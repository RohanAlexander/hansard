0,Could Not H.ive Been Aware Of The Hideous Oath By Which He Would Be Required To Bind Himself To Carry Out The Object Of The Order. I Feel Per,"fectly sure that he will give an emphatic denial to the statement. Those remarks indicate a doubt upon the subject. I wish to place it upon record that I never make a statement of a serious character in this House unless I am prepared to substantiate it. I introduced the name of the Marquis of Linlithgow deliberately and with foreknowledge. The Marquis of Linlithgow was not only a member of the Orange Institution, but at one time was Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. Therefore. I was speaking of a matter of which I had full knowledge. I am very sorry that the action of the honourable member should have rendered it necessary for me to make this explanation. I regret that I was absent from the House at the time that my veracity was impugned, otherwise I should have forthwith explained the situation. I need scarcely comment upon, the bad taste of the honourable member for Dalley in dragging you, Mr Speaker, into this matter in such an irreverent and irregular way. a fine judge of good taste when he accuses another honourable member of telling lies. honourable member of telling lies. honourable member ought to know the difference between a deliberate lie and a misstatement. At the time. I .spoke I certainly thought that the honourable member had made a misstatement, and, further, I considered that he had shown exceedingly bad taste in dragging the name of Lord Hopetoun into a discussion of this kind. gow is the same as any other man. We do not bow clown to him and worship him. communication has been received from the Marquis of Linlithgow' honourable members will refrain from giving credence to the bald statement made by the honourable member for Dalley. put his money up? whole of the time that the honourable member for Dalley was making his explanation the honourable member for Southern Melbourne made no remark whatever. would therefore ask the honourable member for Dalley to refrain from making interjections. this House nor the country will give any credence to the bald, unsupported statement of the honourable member that the Marquis of Linlithgow was an Orangutan. It is true that he may have been induced to become associated with the institution not knowing anything about its real character. If he did so, however, he very speedily severed his connection with it, because soon after his arrival in Victoria, he took the opportunity to lay the foundation stone of a convent-a n act which would have led to his expulsion from any Orange lodge in the world. If he had not thus cut Himself adrift from the Orange Institution, the officials of that organization would have cut him adrift from themunless they restrained their hands merely because he was Lord Hopetoun. I am exceedingly sorry that the name of the first Governor General of the CorrtmonwealtSi has been associated with so odious an organization. rather difficult to address myself to the motion before the House, after the altercation we have just heard. I am satisfied that the honourable member for Southern Melbourne is a person to whom honourable members must pay a certain amount of atThe tention, insomuch that his intimate knowledge of the Orange Institution makes it clear that at one time he must have been a member of the organization which he is now so bitterly denouncing. making a statement absolutely without foundation. misrepresent any fact, and if the statement. I have made be incorrect, I shall take the first opportunity to tender a public apology to-the Orange Institution. I am very grateful for the opportunity to again address the House on this question; but in view of indications that honourable members are anxious to proceed to a vote, I shall curtail my remarks as far as possible. On a former occasion, I endeavoured to show that we had no mandate from the people of Australia to interfere in a question concerning another self governing section of our Empire, and further, that we had no right to inI terfere.

11,Mr Kelly,"I would be the last tostrate that it is not expedient for the Commonwealth to obtrude itself into the matter. pediency must necessarily include the wider question of Imperial expediency. It is a truism with which honourable members are well acquainted, that the Empire depends for its integrity upon the good-will and mutual esteem existent between its component parts, and the liberty which has been always hitherto conceded by each to each to manage its own affairs. I have already shown that Ireland is a natural component part of the United Kingdom, being in juxtaposition to, and within easy range of, the Imperial Parliament : that at the present time she possesses from 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, more representation in that Parliament than she is entitled to from the stand-point of her population ; and consequently that we must consider her as an integral part of one of the great self-governing parts of the Empire. It behoves us to be very careful before we consent to intrude on the management of any such part of it. That the United Kingdom does not ask for our interference is clear. perial Parliament, which constantly hears the Home Rule arguments of the nationalist members of Ireland, has not shown any disposition to grant Home Rule to that country. know that in late years there has been a revulsion of feeling, even in England itself, upon this Question. A t the present moment the prevailing sentiment throughout England, Scotland, and the North of Ireland, is absolutely in opposition to the proposal to grant a separate Parliament to the Irish people. How should we in Australia brook Imperial interference with our own laws ? The honourable and learned member who has submitted this motion would be the first to resent any such interference. If , for instance, one State wished to secede from the Commonwealth, what would the people of the other States say if the Imperial I'arliament attempted to exert an influence which was detrimental to the integrity of the Union? So far as we are concerned, there are other causes of possible friction between the mother country and ourselves if we start this ball of mutual interference a-rolling. For example, there is our Immigration Restriction Act. instance in which the Home Government carried upon the occasion to which I redid effectively interfere in our affairs. ber satisfied with that interference? ber is now proposing that we should f o l low the very course which he himself resented. think the course adopted was justified. There is a wide distinction between' following the course which was suggested and objecting intrinsically to the suggestion. as a section of the Empire, was interfering with the right of British subjects to enter British Dominions. The Imperial Parliament had every right to represent the case of other subjects of the King in that connection. But is any Australian debarred from landing in Ireland? What right, then, have we to interfere in the Constitution and government of Ireland? The leader of the Labour Party himself admits that he keenly resented the Imperial representations of the sort.

Upon the 12th June, 1882, the following reply was addressed by the right honourable the Earl of Kimberley to the Marquis of Lome, who was then Governor General of Canada:My LordI have received and laid before the Queen the Address to Her Majesty from the Senate and House of Commons of Canada in Parliament assembled, which was transmitted in your Lordship's despatch of the 16th of May. I am commanded by Her Majesty to request that you will convey to the Senate and House of Commons her appreciation of the renewed expression of their unsiwerving loyalty and devotion to Her Majesty's person and Government. Her Majesty will always gladly receive the advice of the Parthe granting of autonomy to Ireland may liament of Canada on all matters relating, to the Dominion, and the administration of its affairs; but, with respect to the questions referred to in the Address, Her Majesty w ill, in accordance with the Constitution of this country, have regard to the advice of the Imperial Parliament and Ministers, to whom all matters relating to the affairs of the United Kingdom exclusively appertain. did not sav that upon the second occasion. a snub. ber tell us what the Imperial authorities did say upon the occasion to which he refers? the communication here. very anxious to make it appear that another message was subsequently despatched, which put the matter in quite a different light; but if he has a copy of it, I challenge him to produce it and I shall now read it. In view of the snub which was administered to Canada, is it expedient for the Commonwealth to court a similar catastrophe ? trophe. member! Eveni f by our interference we did not invite similar interference in our In own affairs by other sections of the Empire, we should be laying ourselves open to a snub, which, in my opinion, would be most richly deserved. Under these circumstances it is most inexpedient that we should pass this motion. During the course of this debate we have been assured that all that is sought is "" a just measure '' of Home Rule for Ireland. We have also been told by the terms of the motion that that '' just measure '' of Home Rule is required to pacify the people of that country. Obviously, then, a "" j u s t "" measure of Home Rule means a measure which will be satisfactory to the Irish people. Consequently it is to the nationalist opinion in Ireland that we must go to ascertain what is really meant by ""Home Rule"" for that country. In the first place, I desire to point out that Ireland is divided against itself upon this question. A very considerable section of its people are bitterly opposed to the establishment of a separate Parliament for tEat country. It is true that a majority desire Home Rule, but there is a very large minority who seem to fear that eventually affect its own very right to live. As a proof that this feeling is not entirely without justification, I wish to refer honourable members to a policy which is now regarded with universal favour by Irish Nationalists-the Sinn Fein policy, which aims a good deal in the direction indicated. In this connection I wish to quote a few extracts from other papers reprinted in the Untied Irishman of 15th July of the present year, and apparently endorsed by that paper. The first reads as follows:-Briefly, the Hungarian policy as applied to Ireland, or the Sinn Fein policy, as it is familiarly called, means for a beginning that all Irish elective bodies, county councils, & c , should be exclusively manned by earnest Nationalists. No position in the public service at all controlled by the local elective bodies will be given to pensioners or servants of the British Government. According, then, to tliis authority, if Home Rule were granted to Ireland, nobody who is not a Nationalist would secure any offict. of trust in that country. The Sinn Fein policy involves no oath of allegiance to England, no compromise of principle. It practically means resistance to English law,i",17,Setup

The next extract readsPriests and people will be united in this policy of constitutional resistance, for at a recent session of the Columbian Society, formed by the students of Maynooth, it was decided that the Sinn Fein policy is the policy for Ireland. These are all extracts showing what action should be taken, in the opinion of the Nationalists, to bring about Home Rule for Ireland. opinions endorsed newspaper are not fairly conclusive evidence of the state of national feeling in Ireland to-day. now refer very briefly to observations with reference to boycotting, which were made by learned occupants of the Irish Bench. ' Lord Chief Justice O'Brien, when addressing the GrandJ ury at the North Tipperary assizes on 3rd July last, complained that boycotting existed in certain districts, and that some few persons were actually refused the necessaries of life. Mr Justice Kenny, addressing the Grand Jury at the Limerick assizes in July last, said that agrarian troubles in certain districts were on the increase, and that this "" cast a dark blot on the good name of the -county."" Wright at the King's County assizes, in the same month, said that "" it appeared as if there was a reign of terror over the district."" Lord Chief Justice O'Brien at the Clonmel assizes on ioth July last, in passing judgment on an arson charge the plaintiff being what is locally known as "" a grabber""-referre d to a speech bearing on the case delivered just previously by a member of the Imperial ""Parliament, Mr K. E. O'Brien, and saidHe did not think Mr O'Brien contemplated outrage. He acquitted him of any such idea, but they had to consider the stimulating effect of such language on an excitable people. -Apparently, then, bovcott and terrorization are now rife in Ireland. . If the fact that a very large minority of the people of Ireland are directly opposed to Home Rule-fearin g that it may legalize this sort of thing-is not in itself sufficient It involves no acknowledgement of to make us hesitate to obtrude our interference,, surely the demands of the leaders It does of the Irish Home Rule movement are couched in such terms that no loyal Colony support that which we are to-day asked to do. The honourable member for Dalley has already quoted extracts from speeches by Mr Redmond, M.P., and Mr Devlin, M.P., as well as from a celebrated speech delivered many years ago by the late Mr Parnell. I propose to add to those quotations some others culled from recent speeches of other Nationalist leaders in Ireland at the present time. The first of these is a quotation from a letter written by Mr T. O'Donnell, M.P., and published in the Freeman's Journal, of 9th June last. The letter referred to a distinctly It can hardly be said that disloyal incident that had occurred at a by a Nationalist conference of teachers held at Sligo. At this conference the chairman proposed to toast the King, but the teachers assembled I shall trooped out of the room rather than give that toast which we, in Australia, at all events, are always glad to honor. Mr O'Donnell's letter is as follows: Loyalty to such a toast would mean loyalty to the slavery or banishment of our sons, to the impoverishment of our country, to the annihilation of our race, and such hypocrisy and meanness"" Hypocrisy and meanness,"" in toasting the King! And yet Irishmen in this House are asseverating by this motion their loyalty to the same great Sovereignno true Iiishman could be guilty of. Notwithstanding this we find the honourable Then, again, Mr Justice and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the honourable member for Coolgardie, and also the honourable member for Southern Melbourne if he is really an Irishman asseverating in the opening terms of this motion their loyalty to the KingLoyalty to Ireland, as well as persistent and uncompromising opposition to the unconstitutional and ruinous rule of the foreigner, form the plain duty of Irishmen. We want those duties taught to our children. . . It is time for the Irish party to take up, at home here in Ireland, the question of the education of our children. The boy of to-day will be the man of to-morrow. We must see that he is not being trained a slave or a shoneen, but that his national instincts are fostered and encouraged. Thus, and thus only, can future national organizations become strong, being made up of the masses whose patriotism is fanned by knowledge. I am perfectly satisfied that the great majority of teachers are thorough Irishmen, and that they certainly will not subscribe to the doctrine that the incident which occurred at Sligo is either "" regrettable "" or "" unpardonable."" This was an open declaration by a Nafollows:tionalist member that the paid servants of the State should misuse their trust to foster and admirers of Michael Lambert, the man who disloyalty in the growing generation.

We know that they have the moulding of the minds of the young people in the country, and we know it is the business of the national teacher and his duty to the country to saturate the minds of the young people with true ideas of Irish nationality. That is his business as much as it is to teach them that two and two make four. The most important side of education was the National side. Despite such statements as these, we are told by the supporters of the motion that such a thing as Irish nationhood is not demanded. handover the government of Ireland to people who hold these opinions-to persons who think that it is hypocritical and mean to show respect to the Sovereign of an Empire to whom we are proud to own allegiance-to the embodiment, if I may so put it, of the Anglo-Celtic nationhood. I wish now to refer to an action recently taken by Mr John Dillon, M.P., who. most people will admit, is a fairly prominent Nationalist. man's Journal, he travelled specially from London in order to preside at a meeting in Dublin, on 3rd June of this year, at which a presentation was to be made to Mr and may I again remind honourable members Michael Lambert. The Freeman's Journal, Mr Kelly. which is certainly a Nationalist organ, reports the proceedings at this meeting as On Saturday night last a number of friendsto freedom, presented him with a handsome testimonial in memory of that great deed. Forty ist representative of Ireland-hastene d to Sir We are the descendants of the rebels of '98. ideals; and led by the inspiration which animated them, we declare that we wil l never submit to foreign rule in Ireland, and that we will never cease from struggling, by whatever means seems best to usWhether it be by sugar-coated motions in loyal Australia, or agrarian outrages in Irelanduntil Ireland is free from the centre to the sea. This solemn pledge we renew to-day, and we pledge our faith once more by the memory of '98. Mr Michael Davitt, another prominent We should hesitate before we member of the party, also spoke on that occasion, as follows: It was just 107 years ago to-day that the rebel peasants, pike in hand, stormed the enemy's position in Enniscorthy"". It is always ""the enemy's"" positionWe are proud of the valour they displayed; we reverence them for tEe lives they freely gave for Ireland; we bless their names and memories, and we proclaim here to-day, on soil made holy by the sacrifices so nobly offered up for Irish According to the Freefreedom, our loyalty to the principles for which they battled, and to the cause in which they f e l l. The cause of rebellion ! The Lord Mayor of Dublin also spoke on that occasionthat these quotations are all taken from the Freeman's Journal, a Nationalist paper, and consequently cannot Le said to made, speaking at the graveside of Wolfe be distorted. The Lord Mayor saidIt was a grand thing that such an immense of the ioth July last to have saidcrowd of people could come there from all counties ' in Leinster, and many other counties, to celebrate the memory of '9S, and he would be safe in saying that there was not a man there but would risk all that the men of '98 risked if the occasion required it. This is the view of another fairly prominent Irishman, who, under Home Rule, would no doubt take a leading part in the government of Ireland. Mr P. Byrne, chairman of the meeting, spoke as follows: All Ireland was proud of the heroic stand made for Ireland in that memorable year, and one of the objects of to-day's meeting was to show that, although they rejoiced in reverencing the memory of the mighty dead, they never forgot the cause for which they died, and in which they to-day renewed their fealty. That cause was as much alive to-day as it wasand here we get the comic elementwhen Father Murphy raised the flag, at Boolavogue. I say "" comic element,"" because those words have a swing about them which reminds one of the refrain of a comic song. Mr T. J. Condon, M.P.. speaking at a meeting of the United Irish League at Dualla, .County Tipperary, is reported in a Nationalist newspaper-the Cork Examiner-of the 14th June last, to have saidBut so long as the British flag floated over Dublin Castle, they would never rest satisfied until they pulled it down, and in its place raised aloft the flag of Ireland. He is another loyal supporter of the Imperial connection who will help to govern Ireland, if the Imperial Parliament, yielding to the representations of this and other Parliaments of the Empire, grants to that country what the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is pleased to call ""a just measure of Home Rule."" Mr Thomas O'Connor, in moving a vote of sympathy on the death' of Mr J. F. X. O'Brien, M.P., is reported to have spoken as follows: It was not necessary for him to tell what part James F. X. 'O'Brien took in the '67 movement. He, as they knew, stood in the dock for one of the noblest acts that an Irishman could be guilty of-h e appeared in open arms against Her Majesty the Queen. That is another sample of the loyalty of the friends of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honourable member for Coolgardie. Major MacBride, another of these loyalists, to whom so manv generous references have been [T,8] ' Tone, is reported in the Freeman's Journal Here by the grave of Tone he asked them to solemnly renew their vow of allegiance, and to promise that as long as God gave them health and strength they would never cease working until they had ousted foreign rule from Ireland. They had often been accused of foolishly urging on the country the necessity of appeals to arms. Thatwas not true. They had lamented, and still lamented, the waste of Irish money upon the parliamentary movement, the cost of elec-. tions, useless law expenses, and so on. Their contention was this, that if this countless wealth, i which was thrown away from O'Connor's time to our own time, were employed in maintaining what was left of our industries, and placing arms in the hands of the young Irishmen when an occ-ision like the Boer war arose, they in Ireland would be in a position to add a new Republic 10 the Republics of the West. Yet, we are told that these gentlemen are anxious to honour and maintain the Imperial connection ! Mr William O'Brien, M.P., writing to a Manchester correspondent on his policy of conciliator), saidI t is really too absurd to reply seriously to the grotesque accusation that my policy is to hand over the government of Ireland to th-j landlords. It only shows to what silly lengths my calumniators go. Of course, what my policy really means is to abolish the landlords as landlords altogether, and to welcome only those ex-landlords who are willing to join us in handing over the government of Ireland to an Irish Parliament. All this will be clear enough by-and-by. They are going to have only such landlords as will do the will of the Nationalist Party in Ireland; and "" a l l this,"" he tells us, "" will be clear enough by-and-by."" These statements only too strongly emphasize the need for the caution of the people of the northern part of Ireland which they evidence when they so strongly oppose the granting of that "" just measure of Home Rule"" which some honourable members are so desirous to see given. If the Imperial Parliarfient is foolish enough to grant Home Rule to Ireland before the leaders of nationalist opinion in that country have shown a different spiritin regard to the Imperial connection, "" all this will be clear enough byand-by."" I have put before the House the views of the Nationalist leaders of Ireland, and the quotations which I have read make it plain that the only measure of Home Rule which will satisfy them is complete separation from Englandcomplete local autonomy in all regards, even to the extent of making Ireland a separate nation.

I know that the country will not fail to do so. is attributing an unworthy motive to the Prime Minister. throws in his lot with the Labour Party and the Home Rulers, his constituents and the people of the Commonwealth will know what to think of him, and of those with whom he is associated. tunately a great deal of religious and racial feeling has in times past been imported into the discussion of the question of Home Rule for Ireland, which has not received that fair consideration to which it is entitled at the hands of thoughtful men. In this respect, however, a marked improvement has taken place within recent years, and, although some traces of the old bitterness remain, there has been a gradual evolution in the direction of according fairer treatment to the people of Ireland. As honourable members know, some years ago the mere fact that a person belonged to the Roman Catholic Church constituted a bar to the exercise of civil rights. This unjust provision gave rise to a great deal of bitterness on the part of those who were the subjects of the embargo. After considerable agitation, the full rights of citizenship were conceded to Roman Catholics, and, although the opponents of the reform predicted that its achievement would be followed by most disastrous results, its main effect has been to cement the union of the English and Irish races, and to make it stronger than before. A similar result has ensued from the disestablishment of the Irish Church. The Irish people were called upon to contribute to the support of a Church to which they were antagonistic, but after they had endured this injustice for a considerable time, the good sense of the British Parliament prevailed, and, despite all the evil predictions by exlation in the three countries the municipal treme opponents of the movement, the relief afforded to the people of Ireland had the effect of strengthening the bonds of Empire. whether the people of Ireland should have a more direct voice in the legislation specially relating to that country, I wish to clearly indicate my position. I have been a student of British politics for about from which they would not speedily recover. thirty years, during which time. I have watched closely the trend of events. I have for some time held the view that the [n.8]2 great Imperial Parliament, which we all admire, and which contains some of the best and most capable men of our race, has to devote so much of its time to matters affecting the relations of Great Britain to other nations, and to other Imperial subjects, that purely domestic legislation has not received the attention to which it has been entitled. It has been impressed very strongly upon me that the difficulty which is now pressing on the people of Scotland and Ireland, and even of England and Wales, owing to the backwardness of domestic legislation, might be overcome by establishing in each of those countries Parliaments charged with the duty of looking after domestic matters, and by leaving the Imperial Parliament to deal with purely Imperial questions, which, in themselves, would be sufficient to occupy its attention. I do not, in this connection consider only the needs of Ireland. I have in view the necessities of other parts of the United Kingdom. I believe that by creating legislative machinery for the purpose of dealing with purely domestic matters a great improvement might be effected, and that what would be good for Ireland would also confer benefit upon Scotland. not want Home Rule. ber were to investigate the matter, he would find that a large number of people in Scotland desire that the principle of Home Rule should be extended to that country. The British Parliament has so far recognised its inability to effectively meet the pressing demands of the people in regard to domestic legislation that it has conferred upon County Councils and other municipal bodies much greater powers than we in this democratic land would dream of intrusting to such institutions. This reform has, to a large extent, met the needs of Scotland and Ireland, as well as of England. In the large centres of popubodies have been exercising functions such as are intrusted by us to our States Parliaments. This is particularly so in the With regard to the question case of London and Glasgow. In fact, if our States Governments attempted to proceed to the lengths to which some of the municipal bodies have gone the anti-Socialists amongst us would receive a shock The experience gained in connection with these municipal bodies has led, not to the restriction, but rather to ths enlargement",22,Setup

It has not been i:i the direction of protecting the interests of the few to the detriment of the masses, but the aim has been to improve tlie condition of the people, who have been unable to help themselves owing to the adverse influences exerted by their environment. The work of the local governing bodies has, in fact, been of a most beneficent character. The Imperial Parliament has, in the manner indicated, been relieved of a considerable amount of the work which it would otherwise have been called upon to discharge, but with which it wouJd_havc found it difficult to deal owing to the extent to which matters of Imperial importance monopolize attention. The question we now have to consider is the extent to which this wonderful development of local government will prove adequate to meet the necessities of the case. Whilst the local governing bodies are able to exercise a great influence within their own immediate spheres of operation, many questions relating to the interests of the people as a whole, and quite bevond the scope of any local organisation, demand attention from time to time. In such matters it is necessary at present to appeal tc the Imperial Parliament, which/as I have said, finds it difficult to devote sufficient time to adopt an extreme attitude, is the whole the discussion of domestic legislation. The principle of local government has been extended to Ireland with marked Benefit, and the experience gained there has furnished a satisfactory reply to the objections that have from time to time been raised that the people of Ireland are not to be trusted with self-governing powers. So far, the people of Ireland have shown not only that they possess the ability to govern' themselves, but that they can be relied upon to wisely exercise any such powers which may be conferred upon them. That is a fair indication that wider powers would be handled in the same way by the Irish people. the suggestion that Irishmen are not to be trusted to do justice to themselves, and that therefore it would be unwise to arm them with large self-governing powers. Empire itself owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Irish people for the administrative ability which has been drawn from their ranks. Amongst those who have contributed to Britain's greatness must be numbered many leading Irishmen who have rendered yeoman service in various parts Mr Brown. of the Empire, and at the principal centre of government itself. In view of that fact it is unreasonable to urge that Irishmen are not to be trusted with powers of self-government, and that their loyalty cannot be relied upon. The honourable member for Wentworth laid considerable stress upon that aspect of the case. He quoted a number of extracts from newspapers in support of his contention that the professions of loyalty on the part of leading Irish representative men concealed a deep-seated disloyalty, that would find expression upon the first convenient opportunity. I claim that, whilst upon either side a few individuals may go to extremes, the true position is not to be judged by the views which they enunciate. Ireland has given undoubted evidence of her loyalty to the British Empire through her politicians, who have taken a leading part in the administration of the various self-governing colonies, and in that of the centre of the Empire itself, and also through many men who have distinguished themselves in the British army and navy. Irishmen have ever responded to the call of the Empire, and have manfully borne their share of defending and extending its bounds. Because a few individuals-probabl y labouring under a deep sense of injustice-hav e chosen to nation to be judged by their utterances? I will not allow my opinions to be warped by the extreme statements, either of those who are super-loyal, or of those who are disloyal. I am content to judge by results, and those results compel me to the belief that the Irish people, as a whole, are prepared to loyally work for the upbuilding of the Empire. What they ask for, in respect of larger powers of self government, is a bare act of justice. It is because I recognise the advantage of giving them those powers that I favour this proposition. I support it, not merely because I desire to see a complete measure of auI have no sympathy with tonomy granted to Ireland, but because I wish to confer upon other parts of the United Kingdom, whose needs are quite as imperative as are those of Ireland itself, a The similar boon. If we were asked to grant a separate Parliament to Ireland for the purpose of completely separating that country from the Empire, I should say distinctly that I did not favour_ such a proposal' I believe that the best interests of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and those of England itself, find expression in the union which has ^been feffected. That union) should be maintained for the general advantage of their people. Whilst it is true that it has not been without blemish, I claim that the advantages conferred by it -more than counterbalance any injustices which may have been perpetrated under it. I repeat that no movement on the part of Ireland or Scotland, in the direction of separation from the mother country, would receive any support from me. motion which is under consideration does notaim at that result. It simply requests that a greater measure of self-government should be extended to Ireland. which have been made in support of it go much further. speeches, although I have been present during nearly the whole of the debate. I am not prepared to do an injustice because some individuals who, upon this question, entertain views similar to my own adopt an extreme course. If they push their ex-' treme views to an issue they will find that I am in opposition to them. There was ' one point in the address of the leader of the Opposition which appealed very strongly to me. I do not share the view that we are not even remotely interested in the affairs of the Empire, and that we should leave all matters which immediately relate to the Home Government severely alone. I say that we have a right to express our opinions in a respectful way. At the same time, I think we ought to be careful how we exercise that right. We ought not to exercise it needlessly, but only upon occasions when there is some justification for so doing. I claim that we had a right to approach the Home Government in regard to the introduction of Chinese labour into South Africa. Indeed, in my opinion, it was our duty to act as we did, because, bysending troops to assist the Imperial authoritice than has any other part of the British ties during the Boer war, the condition of affairs which had previously obtained in South Africa under the rule of Mr Kruger and the President of the Orange Rivei Free State had been completely altered. Thus, whilst I agree with the leader of the Opposition that we should not unduly interfere in British politics-especiall y at a time when they are likely to assume an acute formI say that upon the question of Home Rule for Ireland'we do not intervene on those lines. By the terms of the motion under discussion we are merely invited to express our appreciation of the benefits that would attend an extension of the powers of local government, with which the British Parlia? ment has seen fit to endow a number of its possessions. We are simply asked to affirm, as the result of our own experience, that if a wider measure of local government were extended fo Ireland the British people would benefit thereby, and the But the stability of the Empire would be strengthened. In making that affirmation we should not be exceeding our legitimate functions. If we were invited to take an active part in influencing opinions in the old countrywhich is primarily concerned in this matterI should not be prepared to support the proposal, and I should be at one with the leader of the Opposition in deprecating any such interference. In the course of his remarks the honourable member for Wentworth declared that the Labour Party would vote solidly upon this question. I am a member of that party, and if it is going to record a solid' vote upon this motion the honourable member knolws more than I do. . As a matter of fact, the question has never been discussed by members of the Labour Party. I have not been approached by a single individual as to the attitude which I would adopt towards this motion. It cannot be said that Home Rule for Ireland is part and parcel of tfie politics of the Labour Party, for the party, as such, has no more considered the question than has any other section of the House. There is one sentence of the motion which ought certainly to be deleted. I refer to the wordsBut the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland. I admit that since the Act of Union Ireland has, perhaps, suffered greater injusEmpire. The desires and aspirations of its people have undoubtedly been misunderstood, and religious bias and racial feeling have certainly led to the perpetration of injustice. But, whilst this is so, I realize that the great body of British electors outside Ireland-and even many British politicians, in whose hands the destinies pf the Empire largely rest to-day-recognise the grievances of the Irish people, and are prepared ""to attempt to redress them.

Notwithstanding tliis fact, their right of veto is such that they can practically block all legislation, and it is only when the breaking-point is reached that they recognise that discretion is the better part of valour, and give way to the House of Commons. The House of Commons is not nearly so democratic as are a number of fhe Legislatures of Australia. In the first place, there is an inequality of electorates. Some of the electorates comprise very large populations, while others embrace but a small number of electors. In these circumstances, there can be no equality of voting power. that a large section of the British people are not qualified under the electoral law to exercise the franchise.

Every British subject is entitled to hold whatever religious views he pleases, and in my opinion every man should have the right to give free expression to his religious beliefs. A man's religion should be sacred to him. It cannot be said that the views expressed in the motion are those held by the people of the Commonwealth. They may represent the opinion of some honourable members, but it cannot be denied that the question of Home Rule has never been submitted to the people. The subject is Another point is one that has been discussed again and again in the British Parliament, and has led to the defeat of more than one Ministry.

He found, in the course of his tour through the counthe last twenty or thirty years England try, that the desire was not so much for local government as for an independent Parliament that would lead ultimately to separation.

It seems to me, however, that Ireland does not understand England. She has never done so; she has never recognised that the whole history of England for the last 1,000 years is one long record of a sturdy fight for freedom. The English people fought for freedom throughout the days of the Tudors and the Stuarts, and those tyrants were consumed in the flames of liberty. England has been the beacon light of freedom to other nations, and has always been in the van of liberty. Ireland will never truly understand her until she recognises that the people of that land sympathize with her, and are anxious to do all they can to make her a happy and prosperous community. The great cause of the Irish trouble is that Ireland was conquered and subdued by the neck of the Celt. Nothing will ever satisfy the Irish until they get separation. It is more than local self-government for which they ask; they wish to be separated from the Empire, and to become a distinct land has lost one of its chief supporters. organ of the Non-Conformist party in England, used to advocate the claims of Home Rule, and, when the education question to Home Rule.

He spoke about the Orangemen, and about a vile oath which he said they had to take. He can never have read the Orange oath. If he had he would not have spoken in that way. I am an Orangeman, and am not ashamed of the fact.. My obligations as an Orangeman bind me to act as a loyal subject of the King for the preservation of Protestant line on the English throne. It is an Orangeman's duty to see that the constitutional monarchy of England is supported as by law established. Orangeman should feel no bitterness towards his Roman Catholic brethren. They would see that Roman Catholics, as well as other people, had their rights. There may be unworthy Orangemen, as there are unworthy Presbyterians; but there should be no bitterness in the hearts of Orangemen against those who differ from them on questions of religion. One great reason why 1 am opposed to the granting of Home Rule to Ireland is that a great number of my co-religionists there are opposed to it.

I am for Home Rule for Ireland, not because I have suffered injustice from England, but because I think there will never be any hope for Great Britain until every element within the Empire is satisfied. We can never be a firm nation until that happens. Many years ago, the Bismarck, speaking to an American about the probability of England controlling the Continent, as she controlled it after the defeat of Napoleon, said, "" England is a But an nation of the past.

74,That Interpretation Is Empha,"Mr JOHNSON I do not think it willthat idea, and he said further that he was absolutely opposed to separation. I would direct his attention to the remarks made by the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, reported at page 1793 of Hansard, as follows:Tlie most effective way of bringing about Imperial separation is by insisting, in certain circumstances, upon legislative union. On the other hand, the best way to make a lasting and true Imperial union is to grant legislative separation. The experience of the world proves that. tive separation only is sought for. Later on the honourable member for Southern Melbourne said:The best way in which to bring about Imperial union is to grant legislative separation. Any man who chooses to seriously consider this great problem will find that the history, of the world demonstrates the truth of my statement. Those who cavil at it are flying in the face of all history. I repeat that the surest way to Imperial union is through legislative separation. These remarks clearly convey the impression that what is really desired by those who favour Home Rule for Ireland is separation from the mother country. for Southern Melbourne is not a separationist. his speech. On page 1795 of Hansard, the honourable member makes a further reference to this matter. He says :We desire an Anglo-Celtic Federationa union with America-wEich is bound to come. to see the two peoples separate in order that they mav unite. to take up. tific attitude. Ireland and England to go to the National Divorce Court in order to be re-married. A little later the honourable member said :The proposal now before the House is really one to tear up the paper of union in order to accomplish a union of interests and of hearts which will last for all time. ing conditions? be a breaking up process before a real union can be reached. These quotations serve to show that the controlling idea in the minds of some honourable members who desire to see Home Rule granted to Ireland is to bring about separation from the Imperial union. The ostensible reason advanced by them is that it is necessary to break up a union that already exists, for the purpose of establishing another union. I maintain that such a contention is puerile. tion of the leaders of the Home Rule movement. of the views which have been expressed by some honourable members in this House. honourable member has correctly interpreted the speech of the honourable member for Southern Melbourne. certain his actual meaning when he was addressing the House, and in answer to mv interjection he 'stated that there should be a divorce between Ireland and England for the purpose of enabling them to be remarried. That is a singular attitude to adopt. If two parties are satisfied with each other there is no need for a divorce. Whenever a divorce becomes necessary, there must be dissatisfaction between the parties who are directly interested. Under these circumstances I must assume that the basic . object of this motion is to assist in bringing about a separation between Ireland and the mother country. I do not propose to discuss the merits or demerits of Home Rule at the present moment. I submit that to carry this motion would be an impertinence on the part of the House. If similar action were taken By the British Parliament in respect to any matter under the control of the Commonwealth, I am confident that it would be justly resented by us. I support the amendment of the leader of the Opposition. His proposal puts <m diplomatic language the sentiments which I hold, and to which I have endeavoured to give expression in the brief time at my disposal. Should that amendment be defeated, I am certainly of opinion that there will still remain plenty of room for further amendment of the motion, and I shall move in the direction of having the word "" now,"" line 15, deleted. The inclusion of that word conveys an imputation of injustice which is not warranted, and to which even if it were warranted-it would not be good taste upon our part to give expression.

When the supreme power and authority of the Imperial Parliament in regard to the various dependencies of the Crown and the King's dominions beyond the seas are remembered, in respect to the self-governing portions of the Empire, it must be recognised that they have been exercised with the greatest circumspection, and the most splendid self-control. portions of the Empire? affairs of Crown Colonies have been closely considered. pointed to investigate them, and their ordinances have been freely interfered with. in the West Indies against the wishes of the people there. cumstances in my mind. gard to the affairs of the self-governing portions of the Empire there has always been exercised a spirit of wise tolerance and consideration. It is therefore proper that we should proceed in a similar spirit. It may be contended that this is arguing against the position which I have already adopted; but it must be remembered that the Imperial Parliament exercises an authority which extends over the whole Empire, whereas we, although possessing, almost unlimited control over our own affairs, have no representation in the Government of the Empire of which we form part. Consequently there is cast upon us the necessity of considering the form in which we should approach extraneous questions with which we have no power to deal, and can claim none, but in regard to which, on principle and following precedent, we are entitled, when suitable and fitting occasion arises, to make ourselves heard.

In this respect he takes the view of that able writer, Richard Jebb, who, in his recent Studies in Colonial Nationalism, contends that the Empire of the future is to consist of what might almost be called semi-independent powers, united by alliances arid agreements. went on to argue that the greatness and strength of the Empire consisted in the independence of its several parts, and upon the absence of mutual criticism or examination, or of union, except by common agreements. and very largely the view of the right honourable member for East Sydney. This idea explains the attitude adopted by the right honourable gentleman towards the question now under consideration, and upon many others, such as preferential trade. Instead of dealing with his contentions piecemeal and seriatim,-' I desire, for the sake of brevity to say at once that my attitude towards the Imperial problem differs absolutely from his. I cannot share his sentiments. The right honourable gentleman thought it necessary to make some allusion to powers of separation with which he said the self-governing portions of the Empire are necessarily endowed. I do not propose to follow him in that regard. I do not agree with his statement, or with his application of it. I much prefer to avoid any discussion of such a subject. I regard it as unnecessary in this connection, and unseemly everywhere. Only in the last resort can the possibility of such action ever confront us. I see nothing on the horizon of the Empire to suggest the idea of disruption, or dislocation, and, therefore, refuse to dwell upon any contingency of that sort. We can most effectively unite the Empire as a whole by promoting its political organisation by local self-government. I approach this motion as one who believes that the Constitution of Great Britain, superb and magnificent as it is, and the greatest product of East Sydney made a strong point when he the race to which we belong, is being outgrown by the circumstances of this great Empire, and is having imposed upon it a strain which lt' cannot long continue to bear. present prevailing in the United Kingdom. It has developed, and must continue its development. The growth of the great self governing communities and their increasing strength and importance call for the recognition of their right to a. voice in the decision of those questions in which their fate, as well as that of the mother country, is involved. At present, how can we, except by petition to the Throne, or by resolution, give expression to our opinions upon matters that affect our destiny as much as that of the mother country ? We are shut out-and perhaps some people desire that we should be-fro m the British. Parliament, and we are without representation upon any The right honourable gentleman federal body charged with the issues of peace and war, of defence or internal unity. We cannot exercise any rights of citizenship beyond those conferred upon us by Statute, or assert our inherent equality with those who elect representatives to the House of This is Mr Jebb's view, Commons, which governs the Empire, except by the expression, of our opinion on Imperial questions. That can be done most effectively in Parliament, though «it can be done by any group of citizens anywhere. . I hold that it is impossible for us to shut the door on the great issues which are knocking at it to-day, including the great question, whether we are to cling, for all time, to that Constitution shaped on the anvil of liberty by centuries of struggle in the mother country, but shaped for three kingdoms within a small area, and close to Europe, without any provision for the great dominions of the Empire oversea. Starting with that conception, we cannot be content with the doctrine of each dependency for itself^ or with the idea that separate and independent States, acting together on occasion, will ever constitute a real whole. We can only rely upon an Empire, the parts of which are blended together in a living unity, not only so far as their fortunes are concerned, but also in regard to the real representation of every part of it. We cannot afford to leave great Imperial issues severely alone, and we certainly cannot treat in trTat way the one now under discussion, which clearly affects us. We are members one of another, with common interests and perils calling for common action. The right honourable member for asked this House to decline to petition H is Majesty either in favour of or against a change in the parliamentary system at Let me put the converse very simply to the House and the country. Let me ask: If there is to be no change in 'the 1 parliamentary system of representation of the mother country as it now stands, what prospect is there of any federal unity of the Empire? I maintain that no progress in the development of the unity of the Empire, or, to use the appropriate words of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, towards the solidarity and permanence of the Empire, will be possible until the Parliament of the mother country is prepared to reconsider its parliamentary system and the basis of representation. made mutually and voluntarily, and not be forced upon the mother country by outside pressure. honourable member. It would not be possible for us to apply force even if we desired. 4 It is interjected that this change should not be brought about in a fragmentary way. I should prefer that it should be effected on a grand scale and at once, but from my knowledge of history, particularly of that of the British people and of our own countrymen and their methods here, it is plain that the reform will be brought about only in a fragmentary way, piece by piece, step by step, and stage by stage, as may appear possible. But the first and fundamental consideration that underlies every change with the object of achieving greater unity and greater Imperial power, demands that at its very inception we should be permitted to exercise a ful l power of criticism. We have an indirect, but real, interest in the question of the devolution of the powers of the Imperial Parliament. All thoughtful Imperialists are realizing that to offer the distant .dominions of the Empire numerical representation in the Parliament of the mother country, overloaded as it is wjth a mass of intricate local legislative duties, would be futile. It would not further the interests of the Parliament or of the dependencies oversea. It would not present the opportunities we desire for the creation of a real effective political control of the whole of the Empire in which the whole of its own peoples would be represented. prepared dealing with that matter. representation in some Federal body, we must use the irregular representation which belongs to us by means of such motions as this when the occasion is of sufficient magnitude to justify them. On these grounds I venture, as an avowed Imperial federalist, to submit that the reconsideration of the parliamentary system of the mother country is a matter of direct moment to us, quite apart from the special considerations which govern the minds of those who form the Home Rule party. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -In other words, the Prime Minister would break off Ireland in order to open the door for Imperial federation. nothing, but bind all together. The special consideration that is being bestowed at present upon the question of Home Rule for Ireland arises naturally from one most significant, most insuperable cirI entirely agree with the cumstance, to which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has called attention. He says. The people of Ireland have asked for a just measure of Home Rule through their representatives. Never has request more clear, consistent, and continuous been made by any nation. It cannot be disputed that the practical unanimity of the representatives of Ireland deserves the prominence which the honourable and learned member has given it in this motion. The reason why the question of Ireland is pressing is because the representatives of that country have endorsed it in an unmistakable manner. Surely that is the best of reasons. The same proposal would come with equal force from Scotlandi f her representatives had felt it necessary to bring it forward. The fact that Scotland has not done so^-the fact that the movement for Home Rule there after fluttering has almost died out-is a proof that its people are content to retain the representation they enjoy. Nobody desires to alter conditions with which they are satisfied. But it seems to me that we cannot look unmoved and uninterested, upon the problem of devolution in regard to Ireland since its solution must bring forward the consideration of the position of all the other self-governing communities of the Empire. The Federal principle must be applied. From that point of view, it seems to me that we find firm foot-hold and justification for recording an opinion upon this question. Unfortunately, I happen to differ from the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, in regard to the final sentence of the second paragraph of his motion, which relates to the British Parliament. Indeed, I regard the whole of that paragraph as an unnecessary addition to his proposal. WhilstI do not possess a sufficiently intimate knowledge of the mea-",36,Setup

There he makes his position perfectly clear. branch of the subject, may I say that the criticisms which I have ventured to pass upon the mother of Parliaments are not my own. I would not venture to make them confidently if they were. When I say that the Parliament of the mother country, as a law-ma/king machine, is breaking down, and, as an Executive, is failing to satisfy its constituents, I am using the language of members of the House of Commons itself, and of some members of the other Chamber.

That is still remote. Sir Frederick Pollock, speaking on the Federation of the Empire, saysAs for any kind of formal Constitution, it assumes the consent of several independent Legis'1 a hires, and involves a considerable modification of their existing authority. I am not aware of any reason for thinking that the Parliament of the United Kingdom would easily be persuaded to reduce itself by a solemn Act to a mere State Legislature, or that the Colonial Governments would be willing to surrender any substantial part of their autonomy to some new Federal Senate or CouncilA l l the information at our disposal goes to show that nothing of the kind has any chance of being accepted, or even of seeming plausible enough, to induce any Ministry to take it in hand. He then proceeds to propose interim methods by which we can bridge over the period until the Legislatures affected are prepared to re-examine their position in this regard. But I am unable to agree with the leader of the Opposition that the consideration of this question takes us beyond our legitimate province, or Before passing from this with his statement that the fact that it will shortly become an. issue in an appeal to the electors of Great Britain and Ireland is material, especially if we confine ourselves to an expression of our opinion without addressing His Majesty the King and his advisers directly. We take no partisan ground, and make no undue interference with party politics, because all we ask is for a just measure of self-government for Ireland. What is just and wise we leave to them to determine among themselves without any proposal of ours. I agree I have summarized and with the third paragraph of the right honourable member's amendment, so far as it declaresThat this House confidently relies upon the fairness and wisdom p f the British people for the removal of every just Irish grievance in the manner most likely to promote the welfare of the Irish people and the stability of the Empire. But admitting that-and it is obvious that in this matter we are without power, without authority, without votes, without direct connection with the voters-ther e is no reason why, uttering our opinions as best we may. we should not have those opinions laid before the voters of the mother There is country for their consideration. They constitute the jury to which we must appeal. They alone can decide the question. When this discussion, in a remote part of the Empire, 'is shown in its true relation, to our own ultimate interests, when the public of the mother country become seized with the reasons for expressing our opinions to them as well as with the opinions themselves, it appears to me that they are certain to receive fair consideration. All that 'we ask is that our views may make their way by the force of reason, and by the substance of the considerations we offer.

He can only do that which he believes to be right. More than this no man can do, and this every man is called upon to do when he is confronted with a choice of alternatives. I trust that the motion submitted by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne will be dealt with in such a way as will enable any honourable members who share my opinions to vote upon each separate paragraph, instead of upon the motion as a whole. If it is decided to substitute for the motion the amendment of the leader of the Opposition, I trust that a similar course will be adopted. What we should endeavour to arrive at is the most precise and clear ex pression of the will of the majority of this House. That can best be accomplished by adopting the course I have suggested, seeing that in both instances the propositions, though connected, are relatively independent of each other.

176,Mr Wilks,"I am perfectly well awaregenerally aware of. He has a perfect right to occupy his present position, and I do not cast the slightest reflection upon him, but I honestly believe that an amalgamation of Ministerial offices might be made with advantage. The honourable member for Dalley took upon himself to say that the Minister of Home Affairs had a perfect right to occupy his present position. I deny that statement at once, and challenge the Minister to show by what right or privilege he holds his present position. No doubt, he worked very hard to obtain a position in the Ministry, and it is appropriate that he should preside over the Home Affairs Department, where sd much bridge-building and road-making is undertaken. The Minister was one of the champion bridgebuilders, and one of the most accomplished road-makers in the House, and he apparently succeeded in macadamizing the road which led him to office. The honourable member for_ Dalley was quite right in suggesting that the Minister of Trade and Customs would be willing to takeover another Ministerial office, in addition to his own. Tudging from the facility with 'which he disposes of the business of his Department, he has plenty of time at his disposal for gallivanting over the country in order to serve his own political and other purposes. better work for himself and for the Commonwealth if he spent more time in his office, and disported himself at' shows and other places to a smaller extent than he has done of late. There is a good deal in the contention of the honourable member for Dalley that it would be advisable for us to arrange for the supervision of our public works by our own officers. The estimates of the Home Affairs Department are graduallv mounting up, and now represent a very large sum, and I venture to say that the present system of divided control in connection with the construction of public works is hampering the Department at every turn.' The work that has to be done for the Commonwealth has to take a secondary place, so far as the States officials are concerned, and much delay and annoyance result. I might mejntion the case of a post-office in which which work has just been commenced. Twelve months ago I stood here pleading for that work to be carried out. It had been sanctioned long previously, yet it is only now being put in progress. Therefore I say that the sooner we take over the whole of this work ourselves the better it will be for the Commonwealth as-a whole and for the efficiency of the Department of Home Affairs. I am inclined to think that, by so doing, we should not require to increase the total expenditure. At the present time we are paying the various States ;£6,'5oo annually ffor isupervision alone. I venture to say that supervision costs a very great deal more than that amount, by reason of the multiplication of the red-tapism which is involved. As a matter of fact, much of the time of Commonwealth officers is taken up in looking after and policing work that is under the control of the States Public Works Departments. There are one or two matters in regard to which I should like the Minister to make a statement to the House. One of these relates to the question of payment for. the transferred properties. Five years have now passed since the Federation was established, and yet we do not appear to be any nearer finality in regard to this particular question than we were at the outset. In the meantime, owing 10 the system of finance that we have adopted, our Federal balance-sheet conveys an entirely false impression to the outside world. Instead of charging ourselves with Ihe interest upon the transferred properties, we The Minister might do are omitting that 'item from our balance sheet year after year. The result is that we appear to have a surplus which we return to the States, whereas, if we liquidated all our legitimate obligations, we should have no surplus whatever. I think that the Minister should make a clear and definite statement to the House regarding the stage which the negotiations have now reached. He might also inform us when he anticipates being able to submit a proposition regarding the method of payment which shall be adopted in connection with these properties. Various proposals"" have been made 'in that connection. The latest suggestion by the Treasurer is one for adjusting matters with the States, and for taking into account only the outstanding balance. That would be a very wrong procedure indeed. No doubt it would be a very convenient one for the Treasurer, but it would still leave our accounts in anextremely vitiated condition. We should I am interested, upon still be presenting a false balance-sheet. Whatever means we may adopt to raise the money with which to pay for the trans-",44,Department Of Home Affairs
177,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"ferred properties, it is clearly our business might very well be absolved from any conto bring the whole of those properties into account in our Federal Budget. We ought to show in our accounts the total sum of interest which is payable upon them. If we did that, it seems to me that it would not matter very much what metho'd of payment was finally adopted. At present we have a fictitious surplus. We declare that we are returning to the States so many hundreds of thousands per annum more than we ate compelled to do under the Constitution, when, as a matter of fact, we should not have a penny of our own if we liquidated all our outstanding liabilities. If we had been told when the Federation was established that five years hence no settlement of this question would have been arrived at, I venture tQ say that the statement would have been scouted. Such, however, is the simple fact. At the present time we are using the transferred properties, and the States are paying interest upon them, instead of that interest being shown in our accounts as a liability and an item of Federal expenditure. There is another matter to which I wish to direct attentionI refer to the dispute in regard to the Federal Capital question. This matter is dragging its slow course along, and I suppose that the Attorney General and the Attorney-General of New South Wales will get to "" close grips "" some time or other. quite readv. not go out of his way to the extent of one pin-head. for that statement. and learned gentleman declines to leave Melbourne.

If the honourable member wishes to indulge in any criticism of the Minister of Trade and Customs from the stand-point of recent happenings in Sydney, I do not think that he is adopting a fair course. I think that the Minister nexion with those events. ask the honourable member to address himself to the item before the Chair. be obliged if my honourable friend in the corner would cease his interjections. I know that, as a good loyal Victorian representative, he is very anxious to see the Federal Capital question definitely settled. The sooner we get a habitation of our own the better it will be for us, because we shall then be removed from those vitiating influences of the powerful press of which we have so frequently complained. I should like to see a more pronounced disposition on the part of the Attorney-General to make a little sacrifice to secure the settlement of this important matter. It was just as much his duty to visit Sydney as it was Mr Wade's duty to come to Melbourne. There is no comparison between the importance of the public business which is now engaging the attention of these two gentlemen. At the present moment, the Attorney-General of New South Wales is grappling with the Liquor Bill, and two or three other measures of first-rate importance, and, in addition, he possesses Court practice as large as that of any leading barrister. But while the Attorney-General declares point-blank that he will not leave Melbourne, the Prime Minister coolly requests that the New South Wales Attorney General should come over here. I trust that when the conference between these two Attorneys-General takes place, the matter in dispute will be pushed forward to a settlement. I do not know what the Government intend after the High Court has determined the issues which may be agreed upon. We must not for a moment imagine that the decision of that tribunal The Attorney-General of New will finally dispose of the matter. Action will need to be taken by the Commonwealth Ministryi f the Seat of Government is to be removed from Melbourne within the next five or ten years.

224,Mr Joseph Cook,"I said somemembers in regard to the privilege-if it can be called so, though I think that it should be looked upon as a right-of taking one's wife occasionally on a trip, perhaps to one's electorate. Under the present system, if a member lives at a place from which he can travel in a direct line to the Capital and also to his electorate, he can obtain a pass for his wife as often as he likes, but if he is differently situated he is not allowed this privilege. I ask the Minister to look into the matter, with a view to putting all on the same footing. With regard to the proposal to expend £ 5 , 0 0 0 upon a Statistical Bureau, I hope that an arrangement will be made with the Governments of the States under which the Commonwealth will take over some of their functions, and thus save them an expenditure at least as large as that which we are undertaking. If there is one thing more than another which is of Federal concern it is the collection of statistics, and steps should be . taken to try to persuade the States to cease to perform their functions in that respect, and allow the work to be done by the Commonwealth. I hardly think that they will insist on Keeping up their Statistical Bureaux when they find that the work is being adequately done by a Federal agency. In my opinion, no fresh officers need be appointed. Bv an arrangement with the States their officers could be transferred to the Commonwealth, and, no doubt, a saving could be effected, and greater efficiency secured, by the collection of statistics by one agency instead of 5y several. Estimates of this Department, I should like to draw attention, in the first place, to the immense cost of the administrative staff. Last year the amount appropriated was ;£7,886, but the expenditure exceeded that amount by £ 3 3 3 . This year .£8,776 is set down, an increase of nearly £ 9 0 0 . Then, in connection with the maintenance of the Public Works staff, we have an increase of over £ 4 , 3 0 0. penditure, but merely a transference of items. was £ 1 3 , 5 2 7 , while this year £ 1 7 , 8 2 4 is asked for. When the honourable member for 'Hume was Minister of Home Affairs, he told us that the creation of a Public Works staff would mean an expenditure of only £[1,200 or £ 2 , 0 0 0 ayear; but I said at the time that the proposal was objectionable, 2 not because of the immediate expense, but because of what would follow. Now my remarks are being justified. Whereas£ 2 , 0 0 0 was considered sufficient in 1902, we are now being called upon to vote £ 9 , 0 4 8 for this branch. Facts like these afford ground for the complaints of the Treasurers of the States. I consider the Department of Home Affairs a big bundle of red tape, which we have to waste our time in disentangling. It is no better than a circumlocution office. Whenever any public work is to be carried out in connection with one of the other Departments, instead of the officers of that Department or the officers of the States Works Departments being made responsible, the matter has to be referred to the Department of Home Affairs. Consequently all proposals for public works have to pass through the hands of numerous record and correspondence clerks, and go backwards and forwards between Under Secretaries and Ministers, until the proper formal authority is obtained. Nodoubt, as the honourable member for North Sydney explained to me this afternoon, the Department saves the Commonwealth considerable expense in supervising and cutting down the proposals put before them, but I still think that it is altogether too expensive. Then we have an Electoral branch, although most of the work connected with elections is done by the postal officials. If it were all handed over to that Department, I am satisfied that it would be much more efficiently performed. The honourable member for North Sydney is, I believe, satisfied that the Electoral branch should be made part of the Postal Department. I was not aware the other evening that he proposed to carry out that change in a Bil l which he intended to introduce. I consider that such a step would be a very proper one, and if the change is proposed I shall heartily support it. Then there is the Public Service Commissioner's branch. We were told when the Public Service Bill was before the House that we should get a model service. ' I wish to show honourable members what the cost of administering that service is, and to do so I shall refer to the salaries of some of the officers at the head of the various Departments. This information is taken from the classification of the Public Service Commissioner. I find that MrH . H .

I am endeavouring to show that there is a vast difference between the salaries which these officers received when they were in the States services, and those which they are now being paid.

I am satisfied that the Commonwealth would not have been landed in the expensive law suit which is now in progress in Queensland. The Government must entertain the opinion that there is something at stake in those proceedings, because they have retained the strongest bar obtainable in Queensland to defend the action. Furthermore, they have practically pleaded guilty by paying £ 1 0 into Court in satisfaction of Mr Hart's claim for wrongful dismissal. The Public Service Commissioner has brought about all this trouble by acting on the advice of a subordinate officer in his Department in the person of Mr Healey. The latter figures upon the Estimates as an examiner not as a Crown Law Officer. The Public Service Commissioner has flouted the opinion .of the Crown Law authorities, and has accepted the advice of one of his subordinates. has landed the Commonwealth in an expenditure which may involve hundreds, or even thousands of pounds. publicity is given to the facts of this case I shall worry the Government over it during the remainder of the session.

The question which the honourable member for Maranoa put relates to some trouble which arose whilst the late Government were in office. I do not wish to suggest that that Government was to blame, but am simply explaining that that fact may account for the anxiety of the honourable member to make sure that the matter is not silenced. A Mr Hart occupied the position of travelling mail officer, and the circumstances relating to his'case cover a precis of thirty-two pages, whilst they extend in date from November, 1003, to July, of the present year. case extends over the term of office of several Ministries.

I am not going to enter upon a consideration of the merits After the of the case. It would be out of place and quite improper to do so; but the question which my honourable friend put on Tuesday night was whether the Commissioner, in taking the step that led to the matter now being challenged, acted vnon the advice of the Attorney-Guneral or upon the recommendation or advice of one of his own immediate subordinates. So far as I can gather from the papers before me, as well as by the assistance of the Secretary of my Department, it appears that the Commissioner in that particular matter had no direct advice from the Attorney-General's Department, but acted on the recommendation or advice of his own immediate subproper for me to go any further into the case, or to attempt to deal with the merits of the dispute. ney) -The Minister of Home Affairs is realizing, as his predecessors have done, that a Department which touches honourable members so closely as does that over which he presides will never lack criticism.

It has also to be remembered in connection with some of the officers of the Central staffs that the salaries were fixed by Parliament before cney were filled. That, I think, is the case with reference to the head of the Patents Office. Parliament having fixed the salary, it became the duty of the Government to secure the best officer-and preferably a State officer, because it is only right that States servants should have the first opportunity of promotion if transfer to the Commonwealth Service means advancement for this office. was a member, had nothing to do with that appointment; but Parliament having arrived at this decision, it became the duty of the Ministry of the day to see that the position was filled by the best officer obtainable. lected was not receiving whilst in the State employ as much as it was proposed to give him in lvs new office may have been because fiere was not a sufficiently important position available for him-. was open to him. have reached the top of a comparatively small Department.

While I admit that all these matters should receive the careful consideration of honourable members, I think I think that'in the majority of cases-and of course I do not profess to be familiar with all of them,-it can be shown that the officers selected are equal to the more important duties they are performing for the Commonwealth. They are men who had not an opportunity in the service of the States to attain positions to which their merit entitled them. Various suggestions have been made as tp the way in which we should deal with car public works. Some of those who have condemned the present system have apparently forgotten that I have previously criticized any unnecessary expenditure in connection with the Public Works Department The Government, of which I of the Commonwealth.

287,Mr Dugald Thomson,"The exclose and frequent examinations have to be made, and it would be altogether unjustifiable to have a staff of Commonwealth officers inspecting all our buildings, from one end of Australia to the other, whilst States officers were on the spot and able to do the work for us. We ought, wherever possible, to avail ourselves pf the co-operation of the States. I am satisfied that the relations of the Commonwealth and of the States in this regard can be made to work more smoothly than they have done. WhilstI occupied the office of Minister of Home Affairs, I took steps to that end, and am sure that the present Minister will follow up that action. I caused Public Works officers of the different States to meet in Melbourne, and they carefully considered the whole of the arrangements and the regulations, so that methods that would result in the least possible delay in carrying out Commonwealth works might be devised. As the result of this conference, they promised that they would, in the future, heartily co-operate with us. That being so, the few misunderstandings or delays that have occurred, owing to a lack of familiarity with the system, ought to be removed. system is working in that direction. also be remembered that many of the delays that have occurred have been due to the action of the Parliament itself. As a rule the Estimates have not been passed until towards the end of November, and consequently only six months haye remained within which to carry out work that was supposed to occupy twelve. If the work could not be accomplished within the financial year, delays had necessarily to take place, as re-votes had to be made. Sir honourable member, when Minister of Home Affairs, did not succeed in securing the use of the whole of the Customs House, Sydney, for the Commonwealth. Mr' DUGALD THOMSON -We tried to do so, and came to an arrangement that the matter should be allowed to stand over pending the settlement of the question of the housing of the Land and Income Tax Department, when, it was said, reconsideration would be given to our request, with the object of meeting the desire of the Commonwealth Government. Sir WILLIAM LYNE of the transferred properties must be settled in some way or other. so, and if they cannot lie settled amicably other steps must be taken. Every effort should be made in the first place, however, to endeavour to arrange an amicable settlement. I do not intend to enter into a general defence of the Department. On a previous occasion I expressed my views as to the good work which most of the officers were doing, and I do not withdraw from the position which I then took up in regard to the management of the Electoral Department branch. I am satisfied that if it is left in its present position great danger may be created at some future time. Although the officers of the branch are doing all they can to systematize and organize it, the conditions under which they are compelled to work prevent them from getting the effective results which they desire. After careful thought and consideration, I therefore came to the conclusion that, as we are making so much use of the Postal Department in connection with electionsa use which is approved by experience,' and the recommendations of a Committee which inquired into the whole question-w e should endeavour to obtain still more effective assistance from that Department than we now get. At the present time difficulties occur beI t must cause the officers of the Postal Department are not officers of the Department of Home Affairs, and some of them therefore decline to undertake the work of the Electoral branch. Others undertake it unwillingly. Some, of course, are glad to have it to do, and make themselves thoroughly acquainted with all its requirements, but removals are constantly taking place, sometimes very inconveniently for the Electoral branch, and in this way considerable trouble, if not serious consequences, might be occasioned at the time of a general election. A t prefor other work, of too manv persons who are not members of the Public Service. I am not criticising the manner in which they do their work, but difficulties are occasioned because of the numerous changes which this system necessitates, because of (he constant removals from district to district, and because those who have taken up the work to gain a little extra remuneration subsequently find themselves f u l l v occupied in their ordinary callings, and give it up. It was my intention-and T gave evidence of it by omitting from an Electoral Bill which The whole question I had drafted the provision which places the Electoral branch under the Minister of Home Affairs-to ask Parliament to affirm",55,Honourable Member Th E Papers Ordinate I Think That It Would Be Im

290,Mr Dugald Thomson,"That is the desirability of removing that branch to the Postal Department. thus be gained ? administration of the Electoral Act important work is now being done by postal officials. Many of the officers of the Postal Department, however, are rather unwilling servants of the Department of Home Affairs. Then, too, postal officials may be removed from place to place at any time, and it often happens that those who take their places have no experience of electoral work. Furthermore, a postmaster who is working for the Electoral branch cannot now call upon his staff to help him, although he may be overworked, and the staff, as sometimes happens in country places, is not fullyoccupied at certain times of the day. A t the present time, if such an officer asked for assistance from his staff, he might be met with refusals, because his officials are not in any way the servants of the Department of Home Affairs. General issue instructions that subordinate officials should assist postmasters in this work ? would make the work of the Electoral branch a concern of the Postal Department, and, that being so, I think that the branch itself should be under the administration of the Postal Department. persons would still have to be employed in connection with electoral work. rangement could be made between the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States, whereby the officials of the Post Office, the State school teachers, and the police, would jointly undertake both Federal and Sfate electoral work, we should have one of the most: effective electoral Departments that could be devised, and the work would be carried on as cheaply as possible. would be required to make that system effective. approach to uniformitv is necessary, and that is being attempted in the Bill which is now before another Chamber. Tust as the youths who enter the Post Office become acquainted with monev-orcler work before undertaking it, merely by coming into contact with those who are conducting that branch of the postal business, so the officials of ths Postal Department would become acquaintedi with electoral work if the electoral branch were transferred to In the the Postal Department; and there would then be nc difficulty in getting officers of experience wherever they were required, no matter what changes were made. Furthermore, instead of the work being done spasmodically as at present, it would be done regularly and systematically. The police who are scattered: all over Australia, and who now collect more or less accurate electoral rolls-thoug h sometimes there is not a very close approach to accuracy-would , under the arrangement which I suggest, perform a much more efficient service, and, instead of things having a constant tendency to d r if t back towards chaos, because of the impossibility of supervision, everything would become more and more orderly. For instance, if we had the aid of the letter-carriers, we should be able to get information of removals and arrivals in the various districts from day to day, week to week, or month to month. That the towns. formation collected by the letter-carriers would affect the larger portion of our population. Besides them there are those who handle letters in country districts, whot A large number of other could supply a good deal of similar information. In that way, everything would tend to the keeping of correct rolls. In If an army opinion, the postal service will have to be more largely used by the Commonwealth than it was by the States in connection with a number of matters. How else are we tp reach all parts of Australia in connection with the exercise, not only of the powers which we have already put into operation, but also of those which we shall subsequently take into our hands ? Would a private concern which had branches in every State of the Commonwealth, and was undertaking a new agency, maintain new establishments alongside their old ones in order to handle it? No. They would employ their existing establishments. Similarly, the Commonwealth will have to employ the Postal Department. At first the officials may object to this, although they ought to rejoice in it . A branch of a mercantile house rejoices when it gets added business. Why? Because more important positions are thus created,",56,William Lyne I Regret That The Sent We Have To Make Use As Registrars And

I shall not go into the matter any more fullv to-night. I have referred to it because it was mentioned by the honourable member or Maranoa, to whom I give credit for great acuteness, seeing that he had not had the opportunities for forming an opinion on the subject which I obtained in consequence of my connection with the Department of Home Affairs. I could supplement what I have said by illustrations and statements of the experience of the electoral branch, but I shall reserve any further remarks on this head until the Electoral Bill is before us. In the meantime, I hope that honourable members will become familiarized with the suggestion, and be ready to come to some conclusion on the matter when it is brought before them. teachere in out-of-the-way places would n i k i splendid registrars, because they know all the families living round about, while the police would make excellent collectors. I gather from the fact that the change which I propose to make is not provided for in the Electoral Bill that the Minister is not favorable to my proposal; but I assure him that I considered the question very carefully from all points of view before coming to the conclusion that the change should be made. Having come to that conclusion, I am not alarmed by the suggestion which has been made tonight for the abolition of the Department of Home Affairs, although the removal of the electoral branch might, to some extent, bring about the happy despatch. The work of enrolling electors all over Auscers, to overwork themselves to the same tralia and of conducting polls at elections, must be undertaken in the interests, not of one Department, but of the whole Commonwealth. fairs must have been amused when it was suggested that he had very little to do.

I admit that the Postmaster General's Department entails the most work upon the Minister, but I think the HomeI do not think that any great amount of extra work need be entailed on the Postmaster-General under the change I have proposed if the Chief Electoral Cfficer properly discharges his duties. The whole of the work of administration in connection with the Commonwealth could be performed by one Department if it were sufficiently strengthened, but I do not believe in wholesale amalgamation. In the case which I have brought under notice, there is the best of reasons for making a change. If the services of the officials of the Post and Telegraph Department are to be utilized for the purpose of carrying out the work required to be performed under the Electoral Act, there is the strongest reason why the administration of that branch should be placed under the control of the Department of the Postmaster-General. Many other functions, The State school which, so far, have not been exercised by the Commonwealth, will before very long have to be performed by the Department of Home Affairs, the staff of which will find ample employment. I do not for a moment suggest that the officers of fhe Department of Home Affairs have not tried to do their best in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act. On the contrary, they have performed their duties very creditably, but my point is that the administration of the Act should be placed under the control of the Postmaster-General, the officers of whose Department are distributed throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Moreover, if the post-office staffs can be pressed into the service, there will be no necessity for postmasters, who are .also electoral offiextent as formerly, and we shall have at our disposal a thoroughly trained and numerous staff, which will be available for all The Minister of HomeA f emergencies. In this-way we should remove one of the greatest difficulties, indeed dangers, in connection with our electoral system. I do not propose to move in this matter at present, but shall -defer action We know that any Minister until the Electoral Bill is before us.

302,Mr Dugald Thomson,"1 foundpleased to hear the suggestion made by the honourable member for North Sydney, because my ideas are entirely in accord with his, and I trust that his proposals will meet with approval when they are submitted to the House. The honourable member for Maranoa remarked that the Electoral Department might aptlv be described as the circumlocution office, and I am disposed to agree with him. casion, during the recess, I was in Brisbane, and I received an intimation from the Electoral Department that a certain gentleman had been appointed as the electoral officer for the district in which I live. Having an electoral matter to inquire about, I. went to the office in Fortitude Valley, and asked for the officer who had been named, and' was surprised to be told that no one knew anything of him. It eventually transpired that the gentleman who had been appointed was acting as relieving officer during the absence of the permanent occupant on leave, and that he had already left the district. elapsed before the permanent officer was again officially gazetted. affords a very good illustration of circumlocution or red tape. I have to thank the honourable member for Maranoa for having obtained from the Attorney-General information with regard to the case of Mr think the best plan is to confine appointNicholas Hart, which I sought from the Postmaster-General some time ago. T was under the impression, which seems to have been shared by many other honourable members, that the Department of Home Affairs was a typical circumlocution office, but, upon making inquiries, I came to the conclusion that very frequently the delays for which I had held the Department responsible had occurred elsewhere. In connection with delay in the payment of accounts, the fault, if any, lay with the Treasury, which required to have proper vouchers supplied. works, I ascertained that many of the delays were due to the extent to which the Department of Home Affairs had to rely upon the assistance of States officials. Whilst a number of officers in different Departments have to be consulted with regard to the one matter, delavs must occur, and T do not think that the Department of Home Affairs has deserved much of the blame that -has been attached to it. I listened with considerable interest to the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney, who was able to speak in the light of the experience gained during his administration of the Department of Home Affairs. There is much to commend his suggestion that the Electoral Office should be transferred to the Post and Telegraph Department. When the Electoral Office was first established, a central staff was formed, and officers were appointed to adOn one ocminister the Act in the various States, but the officials intrusted with the detail work were largely drawn from the Post and Telegraph Department. The principle was adopted of appointing as returning officers officials of the Post and Telegraph Department, but that was not strictly adhered to. The services of a number of gentlemen outside of the public service were also availed of, and the consequence was that we instituted a hybrid system. The reason given for appointing electoral officers outside of the'service was that it was impossible to secure efficient men on the spur of the moment. It seems to me that we Fully two months should restrict appointments under the Electoral Act to officers of the public service, I think that or enlist the services of the States returning officers, who are thoroughly competent men, and have had experience in connection with elections for many years. Either one of these policies should be adhered to. I ments under the Electoral Act to officers of the Post and Telegraph Department. It should surely be possible to find in each of the electorates postal officials competent to discharge the duties of returning officers, divisional returning officers, assistant divisional returning officers, and electoral registrar's. It would certainly be of great advantage to place the administration of electoral affairs under the control of the Postmaster-General and his officers. A t present many appointments have to be revoked because of removals and of changes in the service. The work in this direction wculd be minimized if the PostalI n regard .to public officials and the officers of the Electoral branch were brought into more direct touch than is possible under the present conditions. The present arrangement involves a large amount of vork, and I am satisfied that by transferring the work of the Electoral Office to the Postal authorities a great saving, could be effected and ' increased efficiency secured. Consequently, I approve of the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney; but before finally committing myself to the-policy out-",58,William Lyne I Regret That The Sent We Have To Make Use As Registrars And
303,Mr Culpin (Brisbane),I was very,59,William Lyne I Regret That The Sent We Have To Make Use As Registrars And
304,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"A t one timelined I should like to have a further opportunity of looking into it. At the present time, the divisional returning officers in country districts are frequently harassed by the fact that they are unable to command the services of efficient men. The Postal officers, who are not specially appointed for that purpose, refuse to have anything to do with electoral work. Then, in remote centres, it frequently happens that post-offices are merely receiving offices. The work connected with them is often performed by individuals more for the sake of rendering a serviceto their neighbours than for the remuneration which they receive. These men cannot be expected to attend to electoral matters which involve clerical work. Under such circumstances, the State school teacher in the neighbourhood is probably better qualified to undertake that work than is anybody else, and his services should be utilized in this connection. In making local arrangements, the greatest latitude should be given to the divisional returning officers. It ' is to their interest to secure the best assistance that is obtainable. I appeal to the Minister, as far ,as possible, to confine electoral appointments to officers of the Commonwealth or the State Public Services. which we are acting. one which is "" more honoured in the breach 1 than in the observance,"" because I understand that some very important positions have recently been filled by persons who are outside the Public Service. Postal officer objects to performing electoral work.. case the Department must invoke outside assistance. I wish now to refer to another matter. It is alleged that prior to the last general election a meeting of divisional returning officers was held at various centres. They were consulted by the Chief ^Electoral Officer, Mr Lewis, who afterwards instructed them in the duties which they would be called upon to perform. There is a very wide conflict of testimony as to what actually occurred in the consultation room. It is alleged by some that a promise was made that in addition to a salary to cover their services for the year they would receive a special bonus for discharging the onerous duties connected with the election which was then pending. When these officers made their claim it was promptly repudiated, and they were informed that their total remuneration had been fixed at £ 2 6 per annum. The result was that some of them retired immediately after the election had .been held. These received only a few shillings. This injustice was of such a glaring character that the Minister was induced to grant them some extra remuneration. But the claims of the officers who continued to discharge their duties were utterly ignored. 'Some time ago, a deputation of these officers waited upon the late Minister of Home Affairs and submitted to him the evidence upon which they based their claim to the special allowance. Included in that evidence was a letter from the Electoral Officer of New South Wales, Mr Biden, intimating that he quite understood that a bonus had been promised, and that he supposed the authorities would grant it. At any rate, the general impression amongst the divisional returning officers was that they would be paid a certain bonus, in addition to a salary for discharging their duties. In two or three cases they have acted upon that assumption, and paid the amount they were to receive to their credit. They were subsequently called upon to refund the money, the Government having decided to disallow their claim. I do not know whether they have complied with that demand, but when the deputation of divisional returning officers waited on the late Minister of Home Affairs in Sydney, they had not done so. I have since learned' from non-official sources that the Minister decided not to allow the claim for a bonus the of£2o for conducting the election, but to grant them up to£10 each to recoup actual out-of-pocket expenses in respect of which, because of the promise that had been given, no claim had previously been made. Having regard to the statements that I heard at that deputation, and the strong impression that I then formed as to the obligation of the Government to grant this bonus, not only to the officers of New South Wales, but to those of Victoria, I cannot help feeh ing that the Department has treated these men most unjjenerously. As one having some little knowledge of the labour and expense incurred in con-ducting an election, I think that the claim made by these officers was a reasonable one.. If the Department desires to secure effective service, it is of first importance that divisional re J",59,William Lyne I Regret That The Sent We Have To Make Use As Registrars And
305,Mr Groom,That is the principle upon,60,William Lyne I Regret That The Sent We Have To Make Use As Registrars And

308,Mr Brown,"That is so; and in thatturning officers who have not only to attend to the working of the electoral machinery between -the holding of each election, but to personally supervise each ejection, should be allowed a bonus of £ 2 0 in addition to the annual allowance of £ 2 6 which they now receive. Every one must recognise the desirableness of securing the services of capable men. If an officer were guilty of carelessnesss, or showed a want of appreciation of his duties, he might involve the Department -in very heavy expense. Last year two elections were declared void owing, I believe, to the remissness of certain officers, and the result was that the Commonwealth was put to great expense. further inquiries as to the allowances granted in respect of the last general election. If the decision arrived at by the late Minister was based upon sound and reasonable grounds, it must of course stand, but I do wish to impress upon the Minister the point that it is unreasonable to expect these officers to carry out the work for a sum of £ 2 6 per annum. I understand that the granting of an additional allowance of £ 2 0 in respect of each general election may be dealt with by regulation, and I trust that my suggestion will receive the earnest and favorable consideration of the Minister. If these officers are to be treated as they have been, I feel confident that the Department will not in future secure the best men for these positions. to a matter which could not be discussed when the Public Service classification scheme was before the House, but is nevertheless one of considerable importance to some public servants. The Commonwealth took over from the States a number of officers who, under the law of New South Wales and Victoria, were eligible for transfer from the non-clerical to the clerical division on passing a certain examination. Since Federation, however, these officers have not had an opportunity to submit themselves for examination. The grievance I have to put before the Committee relates to the case of an officer of the Postal-Department, who was taken over from the Victorian State service. On 6th August, 1903, the following circular letter was sent by Mr Scott, secretary of the Department, to the Deputy Postmasters-General, and was afterwards addressed by the Victorian Deputy Post[T20 ] master-General to the officers in his branch of the serviceI have the honour to inform you that (so and so) being desirous of transfer to clerical division, has submitted an application to be allowed to qualify for same by passing an examination in the subject of geography only, he having passed in all other subjects prescribed for by Act 197 at examination held by State Government, held in December, 1900. The Commissioner has decided that all officers who partially qualified in this exam., such as (so and so), shall be allowed to complete their qualification for transfer to the clerical division by passing in the subjects they previously failed, and which are prescribed by Commonwealth regulations, such officers to note accordingly. Mr L. H. Leigh, of the post-office, Geelong, was among those who, whilst in the I propose to make Victorian service, submitted himself for examination for transfer from the non-clerical to the clerical division, and partially passed. He applied for permission to submit himself for examination to complete his pass, but was informed that only officers taken from the New South Wales service were entitled to this privilege. The following is a copy of the letter which he received from Mr Reddin, secretary to the Public Service Commissioner: In reply to your communication applying for permission to complete your examination for admission to the Clerical Division of the Service, I am directed to inform you that the concession referred to in the notification which recently appeared in the Weekly Guide, issued by tlie Postal Department, was intended to apply only to three or four officers in New South Wales. Under the Public Service Act of that State, officers who had partially passed the examination were permitted to complete their pass at a subsequent examination. As this was not, however, the law of Victoria, your application cannot be entertained. I do not wish to deal with this case as a question of State against State, but desire the Minister to take steps to enable these men to undergo the necessary examination. They have waited with considerable patience for this opportunity, and attention ought certainly to be given to their case. and learned member that I will inquire into the matter. nexion with the itemNew edition, Seven Colonies, £500, I wish to draw attention to the fact that all the books issued by Mr Coghlan are very indifferently indexed, with the result that much difficulty is frequently experienced in ascertaining the information which one seeks from these publications.

We have no control over the issue of these works, but, as we expend £ 5 0 0 every year in purchasing copies of them, a suggestion might be made to the responsible Minister in the New South Wales Government that a more complete index should be supplied, and that the information should be up-to-date and exact. The right honourable member for Balaclava found that the information supplied in Coghlan, and even by the State Treasury qfficials of New South Wales, was not quite correct. This matter certainly should be looked into, because it is extremely inconvenient to those who have to consult these works to be referred by the index to a certain page, and find that the information they are seeking is on some other page. These are little blemishes whicfi could be easily removed, and I am sure would be removed, at the suggestion of the Minister. tention has very properly been called to the increasing cost of this Department. I find that the salary of the secretary, whom I believe to be a first-class officer, has been increased by £ 5 0 . I should like to know on what principle these salaries are fixed.

I find that other officers have been dealt with differently. For instance, the Commissioner of Patents, who presides over a Department whose volume of business is rapidly increasing, and will, I hope, continue to increase, is not getting his salary raised; and in South Many of the New South Wales Australia the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General has been reduced. Charles Todd, was getting a much higher salary, because, I believe, he d i d special work. illustrations. We should insist upon the application of the principle that every officer shall receive only the value of his work.

It does not matter how the duties of a man receiving a small salary are added to, he finds it difficult to get a rise of a shilling or two shillings a week; but, apparently, highly-paid officers can easily get an increase of £ 1 a week. Any one who is receiving over £ 6 0 0 a year ought to be called upon to do a great deal of work for it , and the proposed increase of £ 5 0 a year requires some explanation. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that we must p.ut an end to this state of things.

It seems ridiculous that we should be called upon to vote moneys year after year for works unless! they are to be carried out within a reasonable time after the appropriation. It is disgusting to honourable members, who know that certain works are of an urgent character, to find that their construction is delayed, and that the monev appropriated for them has to be revoted time after time. I do not know who is to blame, but, personally, I have an idea that some of the responsibility rests upon the shoulders of the States Treasurers, who have brought influence to bear upon the Commonwealth Treasurer, with a view to reducing the Commonwealth expenditure upon public works, merely because we have decided that the cost of public works shall be defrayed out of revenue instead of out of loan money. I do not believe that the fault lies with the officers, but blame is attachable to some one when we find that works approved of three years ago have not vet been completed. There is no justification for such delay. If the staff is not adequate it should be increased. When I instituted inquiry into the matter -in Melbourne I was informed that the delay occurred in Adelaide, and when I made inquiries there I was assured that the authorities in Melbourne were responsible. Eventually I ascertained that in nearly every case the delay was traceable to the State charged with the supervision of the work. This is a very unsatisfactory state of things. The Commonwealth Departments are being discredited in the eyes of the public because of the tardiness with which these works are executed. As a matter of fact, the delay is chiefly due to a certain influence which is being brought to bear in the States, and which I fear is being applied to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I would impress upon the Minister the desirableness of expediting the carrying out of these works. I am quite sure that the officers of the Department are eager to give effect to the instructions of this House. When we approve of works being undertaken they ought to be put in progress with the utmost expedition. would suggest that the Minister should consent to an adjournment of the debate.

I venture to say that the Minister has known of Departments being discussed for two or three days. Do the Government anticipate keeping the House until 12 o'clock to-night? honourable members present who wish to speak, and I know of several others who are now absent. I submit that n o'clock is the usual hour for adjournment. trust that the Minister will consent to an adjournment of the debate. The request is a most reasonable one. This morning I did not reach my home until 1 o'clock, and I had to attend a meeting of a Select Committee at half-past 10 o'clock.

There is no desire to press the proposal if there are other honourable members who wish to discuss the division; but the Government do not wish every item to be unduly debated. Government that wished its Estimates to be discussed. any complaints to be made, they ought certainly to be ventilated, but I should like to know whether, if we consent now to progress being reported, the debate on this division is likely to be prolonged tomorrow ?",63,William Lyne I Regret That The Sent We Have To Make Use As Registrars And

Progress reported. Motion (by posedThat the House do now adjourn. direct the attention of the Minister ot Trade and Customs to the following paragraph in this evening's issue of the Herald:The Collector of Customs, Mr A. W. Smart, announces that the thousand Panama hats which had been taken over by the Department at tlie importers' valuation, plus 30 per cent., as stated in yesterday's Herald, have been withdrawn from sale. The Customs officials are very reticent as to the reason of the withdrawal, but simply state that they have acted in accordance with the instructions of the Minister, who is "" considering the case."" T should like to know whether the statement is correct, and if it is, whether the Minister will give the House some information as to the reasons of the withdrawal of these goods from sale? understand that these hats were valued by the firm in question at is. 4d. each, and that they have been valued for Customs purposes at 4s. each. should like the Minister to inform the House where Panama hats may be purchased wholesale at the latter rate? of Trade and Customs) -It is true that these hats have been withdrawn from sale, but I am not prepared, at present, to state exactly what has taken place, or is likely to take place, in connection with the dispute. The matter has not been finally dealt with. As to the question put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh,I have only to say that, so far as I can gather, the. consignment of hats in question was valued at £ 6 0 , or about is. 4d. each. There is a dispute at the present moment as to whether they are true Panama hats. If they are, I think they will be valued by the Department for Customs purposes at more than 4s. each. I am sure that honourable members will not ask me to make any further reference to It is necessary that we should the question at the present time. The papers were before me to-day, and f thought it wise, in the interest of the Department, to take a certain course.
