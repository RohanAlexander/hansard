A t that time Mr Chataway was in a dying e'tate, and said that the policy of the department, in relation to the sugar industry, must be chiefly l e f t with me. The original proposal of the Bureau of Experiment Stations was to establish laboratories and an experiment station at Bundaberg, and a large Station at Cairns, and continue the present one at Mackay. The laboratories are now in use in Bundaberg, and the Mackay station is in active operation ; but in the place of large, permanent -Stations at Bundaberg and Cairns, involving large expenditures, I have determined upon Several small experimental plats in the several districts, some of which are already in operation, in order to render the farmers the most immediate aid, in view of either leaving or remaining in cane-growing, and also to lighten the public expenditure. I trust, Mr Premier, that this orief statement of the policy of the sugar department of the Government will inform you more effectively than a verbal opinion upon the matters on which you request my views. I shall, however, have to urge the most careful consideration of the Government in the interest of the cane farmers if legislation should render canegrowing impracticable. We have 2,610. of these men, the backbone of their districts, and they must not be lost. Yet the subjects which are matters of opinion and of divisions in Parliament are questions of life and death to those men in the fields -I have the honour to be, Mr Premier, vour obedient servant, Director of Sugar Experiment Stations. T h a t is the opinion of D r . M a x w e l l at the present day. He looks on this as a matter of l if e and death to the planters, who have spent the best years of their lives, and have invested a l l their means, in this in d u s t r y . D r . M a x w e l l is of opinion t h a t w it h o u t the assistance of coloured labour the sugar industry, at any rate for a certain distance n o r t h of Mackay, must go. there should be compensation 1 ; MrR . EDWARDS industry is destroyed, the men n a t u r a l l y -ought to be compensated. o n l y planters interested in the industry , t h e matter would be very easily settled, because it would only mean a new expenditure of possibly £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 from the Federal Treasury. But there are many other industries dependant in the sugar industry . There are the coal miners in the north. MrR . EDWARDS There is the shipping industry, and there are the farmers, not only of Queensland, b u t also of V i c to r i a and N e w South Wales, who supply the cane-growers w it h f a r m and d a i r y produce to a very large extent. A telegram from MrP h i l p to MrB a r to n was published in the Melbourne Age of F r i d a y last, 4 t h OctoberMr Philp to-day telegraphed to Mr Barton protesting emphatically against the Kanaka Bill, as, in the opinion of himself and colleagues, it would entirely destroy the sugar industry. Seven years at least should be given before recruiting was interfered with, during which period means might be devised for carrying on without coloured labour. In the State Parliament Mr Philp said : All they asked was that inquiries might be made before the sugar industry was drastically dealt with by the members of the Federal Parliament, who knew nothing of the industry. Ample time should be given to discuss the question. Mr Barton had made no inquiries bej'ond getting information from an inspector employed by the Queensland Government, which, in Mr Philp's opinion, he had ignored. If Mr Barton had taken the advice of-Dr. Maxwell, he would have gone slowly in his efforts to put the question on a satisfactory footing. No man was more anxious than he ( Mr Philp) to see tlie question solved, and in five 3'ears all the Kanakas must leave, and that would only mean total ruin to the industry. He did not think Mr Barton wished that, but. if Mr Barton was sincere, why not give the industry a fuller trial. Mr Barton should purchase a null and a plantation, and allow the labour organizations to demonstrate that they could grow sugar profitably with white labour. Queensland had raised this industry above that of all other States. 'He( Mr Philp) was confident thab if the sugar industry had reached such a stage in the other States, Mr Barton's Bill would he howled down. Men who sought to disturb an industry committed a criminal act, and were nob true Australians. The planters voted for federation thinking that they would get justice, and this was the sort of justice they got. If Mr. Barton and Mr Deakin, when they came two years ago to Queensland, had shown their true opinions and been honest with the people, there W h y does he t h in k would not have been a majority for federation at the referendum-and dealing with MrB e c a u s e if their Barton's speech on the second reading of the Kanaka Bill, Mr Philp said Mr Barton had maligned Queensland. There never had been a If there were majority in Queensland who wished the industry treated as Mr Barton treated it . He asked-Did Mr Barton recognise the importance of the",17,Setup

8,Mr Page,"And the ship-owners.industry, or did he imagine that the people here knew nothing of tlieir own business? They had had Kanaka labour for tlie past 25 years. White labour had always failed, and if Kanaka labour were abolished those northern sugar lands would be abandoned to aliens. The sugar industry was never on a sounder footing than at present,, and during the lost five years the Government hod spent half a million on it. The Premier, in confoundries, and in other pursuits which are clusion, said he complained of Mr Barton acting so hastily. What he should have done, and what Queensland wanted done, was to have an inquiry before introducing legislation. That is what was expected from the Prime Minister, namely, that inquiry should be made before legislation was introduced on this question. The honest opinion of a man like Mr Philp should have some weight with hono cable members of this House. He has lived in Queensland nearly all the days of his life, and has for many years been a prominent Member of Parliament and a Minister of the Crown in Queensland. I think that no one is more familiar with the industries and interests of Northern Queensland than is the present Premier of that State. He is of opinion that if the Bill is passed as it stands, it will entirely destroy the sugar inlaw, dustry in Northern Queensland, and do great injury to the whole State, because there are very many industries in the State which depend upon that industry. As I have said, the planters alone would be very easily compensated, but there has also to be taken into consideration the very large number of persons who derive their living from industries which are dependent upon the sugar industry. I stated in this Chamber on a previous occasion that the number of white men, women, and children Queensland from the sugar industry was not less than 50,000, and my statement was cavilled at; but I now hold in my hand official figures which state that, leaving out two-thirds of the population of Townsville -Townsvill e is not looked upon as a sugar district-the number of white people employed in the industry is 48,246, and the number of aliens and other coloured people, leaving out of account the Chinese employed in banana growing and other pursuits, 11,000, so that I was not very far wrong in my original statement. culous one. The honourable member does not know the population of Northern Queensland. take it for granted that the figures of the Auditor-General are as correct as figures can be. In putting down the number of persons directly connected with the industry at 50,000, no account is taken of the persons engaged in connection with shipping, in coal mines, in sustained by the industry. ' Seeing that so many persons are directly or indirectly concerned in its welfare, a reasonable time should be allowed to the planters to obtain other labour than Kanakas to carry on their work. Queensland voted for federation by a small majority, but, without the northern voters, that State would have rejected the. Constitution. The people in the north,, however, expected consideration, fair treatment, and justice at the hands of the Commonwealth Government. Most of therepresentatives returned by the State were returned to support the Barton Government, because it was never thought that they had it in contemplation to bring in a Bill whose provisions would ruin so many families. If this Bill becomes Queensland will have reason toregret having joined the union, and will look back upon referendum day as a dark and sorrowful one for them. Had thei Imperial Government imagined that during the first session of this Parliament a B ill would be introduced tending to seriously injure one of the States of the Union, I am sure that the Royal assent would not have been given to the Constitution Bill, because I believe that it is a principle of Constitutional law that the Royal assentshould not be given to any measure of the obtaining their living in kind which is likely to injure an individual or a State. The Prime Minister,in moving thesecond reading, made what was, from his point of view, a very interesting speech. But, while= he spoke of the legislation passed in 1885 to put a stop to the indenting of coloured labour after December, 1890, he omitted to say what the condition of the sugarindustry in Queensland was in 1890 and 1891. He should have known that, because of the cessation of the coloured labour traffic, the industiy almost collapsed at that time.. The planters ceased to put in cane because they knew that no labour would be forthcoming to harvest it . Mills containing; valuable machinery were abandoned, and many thousands of white workers werethrown out of employment.

Fix definitely the term when As Queensland has placed its destiny, to a large the industry, to very seriously injure it and put it hack a number of years. I hope that honourable members will consider very seriously the arguments which I have advanced. I fear that I have not been able to place them before the House as well as I should have liked, or as well as some other honourable members would have done. I am veiy anxious, however, that everything should be done to promote the welfare of that sunny land of which I am so extremely fond, and whose interests will be dear to me t ill the day of my death. the Prime Minister is absent from the Chamber, as I wish to congratulate him upon tlie very able speech which he made, from my point of view, upon the second reading of this Bill. He placed the whole position before honourable members as clearly and explicitly as any man could possibly do. us everything in connection with the movement since the date of the introduction of the Kanaka into Queensland. I am one of those who say that the Kanaka traffic is a curse. The sooner we get rid of this curse the better. Perhaps my testimony will not count for much with the Prime Minister, as I am merely one of the rank and file of the third party, but nevertheless Australia. What was the result? OnlyI honestly desire to congratulate him upon his very admirable speech. The honourable member for Oxley has stated that the question of the employment of Kanaka labour was not made a test one at the last general elections. I deny that. I did not have the pleasure of hearing the honourable member for Oxley on the hustings, but I heard his opponent one night at South Brisbane. I was passing through Brisbane during my electioneering tour, and having an evening to spare, I attended to hear the views of the opponent of the honourable member. referred to the Kanaka question. He was asked from the body of the hall"" Are you in favour of the immediate exclusion of all Kanaka labour ?"" reply was ""Yes."" Cou/rier, later on, that at the same place a similar question was put to the honourable member for Oxley, who replied that he was in favour of the Kanaka going, but wanted to give him some time. Yet the honourable member comes here this afternoon and says that the Kanaka is indispensable. This is the first time during my political career that I have ever heard the Kanaka championed on the ground that he was indispensable. On every other occasion the plea urged has been for a continuance of this traffic for a few years. During the past seventeen years the same old ciy has been raised. A t the election which the honourable member for Oxley contested, the labour candidate secured 3,299 votes, whilst the anti-labour votes recorded were 3,753. The result, therefore, proves that the labour candidate lost by only about 480 votes. If these figures do not show that this question was made a test one at the election, I do not know what would. Furthermore, directly the Prime Minister had unfolded the Government policy at Maitland what happened ? A pamphlet was published by the Hon. A . J . Thynne, who was disgracefully beaten in the Senate election in Queensland. It is He concealed nothing, but told useless for the honourable member for Oxley to come here and say that the question of the exclusion of Kanakas was not made a test one. The leading paper of Queensland, the Brisbane Cowrier, threw down the gauntlet. It stated that the question at issue was a white Australia or none at all. The labour party took up the cry, which went throughout the length and breadth of two men in this Chamber have advocated the retention of black labour. One is a Victorian and the other a Tasmanian. As far as I am concerned Victoria and Tasmania can have all the Kanakas. We do not want one of them in Queensland, and I should say, from the way in which tlie Victorian representatives have voted, they are evidently not wanted here. But they want population in Tasmania, and therefore I say, "" Send them over to Tasmania. They can make jam there, if they can do nothing else."" I have in my hand Mr Thynne's That gentleman particularly pamphlet, entitled, "" A l i e n Immigration: The Truth about Queensland and Coloured Races. Sugar-growing in the Tropics."" It was published directly after the Prime His Minister's declaration at Maitland, so that if I saw by the this question was not made a test one I do not know what was. I wish now to deal with the statement of tlie honourable member for Melbourne that the Prime Minister had introduced this B ill to placate the labour party. I would point out that the Prime Minister wanted a white Australia before he knew there was going to be a federal labour party. It is said that if the planters up",22,Divide D As Under

Yet we are asked why we have not freed Queensland of this black labour before! We are here to do it . All honour to the Prime Minister when he says that he is going to give us a brand spanking new white Australia for a New Year's gift. How honourable members can advocate the retention of black labour I do not understand. The honourable and learned member for Parkes twitted a certain section of the House with fighting shy of the Kanaka. There is an old saying that it is a dirty bird which fouls its own nest. We know that our nest is dirty, and we do not come here to foul the nest of Queensland. We came here to make that State white. If we could have done so without being taunted in this fashion, I should not have spoken.

I now want to refer to tlie voice of -Queensland on this question. I suppose every honourable member of this Parliament has received a book entitled A White Australia, written by the special commissioner of the Melbourne Herald-on e of the finest, straightest, and clearest accounts of the Kanaka traffic that could possibly be published. The book was sent out free, and if any honourable member will not read it under these circumstances, he does not deserve to have a copy. I shall quote largely from tliis book, because I know everything in it is absolute fact, and when I have done, if any honourable member can stand well, God help him; so far as a """"white Australia"" is concerned. the voice of Queensland on the subject the -writer says:During the general election campaign the planters were iii a poor way.

I never Mr Ferguson came back he was given a dinner at Rockhampton, and he there declared in favour of a "" white Australia,"" so that the whole six senators from Queensland are pledged to that object. Those who have traced the history of four or five of those senators ever since they took an active part in politics, will know what their belief is, so far as the Kanaka question is concerned. Senators Dawson, Higgs, Drake, Stewart, Glassey, and Ferguson all declared for a ""white Australia."" The only man there was any doubt about was Senator Ferguson, but he made it clear at Rockhampton that he also was for a "" white Australia.""

24,Mr Page,"I will come to that. WhenCan we drag them to the ballot box? The electors knew what at stake, because politicians were going through the States addressing public meetings. The whole of the press was ""bounci n g "" the labour party with the idea of ending its existence. As I said before, the reason the press were so anxious for federation was that it was thought the labour party could be ""bounced"" out of existence in the Federal Parliament, and that their opponents could do with the sugar industry just as they thought fit. But they sharpened the knife to cut their own throats. The cry of the sugar-planters now is that the term of five years is too short, and that further time should be given. But we know that ten years would be declared to be too short. What did the sugar-planters say in 1892 when Sir Samuel Griffith brought in his Polynesian Labourers Extension Act? They then said that in ten years everything would be right, because in that time they would be able to look round and fix things up, and the industry would be placed on. a stable footing, with the result that everything would go swimmingly, and there need not be any more Kanaka traffic. On the eve of 1902 the self-same arguments are being used by the self-same men, who urge that unless Kanaka labour is allowed the industry will he killed. The longer time we propose to give them the more time they want. The honourable member for Melbourne quoted the evidence of a ganger given before the Royal commission on this question. But he did not quote the whole of the evidence, and I shall give the balance. This quotation is from the pamphlet to which I have referred, and readsNow the position of ganger in a colliery is an ment. honourable and useful one.

The answer can only be able member said "" sub-tropical."" in the negative, and yet it is hardly an exaggeration to say that this is the effect of the argument honourable member for Brisbane knows they based on that ganger's evidence during the discussion in the Queensland Assembly. That brings me to the argument that white intercolonial conference of Chambers of men are not able to work in Queensland. Manufacture held in Melbourne, Mr Angus Let me tell honourable members. I was emGibson saidployed for sixteen months on the Cairns line. First, I went out west to the Drummond range, and from there to clusion, Mackay, Townsville, Cooktown, and then cane. back to Cairns. I was there two was years, and worked every day, without being sick for a single day. I worked up north as a ganger, having previously been employed as a labourer. The first start I got in life I got in a country where it is said white men cannot live because it is so hot. I have known it 120° in the shade in December and January, and have seen not one man, but hundreds of men, working in. a cutting with the sun pouring down upon them continuously day after day. What is tlie use of honourable members saying that white men cannot work there ? I will give honourable members what was said by Mr Angus Gibson and the late Mr Knox, chairman of the Colonial Sugar Company; and I suppose tlie honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Melbourne will accept the authority of these gentlemen as of some value. As to white men saying they cannot do the work there, I should be ashamed if I were one of them. In a letter in the Australian Star of 3rd June, 1899, Mr E. W .

Mr Gibson proceededClimate or other conditions did not seem to have anything to do with them, if they were well paid. This is the secret. It was necessary that the men who worked in tlie fields should be well paid. These are undoubtedly the highest authorities on the point at issue in Australia, and both agree that it will be possible to produce all tlie sugar required for Federal Australia by white men exclusively. These are planters engaged in the industry. These are the men we hear honourable members raving' about as having millions invested in the industry, and as being about to be ruined by the Federal Government. These men say that white men can work at the industry, and tlie Barton Government have solved the question as to how it can be done. I am as sure as that we are in this chamber that this problem can be solved by the Barton Government under existing conditions. work, they will do anything. It is said that the climatic conditions are against white men doing this work. Let me tell honourable members what the Governor General has said about this unhealthy spot CairnsLord Hopetoun, Governor General of Australia, the belief that the Queensland sugarindustrycould at Cairns last week, knocked the stuffing out of not be carried on without black labour, he delivered the pro-Kanaka rot about the terrible northern climate. He said to tlie Cairns people: "" I came among you a month ago feeling veiy weak and very unwell, but a month's stay in your lovely on my legs again. When I go back to the proved, and I shall be so robust to look at, that I shall form an excellent advertisement for the virtues of the northern climate."" His Excellency then read the text of a wire he was despatching to Mi"". Barton, wherein he suggested that if the Federal Parliament persisted in sitting in winter no better climate or more charming place could be selected for sitting than Cairns. The rout of the pro-Kanaka push is complete. Cairns is the place where they say men are dying by thousands, and yet the Governor General wants the Federal Parliament to sit there; so that these statements which we have heard about its unhealthy climate are mere moonshine. The honourable member for Oxley spoke of the Kanaka as a good, kind, dear creature, who never did anything wrong, and who could not do wrong if he tried. said so, though perhaps not in those words. as harmless, though useful. members where his harmfulness comes in, by referring to the moral aspect of the question, which has not been entered into by other honourable members; but before doing so there is another point upon which I wish to put the House right. I have been told that the Honourable Angus Gibson, when he made his statement, had something up his sleeve. He wanted the industry brought south of Mackay, because he thought that if that happened things would prosper. That was the idea he had in his head when he was speaking at the conference. The morality of tlie Kanaka is not what the honourable member for Oxley would have us believe. Honourable members will have a different opinion of this dear, nice creature when I have quoted Charles Powers' denunciation of him. Charles Powers was Minister for Education If white men are paid to just before he issued a manifesto, prior to going to the country at Maryborough, and that manifesto created a great sensation throughout Australia.

35,Mr Page,"I intend to show honorablea notable speech, in which he asked-""I s the social and material status of the community lowered by the introduction of servile labour ?"" His answer is apposite here. "" Those who read history,"" he declared, "" w ill at once say 'Yes.' But, unfortunately, the employer does not read history, or does not take to heart its lessons. Poverty, and despair that is bred of long-continued poverty, lead at last to callousness and the extinguishment even of the desire for better things, and a degeneration sets in as courage and hope die. More young girls have been driven to prostitution by poverty than by evil desires, and it is sad to think that our white population is now providing prostitutes for our Kanaka population. The planters who introduced the traffic would be horrified with this phase of the traffic if their class had to supply these for their Kanaka employees. They would get r i d of the Kanaka v e i y quickly then. It is the wives and daughters and sisters of such as me, of those who are labouring hard and who do the pioneering work of Queensland, that w ill come under the lash. It is tlie easiest t h in g in the world for those who are reared in the lap of l u x u r y, and have a good home, to remain uncontaminated by these alien docile curses. I can call them nothing else. Y e t they are the men w it h whom the honourable member for Oxley wants to flood Queensland. Shame on h i m to get up in this chamber and say t h a t they are so good, and k in d , and nice. I leave h i m to reflect upon this matter. He knows the condition of things as well as I do, and the statements which have appeared in every paper in Queensland. Isi t such a little thing that the girls of the white workers-the children of the poor-ar e the victims of the dreadful sacrifice ? It is to me a horrible thought that one single child growing up in our State schools should be destined for such a fate ; but then we rarely bring the black women from the islands with the men. A planter, to whom I lately mentioned this objection, said-"" Oh, yes, but if there were no white prostitutes none of our women would be safe.""

It h in k as much of m y darlin g child as any wealthy squatter or planter thinks of his, and Godf o r b i d t h a t any f r i e n d of mine should be degraded in this way.

L e t honourable members t h in k of that. L e t them imagine w h a t their feelings would be if one of their f a m i l y was brought to this degradation, and they saw them in the arms of one of these black, docile curses. It is enough to make my s p i r it rebel to t h in k t h a t an honourable member should advocate in this cliamber the cause of these dear, docile creatures. They are r u in in g us morally and socially. All honour, I say, to the PrimeM in is t e r for the speech he made at M a it l a n d , and for facing this problem in tlie way he d i d . He is going to emancipate Australia . We are threatened w it h a curse which they have in America, though to a lesser degree, but, thank God, the day has come when the Kanakas must go. I wish the honourable and learned member for Parkes were here this afternoon to hear what I have to say. It is he and his class who are a f r a i d of the Kanaka, and they w a n t to make prostitutes of those of m y class, so t h a t they may make a l l they can on the plantations out of their flesh and blood. The writer of the He r a l d articles says t h a t the Kanaka business is infamous, and this is the conclusion he comes to w it h regard to its moral phase. This is the best p a r t of the whole bookI n my own opinion the situation at Cairns supplies iu itself, and apart from everything else, an unanswerable condemnation of the Kanaka traffic. It will be remembered that it was deemed necessary in the town mentioned to retain Japanese prostitutes for the use of the Kanakas, because it was considered that otherwise white women would not be safe. We are, therefore, led to the following reflections :(a) The Kanaka is brought into a highly civilized British country in order that he may help to bear the white man's burden. (b) The Kanaka, being a mere savage (even though you occasionally find a hymn-book in his bunk), becomes a menace to the white man's wife and daughters. (c) Japanese prostitutes are provided with a profitable field. (d) The white man's wife and daughters are virtually required by the said white man himself to live under the "" protection"" of the Japanese prostitutes. (e) Daughters of civilization, offspring of British fathers and mothers, the sweet school girl of the years that have gone, afterwards, may be, the beloved of some honest British man's heart, yields to the embrace of a filthy savage. All this in a Christian State under tlie British flag. Surelyi t is at this point in the affairs of the Kanaka traffic that young Queensland, "" made a gazing stock both by reproaches and affliction,"" may wring her hands in very shame, and raising her contrite voice, exclaim with King Claudius, "" Oh, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven."" T h a t is my colony. I hope, as the honourable member for Oxley has said, t h a t m y bones w ill rest t h e r e ; but, while I have a voice, it will be raised against this traffic, and my vote w ill always be given for a ""white Australia."" I am afraid of the Kanaka, and of every black man, because I do not want my race to be contaminated with theirs. They may say that their race is pure, and I have reason to believe from what I have read that it is; but, while I am willing to believe that ours is a mixed race, I say that we should except with those of our own colour. Who dares to say that the Anglo-Saxon race is not the finest under the sun ? In the heat of the torrid zone, and in the cold of the frigid zone, there they are to be found -livin g on fish diet brings it on. Dr. The Honourable Angus Gibson dare not say that the white man cannot work in Northern Queensland. I have proved it by practical example. The first rise I made was by working on the railways there, and honourable members can see that it has done me no harm. And, as I told the honourable member for Northern Melbourne some time ago, the stock in Queensland is just as good as the sample. If we look at the men in the southern parts of Queensland, and compare them with the men in the north of the State, we shall see that tlie northern men come out on top all the time. There is another phase of this question I desire to touch upon-and I may as well sheet it home to these Kanaka lovers-and that is the dire disease that these coloured races bring amongst us. Ever since I saw a leprous Kanaka working in the cane-fields up north, at Port Douglas, I have never touched sugar, and when I read the figures I have in my hand I do not think other honourable members will touch sugar either. Now this furnishes proof that leprosy originated amongst these aliens. In Queensland, in 1889, there were eleven lepers all Chinese. Three years afterwards, three Europeans were found to be suffering from the disease. Prom tlie 30th June, 1898, to 1st July, 1899, there were 22 cases of leprosy reported, made up as follow :-English, 3 ; Danish, 1 ; Queensland, 1 ; aboriginals, 2; Chinese, 1 ; Pacific Islanders, 14. This was taken from the journals of the Parliament of Queensland, October 1899. Sixteen of these lepers came from the sugar districts of Queensland. islanders come to Queensland that they contract leprosy-the y do not get it before they come there. bring it from the islands, but they certainly show it in Queensland. I suppose that the Chinese first brought it in. I was personally acquainted with one of these lepers to which I have referred-the Dane. He was an honest hard working fellow out west at the town of Isisford, and we can see from his case how the disease may spread, and how it, perhaps, is spreading unknown to not mix it any further, us. The avocation he was following was that of a fisherman, on the Barcoo River, and he used to go round from house to house selling the fish. Every one knows that fish practically produces leprosy Munro, the great authority on leprosy, says that the seeds of leprosy sometimes take half a century to mature, so that the fact that people do not show any signs of leprosy, is not convincing evidence that the seeds of the disease are not developing in their systems. Half the people in the town of Isisford may be lepers and not know it . The Queensland Government brought this Dane down from Isisford to Ilfracombe on the Central Railway line, and took him to Peel Island. They conveyed him through the streets, and in the public railway carriages. Now is not that a fine state of affairs, and do not the facts I have mentioned thus afford a further reason why we should vote for the Bill? The number of lepers officially recorded in New South Wales was as follows:In 1883 there were five Chinese; in 1884 two Chinese, and one Javanese; in 1887 one Chinese; in 1888 four Chinese; and in 1S89, six years after, one European. So that honourable members will see that the disease is coming south. In Victoria out of eight recorded cases of leprosy, one was that of a European. tion with Chinamen. leprosy is a vile Eastern disease, and we should get rid of all Asiatics. I am not in love with any of them we do not want them, or any of their diseases, whether they be Chinese, Javanese, or any other "" 'ese."" In the Sandwich Islands, in 1853, there was only one case of leprosy; in 1859, there were a few cases; in 1864, 230 cases; and at the end of 1888, there were no fewer than 11,000 lepers suffering from this disease, out of a population of 67,000.

"" to contract leprosy more than do white people ? sibly weakness of physique. eat more fish than do white people ? pretty liberally when he can get-it. There is one matter to which I wish to particularly refer. It is a statement which I clipped out of the Sydney Morning Herald of 5th October, a telegraph message from New Zealand, published under the head of ""Parsee Workmen in F i j i . "" In the House of Representatives Mr Millar asked the Minister for Labour if his attention had been drawn to a report that the Colonial Sugar Company were importing Parsee fitters, blacksmiths, and carpenters, to take the place of Britishers at present employed in their sugar mills at Fiji. We have heard a great deal of talk about loyalty, and if that is not enough to make any man loyal, I do not know what would be. These Parsees are British subjects, but they belong to a subject race, and I hope they always will do. Mr Seddon replied that he had received a communication on this subject, and while regretting very much that in Fiji, so near our own colony, these Parsee3 should be introduced, at the same time, so far as this colony was concerned, we were not entitled to interfere, Fiji being a Crown colony. It was not desirable to disturb the relais nothing that would give me greater pleations between the Commonwealth and this colony and those intrusted with the control of affairs in Fiji. This opens up another phase of the question, and I would ask honourable members whether the\r would like to see the white men now dependent upon the sugar industry supplanted by such people as these ? It is my ambition to see the whole of the coloured labourers supplanted by white men. I come now to the question of pay. The that. Honourable Angus Gibson was quite satisfied that sugar could be grown by means of white settle things quick and lively, but, on the labour, so long as the planters would pay for face of it , the-whole suggestion is amusing. it. Now, I would a3k any honourable member whether he would work in a tropical climate from sunrise to sunset for less money than he could get in Sydney or Melbourne ? If the sugar planters will pay the wages they will get the men. How does the squatter get his shearers 1 If the planters make it worth the while of cane cutters to go round in exactly the same way as the shearers travel round to shear sheep, tlie men will go soon enough. When I was working in Northern Queensland on the railways I was getting £ 7 a week. tracting for myself I sometimes made £ 1 0 a week. They made it worth my while to do the work, and I stopped there until I got a little money together. If the planters paid good wages, they could get plenty of men to take the employment they have to give. It is only a question of wages. There are as fine and healthy-looking men in Northern Queensland as in any part of the globe. I was very much amused to see a statement in the Age as to some threatened rebellion in Queensland. Tlie very people who were talking about law and order to the rouseabouts and shearers in 1891 are now going to take up the same attitude as we did then. The Prime Minister answered the question that was asked him on this subject very well. These white men in Queensland are now going to fight for the black man ; but they brought white men from Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania to "" d o w n "" us in Queensland, and take the bread from our mouths ten years ago, and that is the sort of thing that the men I have the honour to represent in far western Queensland would very much resent.

That delivered by the honourable member for Oxley, apjjeared to me to be a most serviceable one. It was f u l l of information, and I should gather from it that the honorhonable member is a very strong supporter of those persons in Queensland who desire a continuance of the Kanaka traffic, although he, as well as the honourable member for Maranoa, believes that it should be discontinued at the very earliest possible date. The effect of the speech delivered by the honourable member for Melbourne also was that the traffic in this class of labour should be discontinued. The point at issueappears to be whether it should terminate in five, seven, or ten years. That is really the crux of the question. I think the honourable member for Maranoa made it very clear that that is only a "" stall.""

That period has arrived. It is always an extension of time which is clamoured for by other people, who have had the opportunity of conducting their manufactories with white labour. In the early history of Australia we know that the people had an opportunity of engaging cheap convict labour. Later on, an outcry was raised against the discontinuance of that class of labour. Wherever alien inferior coloured races have been employed, it will be found that there has been an agitation against the abolition of the traffic. I take it that the form of labour which is employed in North Queensland is not dissimilar from that which was employed in the cotton plantations of America. When the agitation for the abolition of that Are they prepared to slavery began, there was just as strong an outcry for compensation as is heard in Queensland to-day.

That author states that as soon as tlie Kanaka takes to the consumption of European food, dons European clothing,, and conforms"" to the customs of. Europeans-whic h are always the vices of the Europeans-h e will contract their diseases, and die. That is tlie experience in Queensland to-day. It was also the experience there 30 years ago. It is tlie experience in the islands when the Kanakas are returned to their homes. I have travelled amongst some of those islands, and can bear testimony to the fact that many of the statements made by Mr Louis Stevenson and was referred to yesterday, are absolutely true. I think that we should pay the greatest respect to their testimony. We should also bo guided by the records contained in the two valuable volumes of the hitter's experiences in the New Hebrides. I am inclined to think that had we Sir Henry Parkes in tlie Chamber, we should find him speaking out boldly for a discontinuance of the traffic at the veiy earliest date. Sir Henry Parkes, at the time Sir Samuel Griffiths recanted, wrote to the daily press, putting on record his protest against the action taken by that statesman. It has been stated here time and again that Queensland protests. But I contend that I am here to-day as a representative of Queensland, seeing that I am a representative in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. When the Premier of Queensland speaks, he speaks for a section of the community and should be heard ; but honourable members are sent here for the purpose of legislating on this question, and I , as one of the representatives of the Commonwealth, desire to speak on it . Sir Henry Parkes used these words :There is a higher tribunal than the Government of Queensland-the tribunal of civilization. If our neighbours have not the status for active interferenceThat was before federation-the y have the right and the duty to remonstrance and the right and duty to let the world know that this diseased passion for degraded labour is confined within the borders of Queensland. It is not now confined within the borders of Queensland, and it is our duty as legislators to see that the traffic is stopped at the earliest opportunity. proposal too liberal to the sugar refiners. The honourable member for Oxley, who has spoken. Mr Henry Willis. out-so fearlessly on behalf of the planters who desire another ten years, may be complimented on his courage; but I do not think he can expect much support in his contention. All that has been said by the honourable member for Maranoa as to the amount of disease that is contracted from the Kanaka, the amount of degradation caused by his mingling amongst white people, and the immorality which prevails in Northern Queensland, is most appalling. I have it on the testimony of a gentleman who has come down here from the State to represent the interests of the planters, that tlie Kanakas live in a state of prostitution the Rev. J. G. Paton, who or immorality with European women in that part of Queensland, and subsequently marry them. I do not wish to enlarge on this phase of the question, for other members who directly represent those districts will have something to say concerning it . But I think that in the interests of the Kanaka himself he should be sent back. If his agreement were terminated immediately I do not think the Kanaka would raise any objection, even if he were able to do so. His island home is as sweet to him, and I think sweeter, than his home in Northern Queensland. Before he went to Queensland he had his living provided at hand, and when he returns he has little trouble in again gaining a living; but his period of existence is a short one at best when he does return. In a large proportion of cases these returned Kanakas have to go to tlie lazarette on tlie island where Father Daniien died, in the Hawaiian group. Many of the Kanakas who have returned to the Solomon and Samoan groups, as well as the Society Islands and New Hebrides, have contracted leprosy, and have had to be removed to the island I have mentioned. We not only find them contracting leprosy in Northern Queensland, but also in the Hawaiian group, especially at Honolulu, where the Japanese and Chinese form about half of thepopiilation. The Kanakas have, in many cases, contracted leprosy before going to Queensland, and those who have not already contracted it by adopting European customs and European food, appear to develop it very readily in tropical Queensland. However, I am prepared to give support to the Bill, and only regret that it allows so much time for the continuance of this labour. If Ministers will I consider the Government change their mind in committee, and propose the discontinuance of the licence system, and complete deportation within three years, of the Kanakas now there, I shall be amongst their supporters. ing myself to this subject it is hardly possible to avoid, at any rate, crossing the lines which have been traversed in the most able and comprehensive speech of the Prime Minister. Especially is that so in treating of the history of this question, and I purpose just to glance at that history, without taking up too much time, because when a question is being debated from only one side it becomes rather monotonous. to this measure is so slight, that I am sure that even now members have decided how they are going to express their opinions by their votes. Maranoa, in a Niagara of eloquence, said that there is a curse attached to this black traffic. I will say at once that the word "" traffic "" is very suggestive of the way in which this business has been conducted. So far as I have been able to learn, the first Kanakas landed in Queensland were landed Denison. Whetheri t be that there is a Nemesis which pursues the persons or community which traffics in the flesh and blood of fellow creatures, or whether it is simply the long arm of coincidence, I cannot say; but from that day to this that place has standing that it has one of the finest harbors on the Australian coast, a magnificent back country suitable for pastoralists, and a very fertile agricultural country, and that it has the lowest death rate in Australasia, from that time to the present, Bowen has been practically extinct from a business point of view. I am sorry that that is so, because Bowen is one of the nicest and most beautifully situated little places I have seen in Australia. ""Unfortunately sugar has always been grown by blacks. There has hung over this business, as somebody said, the "" trail of a hateful usage."" It is simply because in the West Indies and other places it has been the custom to grow this particular product with the aid of black labour, impossible to carry on the industry in Australia with any other kind of labour. But I say advisedly, notwithstanding what has fallen from the honourable member for Oxley, that no honest attempt has been made to grow sugar otherwise. It was so profitable to grow it with coloured labour, and as the Government of Queensland have always been in sympathy with that particular kind of labour, there was no desire to change the system. In 1885 we come to the most important epoch in the history of the sugar industry. That was the year in which Sir Samuel Griffith tabled a resolution to do away with licences for recruiting at the end of 1890. A great deal of capital has been made of the fact that shortly after that resolution was submitted there was a considerable diminution in the amount of acreage under cane. But that diminution The opposition can be explained as due to other causes. A t any rate, in 1890 there was a considerable increase in the area under cultivation over the previous acreage, The honourable member for and from April, 1892, when recruiting had absolutely ceased for a period of two years, the acreage still increased, thus showing conclusively that notwithstanding that black labour was denied to tlie industry for that period, it was possible with the altered conditions to cultivate a larger area and produce conat Bowen, Port siderably more sugar. The figures on which I rely are those of the Registrar-General of Queensland, and they may be considered undeniable. Much capital has been made out of this phase of the question, and altogether without foundation. In 1S92, we know that Sir Samuel Griffith"" recanted,"" as it been blighted. Notwithhas been termed ; but what was the reason ? As we all know, in that period of our Australian history, Queensland, with the other colonies, was drifting along to a gulf of financial ruin, into which she afterwords stepped. There is no doubt that at that time pressure was brought to bear on Sir Samuel Griffith and the Ministry the same kind of pressure that is now being brought to bear on Queensland sugar planters who are agitating for the Kanaka traffic, namely, the pressure of the financial institutions. We know that in 1893, when Queensland went to the English market for a loan of £2,500,000, she got only something under £400,000. That was the result of the extravagance of Sir Samuel Griffith himself, in his loan policy in Queensland ; and, in my that it .has been deemed opinion, it was to find a scapegoat for his own maladministration, that he put forward the fact that the sugar industry was somewhat depressed, as the reason for the depression in Queensland. There is no evidence whatever to establish the position that Sir SamuelGriffithadopted,andalthough he did recant, he himself said at the time",33,Divide D As Under

He that incontestably proved he was driven to what he did by some stronger than himself. member for Melbourne last night quoted from a speech of Sir Thomas Mcllwraith in 1893. I should like to call attention to something that was said during the election of 1S93, by one of Sir Thomas Mcllwraith's colleagues, who entered the Parliament of Queensland under the aigis of Sir Thomas bury, who told tlie people of Bundaberg that ""every brick and stone in the buildings of tlieir city was cemented with the blood of slavery."" That was a gentleman who stood side by side with Sir Thomas Mcllwraith as a colleague in tlie representation of North Brisbane, and yet Sir Thomas is quoted here as being in favour of the continuance of the black labour traffic. I know that the remark which Mr Kingsbury madeisnot original, but was used at Manchester some years ago in the anti-slavery agitation by Mr G. V. Brooke, the tragedian. However, the words lose nothing of their force on that account. There was an attempt made to grow sugar by white labour with the aid of central mills; but it proved futile, as in the nature of things it was bound to do. It was urged that the growers were simply growing the^cane for the benefit of the mill-owners, receiving only 8s. to 8s. 6d., and that, if there' were central mills, higher prices would be obtained. great that it was not to be expected that men would sacrifice themselves on tlie altar of their principles simply to establish the fact that cane can be grown by white men. ""When a man who was successfully growing cane by white labour found that his neighbour on the other side of the fence was employing Kanakas and other aliens, as he was allowed to do by the law of the land, is it surprising that he felt tempted to adopt the same methods, and thus obtain larger profits? That is why men grow cane by black labour even for tlie Central Mills. they should not do it, but there was no law to prevent it. In 1892 it was assumed, though, unfortunately, part of the law of the State, that in ten years the traffic would absolutely cease. The late Mr W. H. Groom, who was one of the three Royal commissioners who investigated this subject, in a separate Mr Bamford, report gives six reasons for the depression expressed opinions at the time in the sugar industry which then existed. Among those reasons was the pressure influence of financial institutions, but he does not The honourable mention the difficulty of obtaining labours What is more important is a statement made by one of tlie witnesses examinedMr Villiers Brown, a very influential man in Northern Queensland. He is a large shipowner and merchant, and has been dealing in sugar for some years; and, I may add, I had the honor of beating him at tlie recent federal elections. Mr Brown, in answer to question 5,220, confirmed the opinion of the late MrW . H . Groom that it was the pressure of the financial institutions, and the enormous interest which the planters had to pay, which was the cause of the then depression in the sugar industry. When he was asked as to the period within which the employment of Kanaka labour should be abolished, he said it should not be less than five years. That statement was made nearly thirteen years ago, and the planters are still asking for another five, or another seven, or another ten years. Evidence coming from a man of that class is of very great importance. He is one of those who are now advocating the retention of the Kanaka as indispensable. Erom the very beginning the cry has been raised that the planters only want a little more time. A t no time, until the present, did they ask that the traffic should be made permanent. They were all willing that it should termiBut tlie temptation was so nate at the end of some indefinite period, but now they say that its existence is indispensable to the industiy. Erom the district which the honourable member for Oxley represents, the cry comes that black labour cannot be dispensed with. Something has been said in regard to the inspection ; but no one knows better than those who have been in Northern Queensland that this inspection is an absolute farce, and means nothing whatever. Although an inspector does not give a formal notice of his visit, the planters and those interested are perfectly aware that he is coming within It was thought that no distant date, and consequently everything is in apple-pie order when he arrives. I have known cases in which an inspector it was not made has come to a district only once in three years. People have been summoned for illegally employing Kanakas, and have been fined 3s. od. and costs. Of course, the fine has been paid, and the Kanaka has been at his work as usual the next",35,Divide D As Under
60,Himself. That Gentleman Was Mr Kings,"morning. There is a case on record -and I mention it with veiy great diffidence, because it is a delicate subjectwhich goes to prove that the Kanaka is illegally employed all over the colony. The case to which 1 refer is that of a late member of the Federal Cabinet, who was fined 10s. for illegally employing a Kanaka as a coachman. I do not say that the employment of Kanakas is slavery, but the line of demarcation between it and slavery is not so broad nor so well defined as it should be. A little while ago, in a Mackay newspaper, there was an account of a meeting heldat a place called Marion, a large sugar growing centre-wher e nearly all the growers are small farmers between a farmer and a planter 1 big man, and the farmer the little man. During the proceedings it was elicited that some men had been into Mackay looking for Kanaka labour. The man who gave the information said that he had been acting for others, and he had found that the price of one of the agents was £ 2 2 10s., and of another £ 1 8 . He asked what was the reason for the difference in price. Honourable members will see that they were treating the question as though they were dealing with a bale of wool or a ton of sugar. He was told that the reason of the difference was that one man obtained a larger commission than the other. a head.

It was not because of the humanitarian principles of those engaged in the traffic that the law was altered. opinion had not been so strong, and had not been wrought to white heat by the accounts which were published, the same conditions would prevail to-day. It is not those who are engaged in the traffic who have made it cleaner-becaus e it is cleaner than it w'as-it is the force of public opinion. It is usual now, though somewhat in contravention of the law, to indent a number of islanders to a plantation, or even to the Central Mills which have been built by Government money. These men are brought over in bodies of 100 or 200, and are farmed out to the small growers in the neighbourhood. I have been told, on the best authority, that if a small cane farmer finds himself in financial straitsI am speaking now of farmers who lease land is the difference from planters who cut up their estatesand he goes to the planter and says, "" I have a dozen white men who are willing to do my work; will you advance me the money to pay them wages?"" tbe planter will say "" No."" The farmer will be told, "" Here are so many Kanakas.

The planters farm out the Kanakas, and it is openly stated that they make a profit upon the traffic. In the districts in which the cane is grown it has become an established custom to farm out Kanakas to small growers. it to be done ? must be acquainted with the fact that, where the Government closes its eyes to breaches of' regulations, these breaches will take place. Under an amendment of the Act of 1884 a penalty of £ 1 0 was imposed for a breach of the regulations; but it was found that the Justices Act overrode that Act, and gave magistrates power to impose any fine they chose. Of course, the fine now is merely nominal in nearly every case. The honourable member for Brisbane has himself stated in the Queensland Parliament that magistrates have sat on the bench and dealt with cases in which they themselves were the defendants.

That is a question of whioh a great deal of capital has has been made, but trashing is not absolutely necessary, and the price many of the cane-growers get for trashed cane does not represent the actual cost of the work. The fact is, that when the planters have a number of Kanakas on a plantation. for whom there is a slack season, when the cutting is over and the clearing-up after crushing has taken place, they put them on to do trashing. On the Herbert River the Colonial Sugar Refining Company have cut up their lands into small farms, and they have a_ number of tenant farmers. They also grow a certain amount of cane themselves. They make it a condition of the leases that the farmers must trash their cane, and for this work they give them from 6d. to 8d. per ton. But they do not trash tlieir own cane. They pay for the percentage of sugar in the cane, which is judged by their own analyst in their own laboratory at the mill. ""When the cane is being crushed they mix their own untrashed cane with the trashed cane of the farmers, and if, as is generally supposed, the untrashed cane is slightly lower in density than the trashed cane, they get the benefit of the reduction in density caused by the mixing. That is in one of the districts in which they say cane trashing must be done, but there is no absolute necessity for it . They give Cd. to 8d. per ton extra for trashing the cane, but the farmers declare that the increase in price is not equal to the amount they have to spend in labour for trashing. Mr Thos. Mackay, of Cairns, a man who has been engaged in the industry for 21 years, and has now made a competency and retired, told me that he has seen girls of 12 years of age trashing cane and doing it without any injury to themselves. holds that it is not absolutely necessary that the trashing should be done, and that in time trashing will be dispensed with altogether. trash the cane at all, but they burn the leaves off a few days before crushing, and that answers the same purpose. I would like honorable members to know that tlie crushing always takes place at the coolest time of the year. The cane-cutting which has been so much spoken of, commences usually in June, and, as was stated by the honourable member for Maranoa, who read an extract 17 M from a letter written by Lord Hopetoun, the climate in North Queensland in June, July, and August, and well into September, is simply perfect. It is a pleasure to be alive, and any man can work outside then. have worked outside myself, and the honourable member for Maranoa has told us he has done the same thing ; and although I am not quite so robust as he is, I do not think I have suffered much from it. Reference has been made to? the humidity of the climate, but during the six months from June to Christmas we have what we call our dry season. There may be a few showers, but no rain to speak of. The crushing is always finished by Christmas, because, with the new year we have the commencement of the rainy season, when all outdoor work is stopped; so that the argument that men would be incapable of working in the cane-fields owing to the humidity of the climate in these particular regions, is greatly discounted by the fact that at that particular time of the year there is no outdoor work done at all. They, perhaps, do a little planting and ploughing occasionally; but the rains are usually so heavy that work is almost entirely suspended. I dare say the honourable and learned member for Brisbane will say that he would be very sorry to see the white man reduced to working in cane-fields, but that work is positively ennobling compared to some of the work that I have seen done in the streets of Melbourne. If there is anything degrading in work--I do not say that there is-it is some of the work that is done in the factories and elsewhere around Melbourne that is degrading, and not the cutting or trashing of cane. Mr Paget has given us some figures with regard to the death rate among the Kanakas, which he [puts down at 30.2 per thousand for the last 10 years. Now we Herbert River, who gave evidence of a very startling character before the Royal commission. He said in reply to Mr In some cases they do not King, one' of the commissioners, that in 1887-that was sometime ago, and no doubt the conditions are much better now-the death rate amongst the Kanakas rose as high as 12 per cent., or Ij20 per thousand. Most of tlie deaths were caused by pneumonia and other kindred chest diseases, and by dysentry. The figures as to the mortality amongst these Kanakas are absolutely appalling when they are compared with the death",38,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And

In any case, even 30 per thousand would be a high death rate for these islanderswho are picked men of the best physique-youn g men who are examined medically in order to see that they have no organic complaints or diseases. Taking these facts into consideration and also remembering that they bring few women and no children with them, I contend that the death rate of 30 per thousand is something astounding. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN any way to the manner in which the Kanakas are domiciled or herded together ? dence which was given a little while ago at the Fairymead plantation in the Bundaberg district, proved that it was bad water, and the treatment the Kanakas received after being attacked by disease that had hastened their death, and had in every case accentuated the disease. No doubt these men, when they come here, are affected by the change of food and climate, and possibly by the change of water. I desire to point out that it was not for employment in sugar planting that these Kanakas were originally brought here. It was the greed of the pastoralists which resulted in the Kanaka being brought here originally. I saw Kanakas in the Darling Downs district in the middle of the seventies. There has never been a single stick of sugar cane grown on tlie Darling Downs for commercial purposes; but I saw men being brought there in batches of 20, 40 and 50. They were put into a railway carriage, and around every man's forehead was a piece of Calico on which was printed the name of his destination-in some cases Clifton, in other cases Felton, and other places, just as if they were bales of calico. The season of the year at which they should arrive from the South Sea Islands was never chosen. They were brought to Queensland at any time, but usually they came at a cold, damp, period. I know of one case in which it was intended to place a number of these men upon the Felton station, which is familiar to honourable members as the residence of the late Mr James Tyson. They were detrained at a place called Cambooya. The drays from the station, which were to have been awaiting tliem, did not arrive. It was a cold night, and they had to camp under a bridge, with the result that 70 per cent, of them died. Possibly this will not be found in any of the statistics, because at that time a Kanaka here or there was a matter of very small account-and I do nbt suppose that under theregulations which then existed there was any need to report their deaths. Those deaths were caused by the difference in the climate, and the difference in the food and water. The same influences produce the extraordinary mortality which exists amongst the Kanakas at the present time. It is frequently asserted that the Kanaka is taking no part in our social I s that due in or civic l if e ; but as a matter of fact he is taking such a part. He is induced to do so by other people, to whom his support is valuable. I know as a positive fact that in North Queensland, Kanakas are to be found who are Divisional Board voters. They are paying their rates and they have a vote which they exercise at tlie Divisional Board elections. An Honorable MEMBER -Are they freeholders i there is no necessity for them to be freeholders. If some one else pays the tax in the Kanaka's name the latter gets the vote. land themselves ! 1 Kanaka have these rights without being naturalized 1 a vote for the Legislative Assembly, but he has a vote for the Divisional Board, which he exercises. The honourable member for Melbourne read an extract last night from the Queensland BTansavd, in which Mr. Philp is reported to have said that white men would not work for a reasonable wage. As, however, that matter has been very effectively dealt with by the honourable member for Maranoa, the honourable member for Parramatta, and the honourable member for Robertson, I shall not occupy further time in discussing it . I merely wish to say that we cannot expect men to undertake the toil and drudgery .so vividly depicted by the honourable member for Maranoa and others for the low rate of wage that is offered. I know myself of one mill where the men work ten hours a day for 6d. an hour, out of which they have to pay for their own board. They receive no rations whatever.

If the Commonwealth is going to tax itself foivthe purpose i of providing higher returns for the farmer, the cane-grower, and the mill-owner, I hope that the men who do the hardestwork in the fields and other places, will participate' in the advantage. There is just one other item to which. I should like to refer. It has been said by some honourable members j that an extension of the time during which planters shall be able to employ Kanaka labour should be granted, because Queensland has recently suffered fromdrought and ticks. That argument seems to me like a man objecting to be hung on the ground that he has a sore throat. If such an argument were to be regarded as effective, it might be used at any time and for any purpose. I have had the honour of laying before the Prime Minister a telegram from various local authorities in Queensland in reference to this matter. Concerning that telegram, I wish to say that these local authorities have no mandate from the people to take any such action. During the municipal elections, the question of the employment of Kanaka labour was never raised. I want to state emphatically that the whole of tliis agitation has emanated from one man, who is actuated by -the most sordid motives. That gentleman _ is a member of the Townsville Municipal Council. He had some land on the Herbert River, near which a central mill was to be built. The Queensland Government refused to grant the loan which they had previously promised for the erection of that mill. The individual in question was so disappointed at not being able to sell for £ 5 or £ 6 an acre the land which he had taken up, probably at 5s. or 6s. an acre, that he started the present agitation. That -man has never grown one single stick of cane. Several local bodies, I am aware, have endorsed his action, but it is not a very 'difficult matter for a man to secure that .sort of support. I repeat that the whole of this agitation from the local, bodies of North Queensland has really emanated from that one individual, who is actuated by the most selfish motives. I endorse the statement of the honourable member for Maranoa that there was no hesitation whatever during the federal elections on the part of the majority of' the candidates who were returned by the State of Queensland. 17 M 2 There were no side issues in that contest at all. The one plain question put before the people was whether Austealia was to be iblack or white, and the electors gave a most emphatic vote for a white Australia. That vote has been endorsed in several elections which have occurred in connection with the Queensland Parliament, and also in the election for the Darling Downs vacancy, in -which Mr Groom secured nearly a Wo to. one majority over his. opponent, who is a most influential man, a practised politician ( and speaker, and is generally respected. Government behind him. that federation was accomplished by the democratic vote of North Queensland. In and around Brisbane the vote cast was against federation. The reason why federation was carried there is that the workers of North Queensland, who are most affected by tlie employment of Kanaka labour, had been for years endeavouring to reduce the evils connected with that traffic. They had only partially succeeded. Certainly they had. secured legislation of a somewhat more drastic character than had been upon thestatute-book of that State. But they could not get tlie absolute prohibition of this immigration, which is what they desired. Accordingly, they said, "" If we stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of the southern States, there is no doubt that prohibition will come sooner or later, and in all probability sooner."" It was for that reason alone that they stood in as federationists. Possibly, they may have been actuated to some extent by sentiment, but certainly that was their dominant idea. They believed that they would get allies in the southern States to assist them in accomplishing their object. the opportunity of endorsing that sentiment. I believe that it will be endorsed in this House, with not more than three or four dissentients. I intend to support the B i ll as it stands. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). -Honorabl e members have heard this afternoon three characteristic speeches from Queensland representatives.

92,Mr Bamford,"I am pleased to havetheir voices against the probable action of the Eederal Government. The speeches of the honourable members referred to I consider an epitome of Queensland opinion upon this question. There are two to one in favour of the action contemplated under this Bill.

' They have always held forth figures and statistics gathered by the class who are interested in retaining the trade. If the arguments we have heard in this Chamber, and the -.arguments we have read elsewhere, are all ""that can be used, they are sufficient to crush ..any figures which can be shown. The honorable member for Oxley says that House is not well informed on the subject, ..and ought to pause before taking action -and interfering with such an important industry Queensland. of such great magnitude this House and the Commonwealth been so fully informed. which I can recollect as being under controversy for close on forty years. It originated in disputes between those carrying on missions in the South Sea Islands and the politicians in Queensland, and the subject -is one in connection with which many -political reputations were made and lost. Mr G. B. Edwards. The question has been studied by English writers, by colonial statesmen, and other thinkers, and the facts on both sides have been put before us by the press, while parliamentary letter-boxes have been filled with literature on the subject. I do not think any Royal commission or any select committee would be better able to deal with the question than is the House at the present time. We know that this traffic has a dark and disgraceful past, and that it is in a most unsatisfactory state at the present time. In the future there is inevitable danger, which will grow larger day by day, both to the unfortunate coloured classes who are employed, and to the European employersa danger which will grow to such proportions that we had better now devise means of stopping the traffic and preventing the evil which menaces us. The honourable member for Oxley has made out no case at all why Parliament should stay its hand. The federation, on which we of this industry, the large have now entered, was brought about mainly with the object of dealing with such questions as these. Queensland herself has already, over and over again, attempted to deal with this question, but she has careful how we deal with it. always been hoodwinked and bamboozled we must approach it with ample over the matter of delay-sh e has always been asked to wait a bit, and industry. give a little more time. Legislation has been passed to stop this traffic at some future date, but before that date has arrived,, under the influence of certain wire-pullers and of class interests, the operation of that legislation has been stayed. Further batches of Kanakas have been allowed to be introduced, and the trade has gone on from time to time, until the people of Queensland have looked forward to this federation to enable thein to put an end to it . It was certainly this one of the gravest questions referred to in the Commonwealth at the recent election. I noticed that throughout the whole of the Commonwealth this question of a ""white as the sugar industry of Australia "" was most manifest-tli e question But there are few subjects whether the Kanaka should be kept out of on which Queensland in pursuance of such a policy. have I noticed that in Queensland, in particular, It is a subject this question, like Aaron's serpent, swallowed up all the rest. It was the main question on which the appeal was made in that State, and Queensland gave an emphatic and noble verdict, and returned, as has been pointed out, four senators out of six in favour of a "" white Australia.""",41,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And
93,Mr Mcdonald,"The whole six.Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The whole six were in favour of abolishing this traffic; and to the House of Representatives, seven members out of nine were returned similarly pledged. It is now useless for Mr Philp or any one else to raise his voice against such a definite expression of opinion as we have already had from the people of Queensland. The people of the Commonwealth are one in a determination to abolish this black labour. land, who are more intimately interested in the question of Pacific Island labourers, are almost unanimous in their"" desire to get rid Of such labour. No argument has been advanced for staying our hands in the legislation which we are now considering. I do not think we can gain anything, while on the other hand we have much to fear, by delay. Looking back on the history of the question, we see that every time the opponents of the reform have proved strong enough to stay it for a still further period. The Bill is one which I think meets with the general approval of the House. It is a short and simple Bill, and effects its purpose in an admirable way. If it had been introduced Restriction Bill, I believe that the character of the latter measure would have been very much altered. Bil l aims simply and directly at the end we all have in view. No doubt it will accomplish that end perfectly, and to that extent it is one of the best measures that the present Government have introduced. The Prime Minister introduced the measure in a statesmanlike speech, which was clear and dignified ; and he justified the measure in every particular. He did not take the ground that the labour must be stopped because of certain political reasons, but grounds. He showed the provisions he proposed tice should be done to those who, under the State Acts, had been induced to engage in the industry. free-trader, and one personally interested in cheap sugar, I would sink to some extent my political principles and my private prospects and make some concession of a fiscal nature if that would assist to pass a measure like this, doing justice to all concerned. I do not mean to say that I am totally in favour of the proposals of the Ministry in this direction, which are to accompany the Bill, and which the Prime Minister invited us to consider with it . These proposals are not fully before us, and I do not know that I should fully support them in the form in which they are put forward; but I am prepared to make a great deal of sacrifice to ensure the passage of a measure like this, which will end a dark and disgraceful page in our national history. As I said before, if this Bill had come first, as an illustration of how The people of Queensto deal with a difficulty of this sort in a direct way, we might have had another result in the Immigration Restriction Bill. But ' Ministers, for some good reason known to themselves, introduced the latter measure first. That Bill has now received our consideration, and all we have to doI think we are practically unanimous, and ought not to waste too much time in discussion-is to set to work to get this Bill through as rapidly as possible. This is not a labour question, and I object towhat the honourable member for Melbournesaid last night, when addressing the labourparty. He said this was a piece of legislation brought in as a sop to the party, who sit in the Opposition corner. I say that it before the Immigration is no such thing. This is a broader questionthan that. There are people who, like myself, have a great deal of sympathy with This the objects of the labour party. Butoutside of those people, there are many people of eminence in the community -educate d and professional people-wh o have not one atom of sympathy with the political aspirations of the labour party, butwho are quite at one with them on thisquestion. It is something more than a labourquestion-it is a national question involvingthe preservation of the purity of our race. It is rather a mean piece of criticism to t r y to stay this legislation by stamping it as he mentioned broad proceeding from only one section of the community. The Bill has, I believe, thein order that no injusapproval of the vast majority of all classes, and of the masses also. Many solutionsof this question have been put forAlthough a ward. Before this Parliament met T know there were advocates of drawing a line across the continent, dividing off tropical Australia, and keeping black labour north of that line. That is the sort of line, which was known as the Mason-Dixon line in the United States, north of which a man could not keep slaves. It was proposed that we should reverse that process, and permit black labour north of the proposed line. It is a curious coincidence that in that respect, as in many others, comparing small things with great, this traffic in Kanakas from the South Sea Islands has very much in it to remind us of the American slavery question. In a minor degree it is of the same character and nature, and I was still linone convinced of that when I heard the honourable member for Herbert speaking to-night. Seeing that, and knowing as we do the immense difficulties fthat the people of the United States have had in consequence of their original sin, it is one of the strongest arguments why we should pass this legislation, and prevent the trouble which will come in the future if we encourage the bringing of a black, race or black races into the community. honourable and learned member for Parkes thinks there is no possible danger or trouble. mix with the black population. may not be contaminated ; but I contend that the contamination will proceed, from the lowest strata of society and filter up until it comes to the highest, the whole nation. have to fear. I do not fear that my people or. my friends will mix with the inferior races, but I do fear that my descendants, in theiutur-e days of the Commonwealth, may be largely with them if they are allowed, to enter now. AlthoughI hold that all men are equal before God, and equal to one another in respect of certain civil rights, there is a distinction between one race and another, and it is a good thing to let each race develop on the lines of its own civilization, in its own way. It is better for us to pursue-our chdlization in the direction of Anglo-Saxon development, and not to mix with any other race which, even if superior to us, will give us bad results. The honourable member for Herbert, speaking to-night, said that already Kanakas had exercised a civil right by voting in road boards elections and municipal elections in Queensland. with the ideas that are dominant in our political development, we cannot look for' ward to having a class amongst us to whom we must refuse the franchise. not have any class amongst us to whom we have to deny that privilege; if we are to allow these people here we shall ultimately have to give them the franchise. That is one point Ave ought to consider very seriously before we decide the Mr G. B. Edwards. question. The effect on the Kanaka himself is also one of the factors. These people in their own islands are most interesting, and I have ,no doubt that if they were left aione under the civilizing influences that have already reached them, or are trickling in slowly to them, they might ultimately develop a higher civilization, notwithstanding the vices of the whites. But I am certain that to bring them into Australia, and. subject them to all the contamination they would meet here, would do-no good to the Kanakas themselves. The facts and statistics undoubtedly recorded in the history of this trade show us that in very many instances the Kanakas have'been treated-scajidalouslyandasaservile A gentleman like the class. They come here and die like flies in summer. Their death sate amounted at one time to 120 per 1,000, and there is an He and his, he feels sure, will not average death rate of 30 per 1,000. That His blood cannot come about unless there is some scandalous method of treatment, in their feeding, housing, or otherwise. It can result only from a -Legree style of permeating dealing with them, and of civilizing That is what we them off the face of the earth. To the Kanaka himself it is a bod thing. It is of no use to bring him into contact with our civilization before he is ready for it. A t present he absorbs only what might contaminated be called the worse elements of our civilizar tion ; the best are incomprehensible to him ; and he goes back tainted rather than improved by his contact with us. Therefore, I say that to the ikanaka himself it is better that the 'trade should cease. But to the white races inhabiting those parts of the continent where this traffic exists, it is equally an evil. No nation having in its midst a servileor lower class, bas ever existed without becoming degraded by its contact with that class. It is well known that in the southern States of America, the lower classes-the working men, the proletariats -di d not exist. When a white man ceased to belong to the slave-owning class, As a democratic community, he became a rascal and a rogue, while the members of that-class acquired the highest vices ofcivilization, by reason of the full control they had of their slaves. To inWe should troduce a lower standard of lining and morals amongst us is to lower the tone of and our society, and -will react upon us, the masters of these unfortunate blacks. The statistics which .have been placed before us to-day show, that the female Kanakas who are imported do not number 10 per cent. of the whole importation. One does not want to go into tliis subject in detail, but the effeets of such a disproportion between the sexes is well known, and must be disastrous both to the Kanaka and to the European who brings him here and uses his labour. If the Queensland Government had been matter, ing and returning of the Kanakas,.have required that a certain proportion of females should be brought with the males. I look upon Queensland as one of the most magnificent States in the Commonwealth. We have been accustomed in tlie past to regard New South Wales and ""Victoria as the great States of the Federation, but I do not think that it is improbable that Queensland will ultimately become the greatest State in the union. The resources of that State are immense, and I do not think we can overrate its jiossibilities. . Wheni t is argued that the sugar industry is vital to Queensland, I am prepared to admit that it is a giieat industry, and as a commercial man I should never be in a hurry to do anything to cripple or break down such an industry ; but 1 have good reasons for holding that the legislation which we are now considering will have little or no effect upon this industry, while it will give a .great dustries which for, and which will help her on in the path of progress which, I believe, she is destined -to follow. I am willing to admit that the importance of the sugar industry cannot well be magnified, but I do not think its preservation is so much a question of the employment of black labour. To the planter, the only point in the controversy is that black labour is cheap. I do not think, however, that the industry depends so m uch upon the continuance of this cheap labour as upon other questions of method and means, and economic legislation which will procure a market for its produce and increase its price. As I interjected when the Prime Minister was speaking, it is largely a question of manure, mechanism, and a market. We have heaad during the discussion, and I have read in the literature on the subject which has been disseminated so freely, that there are certain operations connected with the harvesting of the cane that can be performed only by tedious hand labour, and that in a hot climate this labour can be effectively performed only by black men. I have never believed that there is anything which a black man can do which a whiteman cannot do, and I was therefore glad to hear the honourable members for Herbert and Maranoa say that there are white men who are performhumane and just in tliis ing the severest kind of manual labour in they would, when legislatNorthern Queensland. That statement has for the feeding and housing been made, too, by Sir Samuel Griffiths in the Queensland Parliament. I do not admit that there is any work required to be performed in Queensland which cannot be done by white men. We can get white men to do this work if we pay them the wages which white men would naturally demand under the circumstances. Men who have been in Northern Queensland doing this work have gone further north, to the hotter and more dangerous climate of New Guinea, in search of gold. They have gone, too, to the Far East, where the climate and surroundings are in every respect worse. But if the work cannot be made fairly remunerative to white men, we may be certain that white men will not do it . I pin my faith more to the intellect than to the muscle of the white worker. If the white man has to solve the difficutty of planting, trashing and cutting the cane with white labour, his intellect will eventually enable him to invent mastimulus to many other inchinery which will do the work better than Queensland is fitted he could do it by his unaided physical strength. I believe that if slavery had continued . in America up to the present day we should not have obtained from that country the wonderful mechanical inventions which she has given to the world. It is only when the necessity arises, and men are forced to face difficulties, that their inventive faculties are brought into use, and machines are made to do their work for them. When we get rid of tlie Kanaka we shall find intelligence at work to invent machines to trash and to cut tlie cane, and eventually machines will be invented which will do the work more speedily and better than it is now done by black labour. I know of many operations in factories which, it has been said, it would not pay to carry on ; but inventive geniuses havesetto work and given us machines which have thoroughly solved those problems. I heard recently from one of my partners, that in Canada, at one of the canning factories, they found the fish coming in so rapidly that they could not make and fill the cans fast enough. The trouble was put before a cute Yankee, however, and within four or five weeks he had invented a machine which would make the tins and close them up as fast as they could put the fish into them. It has been said that, if you take away the Kanaka, the Queensland farmers will plant no more cane, that her mills will have no more cane to crush, and that the Colonial Sugar Company will have no more sugar to refine. But neither Dr. Maxwell nor any other authority on this question has half so good a knowledge of it as the investors in the Colonial Sugar Company. Those who have put their money into that concern know more about the effects of doing away with the Kanaka than Dr. Maxwell or any member of any Royal commission knows. circumstances, and, having invested their money, they must get a return for it. The Colonial Sugar Company is the centre to which all the rills and streams of the sugar industry flow. It is indeed the embodiment of the sugar industry of Australia. AVhen the first movement towards ation was made, the doom of the Kanaka was sounded. labour was one of the first questions discussed in connection with federation,and one of the chief reasons urged for federating. To my mind, the active campaign for the securing of federation commenced with the Parkes' convention in 1891, when the Colonial Sugar Company's Stock, £-20 paidup, and returning a dividend of .10 per cent., stood at £25 10s. On the 29th January, 1895, the Premiers' conference was held at Hobart. move towards federation, and probably the investors in sugar company's shares had begun to be a little doubtful as to what would be the ultimate condition of affairs, and the price of the shares shrunk to £24 10s. Then many of us came to the conclusion that federation would never be consummated so long as it was left exclusively to the politicians, and the Bathurst Popular convention was held on the 26th November of the following year. The effect of the holding of that convention was to show that a great many people, who took no interest in politics generally, took an interest in federasented among us. 1 am still of that opinion, tion, and were determined, despite the politicians, to bring about its consummation. Nevertheless, after the holding of the convention, the Colonial Sugar shares rose to £26 10s. Then, after the Mr G. B. Edwards. meeting of the elected convention at Adelaide, on the 22nd March, 1897, they rose to £ 2 8 10s., notwithstanding the fact that federation, and the abolition of the Kanaka, were getting nearer and nearer. After the meeting of that convention at Sydney, on the 2nd September, 1897, they rose to £ 2 9 lOs.j but after tlie meeting of the convention at Melbourne they fell to £ 2 8 15s. The next step was the referendum, which was taken on the 3rd and 4th June, 1898, when the Bil l was rejected because of the statutory limitation imposed by the New South Wales Act. On the 1st June, 1898, a few days before the referendum, the sugar company's shares stood at £30, and on 8th June, a week later, they still stood at the same amount. The next They have studied the referendum, when the Bill was accepted, took place on the 20th June, 1899. On the 16th of that month, four days before, the sugar company's shares stood at £ 3 8 , and on the 24th at 37 10s. When the Royal assent was given to the Constitution Bill, on the 9th July, 1900, federthese shares stood at£ 3 9 15s. Upon the inauguration of the Commonwealth, on the The abolition of Kanaka 1st January of this year, they were at £ 4 0 , and on the 1st of the present month their price was £ 4 0 10s. Seeing that the shares of this great institution, in which is centralized the whole of the sugar industry of Australia, have been steadily rising ever since an advance was made towards the realization of federation, and the consequent abolition of the Kanaka, it is evidently the opinion of investors that there is no reason to think that the sugar industry is about to This was another suffer. On the other hand, there can be no democracy, no majority rule, if we further postpone the oft-repeated determination to abolish the Kanaka once and for all. few words to say on this important subject. When we had a measure before us recently framed with the object of keeping out coloured aliens, I indicated that I considered that Kanakas were a manageable quantity, presenting infinitely less difliculty than did the Chinese, Japanese, or any other of the numerous coloured people who are reprealthough I have listened closely to the various speeches which have been delivered by honourable members, some of whom have Company's expressed their views very justly and very strongly. The Prime Minister himself dealt with the subject exhaustively and in a very",42,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And
94,Mr Knox (Kooyong),"I have only aconvincing way. That is to say, he showed that Queensland, prior to joining the federation, had had clearly before her the possibility of legislation being passed by this Parliament to keep out the Kanakas. That being so, it could not be urged that people in that State who are dependent upon the Kanaka labour had not the most distinct warning that was likely to be brought into force at an early date. I have declared distinctly for a white Australia, and T have left no room for doubt as to my position on that question; but I have also made it clear that I do not wish to see white slaves in Australia-o r black slaves either. Further, I have distinctly stated that the absorption into our race of any alien blood should be resisted with all the powers of the Commonwealth. While I stated that, however, I said I believed that there were interests in the north of the continent which had been created and supported by black labour which deserved proper consideration. If the white man can do the work to be done in the tropics without injury to his constitution aud to the race, it should not be given to outsiders ; but I hold the view that I have previously expressed that the white man cannot, in those tropical regions, work without detriment to himself. It is all very well for my esteemed friend, the honourable member for Maranoa, to put himself forward as typical of the men who have worked in the tropical regions of Northern Queensland. He is a man of exceptional strength, and I believe that men of his type are raised and supported in the inland areas of Northern Queensland, which have a climate entirely different from that of tlie coastline, where the Kanaka has to work in tlie cane-fields. The white man, in his effort to do this class of work, which is so debilitating and which so undermines the constitution, is doing great and permanent injury to the race that we all wish to maintain in its full strength and vigour. before referred to the fact that evidence could be produced, upon medical authority, to show that the children of people living in these tropical regions become amende, and that tlie third generation have within themselves no generating powers; and our own knowledge of what takes place in tropical regions gives support to that view: speaking of India1 at all to Queensland. admit that tropical regions vary in different countries, but I ' would ask my honourable friends to allow me to commend to their notice a work which is called The Contro of the Tropics, and is written by Benjamin legislation of this character Kidd, the author of a work in which I am sure my honourable friends of the. labour party will admit they are specially interested, namely, "" Social Evolution."" largely discredited. honourable member is acquainted with the theories I have mentioned. .This book, from which I propose to quote, was published in 1S98, and the author endeavours to show that the black races were originally generated in the tropical areas where living was easiest, whereas our British races are the product of men who, by evolution, brought about by the harder work they had to do in the temperate and colder regions, became stronger and stronger, and gradually established a hardier, more robust and vigorous constitution. This work very clearly shows that those who support the position that white men can go into the tropical regions, and do the work that black men have hitherto done, are acting in a manner calculated to result in injury to their race, which we desire to maintain in its fullest vitality and strength. This writer saysIn the first place the attempt to acclimatise the white man in the tropics must be recognised to be a blunder of the first magnitude. All experiments based upon the idea are mere idle and empty enterprises foredoomed to failure.

I believe that all interests in Queensland would be met by the recommendations which such a commission would make. I hope, therefore, that the House will beprepared to give reasonable consideration to the proposal. I rose merely to emphasize the fear which I entertained that the cry for a white Australia, if carried too far, may permanently injure our own people' in a way in which we do not properly appreciate at the present time. SirW 1 XLIAM McMILLAN "" (Wentworth) I am sure that this House will be sufficiently generous to recognise the straightforward attitude of the honouable member who has just spoken. In a question where there is an overwhelming majority upon one side, I am sure that, as a deliberative assembly, we should welcome all criticism of a clear and straightforward character. remarks, which will be very brief, may not be misunderstood, I desire to say that I regard Uiis Bill, to a very great extent, as the complement of the Immigration Restriction Bill. We are indebted to many people in Queensland for a perfect mass of literature which has been placed in our hands. We are also indebted to the Prime Minister for his very able and historical speech upon this question. He traversed all the ground from the introduction of the Kanaka into Queensland up to the present time. I believe, with the honourable member for Kooyong, that it might have been better if an unprejudiced and independent inquiry had taken place, because, although the result might have been exactly the same, it would have been a generous attitude on the part of the great democracies of the south, k i dealing with a question which affects one industry in one State of the group. I was in heart}' sympathy with the Immigration Restriction Bill, because I believe that of all kinds of coloured immigration, unrestricted, irregularimmigration is the most vital danger to tlie white interests, of Australia. But I recognise, as far as this Bill is concerned, that it must be considered under some what different circumstances as compared with the Immigration Restriction. Bill. Tlie Government, by making it a separate measure, have recognised that position. I am willing to admit at once, to avoid any misunderstanding, that I believe, If a plebiscite were taken in the State of Queensland, the people, by an overwhelming majority, would declare against Kanaka labour. Running through the whole of this legislation, both that which we have closed and that which we are considering to-night, there is one principle. I do not think that the most rabid member in the House, if I may use the term, will say that we, in the cradle of this Constitution-in the cradle of our Commonwealth life-ca n know all the future with regard to tlie destiny of that great part, of the continent. There is running through the whole of this legislation the pi-inciple that, whether right or wrong, we must first get rid of all tliis alien labour throughout the length and breadth of Australia, so that in the future those who follow us, if not ourselves, will have what we might call a clean political slate, without any vested interests or complications of the moment to in any way throw a side light on the question-in other words, that when In order that my subsequent tlie accomplishment of our intention is complete Australia will be entirely white, and that if there is to be any scheme in the future any regulation of tliis great tropical part of Australia it must be done with absolute independence and without anything to complicate the consideration of statesmen. ThatI believe to be tlie honest desire of Australia. Further, it is now too late for a Royal commission. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that this House intends that the -Bill shall go through in some shape or other, and there is no doubt that it must include some finality with regard to this traffic. But having said so, we must deal very fairly and very generously with this interest. Honourable members will not be surprised that .as a commercial man-and I do not see why the same sentiment should not apply to all men in AustraliaI cannot, without a great deal of misgiving, see the possible destruction of a great industry which feeds more or less, directly and indirectly, 100,000 people on this continent. Every great industry we build up-ever y legitimate industry-is a proof oi the enterprise of the British people in Australia. We feel that there is nothing, against this industry itself-it is only the unfortunate climatic conditions which affect the labour of white men. member reckon that 100^000 people are fed by this industry ?",48,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And
110,Mr Eisher,"Ho w does the honorablewe take the figures, and consider that £7,000,000 of direct capital have been devoted to this industry, and that 30,000 people, more or less, are directly employed. in it , and when we take the whole host of concomitant industries, and include the steamship companies and everything else, it is probable that 100,000 people are directly and indirectly interested in the business. of destroying an industry which has grown up, as this one has done, under a duty. not matter whether we say that a sixth or a seventh or an eighth of tlie people in Queensland are interested in the industry. I know that may be reduced by the number of people interested in it in the less tropical parts, where some people contend the white man can easily work. It does not matter how we look at the question. Here is a great industry which has employed a number of jieople, an industry in which capital has been invested under the law. When we have determined that we will deal with it in the most drastic manner, we, as a Commonwealth Parliament, ought to be generous to a fault in considering the interests of the people who are interested in it . There is an argument underlying this discussion which I think is scarcely fair under tlie circumstances. Honourable members who have studied this question historically say-and from their point of view, rightly say-that time after time it has been proposed to do away with the traffic, but that time after time some excuse has been seized in order to continue it . We must recollect this difference. We know that the vested interests in Queensland are much larger in proportion to Queensland itself than they are in proportion to the whole of the interests of Australia. We may depend upon it-and I am sure the Prime Minister will agree with methat when once a Bill passes this Parliament with finality, it is never likely to be disturbed, except by further knowledge brought to bear on the subject. I do not think any honourable member will say for a moment that any law we pass must he an eternal law, if the wisdom and knowledge of the people, expressed through proper means of legislation, favour an alteration. The whole legislation of the century is the doing away with the legislation of the previous century. Therefore it is not quite a fair argument to say that When if we do not stamp this thing out at once, there will, without doubt, be a reaction which will cause us to reverse our steps. But we have not the mere local influence of Queensland to deal with. We shall have, when this measure is passed, the verdict of the democracy of the whole of Australia. Therefore, I plead for generosity with regard to this industry, and I plead with honourable members to put away the fear that when finality is placed in the Bill the question will never be tampered with again. It does to those who suffer from this intrusion 1 all about that. Nobody is more seized than I am of all the evils connected with this business. I believe the great State of Queensland made a very noble attempt to establish this industry, and that her best men did all they could to restrict this Kanaka traffic within reasonable bounds. But, as has been said here this afternoon, with such an enormous area, and with nine thousand or ten thousand people involved, no restrictive measure of Government ccild properly control such an industiy. I am perfectly aware that the conditions under which these Kanakas live are not conditions under which we like to see any human being, and that once men are contracted into a state of tliis kind though I do not think it should be denominated slavery it does create a relationship between man and man hurtful to both parties. I quite allow, following the speech of the Prime Minister, that at different periods in the consideration of this subject in the Queensland Legislature, there was an opinion expressed by most of the public men in that State that all these measures with regard to Kanaka labour were purely temporary. I believe that during all these years there never was an absolute statement made, except by a very few, that Kanaka labour was to continue for ever. For myself, I believe that this labour would die out ultimately. I do not believe that the system can last beyond a certain number of years, but that the same circumstances which affect the life of and destroy these island people elsewhere, will affect them to a larger extent in a traffic like this. does not advocate their extermination 1 not proposing their extermination, but",49,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And

WhatI want to say is, that although that may be a fact, we have to legislate on this question as we find it. tabooed by the Legislature of Queensland, but that a certain state of affairs has been legalised by the local Parliament. I am of opinion, notwitstandiug this Bill, that there ought to be a period given in which there will be no alteration in the absolute status of the present moment. I do not think that, making every allowance, the Bill is fair in its details to the industry. In the very first year we begin to reduce the men who can return by 25 per cent., and in the next year we reduce them by 50 per cent., and after that everything ceases. We may say that we give five years to the industry. that everything ceases, because there will be 9,000 or 10,000 there still. may be, but the system of recruiting ceases. words, we practically stop the system in two years. I take it for granted, though I do not pretend to know as much as honourable members for Queensland, that many have a right to go back to the islands every year. of the engagement of three years. for the first two years we drastically reduce the number to whom we give a licence, and then in two years we stop the licences altogether. That state of affairs has continued for many }'ears. Does anybody mean to say that by a little more generous treatment, so long as we keep in the Bill the principle of finality within a reasonable period, we can do any great injury either to the people of Queensland or anybody else? While I recognise the fact that a ten years already in which to prepare for large majority of Queensland members have this change ? been returned here with a mandate from their people to do away with Kanaka labour, have not had ten years ; that is where honorstill we must not lose sight of the fact which able members make a mistake. There has is shown in the following quotation from been continual agitation and legislation on the speech by the Prime Minister on the this question, but it never came home to the second readingIb is to be looked at by federated Australia, not drastically dealt with. as a question affecting only one State, but as a question which belongs to the Federation which we have succeeded in establishing, and one which five years j at the end of 1904 they will have know very well that other cannot with justice to the continent be relegated wholly to a State. I believe absolutely in that principle. This is not the verdict or the action of the federal members for Queensland ; this is the action of the Parliament of Australia. pleading for fair play, and for a recognition of what I still think should be a principle of this legislation. When we consider that out of 4,000,000 people, more or less, in Australia, at least 3,500,000 are working under good climatic conditions, does any honourable member mean to tell me that when those 3,500,000 take upon themselves to do a work which may seriously affect the interests of 200,000 or 300,000-becaus e that cannot be denied, though our action is the benefit of all-w e ought not to be as generous as it is possible for men to be 1 I say we ought to be. It would be a That disgrace to us if we were not generous. Does the honourable member for Maranoa or any other honourable member for Queensland In other imagine for one moment that, if a little more generosity were put into this Billa short extension of time given-ther e would be any chance of wrecking the finality of the measure. I am sure no such thought is entertained. Therefore I do say that I think end there ought to be at least five years allowed, during which there should be no interference whatever with this traffic, and that then there ought to be a gradual reduction, according to the terms .of the Bill, for another five years.

Is that too much or too little 1 read very carefully the comprehensive speech made on the subject by the Prime Minister, and I think it is a magnificent contribution to tliis debate. It is well that it is recorded in Mansard, as a resume of the whole historical and political features of this question. But that does not affect the fact that we have to deal with this industry as we find it at the time it is relegated to us. do in five years in order to soften the blow 1 all very well. The honourable and learned member might apply the same reasoning to anything else. My point is simply that this is a great industry established under the law. We must recollect, in fairness to these men, that in bringing Kanakas to Queensland they acted under the law. under the shadow of the scaffold. a very clever epigrammatic expression by my honourable and learned friend, but I do not see anything else in it. I have read everything that the Prime Minister has said, while I understand entirely from his speech the trend of legislation on this subject, still we have to take up this question exactly where the States have left it. If , for the sake of example, there had been no legislation of tliis kind during previous years, should we have attempted to deal with it in this way ? No. We should have said that while we have determined that this alien labour shall cease, we will deal with it as generously as possible. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Has the honourable member considered the fiscal proposals connected with this question. perfect nonsense. We are talking now of a question of climate. I quite agree with views expressed in the literaturethat we have had placed before us, that probably up to a considerable point there is no reason why a white man should not do the work connected with this industry in Queensland; but I say distinctly-and it is only fair to say so in this discussion-that I have had no literature placed before me yet which proves I have that, beyond a certain point the white man can do the work. I accept the position taken up by Australia, that we will take the chance; that if no white man can do it, we shall not in years to come have any such industry in existence. That is the position of the democracy of Australia, and I accept it. Buti t is useless to debate this question before this great Parliament of the Commonwealth in any hypocritical spirit. I listened with great pleasure to the honwould the planters orable member for Herbert. He said, according to his own view, that, no doubt, the white man can work in the sugarT h a t is cane industry in any part of tropical Australia. I have read very carefully the literature on this subject, and I have come to the conclusion that whatever machinery or improved methods may do in the future, at the present time, and under present conditions, there is a point in Queensland, north of which the white man cannot work in certain parts of this industry. A t the same time, however, that is a chance which T h a t is we have to take. It may be well worth the while of Australia, in order to be absolutely free from alien labour, to take the chance of leaving unfertilized a certain portion of her territory rather than create this evil. -Whil e Mr O'MALLEY -Hear, hear. She should do so, and breed the white man to do the work. necessity for ine to say much more on this subject. I have not risen, to resent the cry for a white Australia, or the demand that we should not do away with coloured labour of all kinds. I do believe that there is a great and essential difference between the insidious coming in of aliens to all parts, of Australia, which we have tried to sujDpress, under the Bil l thathas just passed this House, and a possible system of regulated coloured labour. But I recognise the fact that that policy is for the future; that we Australians have said that we must have a clean slate T h a t is politically in this matter, and that we must deal with the question untrammelled by vested'interests or complicated conditions. We must not, as the first Parliament of Australia, in the very beginning of our national life, commit ourselves absolutely, and for all time, to any question with regard to Northern Australia. The only thing Ave do commit ourselves to is this: that we will never allow, under any conditions,",51,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And

That, of course, is a veiy difficult question which statesmen in the future will have to decide. a portion of our continent enormously rich in agriculture. I hope that there may be some other kinds of agriculture which we may persue in these great northern districts, and which the white men will be able to carry on without any alien labour. That is a matter which must be left for the future. In. the meantime, on behalf of the weak, as against the strong, I do plead for a more generous consideration than this Bill gives to the sugar industry of Queensland. existed for a certain number of years, and even allowing all that the honourable member for Indi may say-that it makes no difference in the long run still, if we can find by expressions of opinion among those men who are particularly interested in this industry that they would consider we did an act of justice if while dealing with this question we increased the limit of time under which this traffic has to disappear, I think it would be better for us as a Commonwealth Parliament, and as representing the great democracies of the South, who have, of course, no immediate interest in this question, to give them a fuller and a larger portion of justice while carrying out our final and inevitable policy. bane) I had intended at an earlier stage of this debate to address myself to this vast question-vas t in its importance to Queensland interests, as well as to New South Wales and Victorian residents, financiers, shippers and others. My health, however, would not permit of it . I am sorry to say that, even now, I do not feel in the humour to speak. It has been hinted to me, however, that this debate will be closed to-nightI shall not be sorry if it does-and I hope honourable members will bear with me while I endeavour, principally from memory, to summarize tlie subject matter as it presents itself to my constituents ; as it is approved of by them, and voiced by me as their spokesman. I promulgated the programme that for a period of ten years we should allow tlie Kanaka labour to remain m statu quo, and that at the end of that time we should begin to reduce it at the rate of 10 per cent.; so that in twenty years-whic h is a very short time in the history of a nation-it would be extinct, if it had not previously become extinct for other reasons. That was my proThis industry exists in gramme, and I hope honourable members will remember that, in proposing the retention of the Kanaka, I am not howling for it , as the honourable member for Maranoa accused the honourable member for Oxley and myself of doing. I wish to appear before this Parliament as one who is as strongly in favour of abolishing this labour as is any honourable member. But, as my honourable friend, the member for Wentworth, observed, we should extend justice to those engaged in the industry. We are here to endeavour to do This evil has modest justice to those who have invested their capital and inherited the capital of others invested in this industry during the past 36 years. Honourable members will please note that when I first went to Queensland, as a lad, there was not a teaspoonful of sugar grown in the country, and that I have been intimately associated with squatters, wool growers, timber getters And explorers. I was quite a lad when Captain Mackay, who is now harbour-master at Brisbane, met me while on his exploring expedition, and I gave him bullocks with which he was able to continue his journey up North. Mackay found tlie stream now named after him, and called it the Pioneer River. So grateful were the people for the discovery of the fertile country through which the river flows, with its suitability for agriculture, and with its splendid rainfall, that they begged the Government to change the name of the river from the Pioneer to the Mackay, and that was done. I merely quote this incident in my early experiences to show that I could not possibly have lived in the countiy for practically 40 years without observing the history of the Kanaka question in its relation to sugar raising, and to the now defunct cotton industry, which at one time was much more prosperous, and gave promise of far greater results than did the growth of sugar, I live in the tropicsI do not know whether the honourable member for Maranoa was born when I began to do so. I lived in the tropics of Capricorn for twelve solid years, and Rockhampton was my headquarters. I say from that experience, that",52,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And

The climate on the coast is very hot, and white men, if they are wise, will not work there in the middle of the day, but sometimes that John Bullism which makes a man eat plum pudding and drink bottled stoutfor hisdinneron Christmas Day will induce him to take up the spade, or go to the plough, or saddle up his horse in the middle of the day. However, if men are so foolish as to do that they will have to take the consequences. I have seen men go down during the last 40 years not by the score, but by the hundred, simply because they were foolish enough to ignore the natural conditions of life in the tropics, and to take food, and wear clothing unsuitable to the climate. What is my position here to-night as a representative in this Commonwealth Parliament? I have told the House that I informed the electors whom I have the honour to represent that I was going to retain Kanaka labour if possible for ten years. Now, of what is my electorate composed % As the honourable member for Kennedy knows, it comprises five or six State electoratesFortitude Valley, entirely a labour constituency, and returning at present to the State Legislature two labour members ; Brisbane itself, that is the metropolis, returning myself and the Honourable E. B. Forrest; Enog-gera and Toowong, labour constituencies; and Toombul. Every financier, every representative of the banks and public companies, who represent interests all over' the country, whether in mining, sugar planting, sugar milling, or dairy farming, storekeepers, or drapers, told me that I had made a mistake in proposing to do away with the Kanaka so soon. I said, however, that I desired to know what was the real feeling of the most important constituency in Queensland, and whether the electors desired that the Kanaka should live for ten years, or be guillotined at once. The consequence was that throughout the whole of that democratic constituency, none is more democratic in Australia, I had a majority. I had to fight a threecornered fight, and labour was staggered at the result. The other candidate weptlabour killed him, while he thought it would k ill me. I , however, killed both my opponents, and I have come here to preserve the Kanaka as long as I possibly can, in the interests of common justice and in the interests of humanity. I have received a letter from a representative man in Queensland, who saysThere would have been no federation for us if we had known they meant to treat us like this. Another writer saysThere is a feeling of consternation throughout the State regarding this drastic measure, which means, if passed, the extinction of the sugar industry in Queensland. The honourable member for Maranoa said the Kanaka, is the curse of Queensland, and with the honourable member it was always "" curse,"" "" curse,"" "" curse."" I tried to remember where I had heard the word ""curse"" before, and I found out. It occurs in a passage which applies to the Prime Minister, to the press, and to the people of a large part of Australia. It reads as follows :The curse of the scanty knowledge, That fancies it is great, And Hatters fools with the notion That they can rule the State. The curse of scanty knowledge is what we have to face now. We are attempting to legislate upon a topic upon which there is the curse of this scanty knowledge. By all means let us have this Royal commission that has been spoken of. The Prime Minister has lost a grand chance in not giving us a commission to inquire into this question. The matter would not be hung up. We should not accept the conclusions of Dr. Maxwell, who is comparatively a new chum. He is an expert, but an expert from another climate, and I quite agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that there is a great deal of difference between the climate of Northern Queensland and those of other parts of the earth where sugar is grown. Dr. Maxwell has yet a great deal to learn of Queensland, and we who are practically natives of that State know that in the minimum for the Kanaka. that before he did. 1 have kept faith with",53,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And

But from that time onward -and I was very intimate with the circumstances of that case, because I was a member of the Cabinet at the time-w e did everything in our power to eliminate all the evils which we could discover, and to punish the transgressors. We succeeded. We established a limitation of labour for the Polynesians, saw to their comfort, and insisted that they should have medical superintendence and inspectors. What is the result to-day? I am as anxious as the honourable member for Maranoa that white labour should be employed all over Australia. But we ought not to deal with the Kanaka traffic to-day as though the evils which existed 25 years ago in connection with it still exist. The conditions are altogether changed. No harm can possibly come, and good will undoubtedly result from allowing the Pacific Island labourers to he retained for a reasonable term of years.

I am perfectly satisfied that one important authority is watching this debate, namely, the money market of London. Queensland loan' had been postponed tilli this B ill had received the treatment which, it is apparently about to receive, it would have made a vast difference to that State's finances. I wish to point out that a large-, amount of New South Wales and Victorian capital is invested in the Queensland sugar industry. An enormous amount is also in vested in the shipping on our coasts, from. Melbourne right round to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The maintenance of that shipping communication is dependent primarily upon the sugar product. Therefore I say that we ought not to disturb the presentlabour conditions for a reasonable period. A t the end of that period we can see howmany white men will rush in to do the work of the Polynesian labourer. it not been alleged that the white man can do the work as cheaply as can the Kanaka plus the duty? I heard every speech which the Prime Minister delivered in Queensland, and I also made it my business, to hear the leader of the Opposition. I am bound to say that the best speech, from the sugar planter's point of view, having regard to a possible remedy for Kanaka labour, was delivered by the leader of the Opposition at Toowoomba. The right honourable and learned member was asked what substitute the planters were to have for blacklabour. He said that, as in the back blocks we had produced a type of man short or long, thick or lean,' who is called the bushman, so he believed that in the years to come the white race would produce a man fitted to undertake the work of sugar-growing in any part of this continent. What is the inference ? We cannot What does the produce this type of man in five minutes or five days. The right honourable and learned member was cheered. Where was the lesson which his remark conveyed ? Doubtless he meant that the vista was in the future. Perhaps we shall get in 33 years a generation of men who will be able to do the work which is now performed by the Kanakas. But I ask only for the right to retain the services of the Kanakas for ten years.

He was not at first imported for the mere trashing and cutting of cane, to which employment he is now limited by law. A t the present time he cannot drive a horse and cart or an engine, or throw a piece of timber into a furnace, without rendering his employer liable to a penalty. But he has performed good service under the management and enterprise of some of the best men who have ever lived in Australia. Most of these men are now dead. They were determined to make the sugar industry a successful one, and many of them were ruined financially in the attempt. I have in my mind five men in Melbourne who have lost tens of thousands of pounds in their endeavour to make this industry a success, plus the Kanaka. The Kanaka has not been injured in any way. He dresses as well as some of the mashers whom one sees about our towns. They carry silver-mounted canes, wear straw hats, have savings -bank accounts, and smoke cigars. ride bicycles. That represents the disgrace to our civilization which we have created by raising these blacks up to this standard.

I took great interest in that election, and the honourable member for Darling Downs knows very well that my sympathies were always with him.

This combination of the lawyers and labour is calculated to bring about a Commonwealth cataclysm.

It is sometimes said that I am a lawyer myself, but I am afraid that, if I were to declare myself as such, I would never make a living in the profession. Labour and law are applying the lash to the best State of the group. New South Wales has lost 35,000,000 of sheep, and Queensland has lost 16,000,000 or 17,000,000, during the drought. All the trade of supplying the people engaged in the pastoral industry has been lost, and the railway revenue has decreased from 3£ per cent, to 1£ per cent.; and now that Queensland is down, it is desired to strangle the only remaining great agricultural industry she has left. K ill the State which is the brightest of the lot -that is the sentiment. Men in Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne are crying out for the introduction into the Cabinet of common-sense and commercial experience, and the diminution of the legal influence there, because the domination of law and labour is bringing a curse on one of tlie finest States in the group.

Afte r the many speeches which have been made, I feel great difliculty in finding anything new to say on the Bill. I do not think I should have spoken had it not been for the fact that I think it necessary we should, as far as we are able, place the true facts of this particular industry, in all its ramifications, before the people of Australia. Like others, I think that the possibilities of Queensland are probably greater than those of any one of the States which now form the Commonwealth. Western Australia has magnificent mineral resources; but I think the mineral resources of Queensland are even greater. The large area of tropical and sub-tropical agricultural lands, together with her enormous pastoral lands, places Queensland in the first place on the Australian continent. Her pastoral lands are not stocked up to nearly their full capacity, and the time is not far distant when Queensland, if it has not the largest population of the group, will be one of the greatest producing States in the Commonwealth. I do not wish the House to think for a moment that I have any practical knowledge or experience of the sugar industry, but though I never worked in the industry, I claim, like other men who have taken part in public life, to have as keen an interest in it as any man in Queensland. I have had the opportunity of going through quite a number of the sugar districts from time to time. Long before I got into Parliament, I was engaged, along with others, in an agitation against the employment of Kanakas in the sugar industiy, and it was only natural that when I obtained a seat in the legislature, I should make keen observation of what was going on in that industry. I make this statement because I do not wish anybody to believe that I am speaking w i th any practical knowledge or personal experience of this business. I claim, however, that I have a very fair idea of the desires of the that an industryinwhich there is £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 invested is a vast one. An To say that industry which turns out produce worth 15,000,000 £1,500,000 every year is one of great value to the States. But I have taken up the position that it would be far better, in the inI hope will not be taken terestsof Australia, that the tropical lands of Australia should revert to their virgin state than that we should continue to cultivate them with the aid of coloured aliens.

176,,"Mr MACDONALD PATERSONwould much rather see the magnificent mineral resources, which we know exist in the northern portions of the State, go, than have a colour line drawn across the continent. I hope that a colour line will never be drawn across Australia. From time to time efforts have been made by interested parties here and in England to have such a line drawn, and we have had gentlemen occupying high and responsible positions here advocating that course. My opinion is, that if once such a line be drawn, there is no power in the southern portions of Australia which would be great enough to keep the coloured aliens to the north, of it . Many statements have been made in regard to the killing of this industry. I will deal with those statements later on. Before doing so, I must compliment the Prime Minister on the very clear and lucid way in which he laid before the House the various opinions expressed by statesmen of Queensland, relative to this industry, and on his effort to show that tlie employment of the Kanaka was resorted to purely as a temporary expedient. The right honourable gentleman might have emphasised that fact even more strongly from the speeches that he quoted, and from what is known now in Queensland, as the famous manifesto issued by Sir Samuel Walker Griffith in 1892, when legislation for the rein trod uction of the Kanaka took place. Sir Samuel Walker Griffith distinctly stated in that manifesto that the return of the Kanaka to Queenslend would be only temporary, that he did not wish the people to believe for one moment that his opinions concerning the employment of the Kanaka in the sugar industry had changed. He went on to say that the proposal was made really in order to tide over a temporary depression which had arisen at that period. That depression, however, was not due, as many would have us believe, to the stop put to the employment of Kanakas in the sugar fields of Queensland. It was a world-wide depression. It did not start in Australia, but at the other end of the world, and it only reached a climax in Australia in 1893. It existed in Queensland from about 1889 until the final catastrophe attending the closing of the financial institutions in 1893. The difliculty in regard to the sugar industry prior to that was not that there were insufficient Kanakas on the fields. It is well known that from 1890 to 1893 there were thousands of Kanakas unemployed at Bundaberg and at the coastal towns where large sugar operations are carried on. Therefore the statement made from time to time that the depression in the industry at that period was due to the withdrawal of Kanakas is not in accordance with facts. The true cause of the trouble was that the sugar industry was largely over-capitalized ; that a number of people had taken up large areas of land ; that from time to time they had erected expensive machinery, a large portion of which had become obsolete ; and that they were paying from 8 to as high as 12 per cent., in some instances, on the money borrowed. When we take into consideration that at that time the earning power of capital throughout Queensland was only about 6 2-which , by the way, was somewhere about 2 per cent, above its earning capacity in the other Statesit must be seen that only an industry of an exceptional character could have withstood such a heavy strain. That was the real 3 cause of tlie difliculty at that juncture. The depression was used as an argument to show that it was absolutely necessary to reintroduce the Kanaka. So far as the treatment of the Kanaka is concerned, I do not wish to say that in all cases he is used badly. I know of many cases in which he is ill-treated; but I do not wish to say that, because a number of unscrupulous employers use the Kanakas in that way, all engaged in the industry do the same. There is a great deal of truth, however, in what has been said about the ill-treatment of these men. We have only to look at the early history of the introduction of Kanakas into Queensland to know that is so. What could be more disgraceful and better calculated to bring dishonour on any State than the incidents which took place in the early stages of their introduction into Queensland ? The commission which inquired into the matter distinctly stated that at the outset of the traffic most of these islanders were kidnapped. Even as late as 1894, a case was tried in Queensland in which a number of islanders were said to have beenkidnapped in connection with a boat called the William Manson. It is generally believed that even at the present tune, a large number of the Kanakas brought to Queensland are kidnapped. It is said by many of those who have taken an interest in this matter -and especially by missionaries who have lived on the island that in spite of strict regulations many of the Kanakas brought to are practically kidnapped. Thati n itself is another reason why we should put a stop to this traffic. It may well be asked why we bring these men to Australia. Isi t not, as some would have us believe, purely from philanthropic motives that they are introduced 1 In my opinion it is not. MrO ' MALLEY Christianize them. brought here neither to be Christianized nor to be benefited in any other way. He is brought here purely for the benefit of those who employ him, because economically he is cheaper than the white man, and a greater profit can be made out of him. Another matter which we have to take into consideration is the fact that out of some 50,000 or 60,000 of these unfortunate people who have been brought to Queensland, some 10,000 or 12,000 have died. Questions have been raised as to where those who died during the early stages of the movement were buried. Many have said that their bodies were used to manure the cane fields of Queensland. I am quoting merely the statements of others. I am not speaking from personal knowledge. I do not say that this has been done in all cases, but it is said that in a large number of instances the bodies were used for the purpose I have indicated. The planters themselves are responsible by their boasts for a. great many reports concerning the treatment of Kanakas. Reference has been made to the death-rate. I will say no more on that point than that it is a well known fact that the new-chum kanakawho has never been in Queensland beforedies off at a rate that is abnormally high. the death-rate has gone up as high as 150 per 1,000; but in the early history of the traffic it reached 180 per 1,000. That the Kanaka should be allowed to come here under such circumstances is an act of cruelty on the part of a civilized community. There are many matters that I should like to refer to in relation to the moral aspect of this question. The honourable member for Maranoa drew a very graphic and vivid picture of the deplorable condition of these people in certain parts of Queensland. He also gave us pathetic details of the statement made by the Hon. Charles Powers, at one time a Minister of the Crowni n Queensland Queensland, concerning the moral aspect of the Kanaka question. There are just one or two extracts upon this aspect of the question which I should like to read. I propose to read them, not for the sake of having them published, but because I think that on an occasion like this it is absolutely necessary that we should have all the facts before us. It is done in order to Considering the agitation that is going on in Queensland at the present time, and the The Kanaka is efforts that are being made by certain interested parties to smother up the real facts, I think it is desirable that the country, and those who have to legislate upon this matter, should possess the fullest knowledge on this subject. In such circumstances, I am not going to .make any apology for taking up the time of the Housei n reading these extracts. Mr O'MALLEY -There is no provision in our Constitution for either black or white slavery. MrM c DONALD I have a pamphlet here, written by the Rev. William Gray, who was stationed as a missionary on one of the islands from which a large number of Kanakas came to Queensland. I certainly think he should be some authority on tliis question. He has not only given us the result of his experiences on the islands, but the result of his investigations in Queensland. When the opportunity offered, he came to Queensland, and made the fullest investigation of the unfortunate condition of these men. BeforeI quote from his pamphlet, I would remind the House that the Kanakas are in the prime of life when brought here. Their ages range from 16 to 30 years, and to my mind it is one of the worse features of the whole traffic that a large number of these men in the very prime of life It has been said to-night that are imported, but that few of the women of their race are brought with them. It is only natural to suppose that the Kanaka will fall into the various vices into which he may be led by the white races more readily than if he were in his island home. The Rev. Mr Gray saysThe immorality takes place in the Chinese dens, where immoral white women are provided by the Chinese shopkeepers. Some features of this part this afternoon of the Kanaka's life abroad are more revolting than anything of island life that has come to my knowledge. Further, I would like to say that the Kanaka is not a citizen of the class we",58,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And
177,Mr Mcdonald,"--should particularly care to have amongst us. ""We have been told to-night that the .Kanaka is a nice, docile, amenable creature, who will not interfere with anybody. Yesterday we had a telegram from Mackay -published in one of the newspapers, contra-dicting many of the statements made concerning the Kanaka, and also stating that Jie was a very desirable citizen. On looking at the Brisbane Courier, a newspaper which is now advocating the retention of the Kanaka, I find the following headings :"" Riot at Rockhampton-Kanakas and Salvation Army-Polic e and others wounded -15 0 Kanakas engaged-Children violently :assaulted."" I am not going to read the -details of this matter, because I do not think it is necessary. That was published in 1895. The Observer, the evening newspaper published from the Cowier office, made some very strong comments upon the occurrence, and urged that drastic measures .should be taken to prevent the Kanakas from going about in the way they were then allowed to do. The Daily Telegraph, -another influential Brisbane newspaper, referred to the matter in very strong language, -and, above all, the municipality of Mackay passed certain resolutions, winch, I think, it is desirable should be placed on record, -more especially when we take into consideration the telegram I have just referred to. 'This telegram statesA largely attended special meeting of the -Chamber of Commerce, at Mackay, has passed resolutions to tlie effect that the continued introprime of manhood away from home, and duction of Polynesian labour in connection with ""the sugar industry, subject to tbe restrictions of -the Queensland laws, did not involve social, -moral, or other dangers to the Commonwealth. Now we shall see what the Mackay municipality sa3s oil the matter. The report f :saysAt a public meeting held in tbe School of Arts, Mackay, on loth August, the Mayor presiding, *he following resolutions were passed-(1 ) Thati n the opinion of this meeting, in view of the murderous outrages recently committed by Kanakas, the time has arrived when the Government should be called upon to take the necessary ssteps to prevent such dastardly attacks on the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. There are two more resolutions which go on -to say that the Government should enforce the law relating to the carrying of firearms, -and that they should also compel Kanakas -to be in their homes by a certain time at oaight. I wish to refer to another incident in connection with this aspect of the matter which occurred at Cairns not such a very long time ago. There -were a large number of Japanese women in Cairns who were trading upon their charms. Some of the inhabitants thought that they were undesirable, and petitioned the municipal council to have them removed. A special meeting of the council was called, and on the casting vote of the mayor, it was decided that these undesirable women should re main in that town. When subsequently asked for an explanation, the mayor and aldermen who had voted for the retention of these women, said that if they were to be done away with, the wives and daughters of the townspeople would not be safe. When we find men in responsible positions prepared to allow women of undesirable character to remain in their midst in order to satisfy the lusts of these semi-savages, I think it is about time that we made an effort to rid the country of such a curse. The honourable member for Maranoa was quite right in saying that the Kanakas are a curse. From a moral point of view, it is desirable to get rid of these people at the earliest possible moment. WhilstI have thus been speaking in condemnation of the Kanaka, I realize that I should be doing him an injustice if I did not say one or two words in his defence. I have done it before on the platform, and I shall always do so. I think that tlie Kanaka in his island home is just as good as any of us. His moral life there is just as good as ours here, but when we civilize these people, and take those in bring them here without their women, we can expect nothing else than that they will commit outrages. The fault lies with those who are responsible for bringing the Kanakas here. In his island home the Kanaka is in fairly comfortable circumstances, and he has his own plot of land and his own household arrangements to look after. It has been said that if the Kanaka was not very well treated, and the conditions were not agreeable in Queensland, there would not be such a large number of islanders re-engaging for service, and coming back to Queensland. It must be considered, however, that the Kanaka, before leaving his home in the first instance, had certain tribal and communal rights. On going away he loses these rights, and on returning, probably finds his relatives are dead or dispersed, and having no longer any tribal rights, he has no interest in his old home, and is practically a stranger. Under these circumstances he is willing to engage to go back to Queensland. There is no doubt that the climatic conditions in Queensland are not suitable to the Kanaka. That has been proved again and again by the enormous death rate amongst the islanders. On the moral ground and on the ground of humanity, and in the interests of the Kanaka himself and of the community generally, it is a good thing that such legislation as is now proposed by the Government should come into force as early as possible. I do not want to go into the past history of this matter at any length. I have my own opinions as to why Sir Samuel Griffith changed his opinion in 1892. opinion very much. that he changed his opinion. He said that he had not altered his opinion, but was only acting as a matter of expediency. I have my own view as to why that Kanaka legislation was introduced into Queensland in 1892, and any one who takes an interest in the political history of Queensland will agree with me that that session of 1892 was one of the most discreditable in the records of the Parliament. In 1888, when the Parliament was returned, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith said that he was not going to be kept out of Parliament on the score of the land grant railways. He promised the electors that he would not be the means of introducing land grant railways during his term of office, and said that if he did he would be scouted from one end of the colony to the other as a public liar. Sir Samuel Griffith distinctly stated that the question of black labour-and this was also emphasized by Sir Thomas Mcllwraith-wa s settled for all time. But what do we find-that without consulting the electors in any shape or form, Sir Samuel Griffith, in order to obtain power, was prepared to form a coalition with Sir Thomas Mcllwraith. Land grant railway measures were introduced, and Kanaka. . legislation was re-introduced, and immediately afterwards, when Sir Hugh Nelson, the leader of the Opposition, introduced a Bill giving another £1,000 a year to the Chief Justice, Sir Charles Lilley was, through the action of the Government, compelled to resign, and Sir Samuel Griffith took his place. circumstances I do not think was any great credit attaching to those who were mixed up in that legislation. That is how it was that this legislation for the re-introduction of the Kanaka took placeThe influence of big financial institutionswas very strong, and it was because of their strength at that particular period, and their connection with the sugar industry,, that the Bill was introduced. depression 1 commenced about 1890, hutthat was only one of the causes. To me it was a surprising thing; that Sir Samuel Griffith-the gentleman with the keen and powerful intellect,, who had written that famous pamphlet,. "" Wealth and Want,"" which pronounced him to have the greatest economical knowledge of social conditions in Australia at that time, and probably at the present time -wa s prepared to renounce the whole of these principles owing to certain pressure which was brought to bear upon him. Passing away from that, we come to the assertion, which has been made from time to time, that, the white man cannot do the work in the cane-fields. When we attempt to find out what is the particular work which the white man cannot do, it isnarrowed down to two operations in the cane-fields. Even the strongest advocates, for the retention of the Kanaka narrow themselves down to only two operations which they say the white man cannot do. What are they 1 One is the cutting of cane, and the other the trashing of cane. So far as the cutting of cane is concerned, they are notvery strong on that argument; they generally fall back on the other argument as to the trashing of the cane. No one will argue for a moment that the cutting of caneis such work as cannot be performed by any white man. It is done in an open faceThe man who works in a railway cutting,, with a tropical sun over his head, and without the supply of air which is generally very refreshing in the warmer climates, is workingunder conditions more laborious, and more: calculated to enervate him, than he is ever likely to do in cutting cane in an open face. But they will not keep to thatground;. they back down and come to the question of the trashing of cane. That operation is. done in the cooler portions of the year. It is. done anywhere from May up toabout August, Under those when the climate in Queensland is thethere most delightful to he had in Australia. On this question we should have the fullest information. When yon speak to those who are practically interested in the industry,.",60,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And

180,Mr Isaacs,Was it not also a time of,62,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And
181,Mr Mcdonald,"Yes. The depressionthey state that cane trashing, in nine cases out of ten, is not necessary; it is less necessary in the tropics than it would be in the sub-tropics. Wherever the atmosphere is dry, there is not so much need for the trashing of cane as where it is moist. I propose to allow a gentleman who is interested in the industry to explain the matter in his own way. In an interview with a reporter a farmer said :Trashing is work which is being continually pointed to as not being fit for white labour, but as a matter of fact it is work which in nine cases out of ten need not be done at all; and even if it had to be done it is best done iu the cool weather. Again, when trashing is carried out it is invariably performed after the wet season, when the. weather is cool. On some plantations where there is plenty of black labour it is generally very hard to find work for the boys during the rainy season, so they are put trashing cane if there is any fit to trash. In reading the report of the two Royal commissions on the sugar industry, 1S85, I find that many managers state that trashing cane is of little, if any, benefit. I have heard Mr the Kanaka is more under control, and if I may McCulloch, a Government inspector of Central Mills, say that trashing is unnecessary. I have asked one of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's managers if trashing was of any benefit. His answer was that in a dry climate like that of Cairns he considered it of no advantage, aud we know that Cairns, next to Geraldton, has the wettest climate in Queensland. Further, I have been through the Mackay district on two occasions at crushing time, and I did not see any cane that was trashed. However, if trashing were necessary the proper months to do it are April, May, and June, when we have cool weather, and white men can do it as well as black. I have seen little girls trashing cane, and it did not hurt them. That, I think, is very clear on the point that a white man cannot do the work. Here we have conclusive evidence from those who have worked in the industryand I could quote a dozen similar instances if I desired-to show that it can be done by the white man. When you meet the friends of the Kanaka on this ground, they will meet you with the argument that the white man is unreliable, that he is a unionist, that wild agitators go round and get him to strike for better conditions, and further, that he is lazy. On behalf of the workers of the north-and I think I can speak for the whole of QueenslandI deny those allegations. I deny that the white man is lazy. I deny that he is a loafer or a drunkard The white workers of Queensland are just as honest, steady, straightforward, and willing to perform the necessary work which is required of them as are any men in any part of the civilized world. I hope that we shall not continually hear these insulting remarks about the unreliableness of the workers of Queensland orof any other part of Australia. It appears, to me that a large number of planters and others who are interested in the sugar industry, in their wild excitement for the= retention of the Kanaka, are prepared tohurl insults at every person exceptthose whom they desire to have employed.. The report of Dr. Maxwell proves as clearly as anything can do that the white man is. just as capable, putting it even on thatlow level, as the Kanaka to work in the: cane-fields. He shows that the Kanaka has only worked two or three hours more per year than the white man has done. When we take into consideration that the Kanaka, is not in the same position of indejDendenceas the white man, is it any wonder that hemay have worked two or three hours-' longer in the year 1 That only proves thatuse the term, under the whip of the overseer or employer, than the independent white man is. When we take into consideration, the reliability of the white workers of Queensland, and of Australia generally, in connection with the various industries in. the Commonwealth, they compare very favourably with any other workmen in any part of the world. On our huge wheatfields in some of the States, the wheat has to be taken off within a given time, sometimes within a few days or a week, to prevent a large amount of the crop going towaste or spoiling-bu t the wheat-growers: can depend upon getting a regular and serviceable supply of labour year after year,, as the crops are req uired to be taken off. think the same thing can be done in Queensland. But there has been an attempt in. that State, as Sir Samuel Griffith has said,, to get the white workers to believe that it is degrading to work in its cane-fields. That belief has been largely cultivated by the planters. They have never made any honest attempt to try and get the white workers to work in the industry. For various occupations which require casual labour at particular periods of the year men can always be found. If there is employment to be had at reasonable wa.ges, and under reasonable conditions, the planters will find all the necessary labour to carry on the sugar industry within the State at the present time. But the white worker of Australia is not prepared to accept that work 'Under the same degrading conditions as are ineted out to the Kanaka. He will not work for the same wage as the Kanaka, or under the same degrading conditions. Give the white worker a fair opportunity, good conditions, and a reasonable wage, and all the labour which is required for the sugar industry of Queensland can be obtained within the State without inconvenience to any industry. We all know that throughout tlie Commonwealth there is always a -surplus of labour. A t the present time in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, -and other States, you will find agitation more or less, as the case may be, in connection with the unemployed. labour available within the Commonwealth --and certainly within Queensland-to perform the necessary work in connection with the sugar industry. If the argument is sound which is advanced by a number of those who advocate tlie retention of the Kanaka, and even by Mr Philp himself, that the industry will be ruined if we pass this legislation, because, as they say, the white man cannot possibly do the work, what is the use of them advocating an extension of time? of time, it means that the industry, will be killed in ten years instead of in five if their statement is correct. I deny that. As I have already stated, I believe that a white man can perform this work. I should like to point out that there is no agricultural industry within the Commonwealth which is so profitable as is the sugar industry. In support of this statement, I wish to direct the attention of honourable members to the following table, which has reference to the profit accruing from the cultivation of 50 acres of cane by white labour:Cost of cultivating, say, 25 acres of plant cane the Kanaka labourer shall no longer be emand 25 acres ratoons :To cost of two ploughings, harrowing, and rolling, at £1 10s. per acre' Planting, at £1 an acre Cultivating and weeding, at £2 10s. per acre Ratooning 25 acres, at £1 an acre .... Total cost of 50 acres Prom 25 acres of plant cane, 20 tons per acre, at, say, 9s. per ton ... 225 0 0 From 25 acres ratoons, 16 tons per acre 180 0 0 Gross returns £405 0 0 Less cost of production 150 0 0 £255 0 0 Deduct for wear and tear and contingencies, 10 per cent. 25 10 0 Net profit from 50 acres £229 10 0 If we substitute black labour for white, we find that there would be a saving of 5s. per I think there is acre in the planting of 25 acres, which represents ah amount of £ 6 5s., and a further saving of 10s. per acre in weeding 25 acres, which means a sum of £ 1 2 10s. Thus the total saving by employing Kanaka labour would be £ 1 8 15s. The sugar industry, it is therefore apparent, is a very profitable one. Of course it may be argued that certain individuals have invested in the industry and have lost their money. But people who have either little knowledge or poor methods of management engage in If it is only a matter any business with the result that they frequently go down, whilst the energetic man who thoroughly understands what he is about succeeds. Instances of this are to be found in all industries. It was my intention to have dealt with various statements which have been made by those who advocate the retention of the Kanakas. They have said some very harsh things of those who ire opposed to that traffic. I am not going to question the motives of those who differ from me. I credit them all with a sincere desire to save the sugar industiy. But I wish to point out there is not a member of the labour party who entertains any desire to injure it . We simply wish that ployed in it, because his presence in Australia is not desirable. It would be wise to get rid of him as early as possible. Per£ s. d. sonally, I am of opinion that he should go at once, but I am prepared to waive that opinion and accept the Bil l as it stands. I 37 10 0 25 0 0 think that this measure is a very fair and honest attempt to deal with a difficult prob62 10 0 lem. I recognise the difficulties that exist by reason of the fact that certain legislation has permitted this particular traffic to be 25 0 0 carried on. I should like to see clause 9 amended by the insertion of a minimum fine of £ 2 0 in lieu of the penalty £150 0 0",62,Edward Braddon Kanaka S For Very Few People Were Prosecuted And
182,Mr Mcdonald.,"thercinprescribed which is one ""notexceeding JE100."" That, however, is purely a matter of detail. It has been urged that the representatives of Queensland in this House do not accurately reflect the opinions of that State. I do not claim to reflect the opinions of the whole of Queensland; but I claim to reflect those of the people who sent me here. I was returned to this House with a majority of which any man might he proud. It certainly was the desire of the constituency which I represent a constituency which embraces a very large area in Queensland-that the Kanaka traffic should cease. MrM c DONALD majority of about 1,700. I obtained nearly 5,000 votes, whilst my opponent secured a little over 3,000. The honourable member for Herbert also received a substantial majority. Other honourable members who were returned in the labour interest were returned by very large majorities. I think the honourable member for Brisbane was probably the only successful candidate who dared to advocate the retention of the Kanakas for any considerable time. I wish further to point out that in connection with -the Senate elections every candidate who .advocated black labour was placed at the bottom of tlie poll, whilst those who opposed its continuance, and urged the exclusion of other coloured labourers were returned. It has been, said that Queensland would never have entered the Federation had it been known that such a Bill as this .would ""be introduced. I venture to say that if a poll of Queensland were taken to-morrow, owing to the action of the Government in introducing the Immigration Restriction B ill and the measure which is now under -discussion, there would be a larger majority for federation than there was on the day the referendum was token. I may mention that the labour party itself was divided upon the question of federation. Only six or seven of its members, out of a total of twenty-four, were prepared to go upon tlie -platform and openly advocate federal union. One of the strongest points put before the electors in the State of Queensland, especially in the north, was that, given federation, it would be the means of putting a stop to black labour throughout the State; and it was on that ground that we got such -a magnificent majority as practically carried federation in Queensland. That maj o r it y of S,000 that was obtained, practically from the votes of the people in the north of Queensland, was due to this cause. I certainly feel confident that the action we took on the black labour question during the time of the referendum was a strong incentive to the people of Northern Queensland to vote in favour of coming within the fold of the Commonwealth. Under such circumstances, it was only fair, in the interests of the party, and in the interests of Queensland-especiall y in the interests of the north-that their case should be fairly laid before the people ; and I have no hesitation in saying, for one, that I would rather see the magnificent tropical I was returned by a agricultural and mineral lands of Queensland revert to their former state than see any attempt to develop the northern portion of that State by means of coloured labour. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I intend to support the Bill as it stands. I came to this House pledged to support a Bill of this description. I took up that position at the time of my election, because I believed in the principles of such a measure. AlthoughI do not believe that honourable members come here as delegates, but to a certain extent ought to give utterance to their conscientious views, yet when an honourable member makes a formal declaration on a subject, he is in duty bound to give effect to that opinion by his vote. That is the position which I occupy in this House. I firmly believed in the principles of a Bill similar to this when I was before my constituents, and I have heard no reason for altering that opinion. Consequently, I intend to do all I can to have the Bill passed through Parliament in its present form. It has been argued that this matter is one which should be left to the State Parliament, and that the Federal Parliament should not deal with it , because the subject is one with which it is utterly unacquainted. It has been said by Mr Philp that the Government should have consulted with the Government of Queensland before they dealt with the matter. Buti n my opinion that would have been utterly wrong, and subversive of the principles of federation. When this Parliament was constituted, ful l powers were given to it to deal with this subject, and I hold that it is our duty to deal with the matter in that spirit ; and while having due regard to the interests of persons in the various parts of Australia, we must at the same time pay regard to the national interests of Australia. A t the",64,Returns
183,Mr Fisher,"What were the figures 1time federation was accomplished, it was clearly understood that this subject would be handed over to the Federal Parliament. Let me draw the attention of honourable members to a statement which was made by the late SirJ ames Dickson, when he was dealing with the question of the adoption of federation. These are his wordsThe Queensland Government were too much prejudiced to consider the question fairly. He, for one, would readily accept the verdict of federated Australia on the subject. He wished that to be distinctly understood It was better for the sugar planter that this great question of coloured labour should be settled by federated Australia. He believed it would be done in the interest of the planters ; done more equitably and more conclusively than by the local Parliament. There we have one of the principle advocates of federation stating clearly that in his opinion it would be better for this matter to be dealt with by the Federal Parliament. That is the spirit in which Queensland voted in favour of federation. It entered the Federation in the belief that the Federal Parliament would deal with the question, and it is quite prepared to leave this Parliament to do its duty in the matter. It is not only a question that concerns the Queensland members, but it is one to which attention must he given by the whole Parliament. Each individual member is bound to make himself conversant with the case. It is because the people of Queensland believed that the members of tliis Parliament will do what is right between all parties concerned, that they entered into federation. Then, again, it is stated by Mr Philpi n his protest that in this matter the Government are not carrying out the true opinions of the people of Queensland. It is stated that the question was not properly raised and put before the electors. I submit, with all due deference to Mr planters to place themselves in such a poPhilp, that the matter was properly put before the electors, and I will read a statement made by the Prime Minister himself on the eve of the federal elections in Queensland. could be desired If a further term of years was added on to the term of ten years which expires in 1902, what complaint will those have to make who said ten years was enough for them and had got more ? Let them not make any mistake about the matter. He did not wish for one moment to say that the Federal Government intended to deal in a harsh or destructive way with the sugar industry, for it was like the other great industries-an asset of the Commonwealth. Mr L. E. Groom, It was thus clearly stated by the Prime Minister, when he was in Queensland, that he intended to introduce a measure that would have the effect of preventing, after a certain time, the introduction of Kanaka labour into Queensland. There can be no doubt about that; and it is idle for Mr. Philp, or any one else, to say that they did not expect that the Federal Ministry was going to introduce such a measure as has been brought in. Then Mr Philp says that public opinion in Queensland is against it . AllI can say in answer to that remark is tliis : that at my recent election I took up the same position as I am advocating tonight, and stated that I believed five years to be a fair and reasonable time to allow before prohibition started. I stated then that if the Government adopted that limit the people of Queensland would make no complaint, because that was the period which Queensland herself fixed on a previous occasion. My opponent at that election, although he was undoubtedly backed up by, or had the sympathy of, Mr Philp and his supporters, clearly stated that he also was in favour of the ultimate abolition of Kanaka labour. He first started off with the advocacy of a period of ten years; subsequently during the election campaign he reduced that period to seven, and before the election took place he agreed to advocate five years as the lmiitation. Therefore, as regards the recent election it is quite clear that the electors had firmly made up their minds that the time had come when some limitation should be imposed with regard to the introduction of Kanaka labour. Buti t was never intended to abolish Kanaka labour in the spirit of the destruction of a national industry. The principle which was acted upon was this-that a certain time should be given to allow the sugar sition that this industry might be preserved for the white race in Australia. And that is the proper position-the position that the Government themselves take up. He put the matter as plainly as They do not believe that a large industry like this, which is really one of the great national interests of Australia, should be destroyed by means of any hasty legislation; and it certainly would be to a great extent injured if there was an immediate abolition of coloured labour. But the Governmentbelieve in granting a proper time for theabolition of that labour, in the expectation that at the end of the period named the industry will be placed in a state of prosperity, which will be for the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. It was stated by Mr Philp that Queensland did not expect 4i B ill of this description to be introduecd. But there are authoritative opinions upon that subject, which I will quote' to the House. to the two Rockhampton newspapers, which really represent the whole central portion of the State of Queensland. Rockhampton Bulletin of the 3rd October statedKanaka immigration is to be brought to a close, but five years is to be allowed in order that the industry may adapt itself to the new conditions. This is pretty much what was expected. Some people would have excluded Kanakas from the very passing of the Act, others would have given three years' interval, and othersagain seven vears. We have this leading journal of Queensland I venture to state that these extracts very stating distinctly that the Bill is just what cleary reflect the true opinion of the people is expected. The articles went onMr Philp and his colleagues are furious at the Bill. Buti t must be remembered that Mr Philp The people of Queensland have no desire at and the members of his Government are proall to abolish the sugar industry, but what nounced black labour men, and the time would they do firmly desire is that this industry never come when in their view Kanakas should be shall be carried on by the people of a -excluded. Mr Philp talks of allowing recruiting to go on for seven years, presumably unchecked "" white Australia."" it is impossible, in rein numbers, and then, no doubt, to permit all the viewing this matter, to avoid the historical Kanakas at that date in the country to remain t ill aspect of the question, because from the they left of their own accord or died. This would very inception planters have taken up the give us Kanakas in Queensland for the next position that it is essential to have coloured twenty years. That is Mr Philp's wish, or rather the wish he expresses at the present juncture, for labour of some description. As early as his real wish is that there should he no restriction 1860 an agitation was started in favour of iu the immigration of Kanakas, and that no time the introduction of coolies, and a petition should ever he set when this immigration should was presented by Sir Charles Nicholson, the cease. In this Mr Philp has been quite consistent, but in this he is not only quite out of President of the Legislative Counoil, asking touch with Australian, but also with Queensland the Secretary of State to allow the introopinion. The article clearly states that Mr Philp's of coolies. When this petition was sent protest, about which so much noise has been home the petitioners were informed that they made, is absolutely out of all touch with could have it granted on the same conQueensland opinion. On the 4th October ditions as coolies were introduced into the the Bulletin thus described Mr Philp's Mauritius. The result was that the matter conductThe hysterical action of the Government, and a statute was passed, but the conditions particularly of the Premier, in the Assembly last laid down were so stringent that coolies night would be laughable were it not so deplorably undignified. Then, in conclusion, the newspaper saidMr Philp may rave as much as he pleases in Brisbane, but the men whom the Federal Governwere introduced into Queensland, not for ment will listen to, and whom it is alone enthe purpose of growing sugar, but for the titled to listen to on this question, are the reprepurpose of growing cotton. They were insentatives of Queensland in the Federal Parliatroduced by the Hon. Robert Towns, of ment. The Rockhampton Record, the other leading thing to answer for-and were employed by paper, saidThe racial colour question is invariably provoSea Islanders were afterwards shifted up cative of fiery discussion, and in Australia, judging by present indications, it will hardly be settled without bloodshed. The extreme heat exhibited by Mr Philp since the publication of the Kanaka Bill is most regrettable, and reminds one of the controversy in the United States prior to the abolition of shivery. For on reference to American history it will ""be seen that the arguments used by and on behalf of the Queensland sugar-growers bear a curious resemblance to those I refer honourable members used by United States pro-slavery advocates. Then the newspaper addedThe This condition of affairs maj' possibly account for the philosophic calm with which our local politicians view Mr Barton's Kanaka legislation. A t the same time, there is something like a consensus of public opinion against black labour of any sort, and Mr Barton's proposals, and especially his thoughtful mode of arguing the question, appeal far more to the judgment of the electors than does the hysterical language of his opponents. Let us hope that in his calmer moments Mr, Philp will resolve to abandon his threatened lifeand-death struggle with the Federal authority. of Queensland on this important matter. duction into Queensland of certain.classes r came before the Legislative Assembly, and were not introduced. Then the planters turned their attention to getting labour from another source, and South Sea Islanders Sydney-so that Sydney people have somehim at first to grow cotton. The South north and landed at Townsville. person who really succeeded in growing sugar in Queensland, I understand, was the Hon. Lewis Hope, and he was granted 2,000 acres of land for his good services rendered to the colony. In 1863 regulalations werepassed, known as the Sugar and Coffee Regulations, which enabled land to be taken up at 5s. an acre by lease and selection, for the purpose of growing sugar and coffee. After that a boom started in the sugar industry, and the Kanakas transferred from cotton growing to sugar growing. Subsequently we find the Kanakas were introduced very freely, and the same abuses arose as subsequently. thing was that there were no. statutes to deal with them. In 1871 a case came before the Court of Queensland, and ultimately got to the Full Court. was the case of Regina v. Coalh, known as the Jason case, which is reported in the Queensland Supreme Court second volume. Certain ship-masters had seized a number of Kanakas, and brought them to Queensland, where they set them free. kidnapping, and tlie question was raised whether at common law such an offence had been committed. Sir Charles Lilley at the time was, that instead of doing these Kanakas a wrong, the defendants had done them a benefit, by taking them from a lower state of civilization and setting them at liberty in a higher state of civilization. ever, held that a charge of kidnapping had been made out, and the defendants were sentenced accordingly. After that, it became necessary to have some, statutory on tlie subject, and certain laws were passed having in view the restraining of this traffic. The boom in sugar continued, and large sums of money were invested in the industry, a good deal of which money came from Victoria and other places. But the supply of islanders was becoming limited, and on one occasion a raid was made on New Guinea and adjacent islands. It was in this connection that a Royal commission was appointed to inquire, and it came to the conclusion that out of 400 Kanakas imported not one really understood the nature of the contract-that them to understand the agreement or the labour they were to perform. As a result of that finding, Sir Samuel Griffith introduced a Bill in 1885 to compensate the Mr L. E. Groom. The first employers, because the Government had sent the Kanakas back to the place whence they came, with the exception of about 80 who elected to stay. I mention this incidentally to illustrate how difficult it is to make a Kanaka really understand the nature of the agreement he enters into. In the debate which took place in the Queensland Parliament, a letter was quoted by Mr Black, who always stood as a pro-Kanaka advocate. The Polynesian Inspector, in were 1884, wrote, in connection with certain islanders :In connection with tliis subject. I have also the honour to bring under your notice the constantly The only recurring desertions on the part of labourers recently landed. It is bej'ond doubt that the late arrivals from strange lands have come in here with very imperfect notions of the nature of the work required from them; it is difficult-impossible-to . This convey to an untutored savage precise ideas of the. novel conditions of life that he will be called upon, to encounter on his arrival in this colony; and there is nothing surprising in the spectacle of an Reports, islander who has been used to pass the greaterpart of his time lying under the shade of the nearest rock or tree, exhibiting a tendency to. relapse to his natural mode of life rather than adapt himself to the steady continuous drudgery These masters were charged with enacted from a labourer on a sugar plantation. On the grounds, therefore, of the excessive-, mortality amongst these people, and the frequency of desertions, the result of an absolute ignorance, The argument set up by of the work thej' bind themselves to perform, I would protest. I venture to suggest that very much the same condition of affairs exists at the present time. I do believe that an honest attempt is made to cause these men to understand The Full Court, howthe regulations. We have a clause in the Immigration Restriction Act preventing the introduction of labour under contract, one of the reasons being that even a European enactment himself may not really know tlie conditions, of the labour which he has to perform, and that it is better that he should come-free into tlie country, and enter into his contract afterwards. If that applies to an educated man, it applies with still greater reason to the untutored savage, because he cannot possibly understand the conditions underwhich he is to perforin his contract. A t . the general election of 1883 it was decided, by a very large majority that the Government should provide at the earliest possible, date for the complete cessation of this, traffic. Accordingly Sir Samuel Griffith: it was utterly impossible for introduced his Act ; the Coolie Immigration Act was repealed, and the time within, which Polynesian labourers might come intothe country was limited. During 1886, 1887, and 1888, continual agitation went on. in the colony. Although Queensland as a whole acccepted the principle that this labour should cease, the planters refused to do so. The planters kept up their agitation in the belief that they would ultimately gain their point, and compel the Parliament of the day to go back on its action, and allow them to freely introduce Kanaka labour into the country. The Government of the day made an honest effort to secure more white labour for the industry, but the planters themselves took up a very stong position. They sent out emissaries to different places to get up an agitation with the object of counteracting the work of the Government. Their action was thus described by Sir Samuel Griffith in a speech made in the Queensland Legislative Assemblyi n 1889, and reported at page 170 of HansardWhat did the planters do? I speak of them collectively. Instead of trying to do anything to take advantage of the facilities the Government were to offer them, they set themselves deliberately to work-to spite the Government I suppose-to prevent any labour being obtained from Europe, by causing statements to be made throughout various conti nental countries, representing that the labour in Queensland was not fit for Europeans ; that they would be reduced to a condition little better than slavery, and warning them on no acreport of the commission, and that is that the recount to come to Queensland. That clearly was tlie attitude they took up. occupation, and only fit for a man with a black It was one of rank hostility to the measure. skin. But the greatest objection is that, accordDuring 1886-7-8 they continued to agitate to the spirit of our Constitution, every man in for the repeal of this statute. They said this colony is equal, and is entitled to a share in they wanted an extension of the time, but mental objection. If we intend in Australia to in reality what they were fighting for was govern on the principle that we shall be a free unlimited power to introduce coloured community, and an English-speakinEr race, we labour into Australia. In 1888 Sir Samuel cannot afford to admit men of an alien race Griffith emphasized bis objection to the privilege oi having a share in the governing of the introduction of Kanakas to the country, country. Those are the reasons which are, I and Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, when twitted think, conclusive in the minds of the people of at the time with the statement that this colony against black labour, and I am sure he was in favour of the introduction they of coolies and Kanakas into Queensland, In 1892, when he issued his famous maniwrote a letter to the pressI believe it is festo, he reiterated these views. He did to be found in the columns of the Brisbane not go back one iota upon the objections, Courier-in which he gave practically a which he considered were absolutely conguarantee that as long as he was in power clusive against the re-introduction of the he would he no party to-any alteration of Kanaka into Queensland. the existing conditions. He published that which he stated were as follows :statement throughout the land in order to counteract the influences which were at work in favour of his opponent, Sir Samuel absentees, and worked by gang labour, and so Griffith. As soon as the Coalition Ministry discouraged actual settlement by small fanners was formed in 1892, both Sir Thomas working for themselves. Mcllwraith and Sir Samuel Griffith went back completely upon the promises they had worthy of the white races. given to the electors, and they were instrumental in passing the legislation with which, we have to deal to-day. A t the time a very strong protest was made. They were asked why they did not go to tlie country and allow the people to decide, and a word of warning was uttered that if an extension of ten years was granted the problem would be ten times more difficult to solve at the end of that period. That proved to be perfectly true. Money was invested in the industry;, a large number of persons became interested in these various concerns, and vested interests had to be considered. These interests have been at work throughout the States with the object of securing the continuance of this traffic which I believe Parliament will say shall cease. When Sir Samuel Griffith gave his opinion on this matter he set forth the reasons which really actuated him and which really were the opinions held by the electors in regard to coloured labour. In 1889, during the debate which took place in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, in connection with the Royal commission, he made this statement, which is to be found at page. 171 of Hansard for 1S89There is another thing which is manifest in the. sult of this black labour is to lower the dignity and reputation of labour.

These were the remedies suggested by the planters themselves to the commission, some of which were recommended by the commission as being calculated to put the sugar industry upon a sound financial basis. However, at that time Parliament deliberately decided not to take any steps in the matter, and the whole subject was allowed to stand over until the year 1892. Now we have to face the question, and ask ourselves what is the present condition of the industiy, and what remedies we are going to suggest to put it upon such a footing that it can be carried on under the conditions of a white Australia. We are all ready to admit that there are very large sums of money invested in this industry, and that a great many people are dependent upon it for their support. We are also prepared to admit that if the industry were abolished, the country itself would suffer considerable loss, but I am inclined to think that the magnitude of the industry affords all the greater reason why we should t i y to give it every assistance by way of bonus, or rebate, by affording it the widest possible market, and by giving it every other encouragement within our power. The objections urged against the Bill are these : In the first place, it is stated that we are really legislating against nature; and that the country is divided into two parts, and that in the tropical , country we must always have coloured labour, or otherwise we shall never be able to continue the production of sugar. It is contended, in the second place, that whilst the white man can do the work, white labour is unreliable, and that we shall destroy the industry unless we make full provision for obtaining reliable workers. The position is most strongly put in a paper which was read in London by Miss Shaw, who saysThis brings us at once face to face with one of the problems in the solution of which the statesmanship of tropical Australia is likely to be forced to differ from that of temperate Australia. The business of the politician of temperate Australia will be to regulate the working of a Constitution based upon universal suffrage, in which every member of the community, women probably as well as men, will exercise the rights and responsibilities of self-government. The business of the politician of tropical Australia will, on the contrary, in all probability, be to find means by which the affairs o£ a large servile population may be justly administered by a relatively small and consequently aristocratic body of white men. In fact, the place of servile races iu the world is one of the big questions of future history whioh temperate Australia may refuse to consider, but in which tropical Australia must join with Africa, Asia, and America in finding an answer. 17 o This lady puts the position veiy clearly, and that is practically the position which the planters themselves take up. They say that white labour cannot possibly do the work, and that therefore we must look upon this northern part of Australia as a countiy f it to be tilled only by the servile races, with the white races as masters over them. That is a proposition that I do not agree to. In the first place a great many of these so-called servile races do not accept that position, but claim that they are entitled to rise to the rank of masters, and they will then claim that they are entitled to have a voice in the affairs of the country. Mr Philp, thePremierof Queensland,himself practically takes up that position, because in his speech in the Queensland House the other night, he saidI t was all veiy well to get up at election time and say that they want to make Queensland a white State. He hoped that that would be so, however-that there would not be more than the small percentage of coloured people which we had at present; but he said that under proper conditions it would not hurt the white people, but would do them good. There were many things we could grow in Queensland if there was a small amount of coloured labour, not only sugar and coffee, but tea. We ought to grow ail the tea for Australia in Queensland, and why should we not do it, and let the people drink it instead of that grown by Chinese or Hindoo labour-wh y not grow it in Queensland with their aid, too ? He really contends that if we are going to have tropical agriculture carried on in Australia we must have it with a percentage of coloured population-that we must have coloured labour in Australia. That is practically the position that is taken up by the planters and by Mr Swayne, who, in a paper read at the recent Bundaberg conference, said :The utter unreliability of white labourers in the tropics, which is often adduced as the cause why the industry cannot be successfully prosecuted, if dependent entirely upon them, is wrongly so termed. It is simply the effect of a cause, the primary reason being the natural repugnance of the men to work under conditions to which they are not constitutionally adapted. Many of the same men who, in the northern cane-fields are a constant source of anxiety and loss to their employers-throug h their habit of knocking off work on the slightest pretext, getting on the spree, falling sick, or clearing out of the district just at the time their services are most required-would , on a southern farm, work contentedly enough ; but they were not intended by nature to work in a sweltering heat, surrounded by tropical vegetation higher than their heads, the work itself generally requiring to be performed in a stooping position. So that, now that the Eederal Parliament comes to deal with this matter we see that the position really taken up by the men who carry on this business is that it must be a permanent condition of the industry for all time that they shall have a limited supply of cheap labour. It is as well for us to know that that is the position they take up. In regard to it, the people of Australia say--"" Carry on the industry if you can, and by white labour, and if you cannot carry it on without the introduction of coloured aliens, it is better that you should not carry it on at all."" I think that is a proper position to take up. I do not think it is necessary to weary the House with other authorities to the same effect. Another position they take up now is as to the unreliability of white labour, and that is practically the position taken up by Sir Samuel Griffith ten years ago. He believed that the labour would become reliable as the industry developed, and he only wanted a certain period for its development, when he believed it could be carried on by white labour. I do not believe that Sir Samuel Griffith ever, at any time, in his heart gave up the belief that Australia should. be settled by white people only. I give Sir Samuel Griffith credit for altering his opinion, because at that time the colony was in great financial straits, and he believed some relief was necessary. he acted conscientiously in the position he took up, and he believed that if they had another ten years for development would be able to deal with the trouble-that it was probable that during that period there might be some labour-saving invention discovered, or that labourers might become more reliable, and there might be less agitation. But with regard to the class of labour really desired for the industry, I do not believe that in his heart Sir Samuel Griffith ever held the views that are practically held by Mr Philp, that one of the conditions for the development of Australia is that there should be permanently in our midst a certain, though it may be a small, percentage of coloured labour. I venture to say that at the bottom of the question of the unreliability of labour is the fact that the wages offered have never been sufficient to make the labour reliable. it is purely a question of wages. That is clearly shown by the opinions expressed by the planters themselves. refer the House to the opinion expressed Mr L. E. Groom. this year in the conference held in Bundadistinctly, berg by a Mr W. C. Miller. He saysA cane fanner deprived of his labour,, and placed at the mercy of an unreasonable labour union, would be absolutely ruined. We can see that what was troubling him was the unreliability of labour, and tlie belief that white labour, properly organized, would demand a reasonable rate of wages, and if the white labourers did not get those wages there might possibly be some social trouble. He then goes on to state what he supposes are the absolute essentials to the carrying on of the sugar industry. He saysSugar planters are, from their experience, satisfied that they cannot profitably work without abundance of low-class, and, above all things, reliable labour. "" Low-class "" and "" reliable"" seem to go hand in hand. As it was when previously attempted, so will it be again if the labour be withheld-the industry will be driven elsewhere, and the State be the loser. When our Queensland Sugar Commission took evidence in 1889 similar opinions were expressed, and I venture to think that the value of the evidence taken by the commission is as great now as it was then. When they took their evidence they were dealing I believe with the natural conditions of the country, and upon that point the evidence they gathered is of considerable value to us in they dealing with the labour question. A t page 82 of the report of the commission it will be found that Mr Smellie gave this evidence on the question of having white labourThen it was not because they could not do the work, but because they thought they were not getting sufficient wages?-That was it. They would not work for less than the ruling wages of the colony, and there is no sugar plantation in the colony that can pay the ruling wages of the colony, and grow sugar at a profit. I have no doubt that sugar can be grown by white labour up to a certain state. But that is not the question to be solved. The question to be solved is whether it can be grown at a profit. Ifi t cannot be grown profitably, and to compete with the world, it must cease to exist. He has clearly shown there that it is purely In other words a question of wages. The implication is that if we could not get standard wages for white labour prevailing in the colony that I particularly labourwould hot be availablefor this purpose. A t page 28 of the report it will be found that a Mr Thomas gives similar evidence, showing that really the question of wages is at tlie back of it Are yon of opinion that, as far as the Fort Douglas district is concerned, tropical agriculture cannot be carried on by a European population I am sure it cannot be done by white labourthat is, at the present rate of wages. We see that both these witnesses clearly state their opinion that the industry could be carried on by white labour, but not at the existing rate of wages. In other words, if there could be some means devised by which the wages could be raised to a higher rate, they seem to contemplate the fact that undoubtedly the industry could be carried on by a white Australia. An argument alleged against it is that the climate is utterly unfit for white people, and that they really cannot exist in this northern country. But on that point. I refer the House to the evidence given by Mr John Trezise, a selector in the colony. It will be found on page 26 of the report of the commissionWhat labour do you employ in cultivation ?Myself and a boy. You can get nothing but Chinese here, and we have souie difficulty in getting them. Practically you work your homestead by yourself and family?-Yes. How does the climate affeGfe your health ?-The climate is very good as far as we are concerned. And j'ou are able to do your work on your farm without any bad effects?-Yes, and my chidren also. From your nine years' experience do you consider this district favorable for a European popumatters have to be taken together. I lation ?-Yes, I do. That is the evidence given in the district in which we are told that Europeans cannot exist. On page 20 it will be found that similar evidence is given by a Mr Walsh, in which he states that Europeans can work in that district. There is this evidence from himDo you think that the cultivation of oranges, lemons, and limes can be carried on by European labour ?-Yes. Profitably ?-Yes ; it is being done now by Montgomerieand Bobbins on theMowbray, about 7 miles from town, and by J. Trezise, who takes oranges to Herberton. He also gives evidence to show that Europeans are clearing the scrub and doing other work of this character in these tropical districts. There are other witnesses to whose evidence I might refer, but I shall refer specially to the evidence of a Mr Cowley, a name very much connected with the industiy. The chairman of the committee elicited this evidence from Mr Cowleyi n the Herberton districtSpeaking generally from your experience as sub-manager for five years and manager for two 17 0 2 and a half years on Gairloch Plantation, do you consider that European labour can be employed profitably in the cane-field to do the work that Kanakas are now doing ?I do not. Do you think that such work is injurious to the health of Europeans ?-ifo . Then why do you think they are not physically capable o£ doing the work that a Kanaka can do ? I think, they are physically capable of doing it, but they, require such high wages that we cannot afford them. I think we can take it as proved beyond a doubt that the European races can thrive in these districts, and can do the work which is required of them. I do not believe they will deteriorate in working in these districts. I think the cry raised is simply a cry raised by the planters because they want to get cheap labour. But, inasmuch as they have had this cheap labour, and sugar is produced by cheap labour in other parts of the world, I do not think we can consistently ask them to growsugar with high-priced white labour, and at the same time throw our markets open to the cheap labour of other parts of the world. It becomes necessary when dealing with this question to look at the other proposals which have been made by the Government. If we want the farmers to grow the sugar with white labour it is necessary to protect them by putting up a fiscal barrier. I believe that is the only way in which we can secure them in their industry. I think that the two believe it will give them all the assistance they require. The reasons which have been alleged, and which I believe are conclusive against the planter's policy are first--the fundamental reason which was given by Sir Samuel Griffithj secondly, the degradation of labour; and, thirdly, that it has a moral side as well. I believe, with reference to the moral side, it is not only the welfare of Australia itself, but the effect of the traffic on the Kanakas that we liave to look to. On this matter various opinions have been expressed, and it has been suggested that we have been doing very good work for the Kanaka in bringing him to Australia. I do not believe for a moment that we ever introduced the Kanaka for his own good. He was introduced merely because we believed that we were going to make money out of him. We wanted to get a cheap reliable low-class labour, and he was introduced for the purpose of supplying that labour, and for no other purpose. We had no regard for his moral condition, otherwise we should have taken care that the married men brought tlieir wives with them. I think we can honestly say that for the last ten years the white people of Queensland have given considerable attention to them. I know that the churches have shown a great deal of careful consideration, and missionary societies have done a great deal to keep the Kanaka from falling into a lower state. A t the same time we cannot suddenly transplant a man from a state of heathendom and hope in a few months to convert him to a state of Christianity. It takes a period of time, and I believe that the process of -education can be best given to the Kanaka an his own country. On this matter I would like to read a letter which was written to -the Sydney Morning Herald, setting out >the sugar-planters' case. Contending that -if you want to grow sugar in Queensland you must have cheap labour, and referring incidentally to the effect of the traffic on -the islands themselves, the writer saysTlie islands from which these natives are recruited are fast being depopulated, and only in a .minor degree by emigration to Australia, though this has certainly assisted in the general result. In the New Hebrides, from which nearly all the Kanakas employed on the Queensland plantations are recruited, this is especially the case. On one island of that group, Aneiteum, where a few years ago the population was between 4,000 and 5,000, it now numbers something like 3,000, and is declining. The Island Of Malo, in a few years, will be without an inhabitant. Disease has swept .off vast numbers in every island, and the birth rate has rapidly declined. As with the Australian aborigine, so it is with the Kanaka. When the white man comes, he goes. The problem, so far as he is concerned, is settling itself, and that without the aid of legislation. The South Sea Islander will soon cease to contribute his share to the vexed question of coloured labour in these -colonies; even his native islands will know him no more. In other words, the contention is that the Kanaka is dying out; that by our contact with him we are practically killing him or wiping him out of existence. The writer goes on to saySo we see that not only is there no danger of the Kanaka establishing himself on a permanent footing in Australia, but that it is necessary that the Queensland planter should speedily look to some other source for his labour. When they take up the position that there should be a further extension granted, the question which we may very reasonably ask the planters is-"" When the Kanaka is wiped out, as you say he really is by reason of his contact with tlie white adjourned. Mr L. E. Groom. race, what races are you going to get in order to carry on your industry 1 If you say that cheap labour is an essential condition, what races are you going to have 1"" The only answer which they can possibly give is that they hope at some future time to get Asiatic labour, or perhaps African. When you come to the root of the question you see that they are advocating this extension of time only as a sort of stopgap. Just as in the early days they advocated it as a stop-gap in the hope that they were going to get coolies, so now they are asking for an additional extension, in the firm belief that in the future Parliament will repeal the statutes, and allow the free introduction of coloured labour from all sources. I do not believe that that is the sentiment of Australia, or the sentiment of Queensland. I believe that the true sentiment of Australia is expressed in the opinion which was given by the Prime Minister when he visited Queensland, and which is really registered in the Bill before the House. I can see no reason why we should grant an extension. We are told that we should grant a further extension so as to give more justice. The argument, if carried to its extreme, would be to give them an infinite extension, and thus do infinite justice. We have to approach the matter impartially and carefully. We have to look at both sides, and, while trying to prevent suffering on the part of the Kanaka, we have to take every care to see that we do not cause suffering to our own people. In other words, it becomes a question of compromise. I think the Prime Minister has made a very happy compromise in his proposals. He has given ample time to the planter to accustom himself to the conditions of a white Australia, and I tliink he has laid down the conditions by which we may really get a permanent establishment of the industry in Australia, and that is by his fiscal proposals. I do not see how we can separate them. I believe that if the House carries this Bill, it must also, to complete the measure of justice, carry the other proposal. I shall do all I can to assist the right honourable gentleman in that object, because I believe that in so doing we are giving justice to both parties, and are acting impartially and fairly, of.time and at the same time carrying out the national sentiment of the Commonwealth.",65,Returns
