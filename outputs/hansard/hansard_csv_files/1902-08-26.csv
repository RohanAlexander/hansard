Ordered to be printed. Correspondence with tbe Promierof New South Wales with regard to the Federal Electoral Bill. 43 o z seems to be a general desire on the part of honourable members to know what work remains to be done before the close of the session. I understood from the information previously supplied to us, that no new business except the Estimates was to be introduced, and that the. Judiciary Bill and High Court Procedure Bill were not to be pressed this session. It is desirable that we should have some definite idea as to what remains to be done in order that we may make our arrangements for some little time ahead. We recognise, of course, that the business will depend to some extent upon the work done in another Chamber, but, independently of that, I should like the Acting Prime Minister to give us some assurance regarding the actual work that is expected of us. endeavour to make an authoritative statement after the next Cabinet meeting. So far as I know no measure of importance except those in the business-paper can be proceeded with during this session, but there are one or two purely mechanical measures of a few clauses, chiefly relating to the Treasurer's Budget, with which we shall ask honourable members to deal. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN We shall not be asked to consider the Judiciary BillI members canvassed twice with -a view to ascertain their feeling, and on both occasions have received the assurance that they are not prepared to pass the Judiciary Bill at all, or without very prolonged debate. I shall deeply regret having to consent to the postponement of that measure, but, unfortunately, it may be necessary. I shall make an authoritative statement after the next Cabinet meeting. The Loan Bill is one of the measures that will depend upon the Budget, and it is impossible just now to measures will be proceeded with. MrO ' MALLEY I desire to know whether it will be possible for the Treasurer to deliver his Budget speech early next month, instead of holding it over until October.? know where the honourable member got the",14,Setup

I quite recognise that unless further action is taken, and a further report is obtained during recess, so that the site may be selected by this Parliament, a groat deal 'of money already expended will have been wasted. to know whether the Acting Minister for Defence is prepared to lay on the table the report furnished to him with reference to -the appointment of ten additional drill instructors for the military forces of South Australia ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE the report with me, and I shall lay it upon the table a little later on. attention of the Acting Minister for Defence to a telegram from Adelaide which appeared in to-day's newspapers, and .which reads as follows :The local military forces expected that under federation their pay would be increased so as to bring it up to that in the obher States; but instead, agencral order just issuedannonnces that "" special pay"" will be stopped. Hitherto the men received special pay for guards of honour and other special duties, the buglers and bond men for practising, and non-coms, for giving instructions outside their own company, aud officers for various duties. Under the new regulations a captain who subscribes to the military club will be about 10s. better off than a private, and a lieutenant will be £1 worse. I wish also to direct his attention to the scale of pay of officers and men of the South Australian forces which, I understand, is by tliis regulation reduced' by one-third. A private in the South Australian defence forces receives £ 5 per annum as against £-7 10s. paid to privates in the Victorian defence force. A corporal receives £ 5 5s., as wish to know from against £ 1 0 in Victoria, a sergeant £ 5 10s. compared with £ 11 5s., a lieutenant £G against £ 1 5 , a captain £ 7 10s. as against £ 2 2 10s., a major £ 1 0 contrasted with £30, I desire also to and a lieutenant-colonel £ 1 5 . I have not been able to ascertain the Victorian rate of pay for the last-mentioned grade of officer. The horse allowance in South Australia is £ 4 per annum, whereas in Victoriai t is understood to be £ 3 0 per annum. In view of these facts, I 'ask theMinisteri whether he considers it fair to reduce the rate of pay of the South Australian forces by one-third. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is rather unfair to expect me to answer without notice a question such as the honourable member has submitted. I presume that the present rates of pay in South Australia are the same as prevailed before the defence forces were taken over by the Commonwealth Government. The rates paid in South Australia were lower than those in force in either Victoria or New South Wales; and I think also below those paid in Queensland. If the honourable member will give notice of his question as to the regulation, I shall be glad to furnish him with an answer as soon as possible. quite unaware of the-fact that the pay for I think I have special duties hitherto given to the military forces of South Australia by the State Government, has been disallowed by the ComI wish to direct the monwealth authorities?

Acting Prime Minister if the Government are prepared to be guided by Judge Dashwood's report on the pearl-shelling industry, and if the exemption's already granted with regard to the employment of coloured crews and divers will be made permanent, so that an industry which now yields £25,000 per annum to the State revenue may be preserved? time to read the report of Judge Dashwood, I have not been able to look at the evidence on which it is based. Several of my colleagues are in the same position. When the members of the Ministry have had an opportunity of considering the reports of Judge Dashwood and Mr Warton, and the evidence upon which they are based, I shall be prepared to make a statement to the House. of the Acting Prime Minister been drawn to a statement which appeared in the Argus a few days ago regarding the report of Judge Dashwood, and is it the intention of the Government to issue any more permits? the Argus had reference to the concessions granted by the Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, when the whole matter of the pearl-shelling industry was referred to Judge Dashwood and to Mr Warton. An exemption was given for three months, and this expired about six weeks ago. Since then those exemptions have not been granted, nor is it proposed to grant more. RE-IMPORTATIONS OF WHEAT . the Minister for Trade and Customs proposes to charge duty upon Australian wheat exported and afterwards re-introduced into the Commonwealth ? in tlie Customs Act which permits Australian produce to be re-introduced free of duty, subject to two conditions. I think these are, first, that on export entry shall have been passed, and second, that tlie produce shall be re-introduced within two years of the. date of export. NEW MILITARY APPOINTMENTS. Mr L. E. GROOM -I wish to ask the Acting Minister for Defence whether his attention has been directed to the followI wish to ask the ing statement which appeared in to-day's Age :The work of creating new billets for military men under the Commonwealth Government must have been going forward at a merry pace during the past few months. There are alreadj' more than 300 officers-commissione d and non-commissioned-o n the salaries and wages list. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did read that statement, and I was very much surprised that an article containing so many inaccuracies should have been published in the Age. The statement that the work of creating new billets has been going forward at a merry pace in the Defence department is entirely incorrect. There have been no new billets created in the sense that the number of permanently employed officers and non-commissioned officers has been increased beyond the number existing at the time the departments were taken over by the Commonwealth. The contrary is the fact. In stead of the permanent appointments being increased, they are being considerably decreased. The number of commissioned officers, even when the General and his staff are included, will . be at least 15 less than the number which existed last year. With the retirements now made it is The statement made in actually 31 less at the present moment. The number of warrant officers-instructor s w ill be 48 less. The total number -of permanently employed commissioned officers provided for last year was 132, and of warrant officers, permanent instructors, 253. The numbers being provided for this year are-officer s 117, instructors 205. There are sixteen vacancies at present, and some of these may be filled and some may not.

General) I move That the Bill be now read a second time. I. think that Acts of this nature exist in every Australian State, and although the measure before the House is drafted in accordance with the style adopted by the Crown Law department of the Commonwealth, it does not differ in substance in any particular from the statutes in operation in the various States. This measure has not been brought forward on account of the appointment of the Royal commission in connection with the Drayton Grange, although that appointment called attention to the fact that while under the Letters Patent the Governor General had the power to appoint Royal commissions, there was no means by which witnesses could bo compelled to attend Or the ordinary penalties could be imposed for perjury. Consequently it became necessary to introduce, at the earliest possible moment, a machinery measure which would allow of Royal commissions obtaining the evidence which may be necessary to enable them to report to the Governor General upon any matters referred to them, and will insure that in such cases the inquiry may not be set at nought by the non-attendance of witnesses, by their refusal to answer questions, or by their failure to produce necessary documents. I do not think that any further explanation is necessary at this stage. Honourable members will see that there are only eight clauses in the Bill, and I shall be able upon each one to point to the precedents which exist in one or more of the States for the particular provisions which are here embodied. does a similar law operate ? Victoria, South Australia, and TasmaniaThere is a somewhat similar Act in force in Canada, and the same end is attainedthough by different means-in the mother country. There is no lack of. precedents in this connection. Every line of the measure is well buttressed by them, as can be shown upon further investigation. there is no desire to proceed with this measure immediately 1 bers do not wish it. no reason for delay if the Attorney-General desires to proceed with the Bill. There are one or two small matters to which attention might be drawn in committee, but it is scarcely worthwhile delaying the second reading of the B ill to point them out. Question resolved in the affirmative. B i ll read a second time. In Committee: Clause1 agreed to. Clause 2Whenever the Governor General, by letters patent under the great seal of the Commonwealth, issues a commission to any persons to make any inquiry, the president or chairman of the commission, or the sole commissioner, as the case may be, may, by writing under his hand, summon any person to attend the commission at a time and place named in the summons, and then and there to give evidence, and to produce any books, documents, or writings in his custody or control material to the subject matter of the inquiry. MrM c C AY (Corinella) -This clause does not apply to the Royal commission which is already in existence. If it were wanted in that connection, it appears to me it would be necessary to constitute the commission afresh by the issue of letters patent. The provisions of the clause as drafted clearly have reference to the future, and cannot possibly be deemed to be retrospective. point raised by the honourable and learned member is open to some doubt. However, as I did not see the necessity for the provision applying to the commission already in existence, I allowed the clause to stand in its present form. Clause agreed to.

60,Mr Mcdonald,"That is the proceNow, however, that object cannot be achieved unless I move that the committee dissent from the ruling of the Chairman, and request him to refer the point at issue to Mr mitted to enable it to evade the rule. Speaker. I think that the Attorney-General will realize that the matter to which I intend to refer is one which should be dealt with in the House. Standing Order 125 leads :No question or amendment shall be proposed which is the same in substance as any question which, during the same session, has been resolved in tlie affirmative or negative. I maintain that upon the 30th of Apri l last a Bil l was introduced to. this House, in which substantially the same question as that under discussion was involved. That Bill provided that there should be granted to the Governor General the sum of £8,000 annually for the upkeep of his establishment. The motion which is now under discussion contemplates making a similar provision, though the amount has been reduced to £5,500. When clause 2 of the Bill in question was under consideration upon the 2nd of May, an amendment was proposed"" That all the words after 'establishment be omitted."" The words which it 1 was proposed to omit had reference to making an annual allowance of £8,000 to the Governor General for the upkeep of the vice-regal establishment, and the question then put from the Chair was""That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question."" The committee decided that they should not stand part of the question and inserted in lieu of them a provision that £10,000 should be granted to the Governor General to cover the extraordinary expenditure which he had incurred in connection with the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York. The committee distinctly refused to vote an annual sum of £8,000 for the upkeep of the Governor General's establishment. I maintain that the motion now before the Chair is substantially the same proposal that was contained in the Bill which was considered in the month of May last. On page 264 of the tenth edition of May's Parliamentary Practice, I find it statedNor can a motion be brought forward which is the same, in substance, as a question which, during the current session, has been decided in the affirmative or negative. There have' been cases in which attempts have been made to evade this rule by the alteration of the wording of a motion, but it has been repeatedly ruled in the House of Commons that a mere alteration of the wording of"" a motion cannot be perThose decisions are referred to in May on page 288, where it is stated thatA mere alteration of the words of a question without any .substantial change in its object will ' not be sufficient to evade this rule. On the 7th July, 1840, Mr Speaker called attention to a motion for a Bill to relieve dissenters from the payment of church rates, before he proposed the question from the Chair. Its form and words were different from those of a previous motion, but the object was substantially the same ; and the House agreed that it was irregular, and ought not to be proposed from the Chair. Again, on the 16th Ma3', I860, the order for the second reading of the Charity Trustees Bill was withdrawn, as it was discovered to be substantially the same as the Endowed Schools Bill, which the House had already put off for six months. So, also, on the 17th May, 1870, a motion for an address in favour of emigration was not allowed to be made, being substantially the same as a resolution which had beerf negatived in the same session. On the 0th May, .1882, it was ruled by Mr Speaker that a motion affirming the necessity of legislation to enable members only elected to take their seats was inadmissible, as an amendment to the same effect, but in different words, had been negatived on the 7th March. If the practice of allowing questions which have been settled by the House to be brought up for discussion again in the same* session were allowed, it would produce endless confusion and trouble; oind we might have two or three contradictory resolutions on the same question. On page 289 of May there appears this very emphatic statementNor can a propositi contained in an amendment which has been practically negatived by a decision of the House, whereby it was determined that the words of the original motion, on which that amendment was moved, shall ""stand part of the question,"" be again submitted to the House during the same session. I have raised this point of order quite apart from the merits of the proposal before us, because I think that the procedure which I wish to prevent is a bad one. The point is sustained by Bourinot and by Todd, though, no doubt, both writers availed themselves largely of the precedents to be found in May. It seems to me that the object of the motion before us is practically the same as that of the Governor General's. Establishment Bill. It may be argued that, inasmuch as the motion also makes provision for the expenditure of £1,925 in connection with the executive, the question is a different one ; but I would point out that the House in dealing with the Estimates has already determined upon that expenditure. tain that it would be to trifle with the question to argue that, because a slight addition has been added to-the motion, it is therefore substantially a different motion. If that contention were allowed, the parliamentary rule to which May refers could be evaded in every case by merely tacking on to a motion some paltry addition. too, that the Governor General's Establishment Bill was a measure for the appropriation of money, whereas what we are now considering is merely a bald motion which may or may not have effect stantially the same question as that submotion before us deals with substantially the same question as was dealt with during the consideration of the Governor General's Establishment Bill, and that it therefore is out of order. tion to the doctrine which the honourable "".member has laid down, nor to the authorities whom he has cited in support of it ; my whole point is that neither it nor they have any reference to the case before us. When the measure providing for the appropriation of £8,000 a year for the Governor General's establish* ment was submitted it was pointed out that about one-half of the sum would be spent upon entertainments, and that of the balance, part would be expended in defraying the salaries of His Excellency's staff, and another part in paying for fuel, lighting, and other et ceter-as connected with the upkeep of the Government-houses ; but the whole amount was in addition to the sum which appeared on the Estimates for the ordinary upkeep of the Government-houses, the items of which were carefully detailed. The vote then proposed was for purposes quite different from those which the sum now proposed is intended to cover. There was on the Estimates a larger sum than that now submitted to meet the various requirements of the Governor General's household, but those requirements were quite different from those which were to be covered by the £8,000. them have been revived. The Government are not submitting any proposal to cover expenditure for entertainments, salaries of staff, fuel, or any of the charges which No t for this year. were to be covered by the £8,000. TheI n any case, I mainhonorable member is a careful custodian of the rights of the House, but he has overlooked that point. If he had referred to the speech made by the Prime Minister in introducing the Governor General's Establishment Bill, he would have seen that the objection which he has raised, although a good one under other circumstances, does not apply in this case. It may be argued, agree with the honourable member for Kennedy, and to consider the remarks of the Attorney-General altogether beside the question. The point we have to deal with is whether the motion now before us is subI shall not take that point. mitted to us on a former occasion. If reI maintain that the ference is made to the Governor General's Establishment Bill, it will be seen that it is entitled-"" AB ill to make provision for the Governor General's establishment,"" while this is a motion to provide an allowance for the upkeep of the I do not take any excepGovernment-houses. If it can be shown that there is a distinction between the one and the other, the Attorney-General's contention is a good one, but, unless the distinction can be made, the point raised by the honourable member for Kennedy must be upheld. If it is permissible for us to reopen this question on the plea that some of the details connected with it were not considered on a former occasion, it is competent for us to re-open the consideration of the electoral measure which we have just disposed of, and, if we like, to resurrect every other political question with which we have dealt during the session.

69,Mr Mccay,"Whil e I accept the exspecial allowance of £8,000 a year which we declined to grantI think it is straining the application of the parliamentary rule to say that the motion now before us deals substantially with a question which we have already considered. The £8,000 which it was proposed the other day to give the Governor General was to be given him for entirely different purposes-of which the House was cognisant-fro m those for which an amount was set down in the Estimates. There have been three distinct payments to the Governor General proposed. No doubt in the long run they would all have the effect of relieving his purse, but that is not the point. The point is that they are distinct. Without going into the merits of the proposal now before us, I may say I am going to vote against some of the items, but I submit that the motion is in order. Sir WILLI AM McMILLAN tunately absent during the last debate, but as I understand the position it is this : The Government proposed the granting of £S,000 a year to the Governor General in addition to the salary of £10,000 a year provided for by the Constitution, while in the Estimates a further sum was provided for the up-keep of the Government-houses in Sydney and Melbourne, and to cover other expenses. The House rejected the proposal to grant an extra £8,000 a year, and substituted for it the grant of a specific sum to defray the expenses of His Excellency during the visit to Australia of the Prince and Princess of Wales. We are now asked to consider the advisability of granting money to cover expenses which were not provided for by the proposed grant of £8,000. ""Unfortunately there has been a great deal of misunderstanding as to the real intentions of the Government in this -matter. The Estimates were placed upon the table, and the Treasurer had circulated an explanatory statement showing how the various items were made -up. But when the matter came to be dealt with, so much time had elapsed since the laying on the table of the explanatory statement that honourable members had forgotten all about it , and therefore there Was a great deal of misunderstanding. To my mind, whatever decision we may arrive at with regard to the motion it is not intended to cover any of the expenditure -which the £8,000 was to cover, and therefore I think it is not out of order. justify expenditure, not for the present year only, but for successive years. A proposal of that kind should be contained in a Bill. tion on that point when I deal with the motion itself. vides that the Governor General's salary shall not be altered during his tenure of office, the Government could not propose an addition to that salary. Therefore the £8,000 a year which they proposed to give him was a grant by way of allowance. What they are proposing now is a. similar grant by way of allowance, although the amount, instead of being £8,000, is £5,500.' gether different. Whatever the expenditure is to cover, it I was unformust be expenditure by way of allowance. The proposed grant of £8,000 would have been unconstitutional if it had been proposed as an addition to the Governor General's salary, and was, therefore, also a grant by way of allowance. Are we being asked to pass this resolution in order to enable the Government to introduce a B ill ? I should like to know from the Acting Prime Minister whether he proposes to follow up this resolution by the introduction of a B i ll founded upon it? I speak. struct the honourable gentleman, but I point out that, if he does not, he will still be proposing the passing of an Estimate for more than one year, and that is unconstitutional. Our Estimates generally are Estimates for the current year, and they are variable from year to year. I say, therefore, that this is not a regular authority to put a certain amount upon the Estimates, but is rather a direction from the House to the Government to introduce a Bill. I do not care which view is taken. If the motion is proposed as a direction to put a certain amount per annum upon the Estimates, it is wrong; and if it is proposed to authorize the introduction of a Bill, it will certainly be dealing with a matter which has already been considered by the House.

There can, I think, be no question that a decision has already been arrived at by this House upon this question, though that decision did not meet with my entire approval. Are we to go back upon the sound parliamentary rule, and permit this matter to be discussed again ?

The Government might advance the ground that these buildings for the time being are Federal property, but the same objection would arise then, so far as the Parliament is concerned, as we might prefer to allow them to fall into disrepair. MrO ' MALLEY Acting Prime Minister is, in tlie language of the turf, ringing the changes on us. There can be no question that, in substance and in reality, this is the same little bit of business that was before this House on a previous occasion, when the proposal to grant allowances amounting to £8,000 a year was made. The honourable and learned member for Corinella drew a fine distinction. He told us that the £S,000 had nothing whatever to do with this. But was the £5,500 a year in the rear waiting in case the Government were outvoted on the proposal to grant £ 8 , 0 0 0 1 It seems to me like starting one crook and a real racer in the same race. the dark horse, and he has been kept waiting until a convenient opportunity to trot him out. Isi t not all a question of allowances ? In my opinion it certainly is. This recalls to my mind a passage from the Scriptures wherein it is stated that a certain king, with the advice of his inexperienced counsellors, said to his people"" My father has laid upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add to your burdens."" That is precisely what is The figures proposed in being done with us to-day. I support the contention of the honourable member for Kennedy. ber for Kennedyi n raising the point of order has referred me to Standing Order 125, which saysNo question or amendment shall be proposed which is the same in substance as any question which, during the same session, has been resolved in the affirmative or negative.

Estimates relate to people whose rights are safeguarded, so far as we are concerned, by a Public Service Act. That can be dealt with under the provisions of the Act.

A larger amount is set apart in Canada-partl y by special appropriationand a larger amount is provided in two of the States of Australia, whilst an almost equal amount is appropriated in one or two of the other States. The amount for which It binds the House to we are asking represents, in my opinion, the bed-rock of economy.

The choice of Sydney Government-house as a residence for His Excellency the Governor General dates back to a period prior to the birth of the Commonwealth. As some honourable members appeared to suppose that there was a mystery in connection -with the negotiations which led up to that, I asked and obtained from the New South Wales' Government the papers relating to the case. TheseI have now laid upon the table for the perusal of honourable members. A t a very early'period the Government of New South Wales were naturally concerned to see that at the birth of the Commonwealth the importance of New South Wales and of its metropolis, Sydney, were recognised. It was generally admitted throughout the Commonwealth that in view of the peculiar circumstances in regard to Sydney, and of the disability imposed by the terms of the Constitution upon that bright and beautiful city, its prominence and importance should be recognised by holding the inaugural celebration of the Commonwealth there. The celebration took place at Sydnej', and was distinguished by a regal magnificence which will live in the memories of all who witnessed it . The action of the State of New South Wales was most generous, and no nation ever had its existence more fittingly inaugurated than did this Commonwealth on the 1st of January, 1901. Honourable members must recollect that ou the very first day in the history of the Commonwealth we found the GovernorGenerali n occupation of Government-house, Sydney. South Wales Government £20,000 to fit it up for him. grams exchanged between the Premier of New South Wales, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, are now before honourable members. mate desire on the part of New SouthI t is purely Wales, when it undertook the burden of conducting the celebrations at the birth of the Commonwealth, to be allowed to make No ; it is not an acciprovision for the residence of His Excellency the Governor-Generali n Sydney. Mr O'MALLEY -That was ""bossed"" by Sir William Lyne. too. As I have stated, the Governor General was in occupation of the Government-house at Sydney at the time that the Commonwealth was inaugurated, and nothing was more natural than that the Government of New South Wales should invite him to stay in Sydney for at least a part of the time during which he was not detained in Melbourne by his parliamentary duties. That was a perfectly legitimate aspiration, one that is shared by every capital city in the Union, which ought to be gratified in every possible way. The only distinction between Sydney and Melbourne and other capitals lies in the fact that they are the two great centres of population, influence, commerce, and wealth of this Commonwealth. These two great cities are so much larger than any others within the Commonwealth that it is but natural that the Governor General should be expected, in order to make the acquaintance of the people, to spend a longer time in these centres than in remote districts. The great metropolis, Sydney, no longer belongs to New South Wales, except in a narrow and restricted sense, but it constitutes the centre of a great part of this Commonwealth. It is an Australian city of which Australia is proud. The recognition of its importance is not due to the fact that it happens to be the great centre of a wealthy and enterprising State, but to the circumstance that it is one of the vital centres of the Commonwealth. We can no more ignore Sydney as a great power aud population because of State sub-divisions, than we could ignore a large and important city within a State because of municipal subdivisions. It appears to be abundantly easy, without taking into account the many charms which that metropolitan city can claim to possess, to justify the choice of Sydney as a place of residence of the Governor General. No country house will be provided for His Excellency the Governor General, but it is inevitable that he should visit Sydney, and spend a good deal of time there. It is desirable These show a legititherefore, that he should be, so to speak,",25,Government Houses Andexecutive Counci L

As a matter of fact, of course, his residence in Sydney will not be his own house, because it is lent to us by the State Government rent free. We pay nothing but the bare cost of maintaining it . The State of New South Wales, like that of Victoria! has to pay rent for the residence set apart for its own Governor, in order that it may be enabled to extend this liberal concession to the Commonwealth. Not only is it not gracious to look a gift-horse in the mouth, but I think we should show the highest appreciation of the generosity of the States of New South Wales and Victoria in placing their magnificent buildings at our disposal free of rent. we pay nothing but the bare cost of the upkeep of that all too large Government-house on the banks of the Yarra, and we are also occupying Parliament-house on the same singularly favorable terms. In Sydney we stand in just the same relation with regard to Government-house, and we must not forget that we owe all these advantages to the generosity of the States. cept the use of other State houses upon the same terms 1 question. For a considerable period of the year the Governor General will be tied to Melbourne, because Parliament will be sitting there, and during the recess he will necessarily have to pay a visit to New South Wales, which, on account of -its large population and importance, is entitled to some share of his attention. After this has been done, His Excellency will have very little time left in which to visit more than one other Statei n turn during the recess. He can fairly expect to occupy for a considerable time the Government-houses in Sydney and Melbourne, whereas he would need to use other Government-houses at irregular intervals only. There is a difference between maintaining residences in which His Excellency will assuredly spend a certain portion of his time every year, and keeping up residences in which he would live only occasionally. It is part of the duty of the Commonwealth to provide for the accommodation of His Excellency in any Statei n which he may live. The matter of providing the Governor General, with a residence in Sydney resolves itself into a question of voting .about £2,000. The papers which I have laid upon the table, and which have been before another place for two months, explain the exact position. They show that, on 18th June last year, the Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria, and in each case asked them to consider the question of the occupancy of the State Government-house by His Excellency the Governor General. It was stated that it would probably be necessary to arrange for the occupation of these residences for a term of three or five years. On Sth August the Premier of Victoria replied that the Government were prepared to allow Government-house, Melbourne, to be occupied by the Governor General for either three In Victoria or five years, free of cost to the Federal Government, subject to the conditions already mentioned, and upon an undertaking being given that the buildings, offices, and grounds should be handed over in the same order and condition as at the commencement of the tenancy. After some delay, the Premier of New South Wales placed the Government-house in Sydney ab the disposal of His Excellency the Governor General on precisely bhe same Governmentterms as those mentioned by the Premier of Victoria in regard to Government-house, T h a t is not a practical Melbourne. Now we have possession of both Government-houses, and are enabled to point in these letters which constitute. an agreement between the Commonwealth Ministry and the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria up to the end of next year. Having regard to the extremely handsome manner in which the Commonwealth has been treated by New South Wales, and to the magnitude of the interests represented in Sydney, I trust that honourable members -eve n if they take an adverse view in the distant future-wil l concur in confirming the arrangement into which the Government have entered, and from which I hope they will not see .any necessity to withdraw until the federal capital has been esbablished. Even then it may be necessary for the Governor General to make occasional visits to the great cities of the Commonwealth, but until we are in a position to offer him his own residence in the future federal capital, the least we can do is to place at his disposal the two Government-houses in the two principal centres of population, which we are in a position to offer him through the courtesy and generosity of bhe Sbates. I do not know that I need to labour this point. No doubt it will be suggested",26,Government Houses Andexecutive Counci L

120,Mr Deakin,"that economy should be exercised, but I claim that any one who peruses the paper which was ordered to be printed upon the 7th of August, will admit that in regard to the maintenance of the vice-regal establishments in Sydney and Melbourne we have pared down to the bone. If it be possible to maintain those establishments for a less sum, it will be done; but I doubt whether it can be done. The most careful analysis of the outgoings shows that if the amounts which are now proposed do cover the expenses-and I think they will-the y will allow of a very scanty margin indeed. Honourable members have only to compare those amounts with the liberal appropriations made by this House in 1901, in order to realize bhe great reductions which have been made. Of course, bhe sums specified in bhis motion are only in' the nature of estimates, bub bhere is no reason bo suppose thab bhey will be exceeded by more than a Jibtle, if bhey are exceeded at all. Takingi t for granted bhab bhe question of the desirableness of maintaining a second Governmenb-house is bhe one bo be debated, I hope honourable members will remember bhat after all bhere are considerabions which have an utilitarian bearing upon it, albhough they may nob appear bo do so. The Governor General is bhe chief officer and represenbative of bhe Commonwealbh in Australia, and it is not becoming that he should occupy an inferior position to the Governors of the States through which he passes, or in which he lives. If we insist that the chief officer of the Crown in Australia, whilst residing in Victoria or spending a portion of his time in New South Wales, shall, in discharging the duties and maintaining the dignities of his office, be confined to a much narrower expenditure than the States Governor are we shall be placing ourselves in a very invidious position indeed. Those who lessen the standing and irepressiveness of the Governor General, should remember that they are lessening the standing and impressiveness of the Commonwealth. I admit that the utmost impressiveness is consistent with extreme simplicity. pp Mr O'MALLEY -Surely President Rooseveldt is as big a man as the Governor General of Australia. receive 1 MrO ' MALLEY 43 p oughb to know better.

The Appropriation Act passed by Congress last year set apart £20,000 for expenditure upon White House, and in connection with the President. to be credited to other departments. pare America with Australia, but whenever an undue expenditure is cast upon the President of the United States on account of special entertainments, Congress makes special provision for them, just as this House voted a sum to compensate the Governor General for the extraordinary outlay incurred by him in connection with the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York. Of course, it is impossible to compare a nation which has developed such greatness as h s the United States with a young community of yesterday-the Commonwealth of Australia. pay less. stitute any comparisons. A t the same time, the United States cannot be quoted as an instance of greater economy than we are proposing to adopt if the conditions are considered. On the contrary, if all the circumstances are taken into account, it will be found that in this, as in every other respect, the United States exhibits a magnificent determination to maintain its prestige amongst the nations of the world. The question of the Governor General's railway travelling has been referred to by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr itself. Under the circumstances honorPoynton. In this connection, I would say that if all the States Governors have hitherto been accorded the privilege of free railway travelling, I see no reason why that concession should be withdrawn. I decline to believe that it will be withdrawn. received an assurance that they will not be charged for the Governor General's railway travelling 1 effect will be that the Governor General would go nowhere in Australia other than to those places to which his official duties call him. ; If he is charged for that portion of his, railway-travelling, the expense will be borne by the Commonwealth. There is a W ill the Attorney-Genesmall sum included in the £1,000 which is set apart for official printing, <fec, which would cover any slight outlay to which the respect. Government have already been billed for the Governor General's railway travelling ? States Governments have been informed I do not desire to comthat they must render those accounts to the Governor-Generali n person, and that they would be paid out of his private purse, they have withdrawn them. I have no reason to suppose that any new practice will be introduced in regard to this matter. In deed I am confident that the same privilege' which has been extended to the State Governors will also be extended to the Governor General. land with a title receives a free pass over the railways. Governor General will always receive the same courtesy as has been meted out to the I have no desire to inState Governors, and that the difficulty suggested will not arise. If it does, the Governor General will travel nowhere but where his official duties call him, and then his expenses will be paid by the Commonwealth. But the cardinal question at issue is whether it is desirable to maintain a second Government-house in Sydney, when normal sessions of Parliament take the place of this extraordinary session, which I am informed by somebody with an historical turn of mind, surpasses in length any session, except that of the Long Parliament able members will realize that a second Government-house is no more than the status of the Governor General of Australia demands, and no more than its people ought to provide. If they desire the position of. the Commonwealth and of the chief repreGovernment sentative of the Crowni n Australia to be recognised throughout the States, they will at all events pay him the compliment of allowing him a second residence, such as If it is withdrawn, the many of the Governors of the States already enjoy.

140,Mr Deakin,"I anticipate that themake for the maintenance of two Government houses should be immediately embodied in a Bill, or whether we should agree to the suggestion of the Attorney-General to await the results of a year's experience before deciding to place it within a statutory appropriation. No honourable member representing New South Wales can find fault with the kind and generous tone of the Attorney-General's address in referring to the necessity for the upkeep of a Government-house in Sydney. Indeed, this preliminary debate ought not to be necessary, because most of us agree that in connection with the Governor General's position some allowances must be voted. Buti t is very clear from the apologetic utterance of the Attorney-General, and from a great many niurniurings which we have heard during the past few weeks, that an attempt is to be made to eliminate from these Estimates the amount necessary for the upkeep of a Government-house in Sydney. In to-day's newspapers there appears a sort of inspired paragraph, in which it is stated that a member of this House says that he intends to uproot the whole of this matter, and to go into the correspondence between the Minister for Home Affairs, when Prime Minister of New South Wales, and the Imperial Government. Of course he will be perfectly within his rights in doing that. In my opinion, the time has arrived for taking an historical retrospect of.the whole matter. I have always deplored the fact that federation did not come about as the result of the first referendum. I believe that a great many of the difficulties which beset us now in regard to the upkeep of the Governmenthouses of Sydney and Melbourne, and the establishment here of the departmental and Parliamentary offices, would have been obviated if the people of New South Wales could have been prevailed upon to accept the Constitution Bill on the first referendum. By not doing so, and by insisting upon a Constitution which is not the complete embodiment of the views of the Convention in which the various States were represented, they for the first time in the history of this movement condescended to bargaining. a bargain. Sir WILLIAM little has, in my private opinion, come of the bargaining. or wrong, a bargain was made, the chief 43 P i compact in which was that the federal capital should be situated in the State of New South Wales, and, inferential]}', that the Commonwealth Government should be carried on from there. There are provisions in the Constitution which-althoug h we have the right, by following a certain course of procedure, and obtaining the popular approval, to amend-coul d not be changed without committing a dishonourable breach of the arrangements between the States. One cannot imagine the possibility of a ref eren d u m for dissol ving tlie u n ion, nor can we imagine a referendum for altering that provision in the Constitution which says that no territory shall be taken from a State to form another State without the consent of its people. Certain provisions of the Constitution are compacts between the States, affecting their rights qua States, which must be honourably observed, and which we cannot think would be amended. I ask honourable members now to consider the question with which we are dealing as a compact with New South Wales. There can be no doubt that ""if that compact had not been made, the first Parliament would have met in New South Wales. The position of that State was recognised by the fact that the Governor General first landed there, and that the Commonwealth was inaugurated there. ' In order that the Governor General might have a fitting reception, and that proper arrangements might be made for his stay there, the then Premier of the State-the Minister for Home Affairs-place d the Government-house in Sydney at his disposal. Sir WILLI AM LYNE -The State Governor gave up his residence there so that it might be done. have felt, as no doubt many other honourable members have done, that this particular compact would bring about some curious results. I want honourable members, however, to understand the whole position, in order to bring them back to the true federal feeling in the matter. We have been told that federation has enlarged our powers of self government; I hope that it has enlarged our ideas of self-government. We knew directly it was decided that the first Parliament should meet in Melbourne that the Executhere been one grumble from New South But whether it was right AVales because the whole administrative machinery of the Commonwealth has been",29,Government Houses Andexecutive Counci L

142,Sir William Mcmillan,"Yes. Idirected from Melbourne ? The only growl that we have heard has come from a member of another place, who objected to the furnishing of a very humble edifice in Sydney to house Commonwealth when they happened to be doing executive duty there. That unfederal spirit is deplorable. It is our duty to foster in every way the federal spirit. We are here, not merely to pass laws for the Government of the Commonwealth, but also to give life and instinct to the federal spirit. I have been glad to notice during tlie fifteen months for which we have been sitting, .there has been no attempt representatives do anything unfair in the interests of the smaller States. On the contrary, the most .generous disposition has been shown towards the interests of Queensland and TasmaniaWestern Australia, because of her Tariff arrangements, not having been so greatly .concerned. .vquestion now before us we are, to some extent, affected by the' fact that this session is apparently interminable; but does any one imagine that we shall ever have another like it ? Is it not fair to suppose that in the future the extreme duration of u session will be not more than six months ? Of course, the Executive Government and its officers must, during the session, be where Parliament is sitting; but during the recess, if -the spirit and, I think, the letter of thecom-pact is carried out, Parliament should be .only too glad to allow the Governor General -to reside in that State in which the future -federal capital is to be. It must be remembered that this is not a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence. But, in any and if it is the desire of the people of New South Wales that the Governor General -shall reside in their State during part of the year, we ought to freely grant the money. ""There was a clear compact, and it has been -clearly understood. The expenditure for the .up-keep of the Government-houses has been rreduced to, I think, as small an amount as the expenditure of the States in that direction. It must not be forgotten that the Governor of New South Wales, instead of living in the origina.1 has removed to another residence provided by the State. While it is desirable that the site of the federal capital should be determined upon as soon as possible, a certain period must elapse even after it-is determined Sir William McMillan. upon, and perhaps, after Parliament has begun to meet there, before a residence for tlie Governor General can be provided there; and as New South Wales has agreed Ministers that Parliament shall, in the meantime, sit in Melbourne, and that the whole machinery of the Commonwealth shall be managed from Melbourne, it would be contemptible to refuse to vote the paltry sum of £2,000 for the up-keep of the Governineiit-house at the metropolis of that State, which is the most populous, and, in many respects, because of its area and position, the most that important. It may be said that the Execub\' the tive Council meetings can be held only of the larger States to where the Governor General happens to be residing. But honourable members know that Executive Council meetings may be held anywhere without deranging the machinery of government. Then, too, it is our boast that modern appliances have almost annihilated space, and we know that In the consideration of the the Governor General could leave Sydney one evening and be here in Melbourne to attend a meeting of the Executive Council next morning if necessary. Then, again, although the Executive may have their offices in Melbourne, Ministers will have to visit New South Wales to deal with many important matters. I am willing to say that this sum should be voted merely on the ground that the people of New South Wales desire that the Governor General shall reside in their State for a portion of the year. require that. We want to foster the federal spirit throughout Australia. Federation could case,theamountinvolvedisonlyabout£2,000, not have taken place if New South Wales had refused to join the union. That State, however, accepted the Constitution upon certain terms, one of which was that the federal capital should be situated in New South Wales, but not within 100 miles of Sydneya very unfortunate limitation. Could any one have imagined, eighteen months ago, that this Parliament would refuse to recognise the status of New South Wales, and decline to vote a sum of money for the up-keep of the Government-house in Government-house, Sydney, upon which the Government of New South Wales have spent £20,000? If we do not vote this sum, we may place ourselves in a very undignified and reprehensible position. We cannot prevent the Governor General from ' travelling, as he",30,Mcmillan Very Tive Offices Must Be Established There Has
143,Mr Joskph Cook,They have a right to,31,Mcmillan Very Tive Offices Must Be Established There Has
144,Sir William Mcmillan,"Yes.may think ib his duty to do, throughout the States, or from residing in New South Wales, nor ean we prevent the New South Wales Government from offering to him any accommodation they may -think fit. It was contended a short time ago that it would be undignified for the Governor -' General to accept an allowance from a Stabe Parliament. The contention in Victoria when a similar Bill was introduced was, that if a Governmenb-house had bo be maintained anywhere it was the Federal, and not the State Government that should maintain ; that the Governor General, in his position, oughb nob to be beholden to any State for that kind of hospitality ; and that our dignity and our posibion necessitated the other course. Now, what are we doing ? We are going back upon our own principles. Afte r having scouted the proposal of New South Wales because we, forsooth, were willing to provide the money, we are saying now that, having stopped that little arrangement, we do nob intend bo do anything ourselves. tional right of New South Wales? stitutional right of New South Wales is to the capital site, whenever that is decided. I do not know that, as a matter of hard logic, we can deduce anything with regard to Government-house in Sydney to which there could not be an answer. But I do not think we ought to deal with the question in that pettifogging way. We have 'to deal with this question from a purely federal stand-point, in view of the understanding which was come to, and which to a large extent brought about federation, and we have to deal with it from the highest point of view with a knowledge of bhe sensitive feelings of bhe people of bhe great mother Sbate of Australia. Because-and bhis is the lasb word I shall say upon bhis matterI would warn honourable members that if by their vote they refuse to carry this small sum for the upkeep of Governmenb-house in Sydney, they will cause an extreme feeling of irritation in that State. There have been many things to create a feelipg of irritation bhere up bo the present time. I can say for myself that that is no threat or anything of bhab kind, because I am one of those federalisbs who believe that no matter what has happened, and no mabber whab could happen, union, above all bhings, is necessary for our national exisbence. Therefore, while it makes no difference to me as a federalisb, I say the duty of this Parliament and of this Government should be to do everything that will allay any feeling of irritation, which, in many respects, is unavoidable in bringing into operation a new system such as that of the Commonwealth. Wheni t is considered that, in allaying the irritation of the people of New Soubh Wales, we shall be carrying out a compacb, aud bhab bhe carrying out of bhab compact will involve an expense of only £2,000 a year, the question is scarcely arguable. sence of this question is whether, in the opinion of bhis Parliament, it is desirable that the Commonwealth shall be made chargeable with the upkeep of more than one Government-house for its Governor General. When I spoke about bhis matter on a previous occasion, I very warmly advocated the claim then put forward by the Government, that the residence or residences of the Governor General, which were given to us rent free by the States, should be kept in a thorough and complete state of repair at the exT h e conpense of the Commonwealth. Ever since this question has been before the Chamber, I have endeavoured to discover why it was thought necessary bhab, anterior to the establishment of the federal capital, there should be more than one residence provided for the Governor General. I have my own opinion about ib-a n opinion formed upon knowledge which came bo me in a certain capaciby -bha b previous bo the setting out of the Governor General from England, it was his intention to land at Melbourne. There is no doubt that it was bhe intention of Lord Hopetoun bo land ab Melbourne, but after he left England cerbain pressure was brought to bear upon the Home Government which caused an alteration in his plans. sponsible for that, because it was not in existence at the time. am very anxious that this Parliament should not be placed in the position of being compelled to accept a responsibility which it did not incur.

Buti t is patent from the papers that we have at our disposal, that there were two conditions made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The first condition was that the whole of the States interested should be agreeable, and the second condition was that the extra expense should be borne by the States interested. The first of these conditions was carried out. Communications were opened up between the Premier of New South Wales and the Premiers of the other States of the Commonwealth, and, without exception, the new arrangements with regard to landing, the issue of the proclamation, and so on, were agreed to by the States, and perhaps also the question of residence hanging upon that. The second condition, however, was fulfilled only by the State of New South Wales. In the State of Victoria a Bill was brought down for the purpose, but it was rejected on its second reading, and it would have been rejected by a very much larger majority than it was, had it not been for the existence of the feeling of fellowship and comradeship amongst the States which the honourable member for Wentworth desires so much to have expressed. specific reference to Government-house in would be agreed to.

I desire to deal with these questions in the interests of the whole Commonwealth, and I should be very sorry to assist one State at the expense of the others. I do not consider that the appropriations proposed by the Government are excessive. I agree with the Acting Prime Minister that we have at last got down to bed-rock in the matter of these expenses, but I regret that I shall ""nave to vote in support of my opinion that it is not desirable that there should be more than one residence for the Governor General within the Commonwealth.

Apart from this, the Government proposals are as economical'as we could expect, and I am sorry to find myself called upon to record what may be regarded as an anti-federal vote. It is not with any anti-federal spirit that rny vote will be given, because if Melbourne, instead of Sydney, were affected, I should act in exactly the same way. member for Laanecoorie, who professes to be a federalist, has expressed regret that he should be called upon to give what may seem to be. an anti-federal vote, but his reasons for his action do not seem to be sufficient. He evidently bases his objection to the proposed vote for the maintenance of Government-house at Sydney as a second residence for the Governor General upon the fact '.'Tat, although one portion of the compact between the States has been kept, the second part has not been carried out. New South Wales has always been ready to carry out her part of the compact, under which the States were to contribute £10,000 towards the expenses of the Governor General; but Victoria has been found wanting in this respect. reads the correspondence laid upon the table' by the Minister he will find that there was a compact, because in the communications sent to the Secretary of State for the Coloniesi t was stated that the States would provide £10,000. the correspondence regarding any compact having been entered into by the Government of Victoria. of £10,000 would be contributed by the States. able member stated, and he should not make a serious charge against any State without having the best of evidence. who represent Victoria seem to think that New South Wales should be prepared to pact with reference to the maintenance of the residence for the Governor-Generali n Sydney should not be carried out because £10,000 is not forthcoming from the States. For the sake of the paltry £2,00 0 which is required for the upkeep of Government-house in Sydney, the Governor General is to be placed in an invidious position and faith is to be broken with New South Wales. The Government of that State spent £20,000 in renovating Government-' house in Sydney to fit it for the accommodation of the Governor General, and provided another residence for the State Governor. Government-house in Sydney has been placed in the possession of the Commonwealth Government, and whether we like it or not we shall have to pay for the upkeep of the establishment. The fact of the matter is that the people of Melbourne do not wishtolose theGovernor-General. Theydonot wishtohavemorethanone residence provided for him, and they are basing their objections upon the ground of the expense that will be involved. The Victorians utter the federal cry only when it. suits them, and they fight for their own State entirely. I now propose to take a lesson from them, and to uphold the rights of the State which I represent. I do not care whether my action is regarded as federal or anti-federal.

185,Mr Wilks,"-The honourable members,the interests of the Commonwealth. The motion now before us is evidently intended to feel the pulse of the House. to do? Ministry should take the responsibility of placing the proposed vote upon the Estimates in the ordinary way. We have heard a great deal about federalism, but that the mantle of the greatest federalist whom Australia has knownI refer to the late Sir Henry Parkes-ha s not fallen upon the shoulders of the Prime Minister is evidenced by his action in recently proposing that an annual allowance of £8,000 should be granted to the Governor General. If any State is entitled to grumble, because of the neglect to carry out the federal compact, undoubtedly it is New South Wales. If any city throughout the Commonwealth made great sacrifices in order that New South Wales might join the Union, certainly it was Sydney. In this connection I would remind those who taunt New South Wales, that it is from that State that we derive the biggest share of our revenue. Indeed, the State of New South Wales stands before the world as the banker of the Union. I do not wish to raise the cry of New South Wales verms Victoria, but I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that both the representatives and press of Victoria are endeavouring, by every means possible, to retain the residence of the Governor General in this State. If they do not openly declare themselves, they suggest that we should have the federal capital established upon the movable tent system. If that system be adopted I am quite sure that the representatives of South Australia will want to know where Adelaide comes in. A t the inauguration of the Commonwealth the Governor General landed in New South Wales, and took up his residence there. His establishment was furnished by an outlay of £20,000 on the part of the State Government. That expenditure was incurred not simply for the purpose of providing him with a residence for a day or two, but of providing him with a residence during the recess. Naturally whilst Parliament is in session he will reside in Melbourne, so that under ordinary circumstances the people of Victoria would have had the benefit of his presence for a clear period of sixteen months. Now, however, that the people of the Commonwealth ; Council: Expenditure. 15373 are asked to provide £2,077 to maintain' the vice-regal establishment in Sydney, some honourable members object. I am I s not that a proper thing satisfied that their opposition to the proposal is not the result of the outlay which No , not in this way. The it involves. They do not want a second residence. ciple of maintaining two residences, irrespective of where they may be located. average elector does not care where the Governor General resides. He does not share in vice-regal entertainments. He is not amongst the chosen few who frequent Government-house. But I object to any abrogation of the federal compact. My reasons for believing that such a compact was made are: that the present Minister for Home Affairs arranged that the Governor General should land in New South Wales; that the Commonwealth should be inaugurated there; that £20,000 should be expended in furnishing the State Government house; and that His Excellency should reside there when Parliament was not in session. These facts were within the knowledge of every State Parliament throughout the Commonwealth. not provide the money necessary for the upkeep of the establishment ? offers to contribute a larger sum for that purpose than is asked from the remainder of the Commonwealth. The Government, however, have informed the Imperial authorities, in a despatch, that they will not allow any of the States to specially contribute to the maintenance of the Governor General's establishment. The largest share of the £2,000 required for the up-keep of the Sydney residence will bo exacted from New South Wales. Personally, I am satisfied that if we allow the Governor General to remove his residence from that State, we shall hinder the establishment of the federal capital. The opposition to this proposal > springs from a desire to prevent the speedy settlement of the federal capital site. It was a condition embodied in the Constitution that the capital should be in New South Wales territory, and naturally that State is grieved to find that after eighteen months, apart from two little trips to the country, nothing whatever has been done to carry out the terms of that compact.

MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I regret that our friends from the great State of New South Wales haveagain raised the question of sectionalism, because there is no intention whatever on the part of this committee to do an injustice to that State. I can assure them that no honourable member intends to do anything which would cause the weakest child in New South Wales to shed a tear. I may further add that Tasmania is not anxious that the Governor General shall reside in that State, for while he will always be a most estimable gentleman, he is undoubtedly a most expensive "" show."" He is a good deal like a man in America who owned a menagerie. After the menagerie had passed into the possession of the sheriff, the latter had to search out the owner and request him to take the elephants, snakes, Ac, off his hands, as he did not know what to do with them. Similarly, Tasmania would not know what to do with the Governor General. There is something about the utterances of the Attorney-General But I wish to correct his statements with regard to the expenditure upon the WhiteI oppose their present proposal, however, the K i ng had given a feast to 500,000 paupers, gathered together from the four corners of London. All honour to the King for his charity. But tlie conditions which produced those paupers should not be allowed to obtain in the Commonwealth. It is one of the curses of Australia that we have allowed to be introduced here feudalistic titles and all the despotism of privilege. We are to-day struggling against the spirit which democracy has for years vainly endeavoured to destroy-agains t a monster generated by corruption and nursed on the bosom of privilege. These grants mean the upholding of caste and rank, and it is caste and rank which have damned and blasted the European nations, so that now they are falling behind in the progress of the world. I am going to oppose this proposal, but if it is determined to provide for the upkeep of the Government house in Melbourne, I shall not vote against tlie proposal to provide .for the upkeep of Government-house"" in Sydney, because I think an agreement ought to be kept. But these antiquated systems which we are introducing will plunge us into a bondage more terrible than the darkness of Egypt. Like conditions everywhere produce like results. We have no pauperism in Australia now, because we are younger and bigger than other countries. But danger is lurking ahead. In my opinion it would be better to wipe the whole show out, and let any business man be Governor. McAlister, the Governor of Toronto, and the best man they have had, gets only £2,000 a year. The Governor of New York gets only £3,000 a year, although there are 7,000,000 people in that State; while the President of the Republic of Switzerland upholds the dignity of his State on a salary of £540 a year. The great curse of these aristocratic and quasi-aristocratic countries is that they must pile up the agonj'. They must gild the rooster, and have the diamonds glittering, or else they think they cannot have dignity. I look upon all institutions for the development of caste and rank as nothing less than gilded, stagnant lakes into which the rivers of privilege empty. that the discussion is becoming rather academic. In the first place, I am of opinion that the House is bound by the arrangement entered into by the Government with the Government of New South Wales, and that for three years at least we must vote such a sum as will provide for the upkeep of the Sydney Government-house. It must be admitted, I think, that we shall have to provide for the upkeep of at least one Government-house, and it cannot be said that the amountset down forexpenditure in connection with the Melbourne Government-house is too large. It must be remembered that the house and grounds must be kept in good order whether the Governor General resides there or not, because a valuable State property cannot be allowed to fall into disrepair. I find that the whole amount set down for the maintenance of the Melbourne Government-house is only £3,100 a year, whereas the maintenance of these buildings and the adjacent gardens costs something like £4,000 a year. With regard to the Sydney Government-house, I am aware that some honourable members object to any expenditure there, upon the principle that there should not be two houses provided for the Governor General. I understand that that is the position taken by the honourable member for Laanecoorie. Buti t must be recollected that an arrangement was entered into by this Government from which we can hardly draw back. I am not now discussing whether it was a good or a bad arrangement: but, as the executive determined, before this Parliament was elected, to lease the building for three years, we must carry out the contract. Even if I thought that no contract had been entered into, but was informed that the people of New South Wales would feel that we were breaking faith with them if we did not agree to this expenditure, I would say that it is too trivial an amount to quarrel about. After all, it is merely a matter of bookkeeping. .The people have to find the money in any case, whether it is paid by the State or by the Commonwealth Government. In my opinion the people of Sydney will think that faith has been broken with them to some extent if this expenditure is not sanctioned. ' man in six will trouble his head about the matter. the honourable member say that, but there may be some cavil on the part of those who would have liked to see the Federal site chosen quickly, and who think that there has been undue delay in that matter. They will think that it will involve a still further delay, and that will give rise to irritation out of all proportion, in my opinion, to the object t,o be achieved. If after the establishment of the federal capital in New South Walesi t were suggested that a Government-house should be provided at Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, or Perth, at a cost of £2,000 or £3,000 a year for each place, I should not dream for a moment of opposing it , if I were informed it would make the people of those States believe that faith was being kept with them. What honourable member on either side would oppose the expenditure of even £50,000 if he were assured that it would create harmony amongst the people of the Commonwealth ? If after the establishment of the federal capital I were to be informed that the people of Victoria desired to have a Governor General's residence established in Melbourne at a cost of £2,000 or £3,000, I should be inclined to say that if the expenditure of that small sum of money were necessary to induce half-a-million of people in this city, and",36,William Mcmillan Does The Make All Sorts Of Sacrifices But That The Com

The question as to whether there should be only one Governor General's residence is one which may be left to the debating schools. I am sure that if honourable members opposite understand that the effect of this proposal will be to remove discontent they will be prepared to, vote for it. Though the honourable member for Laanecoorie and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne may object on principle to the establishment of two residences for the Governor General, they will be prepared to waive, that objection if they are assured that it is nement was accepted by the Federal Governcessary to doso in order to bring about content. To carry out an existing arrangement the establish ment of a Government-house is asked for in the case of New South Wales, and I think that the Federal Government, whether it likes it or not, will be bound to pay this sum. We must remember that we are keeping up a Government-house in Melbourne and another in Sydney, we are not paying a single penny of interest on the cost of construction of those houses. suppose that the cost of construction of the Melbourne Government-house alone amounts to over £500,000. our disposal rent free, and it is surely not too much to ask that the Federal Government should bear the expense of maintaining it. Government-house in Sydney must have cost an equally large sum, and it is not too much to ask that the Federal Government should pay merely for maintenance and repairs. After all, is it not absolutely a matter of bookkeeping? have to come from the people whether it is paid by the State or the Government. when we should deal with States as having separate interests in these matters. as Federal members should recognise that a tax collected by a State is a tax paid by a citizen of the Commonwealth, and that a tax collected .by the Commonwealth is at the same time a tax paid by a citizen of one of the States. I think the Estimates submitted in the resolution are moderate, and no objection has been taken to either of them even by the honourable member for Laanecoorie. able member is assured by honourable members from New South Wales that any Mr Conroy. departure from the agreement which has been made will be looked upon in that State as a and that no provinbreach of faith, he will not, I think, insist upon striking out the allowance for keeping up the Government-house in Sydney. This appears to me to be a very simple matter. It is not a question of whether we are in favour of two Government-houses or one. To my mind it is a question whether this Parliament is going to keep an honourable engagement entered into by the Federal Government. Let honourable members consider for a moment what has occurred : In New South Walesi t was agreed that the Governor General should be allowed to use Government-house in Sydney. That agreement. There is an agreement extending over three years with the right of renewal for a further term of two years. Already a year's payment has been made on that account and on that basis, and no dissentient voice was raised in this House although about the payment of that money. Not a single sound was heard in condemnation of the proposal until now, when honourable members suddenly wake up to find that I they never have been in favour of the maintenance of two Government-houses, and that they never have been in favour as they It has been placed at say of the maintenance of the Government house and grounds in Sydney. Is this the time when they should raise their protest ? It seems to me that they have allowed the whole tiling to go by the board. A f t e r eighteen months of actual occupation of the Government-house in Sydney they wake up to find that they do not approve of the agreement when one-half of its course has run. that there was any such bargain as an agreeCommonwealth ment to take the house for three years or The time has gone past five years.

I hope that he quite understands I do not make the statement offensively; but there is nothing in the wording of the resolution to prevent the Government from coming down in a few months' time, and saying that the mone}' voted is not sufficient for the purpose, and asking for a further appropriation. I feel that there is a great deal of force in tlie view put forward by the honourable member for Parramatta, namely, that tlie Federal Government is committed by the agreement entered into with tlie Government of New South Wales to the maintenance of Government-house at Sydney for a period of three, or, perhaps, five years. I heard of this for the first time to-day, because I much prefer to depend upon official communications than upon news published in the newspapers one day and perhaps svithdrawn the next. The Government have practically taken over Government-house in Sydney from Ist January, 1901, rent free, but subject to an obligation to maintain it in good order. Speaking with all respect, I think this was a mistake on the part of the Government. Buti t is not for us, unless we are prepared to take the extreme course of punishing the Government, to repudiate the bargain made by them. Under the circumstances, therefore, I suggest that we should ease the position, if we could limit the operation of the motion to the period eliding December 31st, 1903. I a in opposed to the maintenance of two Government-houses outof the Commonwealth funds. A t the same time, I wish to assure some honourable members from New South Wales that they are mistaken in supposing that there is a desire on our part to keep the federal capital in Victoria. I speak with a good deal of knowledge when I say that it is not the desire of Victorians to keep the capital in their State. So far as I can gather from most of those with whom I come in contact, they would far rather have the capital inSydney than create a new capital in the bush, as is now provided for under the Constitution. It is placed there for the us adhere to the Constitution. I feel also that the that of most of those with whom I have discussed this matter, is that the amendment of the Constitution made by the Premiers explained why the was.weak, pawky, and inexpedient, and that, looking at the question broadly, it would I had not the advanhave beeu much better had it been left to the Federal Parliament to decide upon the site of the federal capital. However, that is a matter of opinion. It is a pity that at the inception of our Commonwealth, when our finances are not in a particularly flourishing condition, we should be forced to incur the huge expense involved in creating a new federal capital. Another misapprehension which I desire to correct is one upon which the honourable member for Dalley laid great stress. He said that the Government of Victoria had repudiated a bargain into which they had entered with the Government of New South Wales for the contribution of £3,000 per annum towards the maintenance of the establishments of the Governor General. There was no such bargain. I have the correspondence here, and there is no mention of any such compact on the part of the States Premiers.

214,Mr Higgins,"My own opinion, andplatforms in many parts of New South Wales, but there is no evidence whatever to support the statement that such a compact was entered into. Some negotiations took place between the Premier of New South Wales and the Secretary of State for the Colonies with regard to the residence for the Governor General being established in Sydney. Then there was some communication between Sir Edmund Barton, who was in London as a delegate from Australia at the time, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies as to the provision that should be made for the upkeep of the residence. Some correspondence took place between Sir Edmund Barton and the States Premiers, and eventually it would seem that the Premiers of the various States expressed themselves as not entertaining any objection to the Governor General residing in Sydney when Parliament was not in session. Sir the Premier of Victoria submit to. the State Parliament a Bill providing for a contribution by Victoria towards the expenses of the Governor General's establishment 1 gain. Sir WILLIAM not an arrangement between the Premiers that they should submit Bills to their respective Parliaments providing for the contributions? Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN the Premiers submitted Bills to their respective Parliaments shows that there was some arrangement. presumably, the whole of the correspondence, and it does not disclose tlie slightest shadow of a bargain. The New South Wales Parliament voted £3,000 towards the expenses of the Governor General's establishment, and a Bill providing for the payment of a similar sum was brought forward in the Victorian Parliament, and defeated by a very darge majority. There was no bargain entered into between the States. The fact of a Minister introducing a Bill into Parliament does not necessarily imply that any bargain had been entered into to make any payment. The only fact of which the honourable member is sure is that a Bill was introduced. It may be that the Premier of Victoria promised to submit such a Bill, but that did not ; Council: ExpendiM.in-0. 15379 pledge the State Parliament to pass it . I want those honourable members who declare .that a bargain was made to point to the bargain. Where is it? It is very antifederal, and it is certainly very galling to those who desire to keep faith with New South Wales to find such accusations continually being made. So far as I am concerned, although I disapproved of the provision which was inserted in the Constitution with regard to the federal capital, I am bound in honour to expedite the carrying out of that arrangement. I am -quite sure that is our only duty. I am very glad that the Government have declined to allow the Governor General to accept a special contribution from any State Government. I believe that in New South Wales a Bill was passed under which that State would have contributed £3,000 annually towards the vice-regal establishment.

I am pleased indeed that the Ministry have refused to sanction a special contribution from any State Government.

I agree with the Attorney-General that the sum which we are asked to vote in connection with the upkeep of the Sydney Government-house constitutes paring to the bone.""

It has been said that a compact has been made with the people of New South Wales, but that compact, -if made, was made by duress and misrepresentation, and therefore is not binding.

A few months a,go a Bill was introduced to provide for expenditure in connection with the Governor General's establishment, which should have been provided for on the Estimates.

It has been stated to-day that an arrangeconditions. ment was made between the States about revolver the keeping up of two Government-houses, but I remember distinctly that when it was stated in the daily newspapers that Sydney the Parliament of New South Wales had voted a certain sum of money towards making good an additional grant of £10,000 Furthermore, the comto the Governor General, the South Australian Premier of the day was asked in Parliament if he had been consulted about the matter, and his answer was that he knew nothing about it except what he had read in the newspapers.

If the proposal of the Government is anything at all, it is a proposal to enable them to communicate with the Home authorities as to the actual financial position Premier of Victoria at the time, has denied regarding the establishment of future Governors-General. It seems to me to be a very reasonable and sensible proposal. If we carry out the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and confine the operation of the resolution to a period of three years, can we expect that a Governor General will come here under conditions which may be altered during his term of office } I think 1 it would be far better to deal with the matter on the good faith of the Government. They have decided that this is to be taken as an interim provision, subject to alteration in the light of further experience. There are many things which we are doing in this Commonwealth in connection with which it is impossible for any one to know all the conditions and expenses involved. It would certainly be more-business-like to have a proposal which will undergo no change during the term of office of a Governor General. I am sure that,, for the sake of the honour of this House and the credit of its business capacity, honourable members will not consent to a proposal limiting the operation of this resolution to a period of three years, when a Governor General may be in the middle of his term of office. matters which should be considered in dealing with this question is the extent to which the State and people of New South Wales were induced to look to the Commonwealth Government for some arrangement of this character. I know it has been denied that there was anything in the nature of an agreement between the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth, or between the State of New South Wales and the State of Victoria, regarding this matter. Whilsti t is probable that there is nothing in the Federal Constitution relating to the matter, and that there may be nothing in the nature of a formal agreement between the States bearing upon it, I still think there was a certain understanding anterior to federation . between the people and Government of New South Wales and the peoples and Governments of the other States, and particularly of Victoria, who were engaged in negotiations which finally led up to the acceptance of the Constitution by the people of New South Wales. it. denial, and I should like to be sure that he denies that there was any understanding of that character. Acting Prime Minister that Sir George Turner does deny it , and that being so, I am bound to say that the people of New South Wales were under a misapprehension in regard to the matter. When the Constitution was defeated on the first referendum, there were negotiations between the Premiers of the States which led up to what was known in New South Wales as "" the secret conference,"" a conference of the Premiers representing the different States in which certain agreements were arrived at. How they were arrived at is kept secret, because the meetings were not open to the press, and the press and the public weie' only informed that certain conclusions had been arrived at. These were embodied as alterations in the Constitution, which was then submitted to a referendum vote, not only of the people of New South Wales, but of the peoples of the other States who had approved of the original Constitution, with the difference, of course, that on the second occasion Queensland was induced to come in. That State took no part in the first referendum, and at that stage appeared to have made up her mind to stand outside of the federal movement for the time being. It was represented to the people of New South Wales that, as the result of the Premiers' conference, certain arrangements were to be made, and, amongst others, that the federal capital should be located in New South Wales, subject to certain -limitations, and that in the meantime the Federal Parliamentshould meet in Melbourne.

249,Mr Brown,"I have it now from thebelieve, was that the understanding arrived at by the conference was that, whilst the Commonwealth Parliament should meet in Melbourne, it should be necessary for the Governor General to reside in that city, and it was therefore necessary that the State of Victoria should make provision for his residence. It was also understood that during the recess, when honourable members had returned to their respective States, the Governor General, if he chose, should reside in the chief city of Kew South Wales. That was one position placed before the people of New South Wales prior to the taking of the referendum. ber say that any federal leader in New sSouth Wales asserted that that was an un>dei""standing 1 to name any federal leader who asserted that, but I think I can be borne out in the statement that that impression was prevalent in New South'Wales. So far'as I am personally concerned, that consideration had no weight with me, because when the question of remitting the decision as to the seat of the Federal Government to the Premiers' conference was proposed in the State Parliament of New South Wales, I was one of the few who voted against it. I considered that there were other issues, culb bo induce bhem to believe bhat there of far greater importance, which should receive attention. But in battling against the acceptance of the Constitution on the second referendum, I was met with this argument at nearly every meeting I add lessee!: Ib was conbended that there would be no injustice done to New South Wales under the arrangement that the Governor General should divide his residence in the Commonwealth between that State and Victoria during the time preceding the allocation of the federal territory. This was an important consideration in the minds of the people of New South Wales, and was urged very strongly as an inducemenb bo them to adopt the Constitution. There were indications of some general undersbanding, because the Government of New South Wales initiated legislation making provision for a contribution by that State towards the expenses of the Governor General's esbablishment. The Premier of Victoria introduced similar legislation into the Parliament of that State, and if he had been sufficiently supported, Victoria would have stood committed to a contribution of £3,000 per annum. Now we are told that this acti on was taken quite apart from any understanding arrived at by the Premiers of the States. I am bound to accepb bhe assurance of bhe Acting Prime Minister that there was no understanding, but it is difficult to conceive how such a strong impression could have been created in the minds of the legislators and the people generally of New South Wales in the absence of some compact such as has been referred to. The Premier of Victoria, at least, thought at one time that an arrangement of this kind should be entered into, and there must have been some common inspiration for his action, and thab taken by the Premiersi n other States. We were not informed in New South Wales that the course adopted by the Government of New South Wales was the result of I am not prepared now despatches received from the Secretary of Sbate for the Colonies, but we were led to believe that it was due to an understanding arrived at between the Premiers at the conference held by them some little time before. The matter has now reached such a stage that this Parliament is in duty bound to adopt the Government proposals. If tlie people of New South Wales were misled, their misapprehension should have. been corrected before this, as it is rather late in bhe day bo disillusionise bhem. Ib will be diffiwas no understanding, .and any attempt to vary the arrangements for the residence of the Governor General in Sydney will be regarded by them as a manifestation of an anti-federai spirit. I do nob see bhab bhere is any greab objection to the Governor General visiting the capitals of the Commonwealth. It is not desirable that the Governor General should be tied to Melbourne while the seat of government is in that city, or that, when the Federal Parliament is established in ibs permanenb home, we should place a ring fence around bhe capital and prevent the Governor General from visiting the capitals of bhe various Sbates. member be in favour of maintaining six. establishments-one in each of bhe capitals 1 to His Excellency every facility for visiting the States, and if the Government of South Australia will place a residence at his disposal, I am willing that-that State should be treated in exactly the same way as the others.

253,Mr Brown,"I am prepared to grantMr O'Malley, has stated that there is no necesanticipation of that compact being honorsity for a Governor General in a'democracy, but that question should have been dealt with when tlie Constitution was being framed. It is all very well to talk about the appointment of a Governor General being inimical to a true democracy, but if the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, will turn to the United States, he will see that the people there have been ground down by multi-millionaires to a far greater extent than have the people under our system of government. If the honourable member wishes to do away with those elements in the community that are detrimental to the best interests of democracy he will require to turn his attention first to the abolition of multi-millionaires and trusts. As a federation under the Crown we must have some one representing the Crown. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne denied that there was any question of federal feeling involved in this matter, and he stated that he would be loth to do anything that would convey the impression to the people of New South Wales that the opposition to the residence of the Governor General in Sydney was due to tlie existence of an anti-federal spirit in Victoria. A t the same time the honourable and learned member wishes to limit the operation of the motion to the period for which the Ministers have entered into an arrangement with the Government of New South Wales. I would point out, however, that if it is a good thing to ratify the arrangement entered into for that period it should be just as desirable to continue it until such time as the Federal Parliament is located in its permanent home. member see that the motion provides for the residence of the Governor General in Sydney for all time 1 honourable member. It simply provides for the residence of the Governor-Generali n Sydney during the period which must elapse before the federal capital is established. When the residence of the Governor General has been established within federal territory, it will be open to this Parliament to decide whether tlie present arrangement in respect of Melbourne, and the proposed arrangement in respect of Sydney, or any of the other State capitals shall continue. Honourable members should recollect that in ably carried out, the Government of New South Wales, at considerable expense to themselves, have handed over the State Government-house for the accommodation of the Governor General. They have arranged for the accommodation of the State Governor elsewhere. Are they now to be told that that arrangement was made upon their own initiative, 'and that tlie federal authorities are under no obligation in respect to it ? That would be an unfair position to assume towards the Government or people of New South Wales. I intend to support the proposal which has been submitted by the Attorney-General, because I believe that it loyally carries out pre-federal arrangements. Instead of the people of New South Wales forcing this matter on by misrepresentation, it seems to me that if the compact is not carried out they will have every right to complain. MrM c C AY (Corinella) -In listening to this debate, I was very much surprised at the statement made by some honourable members from across the border that in New South Wales the Constitution was carried because it was understood that the Governor General was to reside there for a few months in each of a few years. Without doubting the veracity of any honourable member, that statement appears to me to be almost incredible. There was no State in the Unioni n which the Constitution in all its bearings was so fully discussed as it was in New South Wales, and under those circumstances I can scarcely realize that such a comparatively unimportant matter as where the Crown's representatives should reside during a few of the earlier years of the federation carried so much not the honourable weight. But leaving out of consideration what was the understanding, it seems to me that this is not a question of whether Victoria or New South Wales is to hold up the I do nof agree with the body of the Governor General for a few years as the spoils of war. The question is whether we are to establish a good or bad precedent regarding the expenditure of moneys belonging to the public, who we know are insistent that this Parliament shall exercise economy in every possible direction. ment of the capital site. MrM c CAY I have not the slightest objection to the adoption of that course. I think it was a huge mistake to insert",48,Mcmillan Was There Governor General S Duties Are Towards The

256,Mr Wilks,"L e t us have a speedy settlein the Constitution the provision relating to that matter, and to bar all the other State capitals from becoming the future federal capital. The 100-miles ring around Sydney is not nearly as big as is the ring around the other capitals. I should be perfectly willing to put the names of Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaidei n a hat, and to draw lots as to which should be the capital. But, after all, the determination of this question, or of the temporary residenceof the Governor General, is of small importance compared wibh the great matters at issue in connection wibh bhe federation. I cannob assume that the people of New South Wales would believe that that State had been wronged if Parliament declined to vote an annual sum of £2,000 for the maintenance of the vice-regal establishment in Sydney. The real question at issue is, whether in expending this money, we are setting a good example in regard to economies which must be exercised by this Parliament in all sorts of directions' for years to come, if the States are to be assisted in keeping down unnecessary expenditure. It has been said, and certainly the correspondence was laid upon the table to-day induces the belief, that we have entered into a sort of tenancy in respect of the Government-houses in Sydney and Melbourne. Granting that that is so, I cannot see why we should ask the people of -the Commonwealth to continue' that tenancy any longer than is necessary. In each case the conbract expires ab bhe end of 1903, and I do nob see why ib should continue one moment longer. In certain despatches it is even suggested bhab when the Federal capibal is established a third residence, should be provided for the Governor General. Apparently we are to have one residence at the Federal capital, another at Melbourne, and a third at Sydney. When the Federal capibal has been esbablished within Commonwealth territory, I shall certainly refuse to vote for the maintenance of any vice-Regal residence, either in Melbourne or Sydney. I would not now vobe for bhe upkeep of bhe Governmenb-house in Melbourne, if Parliament were not sitting here. Bub where Parliament is in session, there bhe Governor General musb be located. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary thab the Governor General should have an establishment in Melbourne. That is unavoidable in the carrying on of the Government of the country, and that is bhe reason why I distinguish between the two portions of bhis motion. I am satisfied bhab the possibiliby of having the Governor General's presence in Melbourne for a few monbhs each year did not induce bhe people of Vicboria bo accepb bhe Federal Consbibubion. They accepted it was a good bargain. MrM c CAY I am sure that if they entertained that impression they are very much disappointed. But the fact is that they accepted it because they believed that Victoria, like the rest of Australia, would benefit by the union, and in spite of all bhab has been said, I think that most of us believe bhab bhis great machine, so soon as ibs bearings geb inbo proper order, will work smoothly. There was bound bo be trouble at the beginning, and that trouble has been accentuated by the great drought which has overbaken Australia. I do not think that New South Wales will consider that she has been grievously wronged if Governmenbhouse is not kept open for bhe occupation of the Governor General during four or five months in each year. It is because I feel that the maintenance of two vice-Regal establishments constitutes an example of unnecessary expenditure in high places thab I cannot support the proposal of the Government. In discussing matters of this kind, the people seize upon poinbs here and there. They will be only too ready to say"" You have spent so many thousands of pounds in connection with the Governor General, and yet you refuse to expend a thousand pence to assist certain people who are in very much more need of it . "" In spite of the moral effect which the presence of His Excellency might have upon Sydney, I think that ibs nabural attractions are quibe sufficienb. I feel, bound bo abide by the bargain which I consider has been made, and which must continue for three years from the date of the inauguration of the Commonwealth, much as I disapprove of it . It would be quibe useless, however, bo continue that arrangement until just after the beginning of a Governor General's term of office. I hold that the Government should not have made such an arrangement until it had ascertained the wishes of Parliament in this matter. Occasionally, however, bhe Government have assumed too much and have discovered that their ideas concerning the wishes of this House have been very much at fault.

257,Mr Wilks,"Becaus e they thought i tthe motion, and in the performance of what 1 conceive to be my duty, but in no spirit of hostility to niy friends across the border, to vote against it . think that something should be said by the representatives of New South Wales in regard to the proposal of the Government to expend £5,500 upon the up-keep of the Government-houses in Sydney and Melbourne, because honourable gentlemen opposite appear to have overlooked the fact that an agreement was entered into with the Government of New South Wales to lease the Government-house in Sydney for a period of three years, .with the .right of renewal for another two years. In view of that agreement, the Government of New South Wales spent £20,000 in adding to the building, and another £7,000 in providing a residence for the State Governor. Yet honourable gentlemen opposite tell us that they did not know of any such agreement. to which the honourable member refers entered into before the agreement was made 1 in view of the possibility of Government house being used by the Governor General. had not committed themselves at the time. was an understanding that the Governor General should reside in Sydney for a certain period of the year. If the honourable member is of the opinion that £20,000 was spent upon the building because it was in a state of disrepair, I would like to inform him that only a short time previously something like £7,000 was spent in renovating it for the reception of Lord Beauchamp, and that every year a large sum of money is voted for its maintenance. been no agreement with the Federal Government it would not have been necessary to provide a residence for the State Governor, but as that has been done, and as the New South Wales Government have spent a large sum in adding to and improving the old Government-house, because of the agreement with the Federal Government, it is the duty of this Parliament to see that the agreement is honorably kept. There is no inclination on the part of the Government to withdraw from it, but some of their supporters seem to be unable to find a reason for supporting them on this occasion. I would point out to the representatives of Victoria that the agreement in regard to the Government-house, Melbourne, is no more binding than the agreement in regard to the Governmeut-house, Sydney. That being so, why should they wish the Government to withdraw from one and to fulfil the other 1 The attitude of those honourable gentlemen is a display of that provincialism of which we have heard so much. There may be a feeling on their part that, if the Governor General resides in Sydney, the occupancy of Government-house, Melbourne, may be on a less firm and lasting footing. I do not wish to-see the Governor General continue to reside in Melbourne, because another compact was entered into with New South Wales, and that was that the federal capital and the permanent residence of the Governor General should be within the borders of that State; but until the federal capital is chosen I think the Governor-Generalshould live part not the expenditure of the year in Sydne}', and part of the year in Melbourne. Apparently provision has been made for the occupancy of the It was incurred -Sydney Government-house for four months in the year. The representatives of Victoria cannot find much to grumble at in that, seeing that he will reside eight months in Melbourne. New South Wales is being called upon to occupy a position I think there second to that of South Australia in this matter, because Lord Tennyson, since he has been Acting Governor General, has made several trips to Adelaide, while he has not been to Sydney at all, and we have .no guarantee that that state of things will not continue. be a Commonwealth Government-house in Adelaide? Had there jection to the Governor General visiting Adelaide. In my opinion it is his duty to make himself seen and known in every State capital. When I was in Canada, I was informed that the Dufferin-mansion, at Quebec, is occupied for a period every year by the Governor General of the Dominion, and the representatives of New South Wales ask that Government-house, Sydney, shall be similarly occupied by the Governor General of Australia.

The honourable and learned member for Corinella seemed to say that if it were a question of the Commonwealth being legally bound bo New Soubh Wales, he would be inclined to accept the position. Then he said afterwards that he could not accept a half-way arrangement He did not put his position veiy clearly, but the impression he-left upon my mind was that, if he were satisfied thab an agreement had been made between the Eederal Government and the Government of New South Wales, he would be prepared to abide by that agreement. While honourable members have been speaking, I have gone carefully through the correspondence, and I have come to the conclusion, as regards the making of a contract, that if this were a contract between two private individuals, and brought before a court of equiby, on bhe correspondence which has baken place, bogebher wibh bhe acbs of possession and ownership exercised over the property in New Soubh Wales, the court would decree specific performance in bhe case of either parby bo bhe conbract. The correspondence sbarbs as early as lSbh June, 1901, when bhe Prime Minister writes as follows to the Premier of New South Wales:I shall be glad if you will kindly take into your early consideration the question of the occupancy of Government-house, Sydney, by the Government of the Commonwealth, for the purpose of a residence for His Excellency the Governor General. It will probably be necessary to arrange for the occupation of the buildings and grounds for a term oi three or five years, and I shall be pleased to receive any proposals you may have to make upon the subject. Tlie Commonwealth Government will, as a matter of course, maintain the house, offices, grounds, &c, and ment is always a condition. effect any repairs which may become necessary during the term of occupancy. After that letter was written a similar are made by administrative officers, and if letter was writben bo the Premier of Victhe approval of Parliament were always a' toria, and the correspondence shows that condition,' ib would be impossible for the head of the Government, acting eviMinisters to carry on the work of their dedently upon Executive authority, enbered partments, involving, as they do, the making inbo a contract wibh bhe Commonwealbh of numerous small contracts.

Lookbhe Commonwealbh, as a whole, will fee! ing at the question purely as a question of itself bound by bhe acb of ibs Executive law, I am of opinion that as regards New officers. We can only acb bhrough agenbs, South Wales and the Commonwealth,, we Mr L. E. Groom. and we are bound by their acbs, although we may disapprove of particular terms of a contract. It will be found that ultimately the Prime Minister of the Commonwealbh wrote bo bhe Premier of New Soubh Wales asking whether bhe Government of New South Wales were prepared to lend Government-house in Sydney to the Commonwealth for the purpose of residence by the Governor General, upon the same terms and conditions as Governmenb-house in Vicboria had been lenb by bhe Governmenb of bhatState. Ib will be seen from thecorrespondence that the-Premier of New South Wales was agreeable to the occupancy of Government-house in Sydney upon the same terms. Throughout the correspondence it will be seen that definite terms are set out, and that a draft of a lease was before the two Cabinets. Then the Premier of New South Wales accepted it , and the Commonwealth Government accepted it. Not only did they do that, but the Commonwealth Government absolutely entered into possession of the building, and exercised effective ownership by appointing their own caretakers and making the repairs. On the other hand, the State Government of New South Wales ceased to exercise any control whatever over it, and became parties to another lease, making provision, at great expense, for a residence for the Sbabe Governor for a long berm of years. If honourable members w ere, bhrough an agenb, parties bo a conbract with a privabe individual, established under bhe berms of bhe contract agreed to by the Eederal Government, they would feel that they had bound themselves to take Government-house in Sydney for a definite term of years.

I put of honourable members of this House if the the matter now upon another ground, and contention is urged in a federal spirit, I say that we owe a duty to New South which I think is a spirit characteristic of Wales to carry out what may be really only honourable members from our State. an understanding.

MrL . E. GROOM -It is not a question of testimony. The point is whether the people of New South Wales had any reason to believe that a compact had been made, and I am pointing out that they had. I can rely only upon the evidence before us. It may be misleading, but it is vouched for feeling. The States which are more remote by very high authorities, and must be accepted until we have some stronger written testimony to set against it . There are further telegrams on the same question in which expressions similar to those quoted by me will be found. We know that there was some communication with the Home Government when the Secretary of State for the Colonies issued a despatch dealing with the provision to be made for the resicordially support them. dences of the Governor-Generali n New South Wales and Victoria, and prior to that despatch the Parliament of New South Wales, evidently acting upon some understanding, passed a Bill providing for a conGeneral's residence in Sydney. Nothing tribution by the State to the expenses of the Governor General. The Parliament of New South AA alcs believed that the 7 Governor General was to reside in Sydney, and everything was directed to that end. Through every act that was performed by persons in authority-by tlie Parliament, by the State Governor, and by the Secretary of State for the Colonies-the people of New South Wales had heid out to them the expectation that, for a certain time at least, the Governor General would reside in Sydney. MrL . E. GROOM -No, for a certain time only. pression prior to the second referendum. MrL . E. GROOM I do not know that the referendum has anything to do with this particular promise. The people accepted the Constitution because they thought thatNewSouth Wales was tohavethefederal capital located within her territory. The people of that State will feel that they have any court would compel the Governora substantial grievance if the arrangement which they believed to have been entered into is not carried out. They have spent large sums of money in fitting up Government-houso as a residence for the Governor General, and they will have just reason to complain if we do not keep faith with them. If it were open to me to decide from the beginning, I should be strongly opposed to the maintenance of two residences for His Excellency the Governor General. I should much prefer one residence for His Excellency, and that adequate provision should be made for him to travel through the whole of the States. His occasional presence in the various cities would help materially to strengthen the federal from the centres of federal activity do not receive many visits from those in authority and those who represent authority ""in the Commonwealth, and in this way federal influence is weakened. I regard the proposals of' the Government generally as just and reasonable, and as economical to an extent which will meet with the approval of honourable members. I shall, therefore, pressed by the honourable member for Darling Downs would lead to the conclusion that for all time there must be a Governorelse will meet the logic of his arguments, because he has told us that in his view there has been a compact or agreement made by whom we do not know, and when and where we are not told. The details of this agreement are delightfully vague and nebulous, and all that the honourable member can tell us is that it was made at some place by some one. Does any one believe that it was ever supposed that Sydney should be the sole place of residence for the Governor General for all time t Yet this is the conclusion that my honourable and learned friend desires -us to endorse. AVe are asked to believe that it was agreed that the residence of the Governor General should be in New South Wales, and that is the bargain which my honourable and learned friend says could be enforced in a court of law.

280,Mr Isaacs,"I should like to know i fother grounds.than those advanced here tonight. The Government have done right in asking for an expression of opinion from honourable members as to their desires with regard to the basis upon which the Governor General's establishment shall be founded. We are asked under the terms of the motion to say that two Governmenthouses shall be maintained at an annual expenditure of £5,500. The Acting Prime Minister has very fairly, and very properly, put it to us that, until they obtain an expression of opinion from honourable members, the Government will not be in a position to inform the Home Government as to what the future Governor General may expect, and therefore it is right that they should bring down their proposals at the earliest possible moment. the motion words providing that it shall apply during the term of office of the next Governor General. keeping with the view which the Acting Prime Minister has presented, but I do not agree with it . It goes further than I am disposed to follow, but it is a fair proposal to make to the House, and the Government are adopting a proper method of procedure. Speaking for myself, however, I am not disposed to go further than to ratify the bargain which has been actually made by the Government. Ministers ought to be supported to the extent to which they have committed the honour of the Commonwealth in the bargain made with the New South Wales Government up to the end of the year 1903. I am prepared to support them thus far, but beyond that I am not going, because I cannot see where we should be able to stop. If we adopt the suggestion of the Acting Prime Minister, and limit the operation of the motion to the term of office of the next Governor General, we might reasonably be called upon afterwards to continue the arrangement for all time. Why should not the Governor General following enjoy the same advantages as were conferred upon his immediate predecessor? Our friends from New South Wales have taken up a position which we scarcely expected them to adopt. If they had argued that the Governor General could not perform his duties without a residence in Sydney, I could understand their point. I am not, however, disposed to agree with them that because Sydney is said to be the greatest city in Australia, and more wealthy and important and more fortunate than any other, we should call upon the other less fortunate States to contribute to its still further aggrandizement. We should be careful to see that there is only one establishment for the Governor-Generali n Australia. I may not be here when the time comes to carry out that view, but I think that it would be distinctly improper to have a Governor General's establishment in either Melbourne or Sydney, when the federal capital is established. I should he opposed to any such proposal. A t the same time, I do not think that, even in view of the revilings Victoria has received at the hands of the honourable member for Dalley-wh o has done more to damage the I am prepared to add to cause of New South Wales than any other honourable member in this Chamber-w e should depart from the strict path of duty by failing to support the Government in carrying out the compact into which they have entered with the Government of New South Wales. There would, however, be no justification for asking AVestern Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland to' help in maintaining an unnecessary establishment for the Governor General in another State. The Governor General has to visit other parts of the Commonwealth, and when he goes to Perth, or Brisbane, or Hobart he is able to make adequate arrangements for his comfort and for carrying out his duties. Surely similar provision can be made in Sydney for housing him as becomes his position. T can see no reason, therefore, for making any distinction in favour of either Sydney or Melbourne. Only one sound reason has been advanced for the maintenance of a second establishment for the Governor General, and that is that a compact has been made with the New South Wales Government for a period of three years, ending in December, 1903. That is a valid ground for supporting the Government to that limit, but I must decline to carry the matter any further. Upon one side will be found some honourable members who take that view, and upon the other those who do not. Everything, however, will centre round this question"" AVhat justification is there for expending Commonwealth money in the establishment and maintenance of a needless Governor General's establishment?"" I do not believe",55,Honourable Members No

I think that the people of that State are worthy of every proper consideration, and that they are above entertaining the petty considerations with which they have been credited. not support the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, because I do not agree with what has been said by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs. The latter has, with his visual fairness, put the view that if the Ministery enter into a compact we are bound to abide by it . But I would point out that there are limits to compacts imposed by the Constitution. is not for us to ratify agreements made outside of the provisions of that Constitution. If the Ministry had entered into compacts with the Government of New South Wales, and with tlie Governments of the other States, to provide a residence for the Governor General in each of them, surely the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs would not argue that we should be bound to abide by them. ' They are not prescribed by the Constitution. WhilstI should be prepared to support any action of the Ministry, which, upon a fair construction, is in accordance with the constitutional powers that they ought to administer, I will not be bound by every foolish compact into which they may enter. I decline to have my judgment forestalled by any executive act. The Ministry ought not to have entered into the arrangement revealed. Government of New South Wales ought to have known what the Constitution prescribed. we are under no moral obligation to support this compact. It must have been known that it was purely provisional, and the Government of New South Wales were very foolish to attempt to forestall our judgment by an expenditure ©f £20,000, because they must have known that to extend the residences of the Governor General was not one of the powers regularly arising under the Constitution. Surely the essence of the prescription in the Constitution is that the seat of Government shall be where Parliament is sitting. is not expressly declared that Parliament must sit at the seat of Government. All that is set out is that until it meets at the seat of Government, Parliament shall sit in Melbourne. But, although it is not expressly stated, we know that it is implied that the moment we have a permanent seat of Government the Parliament and the Executive must be located there. It might suit the convenience of Ministers to have a second seat of the Executive in Sydney for five or six months during the year. It might suit the Prime Minister, who comes from New South Wales, to remain there for several months each year, and have the Governor at his elbow. But we are not bound to bring about such conditions for the convenience of Ministers. If we agree to the principle laid down in this motion, we may have one set of MinisIt ters in Victoria, and another in New South Wales. Was that ever intended ? In the very resolutions adopted by the Premier's' conference, the words ""seat of Government"" were not used. The word ""capital"" was used to indicate the seat of the Executive and of Parliament. Where is the capital now? Undoubtedly it is in Melbourne, and the Executive ought to be here. All Ministers should be here. They must accept the temporaiy inconvenience which attaches to their positious. We should be placing ourselves in an exceedingly false position if we allowed the Treasurer and the Attorney-General to administer their departments in Melbourne, two other members of the Government to perform their duties in Sydney, and the Postmaster-General to control his department from Brisbane. We should have to get an ambulatory Governor General, put him in a balloon, and memI n addition to that, the bers provide him with gas. There is another aspect of this question, namely, "" Should we be quite considerate to the Governor General For that additional reason, himself under the proposal of the Government?"" The sum of £2,000 is a very small one to vote for the upkeep of the Sydney Government-house. It almost approaches to parsimony. I do not begrudge the expenditure of that amount, but if we compel His Excellency to reside in Sydney during five or six months of ' the year, we shall increase the sum which he will be required to pay out of his salary of £10,000. If he has to reside for a certain period in Sydney, he will certainlv have to reciprocate the courtesies extended I am aware that it to him, and thus we shall increase, if we do not duplicate, the number of entertainments which he will be called upon",56,Honourable Members No
283,Mr Glynn (South Australia),"I canto provide. What will follow ? Simply1 added prestige to New South Wales. .Surely the prestige for what it is worth ought to belong to the Commonwealth. Under the Government proposal, it is true that a few more social coteries would be entertained, but that will mean a considerable increase in the private expenditure of the Governor General. He cannot remove his necessary attendants without incurring an outlay above that which he would be called upon to bear if he resided in only one Government-house. Considering that we have cut down the allowances of the Governor General almost to the border of niggardliness, we ought not to add to his expenditure. For that reason I cannot support the duplication of the Vice-Regal establishment. I admit that anj' obligations imposed upon the Commonwealth by the Premiers' conference should be carried out as speedily as. possible. Federal capital cannot be established in Sydney. In regard to that matter I entertain so very little.feeling, that if a proposition weie made to-morrow to amend the Constitution by cancelling the 100 miles limit provision, I should support it . It was an exceedingly bad condition to impose, and originated only in the petty rival jealousies of two of the States. The Constitution has been somewhat marred by that provision, which emanated from the narrow parochialism of certain persons in Victoria and .New South Walesa parochialism which is shared by politicians more than by the people. I object to the duplication of the Vice-Regal establishments, not because of the expenditure involved, but because it is unnecessary and inexpedient, and is not an obligation cast upon us by any compact which we ought to respect. this debate, the one point which has struck me is that those who support the Government proposal urge that as it does not constitute a very great lapse from the path of economy, we might very well sanction it, especially as we have the assurance that the mistake will not be repeated. accept any such excuse for a departure from what, to my mind, involves a very important principle, namely, that theGovernor-General's residence shall be established at the seat of Government. I do not concede that any other arrangement was ever intended by the people of Australia when they expressed themselves as willing to join the Commonwealth. As far as Western Australia is concerned, it comes with a great deal of surprise to myself and others to discover that proposals were made of such a definite nature as those which have been placed before Parliament in regard to the establishment of the Governor General in Sydney. I have to ask myself only one or two simple questions in order to arrive at a decision upon this matter. The first is, "" D o the people of New South Wales as a whole really demand that His Excellency should spend a portion of his time in their capital?"" I cannotfindanyevidencethattheydo. Neither can I discover that the people of Sydney, as a whole, are anxious that that course should be followed. ThenI have to ask myself whether, if the question were put to him, any Governor General would prefer to remain in any one city during a portion of the year, and to spend the balance of his Personally, I regret that the time in another? I can understand that he would be naturally anxious to visit different parts of the Commonwealth, but I feel certain that he would emphatically declare that he would be better circumstanced if he wer-e required to maintain only one ViceRegal establishment. Therefore, I fail to discover that any useful purpose will be served by the adoption of the Government proposal. AVe have heard a great deal about the maintenance of a federal spirit requiring the proposed arrangement. But would not the maintenance of that spirit cover similar proposals with regard to the other States? If we are to provide two residences for the Governor General, why should we not provide six ? No reason has been alleged why we should be restricted to two. Of course we are told that Sydney and Melbourne are the two populous cities of the Commonwealth. If the claim of a State to have the Governor General residing there is to depend upon its population, surely all the States are entitled, in greater or lesser degree, to that privilege, though, perhaps, in the case of a sparsely populated State, like Western Australia, we might have to be content with having the I cannot Governor General's court dress sent over to us now and again. AVe hope that the Governor General will visit us occasionally, and that the members of this Parliament will come, too. But we shall not worrv very much if no special expenditure is voted to provide for his or their accommodation, and if they come they will experience no inconvenience because of that fact.

If the salary provided is too big, it should be cut down ; but whatever is given should be si clear salarySir LANGD ON BONYTH ON (South Australia) -A t this late hour I do not intend to take up the time of the committee at any length ; but 1 feel that it is a pity that the matter has occupied the attention of honourable members at all. It will be seen from the correspondence which was laid on the table of the House to-day by the Acting Prime Minister, that the Minister for Home Affairs, when Premier of New South Wales, suggested to the Colonialoffice that, as the Federal Parliament would meet in Melbourne, it was desirable to determine that the, official residence of the Governor General should be in Sydney when lain, in reply to that representation, said that he had no objection to the arrangement if the federating States agreed to it, if the Federal Government when it came into existence approved of it, and if the necessary provision were made to carry it out. federating States did not agree to it, and* the Federal Government, in failing to act on the suggestion of Mr Chamberlain to obtain the opinion of Parliament on the subject at the earliest moment, have caused all the trouble which has occurred in the past, aud the discussion which has taken place to day. Personally, I feel rather in a difficulty. I in no way object to the amount the Government are asking for in this resolution. I think the sum proposed is very reasonable indeed; nor do I object that that money should be expended both in Sydney and in Melbourne. But I feel that we as a Parliament should be very careful to do nothing by which it might seem to be incumbent upon the Governor General to maintain two establishments. W it h the greatest possible readiness I shall be prepared to give the amount of money asked for in this resolution, in addition to the £10,000 provided in the Constitution as the salary of the Governor General, but I desire that there should be the clearest understanding that the Govern or-General is expected to have only one establishment, and that he can reside elsewhere as may be convenient to himself. Of course, I realize that in practice the Governor General will reside in 43 B Melbourne when Parliament is in session, and that he will reside in Sydney for the most, part when Parliament is not sitting, but I think honourable members should be very careful indeed not to affirm that there should be two Government residences, because if any affirmation of that kind is made, we may depend upon it that the amount 'asked for to-night will be only a part of the amount which will be asked for in future years. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) Anyone who has followed the debate to-night, must have thought that the people of New South Wales are simply yearning to have the Governor General amongst them, and that as a matter of fact they came into the Federation only on the understanding that he should reside in that State for a certain time. undertaking should be carried out. MrM c DONALD I think that the position taken up by the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the honorable and learned member for South Australia, MrG lynn, is the correct one, and the committeeAs a matter of fact, however, the should take it seriously into consideration. The whole desire seems to be that, becausecertain members of the Government are residents of New South Wales, the locationof the executive authority should be divided"" between New South Wales and Victoria,, merely to suit the convenience of those: Ministers. It appears to me that honourable members of this committee, as well as Ministers, should be considered. Some honourable members, owing to the peculiar position in which they are placed, have been forcedpractically to abandon their homes and reside in Melbourne. If the executive authority is to be divided, and some Ministers are to reside in Sydney, while others reside in Melbourne, and probably one in Brisbane,, honourable members in conducting the business of their constituents may have to be chasing Ministers all over the Commonwealth. That is not a desirable state of affairs. When we have the federal capital established, I presume that it will be regarded as the place of residence of the Governor General and the seat of government. But until the federal capital is established Melbourne should be accepted as the capital for the time being, and the Governor General should reside here and nowhere else. On these grounds I intend",59,Honourable Members No
290,Parliament Was Not Sitting. Mr Chamber,,60,Honourable Members No
291,Mr Thomson,"They may yearn that anto vote against any proposal for the establishment of a second residence for the Governor General. I shall do so, though I would personally prefer that Parliament should sit in Sydney. Though a native of Victoria, I prefer New South Wales to this State. Apart from these considerations I am against this increase of £5,500. I think ' that the £10,000 a vear should be sufficient to cover the whole expense. We are told that it was never expected that the Governor General should meet all expenses out of the £10,000 a year salary. But I am of opinion that the general impression was-a t all events it was so in Queensland -that the£10,000a year was to cover all expensesin connection with the Governor General's establishment, just in the same way that it was generally expected that £ 4 0 0 a year was to cover the expenses of honourable , members in attending this Parliament. If the salary of £10,000 is not sufficient for the the subject has been asked in this House, Governor General, and it is proper that the Government should make further provision, it would be right on just the same grounds that they should meet 'the expense of house rent, fuel, and light incurred by members of the Eederal Parliament. I do not say that I believe that that should be done, but that it would be a logical thing to do if it is right that it should be done for the Governor General. I protest .that all through . these proceedings the Government have attempted to keep something back. The whole matter is kept practically in the dark for eighteen months, and then we are informed that certain compacts have been entered into. I think that is wrong, and hope a similar state of affairs will not occur again. Nearly every honourable member who has spoken to-day has complained on this account, butnotone seeins tobeprepared to take .any further action. These matters, though small in themselves, may lead to the House being asked to approve transactions of a .much more important character, simply because the Government have given promises iu some secret way. feel impelled to vote with the Government upon this matter, notwithstanding the very weighty speeches we have heard in opposition, and especially from the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr only voice with which they can speak, in Glynn. Both those honourable and learned members appear to have ignored the true position. It is clear that the Executive of the Commonwealth has entered into a distinct bargain with the State of New South Wales. We cannot ignore that fact. I fully admit that the Government have been to blame. They possibly should have told honourable members much earlier what they were doing. But upon that point I would remind honourable members that they are constantly asking questions upon paragraphs appearing in the press. If I may be permitted to say so, I think that this practice is too generally adopted. No sooner do honourable members see a paragraph in a newspaper affecting some portion of their States than they immediately come forward with a question. It has been well known for some time that the Government house in Sydney was prepared for the Governor General, and that a separate building was provided by that State for the State Governor, and yet no question upon and no pressure has been brought to bear upon the Government in the matter. Honourable members are now complaining of secrecy, and that the Government have not taken the House into their confidence. I might ask why the honourable member for Kennedy did not come forward with questions upon the subject night after night, as he would have done if the matter affected the Kanaka question, the question of the pearl-shelling industry in Torres Straits, or the number of Italians introduced into his State. If the honourable member felt this to be such a burning question, why did he not bring it before the House night after night in order that the hand of the Government might be forced 1 I think it would be a very serious thing for the committee to ignore a distinct compact made by our Executive authority with the Executive of New South Wales. Undoubtedly the Commonwealth is passing through troubled waters. There has been a great deal of friction, and if we now ignore the action of our Executive from some fear of constituting a precedent, deciding whether the Governor General shall live hereafter in one or more States, we shall emphasize the feeling of irritation which I fear already exists in New South Wales. In answer to the honourable member for Perth, I would remind him that the people of New South Wales did vote money through their State Parliament, the order that the Governor General might live in Sydney during a portion of the year.",60,Honourable Members No
292,Mr Winter Cooke (Wannon),"Iof in many quarters. said with regard to the decisions of any Parliament;. The New South Wales Parliament was the -only voice through which the opinions of the electors could be expressed at that time, and they voted money for the maintenance of the Governor General's establishment in Sydney. As the acting leader of the Opposition has stated, it would be humiliating for this Parliament, and for the Governor General, if New South Wales, upon finding that this Parliament refused to supply the necessary money, were to undertake to maintain at their own cost an establishment for the Governor General in Sydney. I ask honourable members to consider the question from that aspect. I listened very carefuUy to the arguments adduced by honourable members, and I was very much influenced by the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the honourable and learned member for South Australia,. Mr Glynn, but we have staring us in the face the fact that if we do not agree to support the Government in this matter we shall be accused of a breach of faith. desire to propose an amendment omitting from the motion the words "" and upon the Federal Executive Council of £1,925 a year."" I do not see any necessary relation between the Governor General's establishment and the Federal Executive Council, and there is no more reason why we should express our approval of this proposed expenditure than that we should sanction expenditure in the department of Home Affairs. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I have a prior amendment. I move That the motion be amended by the omission of the figures "";£5,500,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the figures "" ;e3,101.""0 My object is to omit from the motion the provision for the maintenance of a second establishment for the Governor General in Sydney. or two with regard to the general motion before the committee, and particularly in reference to the"" remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta. will understand that the amendment of the honourable member for Kennedy would not only omit the provision for the maintenance of Government-house in Sydney, but would 43 R z also prevent us from keeping the engagement into which we have entered with, the Government of New South Wales up to the end of next year. I trust that whatever views honourable members may entertain as to the expediency of continuing the occupation of Government-house in Sydney, they will at no time be willing to throw upon the hands of the Government of New South Wales, who have treated us so generously, the building which they have placed at our disposal, and for which they have provided an expensive substitute as a residence for the State Governor. I propose to add to the motion the words, ""during the term of office of the next Governor General."" The Governor General is appointed practically for five years, and the object of bringing this matter before the committee at present is to enable the Secretary of State for the Colonies to communicate to the gentleman to whom the position of Governor General may be offered the conditions which will .attach to his occupancy of the office. The honourable member for Parramatta will see that it is for this reason that the alteration proposed to be made in the provision for the Executive Council is here introduced. Hitherto we have been content to pay a nominal sum to the officer who has discharged the duties of Clerk of the Executive Council. The work attaching to that office is of the most responsible character, although comparatively simple. It includes the safe custody of the. records, and attendance at the meetings of the executive, and precision . in the entries is the chief requirement. In addition to that, it has been the practice to rely upon some member or members of the Governor General's staff to carry out a number of transactions of tlie utmost importance to the Commonwealth. Every communication from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Commonwealth Government, or from the Government to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, or through him to any of his colleagues, or to the tepresentatives of any foreign power, or the other great dependencies of the Empire, requires to be intrusted desire to say a word to some member of His Excellency's staff. The Governor General chooses his staff for his own reasons, sometimes on account of relationship, and in other inHonofablemembers stances because of his desire to have about him gentlemen with whom he has already established friendly relations.

296,Mr Deakin,"Ibut it is undesirable, and on some occasions very unsatisfactory, that the business of the Commonwealth should be intrusted to those who are attached to His Excellency's staff. We may be compelled to rely for the safe despatch, and for the coding and decoding of important telegrams relating to the Commonwealth, upon some younggentleman who, whilst being actuated by the best intentions in the world, has his mind occupied by social engagements. In Canada, it has been found desirable to separate these functions from those which more properly belong to the members of His Excellency's staff, and entrust them to an officer directly employed by the Government. office shall be altered from that of Clerk to the Executive Council to that of Secretary of the Executive Council. In the custody of this officer will be placed the whole of the despatches, confidential and general, which pass between this Government and any other governments, and he will be held responsible for their despatch and for their coding and decoding where necessary. Sir this provision be made here ? that the future Governor General should know that he will not be required to make provision on his staff for one .or other of the aides-de-camp by whom these duties have hitherto been discharged. For obvious reasons it is 'difficult to discuss this matter in detail, but I have already told honourable members that on one occasion a loss of some thousands of pounds was caused by an unintentional error on the part of an amiable young gentleman who was called upon as aide-de-camp to a Governor to deal with an important despatch. Other instances might be cited in support of the change proposed. be on the staff' of His Excellency the Governor General? Mi.

We therefore propose that the Governor General be informed of that without our being called upon to pass this motion ? which attention was called in the originaldespatches from the Secretary of State for the Colonies was that in Canada an arrangement similar to that now proposed had been made, and had been found advantageous both to the Governor General and to the Government.

I ^ h in k that the criticism of the honourable member for South Australia, Sir Langdon Bonython, was an excellent one, and beg to assure him that there is no desire on the part of the Government to imply that the Governor General is required to undertake anything more in connection with his establishments than his own good judgment may induce him to think necessary.

Mr O'MALLEY to be selected 1 ally concerned, I should very strongly favour the appointment of Captain Wallington, because he has a greater knowledge of Australia, of the duties of the office, the functions of our Governors, and of our constitutional practice, than any one else of whom I know. an excellent man. prepared to justify the selection of Captain Wallington for the position, but at present we are making provision for the office, and not for the man. I trust that what I have stated will induce the honourable member for Parramatta not to press his amendment, and k that the honourable member -for Kennedy, will also withdraw his proposal. I shall be prepared as soon as possible to move the amendment indicated. This will limit the operation of the motion, and doubtless at the end of the term specified, or perhaps' before then, the whole question will be reconsidered in view of the early establishment of the federal capital. Sir AVILLIAMM c MILLAN (Wentworth) I think that the honourable member for Parramatta has taken the right course. We are not dealing with the schedule submitted by the Government, which I understand to have been presented solely for our information. We are called upon to vote the amount proposed in a lump sum, and I do not see any objection to that. We understand, of course, that when we discuss the items we may reduce one amount and correspondingly increase another if we think they need adjustment. It would be difficult at this stage to say how much should be voted upon each item for the Governor General's establishment. We are in a different position, however, in dealing with the proposed votes for the Eederal Executive Council, matter should be treated in detail, and each item should be discussed on the Estimates. if we pass this vote now we shall practically sanction the expenditure and leave it to the Government to carry out the details. The argument of the Minister is weak, because Goif we separate the expenditure upon the Executive Council from the allowances to be made to His Excellency for the Is Captain Wallington maintenance of his establishments, there can be no necessity for incorporating the former items i i i tliis motion. It would be very easy for the Government to -say to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Governor General is not expected to pay for any of the duties performed in connection with the work of the Executive Council. Mr Chamberlain could easily be informed that a secretary to the Executive would be appointed, and that the whole of the expenditure connected with the Governor General's establishment is' contained in the other items. Accordingly, I shall support the honourable member for Parramatta should he persevere with the amendment which he has indicated. I am extremely sorry that the honourable member for Kennedy intends to divide the committee upon this question. I think that less feeling would be excited, and that it would be more conducive to the dignity and magnanimity of this Chamber if we allowed a matter in which another State is interested, and concerning which the weight of argument is in favour of carrying out the distinct compact made by the Government, to pass upon the voices. After the speech of the Attorney-General, I am more determined than ever to press my' proposal. The honourable gentleman succeeded in showing the absolute folly of appointing a highly salaried officer as secretary to the Executive Council, because when I asked him what were the duties of the subordinate officer who is to receive a salary of £ 3 25 a year, he replied that the latter would have to do tbe work. copying and typewriting. that the secretary of the Department for External Affairs should be able to do all the additional work that is required to be done.

I am not quarrelling with the appointment, but I do say that it ought not to be mixed up with the Governor General's establishment. regard to the confidential work, I repeat that it could well be undertaken by the private secretary to the Governor General, in conjunction with Mr Thomas, J.' Atlee Hunt. If those officers cannot manage it we must surely be hard up both for ability and trustworthiness. Apart from that consideration, however, I submit that the item in question is an ordinary one which is connected with ordinary expenditure, and should therefore be discussed upon the Estimates. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I am amazed that the honourable member for Parramatta should take exception to an officer who is toreceive£ 6 0 0 a year having a clerk in receipt of an annual salary of £ 3 2 5 to do the work for him.

I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will reconsider the matter. The committee has dealt very generously with the proposals of the Government as a whole, and we are not asking too much when we request that this matter shall be eliminated from the resolution and dealt with as part of the ordinary estimates. I feel sure that if the Government are convinced that it is absolutely necessary that an officer shall be appointed for this work, Parliament will have no objection to voting an adequate sum of money. now as well as later on 1 when this committee should decide about making new appointments, and additions to the public service. We have been preaching economy, and endeavouring to cut down the expenditure of the Government, and surely it is not a fair thing that we should have an absolutely new appointment inaugurated upon a resolution, the object of which is quite distinct from what is now proposed. The object of the resolution is ostensibly for the settlement of the Governor General's establishment, and not for the appointment of a new officer, who is to be no part of the Governor General's establishment, but is to be an executive officer under the Crown, who is to be amenable to Parliament, and under the control and direction of Parliament, although for the purpose of convenience I presume that he will be lent to the Governor General to perform certain duties which will come within tlie purview of the Crown's representative. We are told that this officer is to be the Secretary to the Executive Council, because it is considered desirable that certain communications which have to pass between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Imperial Government should not be in the hands of an why place it here 1 irresponsible and uncontrollable person, but that the officer who wil l have charge of them should be a Commonwealth officer. If that be so, it is not necessary that the officer should be W ill he require to especially mentioned as a member of the staff of the Governor General, and provided for on his establishment. He should be provided for as part of the staff of the Executive Council. We have already provided means whereby officers can be paid who have work to do in connection with the Executive Council, and I hope that the Government in order to preserve that somewhat overlauded uniformity of which we'hear so much, will follow the usual course and have this officer's salary placed upon the ordinary Estimates, and eliminate it from this resolution. MrM c C AY (Corinella) I should like to say to the Acting Prime Minister that we are now asked to decide what is really a very different matter from the one that has been under discussion. We are obviously asked to provide an officer whose duty it will be to act as secretary to the Executive Council, instead of our pursuing the cannot we decide existing practice of making an allowance to an officer already in the service for performing those duties. It may be that it may be found necessary to have a new officer. I shall regret it if it is so, because the Executive Council as a whole does not take up very much of the time of an officer, and whoever discharges these functions will have a clerk at £325 a year to' assist him.' It may be, however, that this separate officer will be necessary if the Federal Executive is going . to start upon a peripatetic career throughout the Commonwealth. But, at any rate, we are asked to determine whether an officer whose duties at present are discharged by some one in the service, shall be appointed to perform those duties. I urge that that question is not involved in the question whether Parliament will provide funds for the cariying out of the duties of clerk to the Executive Council. That is taken for granted, but the question here is as to an alteration of the mode of carrying out the duties, and the consequent increase in the expenditure of the Commonwealth. whether we are to pay for a private secretary to the Governor General. MrM c CAY If the officer is to be a private secretary to the Governor General he is wrongly described in these particulars. From whatever point of view we look at it",65,Pairs

I was under the impression that the officer proposed to be appointed would have a certain amount of work of a confidential nature to do in regard to the estabhonorable member for Parramatta, who has lishment of the Governor General, between the Government and the Governor General. If that be so, I take it that the officer would be distinct from a mere clerk to the Executive Council, whose sole functions would be the registering of decisions. no use arguing that the officer will be one who will carry out the duties which the clerk of the Executive Council has previously had to do. He will be a distinct individual. arguing whether he could very well be done Federal Executive Council of £1,925."" without ? be so, but it is of no use confusing the position.
