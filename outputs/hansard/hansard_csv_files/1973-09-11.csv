4,Mr Speaker,"On the last day of sitting,recollection of the precise words he had used. I was asked to make inquiries regarding the accuracy of the Hansard Report and to disallow any alteration of substance if one were submitted to the Hansard office. I have discussed the matter with the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, and now inform the House: (1) I am satisfied that the report is accurate. (2) The passage in Hansard will not be altered. <3) Before the Minister left for overseas he was informed of the position and in his shy and retiring manner he agreed with the content of it. without notice I think I should tell the House that since our last day of sitting I have been looking into the matter of the length of answers to questions without notice. I find that there has been a slight reduction in the number of questions taken during this year compared with a similar period last year. Obviously the greater the number of questions which can be asked and answered the more satisfactory the period is to all honourable members. I want to stress that the purpose of a question is to obtain infonnation or press for action. It should be stated as directly as possible and should not give unnecessary background information. Lengthy questions seeking detailed answers or which call for the quotation of figures should be placed on the notice paper. In regard to answers I point out that a ones that can be bruited around the countryMinister may decline to answer a question. side for weeks in advance. They are matters That is something on which the Minister must in relation to which decisions have to be taken use his judgment. But if he does answer a with a certain amount of precision. The most question the Standing Orders provide that the critical situation that has faced Australia does answer must be relevant to the question. The not go back only to 2 December; it goes back manner in which the answer is given and the much earlier. In the period ended 30 June length of the answer are in the hands of the Minister. If it is necessary for a long answer 1973 that rather curious index known as the to be given the correct procedure is for the volume of money increased by 26 per cent, Minister to indicate in his reply that, at the which is unprecedented in Australia. The end of question time, he will seek leave to major part of that increase took place in the make a statement. This procedure has been period from July 1972 to December 1972, suggested by various Speakers over many which was within the jurisdiction of the years. I ask for co-operation from both sides previous Government. of the House in keeping both questions and answers as short as possible. to the Treasurer. Did the Treasurer on Sunday, 31 January 1971, use these words: Interest rates raised by Mr Gorton and Mr Bury to the highest level in our history They were then at 7 per centhave acted adversely on important groups in the community, particularly young wage earners seeking to buy a home. Does the Treasurer agree that the interest rate increases, wherever they may finish, will lift the cost of living to families by $5 to $10 a week by increased mortgage repayments, increased hire purchase repayments and increased prices because of the increased cost of borrowing money incurred by the manufacturers of goods or the builders of homes? Does this not mean that the decision is making mflation worse instead of attacking inflation? quotations, but I suggest that there are times when, in the face of critical circumstance, one has to take decisions which one does not like to take. before the Budget? decisions could not be made until after the Budget was brought down; some decisions were made well before the Budget.

10,Mr Mcmahon,"Fo r well known reasons,also because of bad management. This Government took the steps to try to correct the situation. I heard your earlier reference to the length of answers, Mr Speaker, but when one is asked a series of questions it is pretty difficult to give a brief answer. the question. do is to din into the head of the Leader of the Opposition any economic common sense. If honourable members opposite ask such questions they must expect to receive detailed answers. I am appreciative of the fact that what has been done with regard to the instruction about open market operations will force up interest rates in the foreseeable future. But something must be done about inflation. The right honourable gentleman says, when the Government takes one action: 'Is this the only action you are going to take?' When the Government takes another set of actions he says: 'Is this the only action?' This action has been taken carefully and deliberately with a view to acting upon the long term bond rate for government securities. It will have some impact on other areas; one cannot deny that. AllI suggest is that the right honourable gentleman ought to display a little co-operation in this exercise rather than just trying to score cheap political points all the time. to the Postmaster-General. I refer to the proposed alteration of installation costs for telephone line plant in country areas. What will now be the situation with regard to applications which have already been lodged and accepted under the 15-mile free installation provision? Will the terms under which those applications were accepted be changed in any way? Will there be any alterations with regard to costs for those applicants who have been given firm or tentative installation dates? there has been a change in what is known as the country line policy. Nevertheless, all contracts entered into, in respect of which quotes have been given and deposits paid, will be honoured. he recalls his reply to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition in this House on 30 August in which he said: If the state of the economy is to be the criterion, I suggest to all investors that they hold on to thenshares. Does the honourable gentleman now realise that such advice is hollow and misconceived in the light of yesterday's massive downturn in the stock market which has led to major losses by many thousands of small investors? Does he appreciate that confidence throughout this country will not be restored by fine words from him or by ad hoc decisions of the type we have witnessed recently, but requires a coherent and cohesive package of anti-inflationary policies? Will the Treasurer give this House an assurance that the Government will adopt a comprehensive multipolicy approach to combatting inflation and so restore confidence in the Australian economy? of the Opposition has dug up a more recent statement than his leader did. I did advise shareholders on 30 August to hold their shares. But I did not mean for 10 minutes or 10 days; I meant for a more sensible period such as at least 10 months. I repeat my advice: Still hold them, because the future of this country is good. I would like to ask the honourable members who score so many points in this way: Were they concerned when shares in Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd stood at something like $22 to $24? What was the rip-off in share values in the last several years that brought that particular security down from $22 to about $7? BHP is a better investment than the most recent selling prices would indicate. I talked the other day with the management of BHP. I take the opportunity of talking with any groups of that kind. They indicated that they were a little concerned when the shares were as high as $24. They are equally as concerned now that the shares are as low as they are, and so they should be. I pay this tribute to BHP: I always have been an admirer of it despite what some honourable members opposite may think. I think it is an example of a monopoly that has not always used its monopoly power in the way that theoetically one might suppose it could use that power. I would say to those people who are selling those sorts of shares at this low value: Hang on to them because they will appreciate.",19,Finance Interest Rates

I refer him also to his intention to readjust the retention allowance. Does the Treasurer feel that this will drive a lot of people away from the company and into partnerships? Does the Treasurer see any value in accepting the concept of an incorporated partnership where for tax reasons the persons involved would pay the same amount of tax but could have the benefits of incorporation and be recognised by the Federal income tax laws for that purpose? to be a lot of re-thinking about business organisation as between corporative and unincorporative business, private and public, and so press that point in the discussions that take on.

25,Mr Les Johnsoni Acknowledge The,"Defence placed an order for 79 houses to meet the needs of naval personnel at HMAS 'Stirling' on Garden Island, Cockburn Sound. The matter has been the subject of some controversy between the Department of Defence and the Western Australian housing authority, the former preferring land at Kwinana and the latter preferring land at East Rockingham. I am pleased to be able to tell the honourable gentleman that recentlyI think early in AugustI had a discussion with the Western Australian Minister for Housing and we were able to reconcile the differing views to which I have referred. It is now intended to provide the 79 houses in the East Rockingham area. An exchange of land is involved and negotiations towards that end are in progress. Whether or not the provision of the houses is to be delayed will depend upon the priorities of the Department of Defence. I am able to give the honourable gentleman the assurance that the provision of houses will take place in such time as to ensure that the needs of the 79 families at HMAS 'Stirling' will be met at the appropriate time, that is, when they need them. Social Security whether he is aware that material critical of the Australian health insurance program is being circulated to primaiy schools throughout Australia by a body describing itself as the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia. Can he tell the House the status of this body, how its activities are financed and, if the finance involves the use of contribution income, whether this is an approved use of such income under the National Health Act? honourable member refers is a front for a number of private health insurance schemes. It does use contributors' money, without any authority from contributors, on a range of expenditures which I think are far from justified and would not be endorsed by contributors. The previous Government sought on more than one occasion to obtain detailed information on the financial practices of some of these private funds and was unsuccessful. The previous Government was not prepared, for instance, to enact proposals contained in the Nimmo Committee report which would have given it authority to ensure that funds acted responsibly and that if they did not do so they would be answerable for their irresponsibility. I will make some inquiries into the matter raised by the honourable member. I am surprised to hear the honourable member's suggestion that contributors' money is being used to supply information to primary schools. However, having had a look at the quality of some of the material that this association has been producing, I would think perhaps the primary school students have been helping the association to prepare it. cation whether, in categorising schools, the Karmel Committee recognised that, because of greater stability of staffing, the average age and therefore the average salary of teachers in independent schools are higher than the average age and salary of teachers in government schools. Karmel Committee, in considering the position of staffing in non-government schools, recognised the fact that promotions in nongovernment schools tend to be on the spot instead of by teachers transferring from school to school, and therefore there would be a tendency for there to be a rather higher level of salary. All of these matters are being raised with the Committee when bodies are lodging appeals. That may be a question of substance that the Interim Committee would not be able to vary, but the matter can be put to the schools commission which I expect will come into existence very shortly; the legislation to establish it will be introduced into the Parliament very shortly. A lot of these matters are being considered at the present time. The actual appeals, if they are put in well and intelligently and are not put in just on the basis of mistakes, can help one to make adjustments to criteria for the future. whether he believes that, in the interests of public trust and confidence in the Labor Government and of its financial and economic policies, ill-conceived or ill-considered statements or statements creating a false impression of an economically damaging kind should not be made by him or by his Cabinet colleagues.

Every stock exchange, every company and every government agency here and abroad also will be grateful to be reminded of the fact that the last time a variation was made in the exchange rate by a previous Government it took 3 days for the Cabinet to thrash it out.

The Tariff Board is seized of a reference concerning the Australian motor vehicle industry. I am satisfied that as a result of this reference to the Tariff Board there will be an overall assessment of the whole of this very important Australian industry and that there will be some aspects which have never previously been considered by governments and upon which they have not taken advice, such as the location, safety, employment and environmental aspects which hitherto have been ignored. I am confident that it will be possible for Australians to get better cars through taking into account all those factors and that better cars will be manufactured through taking into account all those factors. to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Is is a fact that the Australian Government is being accused of choosing Galston for an intensive feasibility study as a possible site for Sydney's second major airport, on purely political grounds? Is this charge justified? Does the Minister recall any feasibility studies being conducted by the former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins, before he ruled out Towra Point as a site prior to the 1969 elections, when surrounding Federal electorates were tenuously held by Liberal members? Did Sir Robert Askin, the Premier of New South Wales, consult the Minister before arbitrarily ruling out Duffy's Forest as a possible site? Does this location also happen to be in a member to finish his question. at the end. Does this location also happen to be in a Liberal stronghold? able member for Barton has said is perfectly true to the effect, that in 1969 when the right honourable member for Higgins was the Prime Minister, without any advice whatsoever from his.Department or from his Minister for Civil Aviation, he issued a direction on the eve of his departure on an overseas trip that Towra Point was not to be considered Speaker. I do not regard this as an answer to a question without notice, although that is not really the substance of my point of order. The Minister should be given an opportunity to make a statement to the Parliament so that honourable members can debate this subject and also the subject of the Brisbane airport. stance in the point of order. I ask the honourable member to be quiet for a little while. at the time when the right honourable member for Higgins who was then the Prime Minister gave the ruling that Towra Point was to be excluded from consideration, the 3 electoral seats of Cook, Barton and St George were all held by Liberal Party members. In an endeavour to save them he made that decision. I think that the whole question of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and the need for a second airport has to be looked at in its true perspective. Also, we have to consider the dilatory approach that was taken by the former Government. The decision made by the right honourable member for Higgins in regard to this matter was made in 1969 and in April 1969 the then Government appointed an interdepartmental committee to report on the need for a second airport for Sydney. This committee proceeded with its inquiry and reported to the then Government in September 1970 that there was a need for a second airport for Sydney. Also, it recommended certain sites. 1 want to quote very briefly from a speech made by the then Ministerto be as brief as possible. Mr Malcolm FraserI rise to order.

I was just askingof honourable members again to the fact that the inter-departmental committee reported to the then government in September 1970. lt sat on that report for exactly 12 months until 15 September 1971 when the then Minister for Civil Aviation, Senator Cotton, make a statement at the conclusion of question time? made a statement in the Senate on this subject. On the 13th page of his speech he said: 'However, the The Minister is making a farce of the ruling that you gave earlier in this session.

September 1971. When that Government went out of office in December 1972, no decision had been made. to the Treasurer. I refer to the written promise by the present Prime Minister as given to the Australian Federation of Credit Unions in a letter dated 24 October 1972 which stated that a Labor government would (1) grant exemption from taxation on credit union incomes and (2) allow child endowment, social service and repatriation payments to be credited to the savings accounts of members of credit unions. In view of this statement, is the Treasurer prepared to explain why this promise was not carried out in the recent Budget? Further, is this promise ever to be honoured or is it another Labor Party promise to be dishonoured totally? member for the polite ending to his question. The matter is under discussion with the credit unions and taxation authorities. The matter is not quite as simple as is sometimes suggested. I can assure the honourable gentleman that it is being considered as also are the necessary administrative arrangements about the other matter. FUEL CONSUMPTION OF MOTOR Minister for Transport been drawn to the proposals of the Government of the United States of America to compel motor manufacturers in the United States, as an environment, energy and consumer protection, to show on all new motor cars how many kilometres those cars can be expected to give to the litre? Will the Minister investigate the possibility of ensuring that all new cars sold in Australia show in a prominent position as a protection and guide to consumers a Government certified expected fuel consumption per kilometre as an Australian vehicle standards requirement attached to all new vehicles sold in Australia? hear the question, I take it that the honourable member wants some sort of standard laid particular motor vehicles imported to Australia? sold in Australia. to look at the honourable member's question and to give him a considered reply when I have had a good chance to study it. to the Prime Minister.

65,Mr Mackellar,"My question is directedother authorities? If so, who issued the instruction? Does it involve both official and private visits for all categories of Commonwealth public servants? Has the ban been imposed at the request of any outside government or organisation? If not, why has the ban been imposed? vant or member of the armed forces may visit Taiwan while travelling overseas on official duty; nor may any Australian travel to Taiwan on an official or diplomatic passport. There is no general restriction on private travel to Taiwan by Australian citizens travelling on ordinary passports and, in the case of members of the armed services, travelling in civilian clothes. Minister for Transport been drawn to a statement by the former Minister for Civil Aviation, Senator Cotton, that the Liberal Party favoured Somersby as a site for the second international airport? Will the Minister inform the House whether the residents of Galston are especially privileged in comparison with the residents of the Gosford-Wyong area and whether we have on the other side of the House a bunch of phoney environmentalists who planned to site the second airport at Somersby because they considered Robertson to be a safe Labor seat? that the Opposition, when it was in government, and the present New South Wales Liberal-Country Party Government have on every occasion on which they have dealt with a site for a second Sydney airport taken into consideration the political party of the member representing the electorate where the site was located. For example, they excluded Towra Point for a very simple reason and that was, as I said in answer to an earlier question, that, without any technical advice whatsoever and in an endeavour to save the 3 Liberal Federal members in Cook, Barton and St. George, they selected Somersby as a possible site because Mr Barry Cohen, the Labor member, was the representative for that area. They excluded Duffy's Forest because it was in a Liberal electorate. We should not forget that the honourable member for Mackellar, Mr Wentworth, originally supported Duffy's Forest and then went cold on it, for reasons best known to himself. The whole question of a site for a second Sydney airport has been a political issue all the way through. The Opposition, when it was in government, sat on the matter for years and failed to make a decision. We, as a government, have a responsibility in thisfield,and we are endeavouring to make a considered decision to ensure that Sydney has a second airport which will meet its requirements. to the Treasurer. Yesterday he said that the Reserve Bank would intervene in the next few days to help the market establish a new interest rate for Commonwealth bonds. He also said that the Reserve Bank had a figure in its mind, whatever that means. That was the way that he put it. I now ask the honourable gentleman whether he will say what figure the Reserve Bank has in mind. Does he accept that the success of the July loan, when I think $239m was subscribed, depended upon the confidence of the subscribers that the interest rate would remain at 7 per cent? Does he accept that no Commonwealth borrowing can succeed until there is certainty in the minds of investors about the long term bond rate? Does he accept that until there is certainty, the proposal of the Prime Minister that they would soak up excess liquidity cannot be achieved? Treasurer should know so little about open market operations. I will not indicate the level. port say whether a new Commonwealth Aid Roads Bill will be introduced into Parliament this year?

80,Mr Whitlami Thank Honourable Mem,"Motion (by Mr Lionel Bowen) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Opposition) (11.55)I have seen a copy of the statement which has accompanied the tabling of this report but I have not seen a copy of the Public Service Board report itself. Therefore I do not know what is meant by the phrase in the statement 'describes many of the changes which have occurred in the machinery of government'. There have been many changes indeed. One matter which is of more concern to the Australian public than any other is the growth in the Commonwealth Public Service. The Budget has estimated that the Public Service will grow by 4.7 per cent this year. Nobody believes for one moment that the growth rate will be held to 4.7 per cent. Everybody believes that the growth rate will be at least 7 per cent and that more than likely it will be 10 per cent. Even if the growth rate were restricted to 7 per cent it would mean that the cost of running the Public Service would increase to an extraordinarily high level. The Budget, on the basis of a 4.7 per cent growth rate, provides for an increase of 24.2 per cent in salaries and allowances. But that, of course, will not be the actual level of the increase. The level of the increase will be at least 7 per cent. One should compare the growth rate in the Public Service of 7 per cent with the growth rate in the work force of only 3 per cent to 3i per cent. A 4.7 per cent growth in the Commonwealth Public Service will cost an extra $137.6m a year in salaries. If the growth rate is 7 per cent, as is expected, the salary cost will be an extra $204m a year. That $204m a year would provide every pensioner in Australia with an extra $3 a week in his or her pension. That is an example of the way in which the Public Service is growing. This growth is totally disorienting the proper relativities between the private sector and the public sector and, within the public sector, the proper relationship between social service activities and the unrestrained growth of the Commonwealth Public Service. It is quite inappropriate for the Commonwealth Public Service to grow in this fashion. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) has made it clear that he wants the Commonwealth Public Service to be the pacesetter for the whole of Australian industry. It certainly has been used by the Government up to date as the pacesetter. He is quite determined to abandon productivity as a concept. He is quite determined to have the Commonwealth Public Service lead the field in wage rates and conditions in Australia to a level where its inflationary impact will just build upon the present inflationary situation. There is no will on the part of the Government to tackle inflation. Any measure it has taken will not achieve the desired result. Let us examine some of the extraordinary things which are being done. The Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) was elected by the Caucus to be a Minister. He had to be found a job to do. So he was appointed Minister for Northern Development. It was only natural that people would expect the Minister for Northern Development to have something to do with beef roads, but that responsibility was taken away from him. It was only natural that people would expect him to have something to do with primary industry in the northern areas, but that responsibility was taken away from him. job. He said in this House the other night that the single most important international agreement in existence is the International Sugar Agreement. It is not surprising that he should have thought that it was the single most important agreement in existence because it is his only responsibility. Mr Malcolm Fraser-And we negotiated it. the honourable member for Wannon that it was a Liberal-Country Party government which negotiated that Agreement. Some other extraordinary changes are to occur. The Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Charles Jones) this morning, by the way he chose to avoid answering any questions, was anxious to use question time to avoid having any debate. He misused question time in the same way as the Government is misusing the Commonwealth Public Service. It is said that the Government is to amalgamate the Departments of Transport and Civil Aviation. What relationship is there between rail, sea and land transport and civil aviation? Quite clearly, the departments are not appropriate to be amalgamated. They certainly are not appropriate to be amalgamated under the present Minister. That Minister has no chance of running those 2 departments properly and effectively. We already know",27,Public Service Board

82,Mr Nixon,What does he do?,28,Public Service Board
83,Mr Snedden,He has a very important,28,Public Service Board
84,Mr Sneddeni Have Been Reminded By,"that the Director-General of Civil Aviation, who prides Australia on the safety that we have achieved in civil aviation and who has been appointed to the board of Qantas Airways Ltd, is laying siege to his own office. He is not prepared to play any part which would bring about an amalgamation of the departments and a reduction in the safety of civil aviation in Australia. That is a proper attitude for him to have. I am sure that everybody in this House would see the importance of civil aviation and the safety of all those who travel by air as being greater than merely the opportunity for the Prime Minister to give a bigger responsibility to a devoted Minister who always says yes to him. The Prime Minister knows that the Minister will not be exercising that responsibility; it will be an aggrandised public service that will do that. The Minister for External Territories ( Mr last Sunday? Morrison) will find himself without a job. That Department is about to be abolished. Just what new department will be dreamed up for the Minister for External Territories so that he can continue to be a Minister is beyond anybody's guess at this time The Minister for Northern Development received that portfolio and has sugar alone as his sole responsibility. What portfolio will the present Minister for External Territories get? It is said that the Prime Minister is making such an awful mess of his foreign affairs portfolio that he is to hand it over to the Minister for External Territories. Sources close to the Government-everybod y knows how important they are-hav e suggested that the Minister for External Territories would make a much better Minister for Foreign Affairs than the Prime Minister. identify the problem. The present Minister for External Territories would be better than the Prime Minister, but he would still be an awful Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, he has a distinguished background in foreign affairs and perhaps that is what he will do. If that is done, I think that the Minister for Tourism and Recreation ( Mr Stewart) is to have his Department broken into two, so that he can be just the Minister for Recreation and the present Minister for External Territories, no doubt, can be the Minister for Tourism. I do not know what is to happen to the Department of Customs and Excise. The Minister for Customs and Excise is Senator Murphy who, 2 weeks ago in the Senate, delivered the most devastating criticism of a leader that has ever been made. Senator Murphy said that the Prime Minister-the Leader of his own Party-ha d acted with a total lack of concern for Cabinet unity. The Prime Minister accepted that rebuff and did not have the courage either to explain the matter or to discipline Senator Murphy. This is the way the Government has deteriorated. Any Minister can say whatever he likes because the Prime Minister is not game to discipline him. What is to happen to the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns) when he returns home? Will he be criticised for saying that the Government acted wrongly in failing to consult him over the economic measures of Perhaps the biggest joke of all is the amalgamation of the Departments of the Army, the Navy and Air with the Department of Defence. The idea of the Deputy Prime Minister being responsible for 4 departments is just the cause of the greatest amusement that could possibly happen. The statement mentions the incorporation of the functions of the Department of Customs and Excise and the Department of Supply in other areas of the Australian Public Service. Under the amalgamation the Deputy Prime Minister will be responsible for the Army, Navy, Air and Defence Departments. So the Deputy Prime Minister has had Supply taken off him. He will have Army, Navy and Air but there will be precious little of the Army, Navy and Air left. Have you ever seen such a deliberate breaking of a policy promise made by a party seeking office? The Labor Party said that it would hold spending on defence at 3.5 per cent of the gross national product. Then the poor little embattled Deputy Prime Minister came up with that worried look over his face and said: ' I confess we have cut down spending on defence from 3.5 per cent in real terms to 2.6 per cent in real terms'. Yet the Government has the cheek to go around and say: We are going to defend Australia; we are going to play our part in regional defence arrangements; and furthermore we are going to walk the stage of the world and be a powerful middle power.'",28,Public Service Board

123,Mr Speaker,"I s leave granted?in which the correspondence will be incorporated. granted I am compelled, in order that the point of misrepresentation can be made clear, to quote from some of the correspondence. This will make the point of misrepresentation crystal clear. As I recall it, I wrote to the Minister for Immigration on 3 September referring to an earlier letter of mine of 2 September. I wrote: I have received a copy of a letter to you from the Director of the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration. His letter, as you are aware, refers to certain statements made by you on Federal File. I went further and wrote: The Opposition is particularly concerned that the Director was restricted from discussing the question of Australia's membership of ICEM during his recent visit. If that was the case your remarks on Federal File did not accurately reflect the views of ICEM on Australia's withdrawal. As I have previously sought to make clear, the Opposition believes that the huminatarian objectives of ICEM justify Australia's active and continued support. If you have misrepresented, albeit inadvertently, Mr Thomas's position in this matter or if cerI did not discuss the question of membership. At the tain restrictions were imposed on his visit to Australia, the Opposition would feel obliged to express its concern publicly. The point of misrepresentation, of course, was that at no time in relation to the correspondence with the Minister for Immigration did I place any embargo on my capacity to make this matter public, particularly in the circumstances in which the fact of this publication came about as a direct consequence of a copy of a letter which was sent to me. That letter was to Mr Grassby from Mr J. F. Thomas, the Director of the Intergovernmental Committee on European Migration, and copies also were sent to Ambassador Corkery in Geneva, Mr Shildberger of the television program 'Federal File' and Mr Zurek, the representative of ICEM in Australia. That letter, dated 28 August, I believe makes some quite serious allegations which the Minister has not answered and which I believe he should answer because the Opposition has been pressing for a statement from the Minister for Immigration on Australia's immigration progam and it has not been forthcoming. As you are aware, Mr Speaker, we have heard more about Australia's immigration program from Mr Grassby overseas than we have heard from him in this House. Deputy Leader of the Opposition not to debate the matter but to confine his remarks to his claim that he has been misrepresented. Thomas, who is well known to members from both sides of this House as an international civil servant of very high renown, appears the following: A copy of the script used on the 'Federal File' program setting out the exchanges of views between yourself and Mr Lynch has just crossed my desk. My conscience would not be clear if I did not write to you to express my objections to the statement in which you are quoted to say: 'As a matter of fact, the Director, Mr John Thomas, was here in May and he understood this because we'd been discussing it since 1968'. I will not quibble over small inaccuracies,"" i.e. 1 actually was in Canberra in April and I could not have discussed the matter in 1968 as I assumed the office of Director of ICEM only in 1969. WhatI mainly object to is the inference that I understood the withdrawal of Australia from the membership of ICEM. I did not at that time and I do not today understand why Australia withdrew from an organisation serving such a great humanitarian cause-a n organisation which had been so helpful to Australia in time of its needs. You will recall that I asked to come to Australia and I was told that I would be welcome as long as time. I thought this to be an unusual restriction but I abided by it in the hope that I might be able to speak directly with Mr Whitlam. Unfortunately I was told that Mr Whitlam could not see me. I am not certain that he was asked. I did get to speak with you on several occasions for which I was grateful. I thought that you understood my position and that you were sympathetic with ICEM's work with refugees. Therefore it is something of a shock to read the contents of your part of the interview. If there were any misunderstandings concerning ICEM's position during my visit, I would consider they might have been clarified by my letter of 19 April which was sent to Mr Whitlam on my return. I assume this letter would be made available to you, but enclose herewith a copy as reproduced for the last ICEM Executive Committee Session-thoug h it was not possible to reproduce a reply. When I was in Australia. I pledged ICEM's full co-operation in turning over services concerning national migration in the various European countries by 30 June 1973. I have carried out my pledge in a very effective and efficient manner. I have done everything in my power to effect a smooth turnover with minimum hardship to the ICEM staff that had to be terminated and to the migrants involved. I feel that I and ICEM have been very responsible in this matter and therefore it comes as an extreme disappointment to see my position being put forward to the Australian public in such a misleading manner. I hope in some way you will be able to rectify this situation.",32,Personal Explanations

129,Mr Lynch,"In the letter from MrIf the Prime Minister wants me to read some further correspondence I can do so. And if the point has been somewhat laboured let me say to the honourable gentleman that all that was sought on this occasion was the tabling of the file. While he is sitting here in his usual frustrated silence he can reflect that what has happened has been brought about by his own decision. Tarifl Board Report: Ministerial Statement and Speaker, I table the Tariff Board Report on Motion Picture Films and Television Programs dated 30 June 1973, I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to it. being no objection, leave is granted. March 1972 that the then Minister for Trade and Industry forwarded to the Tariff Board a reference which requested it to inquire into and recommend on the assistance needed for the production in Australia of motion picture films and television programs. At that time the Board already held a reference dated 28 September 1971 from the same Minister on the film processing industry, and on 1 June 1972 the then Minister for Customs and Excise forwarded to the Board a reference relating to value for duty of certain film of an advertising character. Public hearings relating to these 3 references were held concurrently. However, in view of the present Government's desire to take early action on the production of films and television programs, the Tariff Board has restricted this report to the first mentioned reference. It has, however, kept in mind the matters raised relating to the second and third references and these will be the subject of future reports. The Government has now given preliminary consideration to the report. It is not at this stage committed to the adoption of its recommendations and will be continuing with its examination of it, including the constitutional issues which it raises. The release of the report will enable members of Parliament and others to examine it and, as appropriate, to make known their views. This is a primary purpose of the release, I should add, Mr Speaker, that it is not the practice to release Tariff Board reports except at the time of the announcement of the Government's decision concerning them. It will be clear to honourable members why this is so. An exception is possible in this case in view of the special nature of the references and of the report. It should not be assumed therefore that this is a precedent for action on Tariff Board reports in future. The Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas McClelland), whose Department was established since the references to the Tariff Board were made by the previous Government, has been invited by the Cabinet to make detailed recommendations to it for the future development of Minister for Foreign Affairs)Mr the Australian film and television industries, taking into account the report of the Tariff Board. The Minister has been asked to bring his recommendations to cabinet in the near future. Motion (by Mr Lionel Bowen) proposed: That the house take note of the paper. Opposition is interested in the tabling of this report. It recognises the reasons the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) has mentioned why in general such reports are not tabled. In this case the Opposition takes the view that the procedure followed is a very good idea. We thank the Government for the procedure adopted and we too will be interested in studying the report. Question resolved in the affirmative. Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah)I raise a matter of privilege, Mr Speaker. In his reply to my question this morning I understood the Prime Minister to say that the holders of official passports would not be permitted to travel to Taiwan. Members of Parliament hold official passports. AmI to understand that members of Parliament will not be allowed to travel to Taiwan on their official passports? If that is so, I ask that this matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges. advisable if the Prime Minister were to read today's Hansard in view of the matter of privilege which the honourable member has raised.

134,Mr Speaker,"Order! I think it might beThat so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister for Transport making a statement on the proposed airport site at Galston and the debate proceeding forthwith. The situation in regard to this matter is one which has the odour of political expediency and partisanship about it. It may be suggested-the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr The decision was taken to dump what for Charles Jones) has attempted to do this-that on previous occasions statements bave been made, views expressed and decisions taken in relation to the second Sydney airport on political grounds. We have already heard something on this matter from the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton), who is a former Prime Minister, and we will hear more from him. But in the light of the Government's commitment to 'open government' and in the light of the impact this decision could have for many people by opening up a period of doubt and dread as to the future of the region, I believe it is of the utmost importance that the Government take steps to make available all the facts about the situation. So far as one can judge-thi s is why it is important that the matter be debated and that we suspend Standing Orders to do so-the decision to site the second Sydney airport at Galston has been taken against all available advice of a significant character. It has been taken against the advice of the high powered Commonwealth-State committee set up to advise on the matter. It has been taken against thefindings,so far as we know-it is in this regard that we want to find out the factsof the British firm of specialist consultants hired to assist the Commonwealth-State committee. This Britishfirmof R. Travers Morgan and Partners worked with an environmental study group established, so far as I understand, by that committee. The decision has been taken against, I suggest, the thinking of the much vaunted Coombs committee which was set up to advise the Commonwealth Government on matters of economic priority. The matter is an important one and should be debated because, so far as we can ascertain the facts, the. decision was taken in the teeth of the advice and thinking from all these sources which favoured a different course of action. I understand that their investigationsI would like the Minister to confirm this-hav e already cost upwards of $500,000 which mainly has been expended this year. The Commonwealth-State committee commissioned a cost-benefit study by the British firm R. Travers MoTgan and Partners, the cost of which would be part of the $500,000. Against their advice the Government decided in a precipitate manner-on e might even suggest a casual or frivolous manner; certainly a political manner-to site the proposed airport at Galston. the Government threatened to be a political embarrassment on the doorstep of, as one journalist put it, a group of North Shore silvertails and semi-rural dwellers at GalstonDural. As the Minister will find when crowds of people from this area come here today, 'semi-rural' does not mean sleepy, relaxed or easy going. He will find the people to be tough, united and implacable in their opposition to the proposal to turn this scenic and recreational heritage, which is as fine as any in the land, to this purpose. As far as one can judge, the decision has been taken in an unwarranted and unjustified way. There appears not to have been a detailed feasibility study. The Commonwealth-State policy committee which was set up comprised top public servants from the Commonwealth and State government departments and the State Planning Authority of New South Wales. The committee, as I have said, commissioned at great cost, the study by the British consultants, which took the form of a complex and comprehensive cost-benefit study of alternative sites. That firm includes persons of very high international standing. This matter should be debated. A considerable amount of detailed study and expert evaluation has thus been made of about 15 sites. I would like the Minister to confirm that. As a result of this investigation the Galston site was rejected decisively in the recommendations of the Commonwealth-State committee on environmental grounds and also on economic grounds, especially as compared with the upgrading of Mascot airport. As I understand it, the study by the British consultants was supplemented by investigations by an environmental study group established by the committee. Such a group would have taken into account the environmental aspects which are particularly important in the case of the Galston area. It is one of the finest residential, scenic and recreational areas in Australia. It contains a number of important reserves including the Hallstrom reserve, the Muogamarra Sanctuary and others.",34,Privilege
135,Mr Edwards (Berowra) (12.31),"I move:Order! The motion is for the suspension of Standing Orders to allow the Minister to make a statement. The mover has had considerable latitude but I think that he is getting too wide of the subject when he goes into the detail he is now pursuing. I ask the honourable member to come back to the motion, which is for the suspension of Standing Orders. ing Orders ought to be suspended to enable this matter to be debated because of the odour of political partisanship which surrounds this decision and the fact that although this Government is committed to open government we have not yet heard the facts of this situation. I am endeavouring to set out some of the facts as I understand them with a view to underlining the importance of the need for the Minister to make a statement and to confirm them. A very important aspect is the figure quoted in the Press as to the cost of this project. It is said that it could be in excess of $ 1,000m as compared with an alternative costing the order of £350m. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The motion is for the suspension of Standing Orders. Is the motion seconded? reserve my right to speak. Postmaster-General) (12.41)I think we must make the position clear to the Opposition; the Government will not agree to the suspension of Standing Orders. There is no difliculty about this matter because, as members of the Opposition will be aware, the Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Charles Jones) already has advised the House in the course of answering questions that he will table the relevant documents when they are printed and are available. This motion for the suspension of Standing Orders has been moved purely on the rather remote issue that the Minister be given leave to make a statement. I submit that the appropriate thing is for the Minister himself to decide when he will make that statement. We are well aware of the political contentiousness of the site of a second airport for Sydney. It is somewhat pleasing to see the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr enable the Minister for Civil Aviation to make Gorton) here because he was closely associated with the problems of airports. The former Government was associated with those problems for many years. I represent the electorate in which the present airport is located and it is a damning indictment of the present Opposition that it did nothing to fix the location of a second airport for Sydney. The biggest problem that faces any Government is proper planning. Admittedly this usually comes about through the co-operation of State governments. It is acknowledged and admitted that when the Towra Point site was abandoned there was co-operation between the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins, and Sir Robert Askin because they made a joint statement at the time. That indicated the co-operation that could be obtained to guarantee that there would be no airport at Towra Point. Irrespective of any personal explanations, that decision was a wise one politically because no-one could say to the people of that area that fney were going to have so many more aircraft flying overhead and that they were going to suffer so much more nuisance because of the Government's actions. In fairness to the right honourable member for HigginsI say that it is a pity that in 1959, when the Government selected a site for a second airport for Melbourne and chose some 4,500 to 5,000 acres at Tullamarine, something was not considered for Sydney at that time. This shows the parochial nature of the then Government. All it could think of was to get an alternative site to Essendon, which was a mere 900 acres and which it knew was unsatisfactory. The then Government acquired some 4,500 acres at Tullamarine for a second airport but did nothing at all about Sydney.. Sydney Airport has a mere 1,400 acres and is now handling more than 2,000 flights a week. Are we talking about suspending Standing Orders on the basis that this subject covers unknown factors? Surely that could not be the case. The present Opposition was in Government for 23 years and knew all the problems associated with airports. It knew the problems it had to overcome in Melbourne and it knew the problems in Sydney. Yet at any stage it would not dare to suggest that a new airport for Sydney should be in an electorate represented by a Liberal. It is completely improper to use the time of the House today to suggest that Standing Orders ought to be suspended to a statement. The House is in the middle of the",35,Suspension Of Standing Orders

There is plenty of opportunity to discuss all aspects of this matter. speak in that debate. Does that not prove how ridiculous this motion is for the suspension of Standing Orders? The Opposition has moved that Standing Orders be suspended to allow the Minister to make a statement but he may want to make a statement in the course of the Budget debate. It is an unknown situation. We have already said to the Opposition: 'Because you have been in government you are well aware of all the difficulties'. The Minister, as was his right, said in answer to a question: ' I will table the relevant papers when they are printed'. What more could the Opposition ask for at this stage? The Minister controls his department and will table what he said he would table, that is, the report on the environmental impact study. This is the position that the Opposition has to face today. We have a Budget debate, about to take place, being delayed by the tactics of the Opposition, merely because it hopes that somebody listening to this debate will think that it will save Galston. It is not a question of saving Galston; it is a question of what the Opposition failed to do for a number of years. For the Opposition merely to say now that it wants leave for the Minister to make a statement assumes that it knows nothing about the matter. It is well aware of the situation and is very anxious that the Government expand the existing site. I will fight to the end against this because, for a start, it happens to be within my electorate. However, from the point of view of the merits of the situation, Sir Robert Askin has a quite nice piece of the action, if I may use that word, because before he knew it was to be at Galston he said what a dreadful thing it would be to expand Kingsford-Smith. When he heard it was to be at Galston he asked what was wrong with Kingsford-Smith. As the Opposition is so anxious to have information I inform honourable members opposite that Sir Robert has gone on record as saying that he has a site for a second airport but is not yet prepared to tell anybody where it is. As Opposition members have some connection with the Liberal Party in New South Wales they might find out what he has in mind. I am certain that any responsible government would listen to any reasonable suggestion. But as to the matter that we are discussing now and what should be done about it, it is not fair or reasonable that the Government should put aside all its business because the Opposition wants a statement to be made. The Minister has answered every question asked of him and has given an undertaking to table all the relevant papers. From the Government's point of view that is sufficient. The Government has had the responsibility of deciding where the second airport will be because the previous Government failed to accept this responsibility. It did something to suit itself politically in other areas, but it did nothing for Sydney. It let Sydney be destroyed. It is ridiculous for the Opposition to say now that it is anxious to learn something from a statement by the Minister for Civil Aviation, a statement which can obviously be debated ad nauseum but which would achieve no result at all. The Budget debate is to continue and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch) is anxious that it should. He said that he has a list of speakers a mile long. I think there are 20 honourable members on his list, but if we are to proceed on the basis suggested that number will be reduced to about ten because there will not be sufficient time for anybody to talk. is a reasonable suggestion. I indicate now that the Government wishes to finish the Budget debate at 6 o'clock tomorrow night. The Opposition has been given notice that that is the position. The Government will co-operate with the Opposition, but if the Opposition intends to use the forms of the House as it has done today-it did not mention what it intended to do; it just decided to do it without any discussion at all and then talks about cooperation and about trying to run the House Mr LynchI told you. of the Opposition never mentioned it to me. I ask him what he means by co-operation. We have wasted so much time on this when there are so many important pieces of legislation to be introduced. They have to be introduced this afternoon and the Opposition knows it. The present discussion is eating into that time.

This is not a matter for Party political considerations. The Opposition moves for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable a Minister to make a statement. I have never heard the like of it. The proper course is like it. It is about time we had a Minister like the present Minister for Civil Aviation because now we will get some action. For 23 years we have been waiting for some results of deliberations on a second airport for Sydney. We now have those results and the Opposition is a bit upset a'bout it. But it is not going to take the business of the 'House out of the control of the Government and for that reason the Government will not support the motion. point I make is that the Postmaster-General( Mr Lionel Bowen) indicated what a frightful thing it was to suggest suspending Standing Orders in order to enable the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) to make a statement. If honourable members cast their minds back a few minutes they will remember that I was to make a personal explanation in this House and the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) suggested that it would be better for a statement to be made on the matter. Therefore I sat down. So if the Postmaster-General has not heard of a motion to suspend Standing Orders in order to allow a statement to be made, at least the Prime Minister has; he suggested it. The second point I want to make arising out ter had something to say about that, but this of the speech by the Postmaster-General is that was the initial announcement. The decision I agree with him as to the great environmental was taken regardless of any consideration of damage and damage to the quality of life that the environment in which the people would would have been caused if an airport had been have to live. established at Towra. Postmaster-General has indicated that he would had been made. The last I heard was an fight to the death for that. Obviously he would announcement by another Minister, the Minisnot be fighting me, and he would not be fightter for Housing{ Mr Les Johnson), at a dinner ing us because we made a decision not to in Parramatta on Monday night that they had establish an airport at Towra. So let him carry not made any decision at all. So it is really on his fight with the Minister for Civil Aviaabout time that we had a statement to tell us tion, which he appears to have won, but do exactly what the situation is. Has there been not let him blame us for this sort of interneany proper planning? Apparently there has cine quarrelling. The third point I want to make is that we are not raising this matter merely in the hope that somebody may be listening to the broadcast of these proceedings; we are raising it because we are concerned about the damage that can be done to the ordinary person's environment, comfort and quality of lifeI have to use that phrase again-if an airport is established at Galston, just as we were concerned about the Mascot proposals. time than to make the wrong decision and ignore the rights of individual citizens, which is what the proposal to establish an airport at Galston does, because let there be no question that if this proposal is proceeded with, not only will a great area of bushland near Sydney be destroyed, but goodness knows how many hills will have to be bulldozed down and how many valleys filled up. Not only the so-called silvertails, but also the ordinary people living in the areas around fhe proposed airport will have aircraft coming in over their heads day after day, hour after hour, and this ought to be something that is taken into consideration; pure technical matters should not be the only questions considered. There are perfectly good and proper reasons why we should move this motion to suspend Standing Orders at this stage. Let us look at the history of this matter. The first point that arose, as I said before, was that the Minister for Civil Aviation either announced, or arranged for it to be announced in the Sydney Press, that the decision had been taken to establish a new airport at Towra. No doubt the Postmaster-General and even the other MinisThe next announcement a day or two later was that this was not so, that an airport was going to be established at Galston although .no not, or at least if there has been it has not",37,Suspension Of Standing Orders

152,Mr Gorton,"It is better to take a longbeen the joint planning that is required, because the New South Wales Government has made it perfectly clear that it has not been properly consulted and that it does not go along with this decision to establish an airport at Galston. Has a proper environmental study been made? Another Minister, thc Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass), indicated with great regret that he was not even able to .get along to the Cabinet meeting to make s statement on the environment. If one had been made perhaps it was made by some sub-committee or by somebody else; but was it a proper one? Was it one that we would consider as perhaps we might consider an environmental study by a joint committee comprising members drawn from both sides of this House which was established to look into the damage to the environment done by this proposal? We, as a Government, appointed a committee comprising members from both sides of this House to examine the environmental damage that had been done at Mascot. Why has not this information emanated from the Minister for Civil Aviation? Why can he not make a statement on this matter and tell us why members from both sides of the Parliament are not given a chance to speak on this matter? Surely these are all valid reasons for moving the motion to suspend Standing Orders. It will allow this information to be put before us now. We could be given the history and the whole matter could be studied. We need to know whether this proposal has been planned, what planning has taken place. We need to know what the actual decision is going to be. It has been sort of waffled about so much Lhat we do not know what the decision is going to be. Above all, we need to be concerned about the people who can be disadvantaged by building an airport on this site at Galston or on a number of other sites. I am the first to admit that it is not easy.

Mr CalderI was engaged in some business, too, but I got here on time. with the Chairman of the land tenure inquiry and my colleague the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren). But I paid the honourable member the courtesy of discussing this matter with him this morning when we both expected confidently that it would be brought on in the Parliament at or before noon. I and my ministerial colleagues can take considerable pleasure in this decision that has now been reached and reported to us from the Senate. Honourable members may recall the original discussion that took place in the House some considerable time ago. We discussed the best ways in which to bring about a situation whereby the people of the Northern Territory could have a say in their own affairs. At that time the honourable member for the Northern Territory moved an amendment that would have tied in a rather restrictive and clumsy mannerI hope that the honourable member will forgive me as I do not mean this in an offensive way-referenc e to the proposed joint committee of the question of how best to inquire into territorial government for the Northern Territory. That amendment was defeated in this House. We know that the consideration of this matter by the Senate has been very considerably delayed. That is to be regretted. I think it is fair to point out that that delay is largely were announced by the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) the result of the fact that the Government does not have a majority in the Senate.

The rate of living away from home allowance for class B and class C widow pensioners receiving training under the training scheme for widow pensioners and supporting mothers is to be increased by $5 per week to $10 per week. This allowance is to be increased to $16 per week where the trainee is a class A widow pensioner or supporting mother. Let me now turn to a more detaUed description of the features of the Bill. The increases now proposed represent the second occasion on which the rates of pension have been raised by the Labor Government since it assumed office just over 9 months ago. In December 1972 the standard rate was $20 per week and the combined married rate was $34.50 per week. With the current increases these rates will have been increased by amounts totalling $3 and $6 per week respectively. The comparable amount for widow pensioners without children is even more dramatic. With the current increase, the December rate of $17.25 per week will have been raised by $5.75 per week. Moreover, we have removed the long standing discrimination against widow pensioners without children who were deemed eligible for pension but paid less than widows with children. Honourable members will recall that in March this year the Government adopted the general principle that common needs deserve common rates of benefit. Hence, unemployment and sickness benefits will be increased in line with the proposed pension increases. When the new rates have been paid, unemployment benefits will have been increased by this Government by amounts ranging between $6 and $15.50 per week and sickness benefits by amounts ranging between $3 and $15.50 pei week. The Government is, of course, committed to raising the standard rate pension until it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings. This is the effect of an undertaking of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) made when he delivered the policy speech of the Australian Labor Party on 13 November 1972. The latest available figures in respect of average weekly earnings are for the June quarter of 1973. Based on these figures, the Government's goal of 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings would be reached if the proposed standard rate were to be increased by a further $3.92 per week The Australian Government is determined to achieve its goal of a standard rate pension of 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings and, if it is necessary, the pension increase for the autumn session will be greater than $1.50 per week. Unlike previous governments, we will not allow pensioners to suffer adversely from economic movements and we are certainly not going to allow them to bear the cost and disadvantages of tight money economic policies in the unconscionable way so regularly resorted to by previous Australian governments. Indeed, this is the whole reason why we are pressing to quickly establish the standard rate of pension at 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings, and thereafter by regular adjustments to maintain this ratio. In 23 years of conservative administration, previous Liberal/Country Pi-rty governments were never interested in such an objective. They resolutely eschewed proposals by successive Labor Oppositions, pensioner representative groups, other-responsible and concerned groups and people in the community urging a clear commitment to a formula such as this. They were unmoved that such a step should be undertaken in the interest of preserving Average weekly earnings(a) Quarter ended 30 JuneS 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 Note(a) Per employed male unit.

I ought to point out at this stage that in the 12 months from the June quarter 1972 to the June quarter 1973 there was an 8.2 per cent increase in the consumer price index, and an 11.4 per cent increase in average weekly earnings, whereas the married rate of pension increased by 17.2 per cent and the standard rate by 17.8 per cent respectively. When the increase now proposed becomes operative, the married rate of pension and standard rate of pension will be $20.25 and $23 a week respectively. In turn this means an increase in pension rates since the June quarter last year of 26.6 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. I ask leave to have incorporated in Hansard the following table showing relative annual movements of average weekly earnings, consumer price index and the standard and married rates of pension.

173,Mr Speaker,"-Order! Is leave granted?ourable members will note that the largest and most generous yearly increase in pensions in money terms and in percentage rates has taken place since this Government came to office. Unlike previous governments, the proximity of elections will not be a deciding factor in the rate at which pensions are increased; rather it will be our commitment to achieve social and economic justice for pensioners to establish pension payments at an adequate level and as a right, and to maintain these principles consistently. I would ask honourable members to contrast what this Government has done-the generous rates of increase in pensions, both in money terms and percentage rates, against the indices set out in the table-wit h the record of the last Government which in the year ended June 1971, for instance, when the average weekly male earnings increased by over 13 per cent, increased married and standard rates of pensions by a mean and miserable 7.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively. table? the table. It was the Liberal-Country Party governments in the past 23 years that presided over and indeed were responsible for the erosion of the standard rates of pensions from 26 per cent of average weekly earnings in the 1940s to as low as 18 per cent to 19 per cent of average weekly earnings in recent years. I mentioned earlier that this Bill confirms the Government's desire to see an entirely new aproach to the question of cash payments. Confirmation lies in the fact that this Bill takes the first step towards abolishing the means test on aged pensioner eligibility for people aged 65 or more. Complete abolition will be achieved within the life of this Parliament. When the scheme is fully implemented and backed with national superannuation, national compensation, universal health insurance and a system of guaranteed income Australia will have one of the best systems of social security in the world. IndeedI would go further and say that Australia will then be a world leader in this field. We will restore Australia to its proper position as a great and successful social laboratory, a leader and trend setter in the field of social welfarea position it rightfully held 50 years ago. Abolition of the means test on age pensions for people 75 years of age or more will have immediate beneficial effects for a great many elderly people throughout the community. Immediate benefit will be felt by those now receiving age pensions at reduced rates. A great many others whose means presently exclude them from any pension entitlement will also benefit. The number of people in each group is estimated to be 34,000 and 31,000 respectively. The cost, including extension of free of means test service pensions for ex-servicemen and women, is estimated to be $40m in 1973-74. I think it fair to make the comment at this stage that in the first year of the new Australian Government the first positive step towards the elimination of the means test has been taken. Liberal-Country Party governments made promises on this for most of the 23 years they were in charge of the affairs of this country but produced nothing. They were the governments, remember, which consistently from the mid-1940s promised a national insurance scheme but never did anything about achieving such a scheme in the long period in which they were in office. Indeed, it is worthy to recollect that their first Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, was a man who resigned from the Lyons Government in 1939 because the national insurance legislation enacted by that Government, which would have included a national superannuation type scheme, was not proceeded with. In spite of this dramatised demonstration of principle, Sir Robert Menzies, as Prime Minister of this country for 16 years, never introduced a national superannuation scheme. Our promises will be fulfilled. We currently have an inquiry into national superannuation under way. We will respond to thefindingsof that inquiry by introducing a national superannuation scheme. In the meantime, as I said earlier, we will abolish the means test. I repeat that this Bill represents the first step towards achieving that objective. This Bill allows for a period of 3 months grace-that is, up to 31 December 1973-dur ing which, if an age pension is claimed by a person who qualifies solely as a result of abolition of the means test, payment may be backdated to the first pension pay day after the Bill receives royal assent. However, an important point to remember is that free-of-means-test pensions will be available only to people wno satisfy the normal residence lequirement for age pension eligibility. A period of 10 years residence in Australia at any time is required. This period is reduced where a person has lived",43,Comparison Of Rates Of Increase Pension Rates Average Weekly Earnings And Prices

175,Mr Chipp,What is the source for that,44,Means Test
176,Mr Hayden,"The Department compiledin Australia for periods aggregating more than 10 years and has had a period of continuous residence of not less than 5 years. The guardian's allowance and additional payments for children will continue to be subject to the means test, as will the wife's pension."" Supplementary assistance will also remain payable subject to the existing supplementary assistance means test. A word about Australian Government 'fringe' benefits-that is, the pensioner medical service, funeral benefits and rebates on telephones, radio and television. These benefits are available only to people who would qualify for a pension under the 1967 means test. The Government has decided that the 1967 means test will continue to apply for 'fringe' benefit eligibility but that the pension increases to be paid in the autumn of 1974 will not extend benefits to people whose means are outside the new limits now proposed. The pension increases provided in this Bill will lift the disqualifying limits of means as assessed for 'fringe' benefit eligibility by $1.50 a week to $33 a week for 'single' pensioners and $3 a week to $57.50 a week for pensioner couples. What this means is that a married couple may have a combined income of up to $86.50 a week, including pension, and a single person a combined income of up to $49.50 a week, including pension, before eligibility for fringe benefits ceases. There are many people in the community, such as young marrieds with families to support, homes to establish and pay off and a future to be made, who have less income than this but are denied such benefits. This raises questions of equity. We will give special consideration to the needs of all people, through programs supported by the Australian assistance plan and programs to be developed following on the findings of the Henderson poverty inquiry, which, of course, will provide useful guidelines for us here. At this point I should mention that, because increases in the basic rates of pension have the effect of raising the limits of income and property at which pensions cease to be payable, many people who do not qualify for a free-of-means-test pension will, nevertheless, qualify for either an age, invalid or widow's pension for the first time. As a result of the increases now proposed a single person without property affecting his pension will retain some pension entitlement until his income reaches $66 a week. A single pensioner without other income will be eligible to receive of an adopted child if both adoptive parents some pension until the value of his non-exempt property reaches $34,720. For a married couple, the equivalent limits of income and property will be $115.50 a week and $60,880 respectively. A widow with one child and no property affecting will now be able to receive income of up to $90 a week before losing her entitlement to widow's pension, or up to $94 if her child is under 6 years of age or an invalid child requiring full-time care. If she has no income affecting, a widow with one child may have property to the value of $40,480, or $42,560 if her child is under 6 or is an invalid requiring full-time care, before her entitlement to widow's pension is extinguished. I have already mentioned the 2 new benefits called transitional benefit for the aged blind and double orphan's pension which are proposed in this Bill. The transitional benefit is designed to alleviate any financial detriment which blind persons of pensionable age might experience when their pensions become taxable. The benefit will be payable at the rate of $3 per week and it will supplement age and invalid pensions to permanently blind persons who have attained 65 years of age in the case of men and 60 for women. It is proposed that the new double orphan's pension of $10 per week will be paid to the guardian of a child both of whose parents are deceased. It will also be paid to the guardian of a child, one of whose parents is deceased, if the whereabouts of the other parent is unknown. Double orphan's pension removes an area of human neglect that should not have been allowed to continue. It is incredible and inexcusable that this anomaly should have been tolerated for so long by past governments. Imagine the grave social distress and severe disadvantage that has been caused to thousands of unfortunate and innocent children over the years because of these injustices. Let me give one illustration of the intolerable nature of this injustice. Children of a widow receiving a widow's pension would attract a mother's allowance and additional pension for children. If the mother were to die, all pension entitlement from the Australian Government, until this Government accepted its responsibilities with this legislation, ended. Previous governments washed their hands of all responsibility. I am pleased that this important reform has been achieved as one of our earliest actions. The new pension will not be paid in respect are still alive. However, a benefit will be payable to the guardian of a child if both adoptive parents are deceased or if one is deceased and the whereabouts of the other parent are unknown. There will be no means test. However, double orphan's pension will not be paid if the child attracts a war orphan's pension payable under the Repatriation Act. The conditions for payment, generally, will be broadly along the lines of those applying to child endowment. Payment will be made in respect of orphans who are under 16 years of age or who are full-time students aged 16 to 21. My Department will make payment by the same method and at the same time as child endowment. In most cases the new pension will supplement child endowment. In turning to the rehabilitation aspects of the BillI should first say that the decision to remove the time limit of 3 years on rehabilitation treatment and training is a practical and overdue move. It is designed to meet the needs of a small number of disabled people who, because of the severity of their disabilities, or their need for specialised training, are unable to return to suitable employment within 3 years and consequently do not, at present, qualify for acceptance. Greater use is now being made of tertiary training at universities and colleges of advanced education as a means of giving handicapped people vocational or professional skill that will ensure for them a suitable and satisfying career. Some of these courses are of 3 or more years' duration and it is not unusual for training to be preceded by a period of treatment in a rehabilitation centre. Provision is also made to increase the rate of rehabilitation training allowance from $4 to $8 per week to persons undergoing full time training; and to pay $4 per week to part-time trainees. The rates of living-away-fromhome allowance, payable to persons undergoing training, have been amended so that the married trainee will receive $16 per week instead of $8 per week. The new rate will also be paid to persons with the care, custody and control of children. All other trainees will have their rates doubled from $5 to $10 per week. When a handicapped person has been away from employment for many months it is natural for him to want to go back to work as soon as possible after medical treatment is concluded. This is a very good thing where the person's residual disability permits him to return to his former job. Frequently, however, it is in the handicapped person's interest, or sometimes a matter of necessity, for him to be trained for a different type of work. Widow trainees, too, may need to be encouraged to train for a career that will afford them long-term satisfaction rather than turn to unskilled or casual employment. It is not easy for an adult to adjust to training for a new vocation and it may involve a temporary financial sacrifice, especially if there are dependants to look after. The higher rates of training and living away from home allowances are intended to make it easier for handicapped persons and widows to enrol in training courses, and to encourage them to opt for the long term advantages that training will provide. Pension increases proposed in this 'Bill will also flow to persons receiving rehabilitation allowances. These allowances are paid in addit nn to the training allowance and living : away from home allowance. Sheltered employment allowances will also be increased in line with pensions. Mr Speaker, I would now like to give the House further details of the costs involved. The expenditure on cash benefits for 1973-74, other than that resulting from the provisions in this Bill, is estimated to rise by some $200m over the expenditure for 1972-73. This is partly due to the natural increase in the number of pensioners but mainly due to the full year cost of the significant increases granted after the Government assumed office, and the introduction of the new supponing mother's benefit. The cost of the proposed increases in cash benefits and abolition of the means test for residentiaUy qualified persons aged 75 years or more is estimated to add an extra $141m to expenditure which would otherwise have been incurred in 1973-74 on benefits payable under the Social Services Act. This will bring estimated expenditure in 1973-74 on -benefits payable under that Act to $ 1,874m. In accordance with the usual practice, it is proposed that the pension increases provided under this Bill will operate from and including the pay days following royal assent. The increases in unemployment and sickness benefits will, as usual, operate in respect of the benefit week ending on the date of royal assent and each benefit week thereafter. Mr Speaker, I commend this Bill to the House. able a breakdown of the costs to which he referred at the end of his speech?",44,Means Test
177,Mr Chipp,"Will the Minister make availget for you. Debate (on motion by Mr Chipp) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Barnard, and read a first time. Second Reading Minister for the Navy, Minister for the Army, Minister for Air and Minister for Supply) (2.52)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I believe, Mr Speaker, that this Bill contains some of the most significant changes in the repatriation field that have been presented to the House for many years. There will be increases in the rate of payment of most pensions and allowances. The means test for Service pension purposes will be eased and, for Service pensioners or applicants for service pensions who have reached the age of 75 years, it will be abolished. Free medical and hospital treatment will he provided for all ex-servicemen of the Boer War and the 1914-18 War. Ex-servicemen and women who served in a theatre of war and who suffer from malignant cancer will be provided with free medical and hospital treatment for that condition. Artificial limbs will be provided free through the repatriation artificial limb and appliance centres to all amputees in the community who need them. These new and extended benefits were referred to in the Budget speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Crean). This Bill will, however, introduce other changes which the Government proposes, both within and outside the Budget context. Repatriation benefits will be extended to members of the regular defence force. The admission of civilian patients to repatriadants will be involved and all of these people tion hospitals will be authorised, but only to the extent that facilities are available after catering for entitled repatriation patients. Statutory authorities giving determinations under the repatriation system will be required to give reasons for their decisions. These changes, Mr Speaker, are an indication of the responsibility that this Government accepts in relation to those who have served their country in time of need, and now those who voluntarily make up the country's defence forces. We also recognise that, when and where capacity exists, the facilities and expertise of the repatriation treatment services should sensibly be made available to the community generally. Although most existing pensions and allowances have been improved on this occasion, there are some that have not been changed or increased to the degree eventually intended. They have not been overlooked but, as a matter of priority, benefits for ex-servicemen and women, and the dependants of deceased ex-servicemen, have been given preference on this occasion. Other benefits will be adjusted as circumstances permit. In addition to the improvements that I will detail shortly, there will also be increases in the rates of payment of service pensions that will result automatically from proposals that my colleague, the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) has already announced in the House. However, the Bill amends the principal Act to apply the increased rates of service pension payable in respect of some children and to incorporate in the principal Act the same principles that will aply to age pensions under the Social Services Act. A small pension of 25c a week presently payable to certain children of service pensioners, but not payable to children of social service pensioners, will be discontinued, but this will be more than offset by the increase in the rates payable to parents in respect of those children. The increased rate of means test pensions, the easing of the means test and, in some circumstances its abolition, will mean that many war pensioners and war widows will receive greater total payments than may at first appear to be the case. The opportunity will be taken in this Bill to remove the remaining instances of higher repatriation payments to dependants on the basis of the rank the serviceman held in the forces. This Government sees no justification for differing payments being made for like circumstances. Probably fewer than 200 depenwill receive an increase. Another anomaly this Government considers exists in the pensioning structure will be removed. I refer to the special compensation allowance introduced by the previous Government in 1968.

The Government proposes that artificial limbs will be provided, free of charge, to all persons in the community who need them, whether ex-service personnel or civilians. Supply, at least in the early stages, will he subject to certain priorities, generally based on need and medical advice. The Repatriation Commission will supply artificial limbs either direct from the Repatriation artificial limb and appliance centres or through commercial limbmakers. In addition to supplying initial artificial limbs to new amputees, the Government proposes that replacement limbs will be supplied to existing amputees, estimated to number 13,000. The estimated cost of providing the additional limbs this year is $0.615m and $0.9m in a full year. In addition, an estimated $0.5m is expected to be spent on provision of additional buildings and equipment over the next 2 years. Disregarding War Pension as Income iFor Means Test Purposes As a step towards implementing the Government's undertaking to disregard war pensions as income for means test purposes, the Bill proposes that 25 per cent of all war pension payments will be disregarded in the assessment ot Service pensions. Some war pensioners whose means exclude them from receiving a Service pension, or who receive such a pension at less than the maximum rate, will benefit from this proposal. Estimates are difficult to make, but it is expected that approximately 25,000 persons could benefit at a cost of $5.6m this year and $7.47m in a full year. Provisions for Service Pensioners Aged 75 Years and Over or Blind The Bill provides that the means test on Service pensions will not ibe applied where the Service pensioners, or applicants for Service pension, have reached the age of 75 years. As with age and invalid pensioners under the Social Services Act, the Repatriation Act at present excludes the earnings of a blind pensioner from the means test. Because it is proposed to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to make age pensions subject to income tax, the Oovernment proposes in the Bill that a transitional benefit of $3.00 a week will be paid to any 16750/73-K-(28 ] blind Service pensioner male over the age of 65 years, or over 60 years in the case of a female. This benefit will be free of tax and should ensure that those aged blind will not be disadvantaged. Proposed amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act will also provide a rebate of tax for non-blind age and Service pensioners totally or mainly dependent upon their pension. The cost of the first stage of abolishing the means test on Service pensioners and providing the transitional benefit for Service pensioners will be of the order of $8.8m this year and $ 11.7m in a full year. Repatriation Benefits for Regular Servicemen and WomenI come now to provisions in the Bill which are of a non-budgetary nature. Perhaps the most important of these matters is that, for the first time, Repatriation benefits will be extended to servicemen and women in the peace-time Services. In many respects the regular servicemen's range of activities, location and .potential exposure to personal injury are far less predictable than in the case of a civilian. Recognising these factors, the Government proposes in the Bill to extend to regular servicemen and women Repatriation benefits in respect of disabilities arising out of or aggravated by their defence service on or after 7 December 1972. 'Persons who will be eligible are those members of the forces on continuous full-time service on or after 7 December 1972 who, whether before or after that date, have completed 3 years effective full-time service. Persons who were engaged or appointed for a period of full-time service of not less than 3 years but who, on or after 7 December 1972, died or were discharged on medical grounds for reasons attributable to their defence service before the completion of 3 years service will also qualify, unless their discharge occurred before the completion of 12 months effective service and resulted from a preexisting condition which was not aggravated by service. National servicemen serving immediately before 7 December 1972 who complete the period of service for wbich they were engaged to serve or who die or are discharged on medical grounds as a result of their service prior to the completion of that period of service are also eligible under the provisions of the Bill. At the risk of repetition but so that this aspect is abundantly clear, I emphasise that only incapacity or death arising from service on or after 7 December 1972 will attract repatriation benefits. It must be remembered that regular servicemen and women are already provided for under the Compensation (Government Employees) Act, which I will hereafter refer to as the Compensation Act, and they will retain that cover even though the Bill extends to them eligibility under repatriation legislation. The dual eligibility concept avoids the many complications which would arise if servicemen and servicewomen were forced to make rigid choices of cover under only one of the two Acts. However, the Bill includes provisions under which benefits received under the Compensation Act are to be set off against entitlemet-s under the Repatriation Act. Thus, while dual eligibility under the two Acts is proposed, double compensation is avoided. For example, a serviceman or servicewomen disabled because of defence service may claim under both the Compensation Act and the Repatriation Act, but any pension payable under the latter Act will be reduced by the extent of any payments under the former. In any case where payments under the Compensation Act exceed entitlement under the Repatriation Act, no pension will be payable under the latter Act. Similarly, repatriation payments will be reduced by the extent of any payments received by way of damages in respect of the same incapacity or death. In view of the widespread entitlement under third party and other forms of insurances against common law liability, the Bill recognises the possibility that a claimant may hold a right to common law damages and provides that damages received in any resultant action should be offset against repatriation pension payments. This is not a new concept. An example of its adoption is already in the Compensation Act, which makes similar provision where an employee has a right to damages additional to his compensation entitlement. As a logical extension of this concept, the Bill provides that a claimant who may have entitlement to damages from another party may be required to pursue his case to a court of law. The Bill also provides that a right of action may be taken over from a claimant and pursued either to settlement or judgment. Payments already made by way of pension may be recovered from any damages obtained. The existing repatriation determining authorities will decide claims and determine appeals from members of the defence force using the same criteria, procedures, etc., including the benefit of doubt and onus of proof provisions, as now apply to ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen generally. Within this context, the repatriation benefits being made available under this Bill to regular servicemen and women are broadly those available"" to 1939-45 members of the forces who did not serve on active service. Specifically, where incapacity or death arises out of or is attributable to service in the defence force, or the condition leading to that incapacity or death is contributed to or aggravated by such service, the existing range of war pensions, allowances, and treatment will be available to the member, his wife and children. Other repatriation benefits will also be available, including benefits to eligible children under the Soldiers Children Education Scheme. Reasons for Decisions The second non-Budgetary item in the Bill will authorise determining authorities appointed under the Repatriation Act to record and advise claimants of the reasons that led them to make the particular decisions. The Government takes the view that it is unreasonable to expect a person to prosecute a claim through an entire determination and appeal structure without at any stage giving him a reason for a decision. Armed with the reason for an adverse decision, a claimant would be in a better position to decide whether to accept that decision or to proceed with an appeal. The Bill also contains provisions to protect members of determining authorities, witnesses and others from proceedings, either civil or criminal, in respect of the determination made by the authority or in respect of evidence presented or provided to that authority. So that claimants and appellants are not inconvenienced by delays in the determining process, it is proposed to introduce the giving of reasons for decisions gradually, having regard to the additional work-load involved. The Bill therefore provides that regulations may prescribe which determining authorities will be required to give reasons for decisions and, also, the provisions in the Act on which they will be required to give reasons. This phasing-in will provide the authorities with time to adjust to the new requirements and will also allow for assessment of the extent of administrative and other changes required in the light of experience. Honourable members may be assured that the whole system will be carefully monitored, so that delays will be avoided. If necessary, additional determining authorities will be constituted. The remaining matter to be dealt with in the Bill, Mr Speaker, is to give legislative authority to make regulations to allow the Repatriation Commission to make its hospital beds available free of cost for non-repatriation patients if capacity is available. The same authority will provide for the supply of artificial limbs to all in the community who need them. But I emphasise that these facilities will be made available only after the needs of entitled repatriation patients have been satisfied. After entitled patients, priority will be given to ex-servicemen and women if, while in hospital for a war-related disability, it is considered medically desirable that they receive treatment for a non-accepted condition. Any remaining capacity could be made available to non-repatriation patients such as those attending the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres who require treatment associated with the amputation or, for that matter, for the actual amputation. Other patients could be admitted where it is considered specialised treatment can best be provided in repatriation hospitals or patients whose cases are of special interest for teaching purposes, and who are being treated privately by specialist repatriation consultants. It may also be possible to admit suitable patients who live in the immediate vicinity of the hospital. Treatment of nonentitled patients would not be automatic but would depend upon the circumstances that exist at the time at each particular hospital and would be subject, where necessary, to agreement with the various State health authorities. (Extension of time granted.) Application Generally the Bill provides that increased rates of payment will be effected from the first pension pay day after Royal Assent is given to the Bill and that other provisions will apply from the date of assent. However, entitled members of tht Regular Defence Force will be eligible for benefits with effect from 7 December 1972. Mr Speaker, this Bill encompasses a wide field of repatriation activities and in order to assist honourable members in their consideration of it, the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Bishop) has prepared explanatory notes for each clause of the Bill. A copy of these notes will be made available to all honourable members. It is my pleasure, Mr Speaker, to commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Bonnett) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Hayden, and read a first time. Second Reading Security) (3.25)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to make the changes necessary in what will become the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act-in lieu of the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act-to complement the new provisions to be included in the repatriation legislation that will put into effect the Government's decision to extend repatriation benefits to members of the Defence Force in respect of disabilities related to defence service on and after 7 December 1972. The members of the defence force who will benefit from the extension of repatriation benefits to peace time service were described in general terms by my colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister, in the course of his second reading speech on the Repatriation Bill (No. 3) 1973. Technically speaking, they are members of the forces within the meaning of the proposed new division 10 to be inserted in part 111 of the Repatriation Act, and the dependants of such members. Honourable members will recall that complete details of the new benefits to be provided by this Government for members of the forces and the necessary requirements to be fulfilled for eligibility were given by my colleague when he was introducing the Defence (Re-Establishment) Bill on 22 May 1973. The Deputy Prime Minister has explained that while there will be dual eligibility under the compensation and repatriation legislation, double compensation will not be payable. To provide for this dual eligibility it is necessary to amend sections 7 and 98 of the Compensation Act. The former provides that the Compensation Act does not apply in relation to service of a member of the defence force in respect of which provision for the payment of",47,Repatriation Bill No 3 1973
180,Mr Hayden (Oxley,"Minister for Sociala pension is made by the repatriation legislation. Section 98 of the Compensation Act provides that where an employee, or a dependant in the case of his death, is entitled to repatriation benefits, other than a service pension or funeral benefit, compensation is not payable under the Compensation Act. The amendments provided for by clauses 3 and 5 of this Bill will remove the foregoing restriction in relation to members of the forces within the proposed division 10 in part 111 of the Repatriation Act. At the same time, because specific provision is to be made in the Repatriation Act, in relation to pensions payable under division 10 of part 111 of that Act, to take into account a payment under the Compensation Act, it is necessary to provide in the latter Act that such pensions be exempted from the operation of section 52 which allows other payments made by the employer to be taken into account in the determination of what weekly compensation is payable. The necessary amendment to section 52 for this purpose is provided for in clause 4 of the Bill. Honourable members will appreciate that if a person wishes to rely solely on repatriation benefits for his disability, he may achieve this simply by claiming under the Repatriation Act and not under the Compensation Act. On the other hand, having submitted claims under both Acts and qualified for benefits under both Acts, a person may decide that it would be in his best interests to take a repatriation benefit rather than a compensation payment. The Bill will therefore allow a person who has qualified for a benefit under the Compensation Act and also for a similar benefit under the Repatriation Act to request that an amount of compensation not be paid so that he may receive the repatriation benefit in full. Clause6 of the Bill provides for the necessary amendment to this effect. The Compensation Act at present requires that the compensation paid or payable under that Act be recovered from, or offset against, damages recovered by an employee or the dependants of a deceased employee. The provisions of the proposed new Division 10 of Part III of the Repatriation Act will require an offset against repatriation pensions of damages recovered by a member, or his dependants, in the case of his death. So that damages recovered will not be taken into account twice, it is necessary to provide that damages taken into account in the assessment of a repatriation benefit will not be taken into account to reduce the compensation otherwise payable under the Compensation Act. Clauses 7, 8 and 9 of this Bill will provide the necessary safeguards in this respect. I come now to the new recovery provision proposed to be inserted by clause 10 of the Bill. My colleague mentioned during his speech on the Repatriation Bill (No. 3) 1973 that claims may be made under both the Compensation Act and the Repatriation Act but any pension payable under the latter Act will be reduced by the extent of any payments under the former. He also explained that where payments under the Compensation Act exceed the entitlement under the Repatriation Act no pension will be payable under the latter Act. The retrospective grant of compensation after payment of a repatriation pension had been commenced could result in there being an overpayment of the repatriation pension and also the cessation of such a pension, thus preventing recovery of the pension overpayment by the Repatriation Commission. To meet this situation provision is being included in this Bill to enable recovery of an overpayment of a repatriation pension from compensation payable. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Bonnett) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading Postmaster-General) (3.32)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill relates closely to the Repatriation Bill. It is to give effect, so far as seamen are concerned, to the Budget decisions that provide for increases in war pensions and allowances, and also will require authorities determining claims for benefits under the Act to give reasons for their decisions. Under the Bill the existing general rate pension is increased from $16 to $19 a week and the war widow's pension is increased from $21.50 to $23 a week.

SEAS AND SUBMERGED LANDS BILL 1973 [No. 2] Bill presented by Mr Connor, and read a first time. Second Reading Minerals and Energy) (3.40)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In introducing this BillI remind all honourable members that it is completely identical in all respects with the measure which was introduced by me in this chamber on 10 May 1973 and which was carried in this House by vote on decision without amendment on 17 May 1973. It was introduced into the Senate on 22 May 1973 and its consideration was there adjourned, by vote on division of the Senate, until after the first day of sitting of the Senate after 1 August 1973. As an interval of over 3 months has new elapsed, during which the Senate bas failed to pass this measure under the terms of section 57 of the Constitution, the Bill is being introduced so that it may be again passed by this House without amendment, and returned to the Senate for its further consideration. The objective of the Bill, as announced by His Excellency the Governor General in his Speech at the opening of the Twenty-eighth Parliament is to remove any doubt about the exclusive right of the Commonwealth to sovereign control over the resources of the sea bed, off the coast of Australia and its territories, from low water mark to the outer limits of the continental shelf. The Bill, in addition, provides the legislative framework to govern the exploration aud exploitation of the mineral resources, other than petroleum, of these submerged lands. By the reintroduction of the Bill, the Government demonstrates its determination to adhere to its policies, as announced before the last election, and to which the Australian people gave their stamp of approval on 2 December last. I do not propose to explain further the provisions of the Bill, as these have been fully covered in my second reading speech delivered in this House on .10 May last. The current stalemate over this Bill has resulted in a truly Gilbertian situation, in which members of the former Government have frustrated and delayed the passage of legislation which virtually in all respects repeats their own proposals of 1970. The announced support ol the Liberal Party Conference for PartsI and II of the Bill is not acceptable to the Government. It is merely a repetition of the tactics used in 1970 when the Bill as introduced, without a mining code, would have been merely declaratory without imposing obligations or providing for their enforcement. The States and other bodies, interested in the preservation of the present stalemate would merely stifle a metaphorical yawn and"" state how interesting the academic situation was, and continue unimpeded their present conduct. Honourable members of all parties will recall that the Government when in Opposition gave full support to the Territorial Seas and Continental Shelf Bill introduced by the former Government in 1970. Despite that support the former Government, after debating the measure, deliberately moved and secured an adjournment of the debate. It lacked the courage and foresight to pass this vital legislation. The Government's views on the matter can hardly be better expressed than by the speech of the former Minister for National Development who, when introducing the Territorial Seas and Continental Shelf Bill in April 1970, on behalf of the Acting Minister for External Affairs said: The Government's view is that it would serve Australia's national and international interests to have the legal position resolved as soon as practicable. If the Opposition had the courage of its convictions it would support this legislation instead of conniving with certain of the States to frustrate the Government's wishes in this most important matter. Passage of the Bill will open the way for any doubts or issues to be challenged. This is precisely the Government's intention, as stated by me in my second reading speech on 10 May last, when I said: If there are parties-individual s or governmentswho would dispute our right to take the course I now propose, let them challenge this legislation in the Australian courts.

Already there is a drilling vessel off our coast, capable of operating in water to a depth of over 1,500 feet. Major exploration interests are already preparing to drill in depths of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. The Australian Government negotiates and ratifies treaties with adjoining national states. It is responsible for the bathymetric survey of the continental shelf. It has the undoubted responsibility for the defence of the superjacent waters, the control of navigation and the apprehension of smugglers and wrongdoers in these waters. The conspiracy, based on petty parochialism to frustrate consideration by the highest tribunal of our land of these matters is the measure of the backwardness and the foolishness of our little Australians.

But I want to make one or two plain comments on the Treasurer's proposals. He has said that the over-riding have a look at some of the reforms that he offers to us. First of all the Government has can be truly proud. Let me mention his reforms on pensions. I statesman who said: There are lies, damned otherwise the pension will fall behind in the",57,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74

193,Mr Cooke (Petrie) (3.58),"I am sorry to accepted an annual inflation rate of about 10period of rapid innation that we are coming into at the present time. John Citizen might have been forgiven the day after the presentation of the Budget for thinking he had come out of this particular period reasonably well. If he did not drink spirits he could say: 'This will affect only those toffy people who drink Scotch. They have to pay an extra 3c a nip'. If he did not smoke he could say: 'That is all right. Those people who are driving themselves into the grave with lung cancer will have to pay another Sc a packet for their cigarettes, but of course that does not really affect me'. But of course he has not read the small print. When we read the small print, and as day by day more revelations are brought to us, we find that John Citizen's pocket has been hit very hard by this Budget. We were not told that there is to be a rise in the excise on beer. That was cunningly concealed in the Coombs report, and all the Treasurer told us was that the Government would change the measurement of the kilderkin. That sounds all very nice but now we find that an extra $7m is to be raised from excise on beer. If anyone imagines that breweries can carry that sort of a sock he is either a fool or something else. Price rises have already been hinted at. In fact in his report Dr Coombs says that the change in the measurement of the beer kilderkin will result in a price rise of about lc per 10 oz glass of beer. Typical of the Labor Government since it came to office, it has not told the people the straight facts all at the one time. It hopes that by telling the people one piece of disasterous news today and by leaving the next piece of disastrous news for a week nobody will ever put all the disasters together and realise how terrible this Government really is. John Citizen might have thought: 'That is wait for next week until we get over the shock all very well. I am still on the up and up. I of being told that interest rates will go up. have an increase in wages and all is well'. Then he comes to the Sc a gallon increase in his petrol. That does not matter to the businessman because the businessman will pass it on, but it matters to John Citizen.

It might Minister hopes everybody is away at the beach. go up by $1 a week depending on how far We have not only the tax slugs provided for he has to travel in his motor car.

If he happens to be one of those thousands and thousands of people who are waiting to have a telephone connected the Treasurer has more good news for him. When he eventually gets connected in several months time he will have to pay another $10 for the privilege of having the telephone connected. If he reads the fine print in the Budget he will also find that if he has a holiday home or a weekender somewhere the rates on that property will not be deductible from his taxable income next year. This is another one of the small print parts of the Budget. So it is not only what appears on the surface but also what comes later that is important to the pocket of the ordinary citizen of Australia. I think it.is disgraceful for the Treasurer to make a Budget Speech that gives only half the truth and half the facts. He mentioned also that there will be some restraint on private building. He did not say what it will be but we can make a pretty good conjecture at the present time because a few days after the Budget Speech he said in answer to a question in the House that he was proposing to introduce legislation which would place restrictions on all forms of non-banking credit. Building societies will be among the organisations he seeks to control. So if a person does not qualify under the means test for a housing commission home his prospect of getting a home in the near future looks bleak. We were blistered again this week by an increase in interest charges. Once again the Government adopted the approach of announcing a little bit at a time. We are told that interest rates will go up but the Prime Minister does not have the intestinal fortitude to tell us by what amount they will go up. I suppose that will",58,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74
194,Mr Fisher,On Sunday afternoon.,59,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74
195,Mr Cooke,"Yes. I am told that possiblyAustralia were waiting for. In this Budget, $8m has 'been allocated for a computer so that we can all have our medical histories and details of our private lives fed into it. If this computer is to run the health system, heaven help the patients, because recently the computers in the Department of Social Security broke down and thousands of pensioners did not receive their cheques, files were lost and computer print-outs told people that their pensions had been reduced or stopped. That is the sort of thing that is happening at the present time in the Department of Social Security. One can imagine what it will be like when this computer for the national health program gets under way. Next year there will be another levy on our taxable income to finance the Government's grandiose national health scheme. It will be a 1.35 per cent levy on all taxable incomes, including those of wives if they happen to go to work. all. There will have to be an increased amount coming out of Consolidated Revenue which, of course, comes out of the taxpayer's pocket. There will also be an increased amount coming out of motor vehicle insurance funds, and that means that motor vehicle insurance premiums will rise as well in order to finance indirectly this magnificent scheme. Quite a number of people to whom I have spoken have been looking for places to which to migrate. This is quite a serious suggestion. Not only do we have these clear indications of what is to come but we also have a blueprint in the Coombs report which the Treasurer tabled with the Budget Papers. The report recommends cunning and sneaky ways of introducing extra taxation to make it look not like taxation at all. But eventually it comes out of the taxpayer's pocket. If one has a report such as that tabled with the Budget Papers, if onefindsthat all the sneaky methods of increasing taxation which the Treasurer used this year are taken directly from the Coombs report and if no comment is made by the Treasurer as to whether the Government proposes to use the other items in the Coombs report, one must be left with the impression that the Government proposes to use some more of the Coombs report delights next year when it is short of cash. I can assure you, Mr ment has now taken over. Most of the Deputy Speaker, that in view of the way this Government is spending money it definitely will be short of cash before next year. Let me look briefly at one or two of the delightful suggestions that appear in the Coombs report. Firstly, there is the question of life assurance deductions. It is suggested that these be abolished. Of course, this will be a tremendous slug for the middle income group-the people to whom before the election the Prime Minister{ Mr Whitlam) was so concerned about giving tax relief. That concern seems to have evaporated with the summer dew. It is also suggested that the Government tax child endowment. It is running at 50c a week-it was not increased this year by the Treasurer-and the Government is going to tax it. It must give the Treasurer tremendous comfort to know that he will have the possibility of introducing that reform next year! One of the most interesting proposals in the Coombs report is to reduce the minimum taxable income. Only -ecently the Liberal Country Party Government lifted the minimum taxable income to $1,041. The Coombs report suggests to the Government that if it reduces the minimum taxable income to $417 it can pick up another >$10m. What a marvellous reform! The Government will be able to pick up another 600,000 taxpayers, according to Dr Coombs. Those people comprise working wives, university students who work during the holidays and school leavers who work for only part of the year. What a marvellous way to get money out of the pockets of people and to hit at them when they earn such a pitiful amount of money in a tax year! But this is the era of reform and I suppose that the Treasurer has to scrounge around to pick up every cent he can to finance the grandiose schemes of the present Government. I want to comment very briefly on two of the programs introduced in the Budget. The first is the education program. This was introduced with a great fanfare by the Treasurer who told us that it represented a 92 per cent increase on the education budget last year. That is all very well, but if one looks at the fine print once again one sees that it is simply a sleight of hand or book-keeping juggling. More than half of that increase has been taken directly out of the States' allocations for universities^a responsibility which this Govern-",59,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74

199,Mr Cooke,"They certainly look terrible.educational expenditure is for programs to which the former Liberal Government had been committed before the election period. So the increase in educational expenditure would be a natural follow-on from that. The only novelty is the classification of independent schools and the distribution of money on a needs concept. If this concept does not get the Government into a tremendous stew and a tremendous pickle before the end of the year, I do not know what will. One can see from the classifications of independent schools that the formula used by the Karmel Committee is hopeless. It takes no regard of the facilities of a school or what is required to give children at that school a decent education. When this is applied to Government schools as wellwe are told that it will be-on e can imagine the chaos and the mess that the Government will get itself into. The other matter I want to mention briefly is urban programs. We were told that this was an historic move. It may be historic, but if one looks at thefiguresfrom a Queensland's point to meet the need for schools, hospitals, local of view, as I am bound to do as a representagovernment works, roads and sewerage.

It has always been said in Brisbane at a meeting which he attended. that the building industry is the yardstick of Today's 'Courier-Mail' reports as follows: Question time was a tame affair with the main deal of truth in that statement. But when it dissenting voice that of former State Liberal MLA, Mr Ray Smith.

I compliment the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) deposit on a block of land in addition to purbecause this Budget, together with the recently chasing a home. If this goes on, naturally it announced monetary and fiscal measures, will bring about a very necessary transfer of resources from the private sector to the public sector. I say that it is a very necessary transfer because the public sector in this country was neglected for 23 years. The private sector was allowed to run on virtually unchecked. All the checks were placed on the public sector. The result was that we had the very serious local problems about which the former State Liberal member of parliament spoke. For example, the amendment moved by the Opposition suggests that public sector spending is inflationary but private sector spending is not. In each case further expenditure is involved. If we are to spend more in one sector because it is absolutely essential in order to meet community needs, obviously we have to spend less in the other sector. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden), who used to be a Treasurer of this country, should know this. It is very important that far greater emphasis be given today to the public sector extreme shortages in the building industry and yet the owner is going ahead with the concorrectly, shows that the economy as a whole the economy as a whole and there is a great becomes unbalanced like it is today, when all resources are going into buildings which We have spiralling land costs today brought about undoubtedly because everybody is trying to put money into land as a result of the cheap credit which is available and the easy availability of this credit for the purchase of of age, each of whom paid a 10 per cent",60,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74

203,Mr Armitage,"He was so agitated thatwill it adopt the completely negative approach that it is adopting today? It is time that a Federal government agency once again entered the field of general hire purchase. It is often forgotten that under the 1949 Commonwealth Bank Act introduced by the Chifley Government the Commonwealth Government was given power to enter the field of hire purchase. In9 months it grew to be the biggest hire purchase house in Australia, lending on new motor cars at 4 per cent flat and making a tidy profit. One of the first actions of the Menzies Government when it came to power was to introduce legislation to restrict its ability to raise fresh capital. Finally, when that did not work, the Government ordered it out of the business altogether, except in relation to farm machinery and equipment. In other words it was a bit of public competition against the private sector. Are Opposition members prepared to support it or do they want to ensure that there is no competition and to continue the present system? I believe very strongly that the Commonwealth should bring in public competition against the private sector. A little competition of that kind is good for the soul. The advocates opposite of a free enterprise economy and of competition should be the first people to support such a proposal. But the reason they do not, of course, is because of the friends from the industries they protect who finance their parties. Why do honourable members think that the hire purchase companies were given that protection, one of thefirstpieces of protection given by the incoming Menzies Government? I think also that it is time that people looked at the question of doctors fees. The day will come when the people will have to be asked whether they think the Commonwealth should have power to control doctors fees. I am concerned, as are many other honourable members, because I have received a few letters recently which obviously indicate that some members of the medical professionI do not say all members of the medical professiondeliberately, in the privacy of the surgery, are giving misleading information to their patients. surgeries. I have replied to each of the letters I have brought about grave shortages in community received. Each letter to me states that the needs. proposed health scheme of this Government will remove the freedom of the individual to choose his doctor. complete rot and nonsense. The scheme to be introduced by this Government will provide, first of all, complete freedom for the individual to choose his or her doctor. It will also provide freedom for the doctor to decide whether he or she wishes to practise ih private practice or under the health scheme in public practice. In other words, it will put a little competition into the medical profession. Once again, members of the Opposition should be the strongest advocates of the scheme-thos e advocates of free enterprise, lt will put some competition into the matter. In each case in which I have written in reply to those letters I have given that explanation. I have asked that the people who wrote the letters should reveal who is the doctor or the person giving the misleading information. I say here and now that if I can find the names of those doctors who are giving misleading information of this type to the public, I will nominate in the House each individual doctor. I do not think that that would hurt. Also in regard to doctors fees, I believe that the time will come when the Government should publicise a registered list of doctors who charge the common fee. I believe that those doctors who charge the common fee and those who do not should be identified. I think that the public will make its own choice between them and once again put a little competition in the industry. This Budget for the first time enters into fields which have never been touched by the Commonwealth before. For a start, it provides finance for the establishment of the Westmead Hospital in the western suburbs of Sydney. An independent report last year estimated that by 1980 there would be a bed shortage of over 2,600 in that area. For years a hospital at Westmead has been promised by the State Government. No funds have been allocated towards it. This Government has now taken the initiative and allocated $4m towards the buildtowards local government in the western suburbs of Sydney. These suburbs have been",62,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74

207,Mr Armitagei Agree. It Is Utter And,"Tbis is a pilot project and I hope shortly to see a task force determining the needs of the area, the priorities and thefinancingof them. This is the first time ever that the Commonwealtb has allocated funds for local government. Also for the first time it has allocated funds for urban transport. It will mean for example that the railway line between Penrith and Parramatta will be quadrupled. There has been chaos on those lines for many years and no action whatsoever was taken by the State Liberal Government to do anything about it. The Commonwealth for the first time has entered this field. It bas allocated a further $8m for child care. It has allocated $10m towards pre-school education with the object within 6 years of giving every child who requires pre-school education one year's preschool education. Another first by the Commonwealth is the provision of funds for the establishment of a land commission for the Commonwealth to acquire, subdivide and develop land. Surely, once again, this will give some competition to the private land developer and help to control the spiralling cost of land. For the first time the Commonwealth has given funds for medical health centres in areas which lack these facilities today. Tbis will be of great benefit in those areas where once again the public sector has been neglected. The latchkey children can expect assistance from the funds allocated for sporting centres, etc., in schools. The centres will be for the use of the whole community. These are very important projects. This is a reallocation of resources from the private sector to the public sector which is long overdue and essential. I congratulate the Treasurer on his Budget. I believe that together with the monetary and fiscal measures recently introduced it will bring about that very necessary reallocation of resources from the private into the public sector, and that will mean a better way of life for all Australians. ourable member for Chifley( Mr Armitage) towards the end of his speech referred to the matter of the allocation of funds for a hospital in the area covered by the Paramatta by-election and to local government funds also for the western suburbs, Mr ArmitageI rise to order. The honourable member has just misled the House insofar as he said that I referred to an allocation of funds in the area of the Parramatta election. They are not for that area; they are for the western suburbs as a whole. I correct it by saying that it is in an area which is greatly influenced by the Parramatta by-election. I shall also refer to the allocation of local government funds in the western suburbs of Sydney. These to me are some of the cheapest political motives one could possibly bring forward. I know that the people in the Parramatta electorate will express their opinion on them on election day. I say immediately that I oppose the Bill and support the amendment for the 8 good reasons which have been laid down in the amendment put forward by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) and for other reasons also. It would be absurd, I am sure, to deny that sections of the Budget would meet with the approval of the Australian public. I point to the question of education where there has been an increase of 92 per cent in the total funds made available. I will make further comment at a later stage on the spending of those funds. Quite a substantial change is proposed in some aspects of social services, or social security as it is known nowadays. Surely the change in name was an exercise in semantics. Given those 2 factors, in the Budget Speech several matters stand starkly outlined. First of all, there is evidence of an unbelievable antipathy, amounting almost to a hatred, on the part of the Government to those people who have not been attracted by the drift to the cities and who have elected to carry on their lives work in non-metropolitan areas of the Commonwealth. As I say, this attitude amounts almost to a hate of country areas. This is the feeling that is coming through to people in nonmetropolitan areas. The second aspect highlighted in many phases of the Budget Speech is the penalty which is inflicted by this Government on success in any form at all. We pride ourselves in this country on our independence of spirit. We pride ourselves on our ability or desire to have a go. We are quick to encourage the underdog and to see him come through and get up and triumph over whatever handicaps he has faced. As I see it, many of the provisions of this Budget react against success. It penalises those people who, by their own ability and sacrifice, have won their way to a more secure position. To me this latter tendency is a most dangerous one for the future of our nation. IfI were",63,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74

209,Mr England,"If I have misled anybodyasked to illustrate a third factor 1 would quickly indicate the acceleration towards centralisation in government-the erosion of State rights. The fourth aspect I would highlight is the deception, almost dishonesty, which is now apparent in respect of some of the election bait which was cast out on 2 December last. Taking these matters out of order. I will deal first with centralism. The Commonwealth Constitution lays down very clearly that the Commonwealth has 39 powers. Following the last referendum the number of powers may now total 40. The figure that I have given is substantially correct. The powers are very clearly outlined and expressed. I know that the States have power to delegate responsibilities. I am not saying that the Government has acted against the provisions of the Constitution-that is something which is challengeable at law-'bu t I do say that the Government acted very much against the spirit' of the Constitution. The tied grants, for this reason: Every year in that synod we as they have grown in this Parliament over the years and as they are being perpetuated very strongly by this Government, in fact amount to a form of duress on State governments to hand over some of their rights. In my term in this Parliament, since I960, I have seen at least 3 new departments set up under the previous Government. One was the Department of Education and Science which grew from the Office of Education. The others were the Department of Tourism and the Department of Housing. But the creation of these new departments was just playboy stuff compared with what has happened since 2 'December. I do not know accurately the total number of departments. I did not do my homework on it. But I think it runs to about 37. A tremendous increase has occurred and a number of the new departments deal substantially with matters which are the prerogative of the States under the spirit of the Constitution. I am reminded of a speech I heard in Kings Hall when the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) was welcoming a New Zealand delegation to this Parliament. The Prime Minister-and this should be known by everyone -complimente d New Zealand on its outstanding democratic system-on e Parliament, no states; one House, no bicameral system or House of review interjection is recorded. The Prime Minister complimented New Zealand on its 2 party system with no minor parties and its first past the post voting. Let Australia, as a nation, never forget that. I acknowledged earlier the advances proposed in education. The allocation made in this field this financial year is 92 per cent greater than the amount appropriated last financial year. This nation seethes today about the injustice of some of the new provisions contained in legislation emanating from the Department of Education. It seethes with indignation at the proposed methods of distribution of funds by way of aid to independent schools. I think that the Government should note that all of the criticism does not come from those people who have been deprived. It comes from others who are ready to admit, have admitted and continue to admit, that the present arrangement is discriminatory. I enjoyed 12 years of service as a lay representative of a synod of my church before I entered this Parliament. I mention that fact were confronted with the tormenting problem of trying to balance the statements of receipts and expenditure and the balance sheet for the 2 schools of the diocese. The2 schools are still functioning. The2 schools are not in my electorate. I am not being parochial. But I mention them as examples from my experience. They are All Saints College in Bathurst and the Marsden School for Girls. I am glad to say that these schools through good management, through dedication on the part of many, including the school council, the staff and those supporting them, through sacrificial giving and by the grace of God have lived through the times that they have been called on to survive. The schools have lived through a tremendous rural recession in the course of which it was quite common for children to be taken from their school and to remain at home. If it had not been for the fact that more city children than usual were attracted to these country schools and for the many instances of the influx of Asian students to these schools, the schools would have gone to the wall before now. I remember the election promise of the Australian Labor Party that there would be no reduction in the aid to independent schools. Government supporters can say that the total allocation may or may not be more than last year. But why has the Government departed from the most equitable system that we can possibly have in which we think of boys and girls intead of bricks, mortar and buildings",64,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74

214,Mr Uren (Reid,"'Minister for Urban andurban and regional development. Under tbe heading of 'Cities', the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) has announced an allocation of $136m for the next financial year. Most of the programs under this heading are historic for a national government in Australia. This is the first time they have been attempted or for which allocations have been made in a budgetary program such as ithis. I do not want to try to deal with the whole range of our program in ithe short time available to me. Rather, I want to concentrate on our policies relating to land and land commissions. There are 3 great principles which underlie our policies on the cities: Firstly, this Government believes that the national Government must involve itself directly in cities; secondly, this Government believes that we must bring about changes in our cities which will make them more efficient; and, thirdly, this Government believes that we must bring about changes in our cities which will give more equal opportunities for people to enjoy living in them. In Australia the pattern of urban growth has been determined largely by the accidents of history and the activities of the market-place. The development and growth of our cities has resulted in real income being transferred from the poor to the rich. In recent years, these income transfers have become massive. Only last week I read where it is claimed that Melbourne's land boom has made 30 people millionaires in the past year. This has been achieved through no effort of their own, but simply by being in a position to exploit people's basic need for shelter. An example could be given where this has happened in every State, particularly in the capitals of the States. The faster the population growth, the greater the fortunes amassed. This situation reminds me of a learned parliamentarian who once said: Unearned increments in land value are not the only form of undeserved profit but they are the principle form and they are derived from processes which are positively detrimental to the general public. And at last the land becomes ripe for sale, and that means the price becomes too tempting to be resisted any longer. And then . . . and not until then . . . is it sold by the inch or by the yard at 10-50 times its true value. This evil process strikes at every form of activity. The more a municipality has improved the area, the mor it will have to pay, for any land now e required for future improvements. And no matter where you look or what examples you select, you wiil see that every form of enterprise, every step in material progress, is only undertaken after the land owner has skimmed the cream off for himself. And everywhere today the man or the public body who wishes to put the land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine to the man who is putting it to an inferior use and, in some cases, to no use at all. And its owner is able to levy toll upon all other forms of wealth and any other form of industry. 'Land which is a necessity of human existence, which is 'the urban source of wealth, but is strictly limited in extent, and which is fixed in geographic position, differs from all other forms of property. A land owner who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts of a big city, watches the busy population around him making the city larger and more famous every, day and, all the while, he sits still and does nothing. Roads are made, services are improved and water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles away. He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general welfare, he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived. The population of the city grows and keeps on growing. I have heard this learned parliamentarian quoted with great respect by members on the other side of the House. The words are those of Sir Winston Churchill. 1 ask the honourable members opposite: Do they disagree with this point of viev? I believe his remarks are just as relevant in Australia today as when he made them in Britain over 50 years ago. For those who still question why the Government wants to be involved in urban development, the short answer is that Adam Smith died 183 years ago. The conditions for the success of the old laissez-faire doctrines have long since disappeared. Private enterprise no longer goes unchecked, nor does it go unaided. There is no going back on this. A classically competitive urban land market is inconceivable. The public sector must give leadership. It must play a leading role in determining how a metropolitan area should develop. The whole process of urban development involves location. Therefore land values and land use are key elements. The rapidly rising price of land in our capital cities is something which disturbs this Government and distresses the young people over the length and breadth of this country who are saving for a home. There is an alternative. That alternative was on show here in Canberra-unti l the GortonMoEwen Government destroyed it in 1970 and 1971. Properly managed, we believe that the method of urban development used in Canberra is the most efficient and most equitable available in this nation. This is why the Government is negotiating with each State to establish land commissions which will buy substantial tracts of land needed for urban development. Land acquired by these commissions will be made available fully serviced at a fair price. South Australia and Western Australia have already introduced legislation to create land commissions. Our policies on land form part of our urban policies. What we have to do is to change the rules of the game. Urban development needs to be planned so that it does not take place simply as the consequence of pressure by major landholders for rezoning. One of the chief characteristics of the legislation for a specified period, conduct a growth of our cities is that often the sequence study of the area and if the study is successful of development is private initiative for profit proclaim a designated site. This of course is followed by a harried and strained public being done in the Albury-Wodonga area and investment in basic infrastructure. If the we hope that it is also being done in the honourable member who has been interjecting Bathurst-Orange area by co-operation between wants an example of this, he should look at the Australian Government and the governthe Gold Coast of Queensland. In the Gold ments of New South Wales and Victoria in the Coast, there is private affluence and public first instance, and co-operation between the squalor. Over 84 per cent of that area is Australian and New South Wales governments unsewered, yet private speculation still runs in the second instance. rife. So, there is a great need for governments to be able to co-ordinate the provision of services to developing areas. In order to get an of speculation which occurs in possible future efficient co-ordination and provision of sergrowth areas. If this can be done, the average vices, governments ought to be able to identify home seeker will have a much better chance specific areas for development. Before these areas are publicly identified, program are joint Australian and State governthe price of land should be stabilised. Under ment programs. They are programs to provide the freehold system the present planning the States with funds for land acquisition system is a blueprint for speculation. This is one which they have never had before. This is the of the major reasons why we in the Australian first Budget allocation to the States for this Government must change the rules of the requirement. They now have no excuse to game. Land commissions and the land price avoid taking positive action. In addition, there stabilisation legislation which we are encouragis much the State governments could have ing the States to pass are the means by which done towards meeting the problem of the high we can achieve better co-ordination and better price of land for housing. If the States are planning. Ultimately, they are the means by really serious about the problem of inflation, which we will enable young people to enter if they are really serious about the problem of the land market at a cheaper price. This Govyoung people trying to buy a home, these are ernment does not believe that speculative the sorts of policies tbey could adopt. Not only profits are just. The whole problem of land prices is one in which the States have the power to provide some of the solutions. Until now they have not chosen to do so. The Australian Government has no power to freeze land prices or even to stabilise land prices. However, the States bave the power to do both. The Australian Government is not asking the States to freeze land prices. The land price stabilisation legislation which we are urging the States to adopt should set out a formula for the price to be paid for land which is acquired within a designated site. There are 2 essential components of the acquisition price. The first component is the 'base value', that is, the value of the land at the date of the initial proclamation. Secondly there is a value increase factor which can be expressed as a percentage of the base value and should be tied to an index of inflation. The aim of land price stabilisation legislation therefore is to identify general areas where urban growth is being considered by a State government, apply land price stabilisation In this way we hope to reduce the high level of buying a block of land at a fair price. The land commissions program and the new cities that, they could do it within a few months. Firstly, they should show what is happening in the land market. They can do this by simply publishing the appropriate statistics on land prices, on the rezoning of land and the subdivision of land. Secondly, tbey should identify to what extent the present innation is caused by a real shortage of housing land relative to the volume of new housing commencements achieve what all Australians would want them and to what extent the inflation is caused by to achieve-to give Australian families access excessive demand through land speculation. to land and housing at fair prices.

215,Mr Bury (Wentworth) (5.17),"Th eout, the Treasurer his in fact proved to be a very solid shadow. At last he has gravitated to a position of power. Over the years when he made his contributions to this House a large number of people were not inclined to take very much notice of him, but now they realise when they study the question that year by year, little by little, he enunciated much of the policy which is now being embodied in the policy of the new Government. Perhaps they did not listen at the time because they thought that nobody could be as silly as that, that such ideas were not to be taken seriously. Now they await the next onslaught coming to rob them of something or other. Perforce, they have to take the Treasurer very seriouslv now. I congratulate the Treasurer on bringing formodity movements and prices nor the moveward various matters which have been under way for some years in the Treasury. I have in mind program budgeting and all the other things which to some extent appear to have been taken over by the Prime Minister( Mr Other matters also have been beyond his Whitlam). Whether that is so I do not know because, despite open government, it is very difficult to follow these matters. I hope that by now the Prime Minister realises the limitations of open Government. He has recognised these limitations because on several occasions the exchange rate has been varied. Quite clearly this is a case where discussion by the whole Cabinet with more entering such discussion creates more mess and confusion. The only way to handle these matters practically is to confine them to the very few even if at times it does mean excluding Ho Chi Jim and leaving out someone who might consider he should be consulted. Historically it has always been the position that the decisions must be made by a limited number of people who by the time such discussions arise are pretty well primed with all the main considerations which must be taken into account. As has been stated by a number of people recently, this Budget is notable in that it provides for a huge transfer of resources away from the private sector to the public sector. Whatever view one takes of this situation, it does lead to many practical consequences. Some may rejoice and think more should have been spent on behalf of the public and less on behalf of the private sector but the fact remains that basically it is the private sector which produces distributive income and builds up living standards. What the Budget does particularly is basically to ignore the problem of inflation. When the Treasurer is charged with this or is asked questions about inflation he prefers to reply fairly blandly that inflation did not start with the Labor Government or his custody of thefinancesof the country. This is perfectly true. Inflation has been developing in many ways throughout the western world and taking different forms in different places. Certain serious problems for which the Treasurer and the Government cannot be blamed have played a serious part in our own dislocation. For instance, the Treasurer can hardly be blamed for the recent trend in world commodity prices which have gone up and down like a switchback and dragged the economies of the world in their wake. Nothing done in Australia could avoid the tremendous crisis which has come from this flow of comment in capital which has flowed around the world and come into Australia in large quantities. power. For instance, fixing an appropriate exchange rate for Australia has become a complicated business. Of course it is simple enough for any particular group to look around and decide fairly quickly how it would be better off or worse off according to what action has been taken. For several generations we have had sterling to latch on to and we adjusted our exchange rate in accordance with the basic movement in the value of sterling. More recently we have changed from sterling to the United States dollar and now we face confusion. Not only is sterling dragging very badly and its value continually plunging but the United Sttes dollar also is dragging its anchor, if anything, worse. They are continually changing relationships with each other and the other leading currencies of the world have all been changing inter se. This provides a set of circumstances in which it takes a fine degree of judgment to decide the sensible course for Australia to pursue. One thing that can be said is that by appreciating our currency the Government has followed what might be dictated or suggested by current movements in the exchange rate and in our external trade. The fact is that while the external value of the Australian dollar is being steadily appreciated, its internal value has been steadily weakened by the process of inflation which hitherto has not been as bad in Australia as it has been elsewhere. However this position is rapidly being undermined and changing. It is not a simple judgment to make nor should we come to a simple minded conclusion which is easy to come to in terms of particular interests involved but which does not really add much to the total understanding of the situation. What we must do is follow the notion that the Government is pursuing a high external value for Australian currency but by its conduct is constantly eroding its internal purchasing power. In the end-in the long pull-it will be the way we manage our affairs in Australia which will decide whether, in fact, Australia really has a strong currency or a currency which will steadily become weaker and weaker. Whatever is done about dealing with inflation certain things must be done and these are difficult for any government of any persuasion to achieve. Firstly, something must be done to limit the constant growth of incomes at such a pace. The constant putting up of incomes, irrespective of what is produced and the productivity involved in the process, must be slowed down. It is essential to bring government expenditure under much closer control and also to pursue sound management policies in regard to Budget deficits and generally to contain the local fiscal situation. Unless governvate sector will find it very difficult with the ment expenditure is controlled, limited and curtailed no system of pricefixinghas the least chance of success, except for a very short period. It is also vital that the Government take charge of the monetary policy-the supply of money. We have had considerable growth in this respect partly from overseas-somethin g has been done to curtail this-and also by internal domestic expansion. This growth was well under way before the Government came to power a progressive tightening of money. The With respect to inflation it is no good money supply has become much too large and referring back too far historically and saying ill disciplined. Presumably from now on that somebody else has had it worse. The really interest rates will rise, on whatever day the guilty party with inflation is the last person increase takes effect. If this process is to make who had reasonable control of averting tlie any impact on inflation it will have to be disaster. So whatever has happened so far, the applied progressively. It will make it more present responsibility now fastens directly and and more difficult to operate profitably in the primarily straight away on the Treasurer. It private sector. As it passes around from one is a difficult responsibility to take but the to the other it will gradually have the effect Treasurer cannot avoid it. He has to defend of slowing down activity. This is thefirstreal, himself. Is he doing everything he can to effective move that the Treasurer and the curtail and inhibit this process? I would suggest Government have made towards inhibiting the that at least in one respect he has now come process of inflation. This is utterly essential to realise this situation with respect to the for Australia's future. money supply. He has announced what used to be abused as most horrible when the Opposivelopment said that the Australian Governtion was responsible for running the country, ment must have power to control prices. This namely, that a credit squeeze is about to be instituted. I personally believe that something of this kind is really required, but it will have some very unpleasant consequences. Today in the House we heard certain statements about the bond market and putting up rates of interest. If the economy is to be slowed down and if we are to slow down the rate of growth obviously there must be a rise in interest rates. This will have a number of other effects on the economy which will not be pleasant from the point of view of anybody. As has already been pointed out today, it will affect the housing situation, the ability to go on constructing houses and the ability for young people to pay for their houses. As indicated in the Budget Speech, the Treasurer is already well aware that housing is so crucial to the total economy that it becomes a very sensitive indicator. If the economy is to be slowed down, housing is the most effective area in which to start doing this. Clearly this has to be done. Despite this, huge sums of public money are earmarked in the Budget for State housing, so there will be a continued huge expansion of housing in the public sector, and the priimpending and increasing credit squeeze which will be applied month after month from now on. This is an unpopular thing for any government to do. It is rather amusing now to see the Treasurer changing sides, and instead of talking of a great credit squeeze, as he used to describe this kind of policy, inventing a slightly more euphonious term for it. But in fact it remains a credit squeeze. We have begun-and it must be continued The Minister for Urban and Regional Deis now the current cry. One can see that the idea of the Government is that prices will rise higher and higher under the impact of what it is doing, whatever inhibiting effect the curtailment of money supply and credit restrictions will eventually have. Many price increases are now in the pipeline, and the simple theory put forward is that if the Government has power to control prices all will be well. As I said earlier, without limiting incomes, without curtailing Government expenditure and controlling money supply, no measure of price control has the least prospect ultimately of being successful. This is the basic reality. The other things are mere trimmings. Price control as such we experienced in the closing years of the Second World War and just afterwards. When it is really attempted on a large scale by the Government it becomes rapidly evident that you cannot have price control by public authority unless in turn you can control all the ingredients which go to make up prices. They include wage rates, raw materials and so on. To control prices by edict you have to finish up with iron-clad control over the whole economy. That is why I personally resist any idea that power to control prices should be transferred to Canberra on a permanent basis. Ths power is not really wanted for price control. Price control is merely the deception to get a favourable vote to transfer power to Canberra. I believe this is a snare and a delusion. It will not be properly worked. We will get involved in all sorts of tangles. There will be detailed control by and through the bureaucracy and the Ministers. There will be personal interference according to preferences which people express, but we will end up with an iron-clad control over the whole of the Australian economy. This is why I believe we should resist any process of legislative price control. We have a little time to watch what happens in Canberra with an experiment in price control. If price control had a chance of being successful anywhere in Australia it would be in Canberra, which, is full of the necessary control and administrative ingredients. But we should set our face against any idea of transfer of direct powers over prices and all the ingredients necessary to maintain price control from the States to Canberra on anything but a very short term basis. Debate (on motion by Dr Jenkins) adjourned, MEAT EXPORT CHARGE BILL 1973 Bill presented by Mr Grassby, and read a first time. Second Reading Immigration) (5.37)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to impose a charge on meat exported from Australia in order to recoup the cost to the Government of export meat inspection. The charge will be payable by exporters. Exports of meat and meat products which have been inspected and declared fit for human consumption will be subject to the charge. The charge will be 1.6c per lb on meat and edible offals derived from cattle (including buffaloes) and calves, and lc per lb on meat and edible offals derived from sheep, lambs, goats and pigs. The charge is to be imposed on those meats and offals whether exported in fresh, chilled, frozen, canned, dried or otherwise prepared form and on mixtures of meat with other food products. For products containing mixtures of meat and other food products the charge will be payable on the net weight of the mixed product. For mixed products containing beef or veal the charge will be 1.6c per lb and for mixed products containing other meats the charge will be lc per lb. The legislation provides for the charge to operate for a period of 33 months from 1 October 1973 to 30 June 1976. The charge has been calculated on the basis of the estimated expenditure of export meat inspection over the period 1 July 1973 to 30 June 1976, and the estimated quantity of meat that will be exported over the 33 month period. The legislation provides for regulations to be made permitting total or partial exemption from the charge. The major part of the cost of export meat inspection has been met from Consolidated Revenue since 1927 and it has become a large item of expenditure in the Budget. The measure was originally introduced to offset low export prices and has been maintained ever since. This is in contrast to the present situation in which world demand for meat is particularly strong and prices are at high levels. The cost of export meat inspection has grown rapidly in recent years, rising from $5.3m in 1968-69 to $11.4m in 1972-73. A significant part of this increase can be attributed to the need to expand the inspection staff to meet requirements of overseas countries. In this regard it is to be noted that",70,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74
216,Mr Grassby (Riverina,"Minister forover the period December 1969 to June 1973 the number of veterinarians and meat inspectors in export establishments has increased from 1,128 to 1,726. It should also be noted that, in effect, overseas consumers have been subsidised from Consolidated Revenue. Furthermore, local consumers bear the cost of meat inspected for local consumption as State authorities impose inspection fees on wholesalers in respect of meat destined for the local market. It is emphasised that the export charge is not intended to be a means of diverting supplies of meat from the export to the domestic market. Currently there is a very strong export demand for Australian meat and in these circumstances it is not expected that the charge will be passed back to the livestock producer. Clearly there is every justification for charging for the export inspection service instead of perpetuating the position of the overseas consumer being subsidised from Consolidated Revenue. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on adjourned. MEAT EXPORT CHARGE COLLECTION BILL 1973 Bill presented by Mr Grassby, and read a first time.

Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed (vide page 784). Dr JENKINS (Scullin) (5.42)-In participating in this debate on the Appropriation Bill one can follow 2 courses. One can discuss the Appropriation Bill and the Budget Speech or one can discuss the amendment that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden). It is rather interesting to note that the amendment is such a mess of nonsense and contradictory terms that the majority of honourable members on both sides of this House have concentrated on the Budget, as well they might because of the trivial nature of the amendment. During the course of the debate a number of Opposition members have made accusations against the Government in regard to its conduct of foreign affairs. This shows the development or retention of their colonial and gunboat mentality. They suggest that because Australia has disagreed with the United States motion by Mr Sinclair) of America relationships with that country have been affected. They misunderstand the basic characteristic of the American people, which is a strong sense of independence. Whilst Americans might not like being disagreed with, they do respect a country that stands up for itself. They respect independence.

217,Mr Grassby (Riverina,"Minister for Imhas severed ties with the United Kingdom.they emerge after those 3 years, or of suppressing any newspaper that disagrees with him. Is this the sort of thing honourable members opposite support? Members of the Opposition have said that this is a socialist Budget. As a socialist, I have examined it. I cannot find that it is a socialist Budget. It is certainly a social welfare Budget dealing with the quality of life and with a great deal of public expenditure. I regret that more notice has not been taken by honourable members opposite of the descriptions given by the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) of the economic context in which the Budget has been presented and of the budgetary objectives. The favourable features spoken of, such as strongly rising demand, vigorous growth in output, full employment and external strength, have been overshadowed by the persistent cry of inflation. They are worth more than that. The Treasurer is to be congratulated on this his first Budget. He pointed out that the Budget was not and would not be the only instrument used to maintain a favourable economy in Australia. One can sympathise with him in the problems of the presence of increasing inflation and of combatting it. It is not a new phenomenon, as many honourable members have said. Many factors other than the Budget are being used to damp down inflation. For instance, there have been the revaluations of the Australian currency, tariff reductions and the introduction of the Prices Justification Tribunal. One of the problems which are difficult to combat in these circumstances is the build-up of an inflationary psychology. The Leader of the Opposition and his myrmidons have certainly done much to build up this inflationary psychology in the community. With wide publicity and discussion, the community is saturated with a pervading inflationary expectation. The result is that the rate of inflation accelerates. Employees take appropriate steps to seek ever higher rates of wage increases with the view that such increases will compensate for expected inflation. Along with this, employers are more ready to grant increases because, with an atmosphere of expected inflation, they know that the prices they charge can readily be adjusted. So it snowballs and goes on in other areas. One of the other great factors-thi s was mentioned by the honourable member for question of imported inflation. This reflects the situation in many other countries. The role of the United States in world trade has a great influence on many other countries. Australia seems to have been affected much more by the attitudes taken by the previous Government. I believe that appropriate steps have been taken in this field of imported inflation, in the form of the up-valuation of our currency and the tariff measures. There is no doubt that the Australian currency was under-valued. The question of incomes policy and wage and price controls has received a great deal of attention in this debate. The advantages and disadvantages have been revealed. One thing is certain, and the Government has made this quite clear: It is not prepared to accept unemployment as a necessary factor to control inflation. Where measures that would appear to lead to unemployment have had to be taken, compensatory measures have been instituted to supplement employment. The employment figures speak for themselves. If a purely incomes policy were to be instituted, as has been suggested by the Opposition side, unemployment inevitably would follow. The Budget in its revenue producing section has relied in a major way on disguised expenditures-that is, revenue concessions. The Treasurer is to be congratulated in this area. When in Opposition he was consistent in his claims that this area was the one that needed the utmost attention. The honourable member for Wentworth at least agreed that when the Treasurer was in opposition he was honest and consistent in putting forward some of the rackets and ramps that he saw and felt should be corrected. He has, as Treasurer, wielded the broom with vigour and removed many of those loopholes, ramps and rackets which have provided tax dodges for many years and which had provided income to authors who wrote books about loopholes that people could use to dodge taxation. The Treasurer has to be congratulated for closing these loopholes. His aotion is entirely consistent with the attitudes he has taken in the past. We hear objection because the Treasurer has the temerity to suggest that the volume of beer should be correctly measured. Apparently being an honest man is a bad thing in this country! Among other revenue producing measures he introduced was the impost on petrol. It is amazing to see throughout our country the number of signs on petrol stations advertising 8c off or 7c off. What a racket and ramp must be going on in the fixing of prices for petroleum products in Australia. Is it any wonder",74,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74
218,Wentworth ( Mr Bury),"is the overwhelmingthat this is seen as a fruitful area for raising revenue? Among the things that this Budget is about are the realities of Australian life. I would like to refer to an article called 'Australian Society: The Realities' which appeared in the July-August 1973 'Development News Digest', a publication of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. It talks about the things which this Government has tried to correct, about the problem of the majority standard in our community. It states: Thus it is said 'that Australia has perhaps the etTective action to change their disadvantaged highest standard of living in the world because 70 situation. per cent of the population live in 'owner-occupied dwellings'. But what about the other 30 per cent? The fact of the matter is that housing is one of the greatest causes of poverty for this other 30 per cent and if you are one of the 30 per cent it is not much satisfaction to be told that 70 per cent of the people are all right. The article continues: It is said that Australians have a high per capita attending universities has not affected this income. This is an average; which means that there group so much, but we should look at the way are plenty of people who have below average income. this money for educational assistance will be At least 5 per cent of Australian families earn less expended.

Is this what we want to see? A supposed sign of universal affluence is that there and other teaching facilities for these people. is about one car for every 2 people in Australia, yet It is realised that this Government is looking a Melbourne transportation survey discovered that across the wide scope of Australian people 63.2 per cent of low income families did not own and is determined that an under-class shall motor cars whereas 42.8 per cent of high income people owned at least two cars per family. The majority standard creates a false impression standard may be said to be so high. There are of equality and universally good standard of many other aspects of the educational part of living . . . What the majority standard conceals is that there opportunity to discuss later. are definite extremes in Australian society. We talk about Australia being a middle class society. One could accept that about 50 per cent are middle class, but there is the other 50 per cent. The article states that above the middle class are the people who have an excessive share of societal goods; below it is the working class which has some difficulty in keeping up with the accepted standard of living. Further below are the poor who have to struggle For the necessities of life. On a modest sociological estimate they comprise about 8 per cent of the population and number about 1 million people. There are some who have an extravagantly high standard and others who have a totally inadequate standard. The general attitude towards these 2 extremes seems to be extremely permissive or apathetic. It is suggested that in Australia we were developing an under-class, a section of society that is denied access to those goods, opportunities and services that even people in the working class enjoy. In Australia the likely members of such an under-class are mainly Aborigines, deserted wives and widows with young families, pensioners and large low income families. The article points out that the only 2 things they have in common are that they live in poverty and that they are such a desperate and neglected group that they lack the means, opportunities, political innuence and popular support for As well as looking after the rest of the community this Budget has done something for those people too. One of the things that basically they suffer from is lack of opportunity in education. We see in the Budget a doubling of Federal money spent on education. It may be said that the abolition of fees for families. In primary schools, according to the need of the areas, there will be proper library not develop, even though the majority the Budget which I trust one will have the I want to make some passing remarks about -the health field. It is with absolute disgust that I see the process of misrepresentation and dishonesty with regard to the Government's health scheme. The other day I went to collect a refund from the Hospitals Benefits Association of Victoria. When I was handed back my book and refund I was handed also a politically oriented health scheme pamphlet on which had been spent part of my contributions for the more than 22 years that I have belonged to this health fund. I resented that greatly because the pamphlet was full of dishonesty. I have heard the argument about the use of the computer in the new health scheme. The computer is to be used to keep records of usage throughout the community. As a member of a voluntary health insurance organisation my family unit has a number. It is stored away by the hospital benefits organisation which keeps on its records the number of claims I have made, the complaints that there have been in my family and the categories they come under. In fact thc Hospital Benefits Association has just bought a computer to carry out a function in respect of which the Government is being criticised. I would rather trust the integrity of governments than private organisations like that. They are supposed to have contributors on the boards controlling them, but they run their annual meetings in such a way that their contributors do not know that meetings are being held. If they think they are short of numbers -they get the employees of the organisation to go to the annual meeting to elect their puppets to the Board. Perhaps the Opposition wants to return to the use of the abacus in recording health finances. This is the way that members opposite talk. Does the Oppoosition not know that in developed countries computers make a real contribution not only to recording but also to the practice of medicine itself. It we are to have this smear, scare and feat campaign Australia will be denied the benefits that computers can give. Let some honourable members opposite and their medical friends who are indulging in such misrepresentation look through the work that has been done at the University of Missouri on the use of computers in the diagnosis and sorting out of complaints. They will find that by proper use of those computers there can be correctness and accuracy of diagnosis and that better treatment can be carried out very effectively. After all, in one city in America, by using a computer in its social welfare agency it was found that a woman who had been receiving social security payments for 15 years had never had a medical examination. It was only the computer that revealed this, not the human beings concerned. When she was examined she was found to have a minor complaint which was treated. She is now in full employment, looking after herself. So let us have done with this hogwash, this dreadful hypocricy that is going on in this field. Let us settle down and realise that people want decent health facilities and can get decent health facilities. Let us stop this fear and smear. Another item which is mentioned in the come. The weekend decision on currency Budget is the question of legal aid. It is revaluation and interest rates indicates this mentioned with regard to the Aboriginal only too clearly. The Government will be people. I am pleased to see that it is to be forced to take further corrective action next provided for Aboriginal people. My one regret is that at this stage the Government has not been able to go to the extent of offering legal aid to another class in the community, the under-privileged, those who are too poor to have proper legal representation in so many fields. I congratulate the Treasurer on his first and perhaps one of the most significant Budgets that this country has had. The Treasurer { Mr Crean) has stated that the task of this Budget is to reconcile the Government's determination to carry out its program with wise management of the economy. He has failed and failed badly. It is understandable that after 23 years in Opposition, Labor's first Budget would seek to implement as many of its policies as possible but there is a fundamental requirement that any government in framing its budget must have a regard for priorities and implement policies and reforms -which it believes are desirable within the context of national economic responsibility. But this is a document which lacks responsibility and in some statements is guilty of deception. The Australian Labor Party inherited an economy in good shape, moving ahead towards full employment and with the rate of inflation in the last quarter of 1972 down to a level which was getting very close to manageable. Now we have enormous increases in public expenditure and an unacceptable inflation rate. Labor will discover that Australians after 23 years of growth and progress under the Liberal -Party-Country Party coalition, with real improvement in living standards, will not tolerate a government which clearly demonstrates its inability to manage effectively the financial affairs of the nation. Of course, not all the decisions are bad. Some should and will be supported, but the Budget's inflationary impact will create immense problems and much hardship to many sections of the community, particularly to those groups which Labor pretends the Budget is designed to assist. The Government will of course delay facing up to the inevitable day of reckoning as long as it can-certainly , I believe, until after the Senate election-bu t Australians should realise that bruised though they are by this Budget, the worse is yet to",75,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74
219,Mr Eric Robinson (Mcpherson) (6.2),"year which will only further damage the nation's confidence and growth. We are dealing with an expenditure of SI2,168m, an increase of 19 per cent over last year. This is a dangerously high increase, particularly in the context of today's economy and a decision which will ensure a rate of innation higher than 10 per cent. Australia cannot afford a Treasurer who for short term political advantage delivers an expansionary and inflationary Budget at a time when the state of the economy clearly calls for different decisions and emphases. But first of all, let me give credit where it is due. The increased allocation for cultural activities including the National Library, the National Gallery and collection, and the Australian Council of Arts is desirable. In recreation, the decision to provide community and school centres in co-operation with State governments, the increased vote to the National Fitness Council and the allocation of funds for national park development is equally desirable. In welfare, I commend decisions on Aboriginal advancement, road safety, the increased subsidy to senior citizens centres and Meals on Wheels organisation and assistance to handicapped children. The total expenditure on these measures is not large but regrettably, they are reduced to lesser importance when the duplicity and deception in vital areas is unmasked. In education, Labor has dishonoured pre-election and election promises. Its attempt to claim an increase of more than 90 per cent in education expenditure is phoney. Whilst taking over responsibility for tertiary education, tax reimbursements to the States were adjusted to allow for this-clos e on $200m. The credibility of the Minister for Education ( Mr Beazley) has been severely damaged by the unjust treatment handed out to independent schools. The categorisation of schools on unacceptable grounds after superficial inquiry indicates the Government's preparedness to accept discriminatory advice. Labor has created justifiable anger in the Australian electorate because of its basic injustice in this matter to parents, children and schools. I sincerely hope that the Minister does not hesitate to review some of the decisions arrived at, which are so obviously unfair. In health, despite the remarks of the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) Labor continues to state without either convincing argument or proof that the present health scheme is inequitable and inefficient. Whilst the present scheme has some imperfections which will require attention, this Government is obsessed with socialist and centralist policies, and against growing public concern it allocates in the Budget funds to commence the implementation of its national health scheme. The Government and the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) in this vital area, continue to attempt to force on Australians a scheme which will result in a poorer medical service and at the same time restrictI use the word restrict deliberately-the freedom of choice of doctor and hospital. Labor would serve the interests of the nation if it looked at the question of dental care and made some positive contribution to what is required in this nation. There are approximately one million Australians who are entitled to pension payments. Many of these people depend substantially or solely on these payments. Surely they are entitled to enjoy an improved standard of living and to be safeguarded from policies which erode their personal savings. Our senior citizens have been sold short in this Budget. Labor's announced policy is to increase pensions twice a year until they reach 25 per ceni of average weekly earnings. The Budget lifts basic pension rates by $1.50 and at the same time unleashes the forces of inflation which will negate the purchasing power of the pension increase and decrease the value of savings. This section of our community is unfairly disadvantaged, not just those on old age and other pensions but everyone on superannuation and fixed incomes who are not in a position to take any steps to protect themselves and their families from the ravages of inflation. One clear result of this Budget is that every Australian, old or young, wealthy or poor, will find that within a year each $100 of savings will be worth no more than $90, and probably closer to $80. In the field of housing, Labor is guilty of duplicity. The Budget gives effect to a scheme for deductibility of mortgage interest. But with sleight of hand, after no indication of this action in the course of the election campaign, the Labor Party is to end the valuable homes savings grants scheme, which has been of great assistance to young married couples in helping to provide a deposit on the purchase of a home. The deposit is surely needed before any advantage can be taken of interest deductibility. Sunday's monetary policy decision will now force up interest rates and further disadvantage young Australians. Sunday's decision was an attack upon home ownership in this country. In addition, the housing industry with all its national significance and importance is already reflecting the problems of costs and shortages which will occur with increasing ferocity from Labor's irresponsibility in economic management. We heard a lot about cities during the elecsures have been taken against the wine and tion campaign, but the proposals in the Budget were not a very inspiring first effort to tackle some of the real problems of urban life. The national backlog in sewerage-despit e the comment of the Minister for Urban and limited attention only. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development comes into the House and makes comments, almost bordering on insult about the Gold Coast and sewerage. WhatI hope the Minister will do is make some contribution to solving the problems of the second fastest growing city in this nation. Making cryptic and insulting remarks does not require much ability. A more enterprising approach to the tourist industry would have repaid the Government. Obviously the Minister for Tourism and sorry for him-is finding it difficult to convince his socialist colleagues that the private enterprise tourist industry properly encouraged can contribute handsomely to the national economy. The relatively small allocation to the industry for promotion purposes is not good enough. A bolder imaginative approach, including depreciation allowances on tourist income producing buildings and a rethinking of some civil aviation and transport policies would have not only assisted the industry but repaid the national purse. There are many other examples in the Budget of discriminatory and deceptive attitudes. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, the overriding problem is we have government expenditure up by 19 per cent.| Increased costs include those of the Public Service new departments, commissions and committees to carry out Labor's socialist policies. They include public expendilarly unjustifiable decision in the context of ture on projects like the pipeline authorityover $100m of taxpayers' money-whic h could have been financed by private enterprise. To finance this type of exercise and to help towards balancing the books, we have action on one hand to disadvantage private enterprise, which really generates the nation's wealth, to discriminate particularly against the primary producer and the mining industry and to downscale the defence capacity and, on the other hand, to inflame inflation further by increasing indirect taxes. For the rural producer, bounties on cheese and butter are being phased out, investment allowances discontinued and telephone charges increased. In addition, other undesirable meafruit growing industries and, of course, the mining industry, which has contributed so much to the nation's growth in recent years, as well as being singled out for continuous and vicious attacks by the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor). Whilst no one believes there is an external threat to Australia at the present time, Labor has a responsibility to maintain adequate defence capacity. Surely we are realistic enough to accept that it is essential to back up foreign policy. The nation's security is the prime responsibility of government. Labor has deliberately downscaled our defence capacity particularly in the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force in order to assist it to pay for its socialist policies. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. sion of the sitting I had given the House some detail of Labor's duplicity in key policy areas particularly in housing, education and health, and its irresponsibility in increasing Government expenditure this year by 19 per cent and thereby unleashing the forces of inflation, disadvantaging many sections of the community and attacking private enterprise, particularly the primary producer and the mining industry. But of course that was not sufficient in itself. The Government had to look at taxation. We now have a Labor government which because of inflation will reap an increase of over 25 per ceni in personal taxation. In addition it deals severely with private companies-and they have made a very real contribution to the growth of Australia-and increases indirect taxation on fuel, tobacco and spirits. The increased tax on fuel is a particutoday's economic conditions. In the final analysis we have a Labor government which accepts inflation at an annual rate above 10 per cent-and there are very good reasons to expect it to be considerably higher than 10 per cent. The Budget document itself accepts that wages will",77,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74

222,Mr Eric Robinson,"Before the suspenincrease by 13 per cent and productivity only between 2 i per cent and 3 per cent. The Liberal Party rejects this attitude and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) stated very clearly the unanimous approach of the Liberal Party throughout Australia to combat this menace. What is needed is a capacity to identify all the components operating within the economy and a determination a genuine determination-to take wide-ranging appropriate action to counter inflationary pressures on prices, incomes, interest rates, working hours, industrial relations and Government expenditure, together with other monetary and fiscal policies. We support a prices-incomes policy, after consultation and discussion with all the responsible elements in the Australian community. We realise that this is not a permanent solution but it would serve a useful purpose in the short term and it is becoming increasingly obvious that some decisive, effective action needs to be taken. Labor's superficial approach on prices and its irresponsible attitude on wages are unacceptable. We believe that the common sense of Australians will accept an attitude that productivity must be taken into account when wage demands are considered. Labor, by its support of excessive wage demands in some cases, by its tolerance and regrettably at times by its encouragement of industrial unrest, by its posturing on prices and with its enormous increases in Government expenditure has set in train inflationary pressures which will create hardships, inequities and injustices in every section of the community. The Treasurer speaks of needed reforms and of clearing the deck so that these reforms may be implemented. But because of the Budget's excesses and lack of responsibility we are not debating what could be claimed in any way to be a document of reform. Rather, it is a regressive socialist approach to the management of thefinancialaffairs of a nation which holds such promise under different direction of harnessing individual initiative and enterprise and controlling the growth of bureauracy. The Labor Party now has in its hands the justification to dissolve both Houses of the Parliament. But there will not be an early double dissolution. The Labor Party knows that Australians will not tolerate a government which tries to enact legisa'ltion to allow it to draw electoral boundaries in its own favour. The Labor Party knows that Australians will reject a government which tries to enact legisaltion which gives to trade unionists privileges not enjoyed by the community at large. We now have this Budget, a deceptive document containing a number of deplorable and discriminatory decisions. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) will not seek an early double dissolution. The Budget does not deserve the support of or acceptance by the Australian community and as this debate continues more and more Australians are becoming aware of this. during the speech made by the honourable member for McPherson( Mr Eric Robinson) I was about to commend him for his rather keen appreciation of the expenditure on cultural activities, tourism, social services and so on, but then he went on to say that the expenditure was far too high. I became a little disappointed because I know that the people in Western Australia appreciate the benefits which they have received in the city areas particularly in regard to sewerage facilities, which were so sadly lacking in my electorate where developers had been allowed to develop without any responsibility in this field. I thought for a moment that it would be pleasing to note that somebody on the Opposition side had a similar viewpoint. However, he was only building up to an argument in relation to an amendment to whioh we are all opposed. It is to me a moving experience to be speaking to the first Labor Budget for so many years, for it is not only a budget from a government of which I am a supporter but to me it is a commemorative budget which sets out to bring about many of the social changes which this country has looked forward to for so long. More importantly, as a Western Australian, when I cast my mind back to this time last year I recall that I had to speak in a manner deploring the economic situation of the country, the widespread unemployment in Western Australia which had been caused by the then Government's failure to manage the economy and the human misery that was being caused. Let us not forget that after such a short period. It is pleasing to note that all these problems have now been eliminated by the change in administration. This country is amazed to find a government which is keeping its promises, and perhaps this would be one of the reasons for criticism of it. It is incredible to have people say that we are doing too much too quickly.",79,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74
223,Mr Bennett (Swan) (8.5),"A t one pointWe cannot do enough quickly enough because of the terrific vacuum which has been created by the 23 years of maladministration. In the last Budget debate I spoke not only of the unemployment but of the record number of bankruptcies and companies in voluntary liquidation or in receivers' hands. This situation has been mainly eliminated. I spoke of the excess migration which was crowding into our already overcrowded employment market. That too has been eliminated. As I look around I find that there are few problems left which need to be dealt with to solve the human problems which were looming so greatly at the time of the last Budget. The major one that is left is the question of inflation. With the co-operation of the States and perhaps of the Opposition it may well be that when the next Budget is presented this problem will have been grappled with to bring about a stronger measure of control. But I do not think that anyone in Australia would doubt that if this Government is given the power and the mandate to do something in that field, or any other field for that matter, that it will act. For it has proven in a few short months of oflice that it is a government of action, not of the promises and inaction which the Australian public has become sb used to. The commencement of the program to abolish finally the means test is something this nation has waited for since 1928. It is something which has caused much politcal campaigning over the last few years-unfortunatel y done by people who had already retired and who were personally affected by it. There are few who started initially to campaign in this field who have lived to see the day when what they set out to do has at last been achieved. I feel that this is something that we should cast our minds to. It is something over which we should feel deep personal regret. It is an indictment of the politcians of this Parliament that the campaign-was ignored for so long. It is to be hoped that the program can be accelerated so as to eliminate the possibility that the few remaining people who campaigned so vigorously do not pass from this world before seeing the fruits of their efforts to bring the social conscience of Australia to bear on the need for all aged people to receive social justice. I have known many people who spearheaded the action, and it was always my deep regret that they could not see the fruition of the many promises made to them so glibly by politicians and political candidates alike. Let this not be another field of always too little too late. For the first time, the age pensioner has the assurance of a fixed increase in his pension, with a fixed amount in view. No doubt, the amount that has been set by the Government does not comply with the amount which has been outlined in petitions presented to this Parliament by hundreds of thousands of pensioners throughout Australia, namely, 30 per cent of the average weekly wage. The setting of pensioners' incomes needs to be taken away from the Parliament. If the average pensioner is below the poverty line on today's standards, that position should not be tolerated. If inflation continues to erode the very many advantages gained for the pensioner under this Government, there should be an appropriate independent assessment tribunal to set pensioners' wages. I have said for many years that the politics should be taken out of pensions, and I feel that this still appUes. This is only my personal feeUng; I only hope that the day will come when this will be accepted generaUy. It must be dreadful for any worker who has no superannuation scheme and who is accustomed to living on the inflated wages of today to know that he must retire within a week or so and receive and make do on the pitiful amount in relation to his current wages that the pension would represent, even with the generous increases made by this Government. If retirement is not something to look forward to, it will become a dreadful limbo of merely existing. Those sections of the community which must bear further personal charges and increased indirect taxation and be asked to forgo some of their income to assist the pensioner will appreciate that the standards that are being set today are those that wUl apply to them tomorrow and that their sacrifice today is not only something for the pioneers of our country but also something to which they can look forward when they too become pensioners. It is in this light that the actions-the overaU actions-of this humane, socially orientated Budget must be looked at. l t goes so far in the field of pensions, yet it still has a long way to go. This is because there have been heavy commitments to the easing of the means test, to education and to Aborigines. In regard to the easing of the means test, I know that the country people who at this point are enjoying prosperous times and who can survive without the many subsidies will appreciate that, in a large number of cases, the people ""who will be assisted by the easing of the means test are the retired country people who have suffered many grave injustices and who very often have been forced to live in circumstances in which they would have preferred not to live, due to the rack of cash income and, no doubt, the so-called book assets. No doubt, this easing of the means test, with the consequent payment of a pension, will make their lives just that much more bearable. It is with this thought in mind, perhaps, that the country people, who are so generous in their nature, will look at that aspect. No longer will they have to tolerate the thought that for year after year the situation of couhry Aboriginal reserves and shanty towns blighting the social scene of their country centres with a deprived Aboriginal community will continue. They know now that some positive action is being taken in this field, that this matter will be looked after for them in a proper and progressive manner and that they in turn will receive in their community the benefits of the improved standards of the Aboriginal section of their community. Of course, it is to be expected that this Budget or, for that matter, any action of this Government, will not satisfy certain critics within the community because of their political very often is ill informed as a result of this stance or their vested interests. But then, of type of misrepresentation, and it is pleasing course, we must remember that these people to see that some provision has been made in do not represent the majority of opinion, even the Budget to allow for the proper informing though they set out to mould and/or to pretend of the public, in a factual manner, of what to represent that majority. This is particularly the Government policies are and how they so in Western Australia where certain sections will affect the public.

In fact, if their notice by young people in the community who editorials were any other way, possibly Labor said that they were in a position where they politicians would wonder where the devil they could believe only one-third of what was in were going wrong and why they were serving the Press, whereas before the saying was that the vested interests and not the commumty. one believed only half of what one read.

I am pleased to see that at least it has brought them out of their usual within Western Australia, which would not inertia. When I was so rudely interrupted, I was Western Australia once voted for secession, about to say that if one were to waste too which never came to fruition. Because of much time listening to members of the OppoWestern Australia's isolation, this feeling16750/73-«-1[29 ] sition in the Western AustraUa State ParUament, one would wonder whether one's party lacked any State policies or State parUamentary aims, because the number of criticisms levelled at Federal matters and the number of times they talk about Federal matters is beyond comprehension. One often gets the feeling that they have not even read the Bills that they are criticising. I feel, when looking at newspaper comments, that we must have a particularly efficient air mail service to Western Australia which enables the local newspapers to approach leading State Opposition spokesmen in Western Australia who are then able to come out and say-n o matter what the Bill is-that it is a disaster for Western Australia and that what the Minister presenting the Bill in the Federal Parliament said was all wrong. Perhaps, having so little to do, they are able to spend their time with their ears glued to the radio; I do not know. But the monotonous regularity of political statements made on Federal matters by people who obviously have not read in full either the statements made in relation to those matters or the content of the Bills, and who are relying only on newspaper reports, gives rise to much amusement on the part of the people who have read both the statements and the Bills in question. It is little to be wondered at that the public One section of the community, particularly appreciate a Labor Budget is the people who are State-righters. One must bear in mind that whatever government may be in powerremains today, not so much in the younger generation but in the people who perhaps are in my own age bracket and beyond. When people refer to them as members of a colony they do not look on it as an insult but regard it as a compliment. In fact, we Western Australians are proud to be called Sandgropers. We are proud to be Western Australians and we believe that no other State has the wealth of resources to prosper as a nation that Western Australia has. ThusI can understand the angry reaction of the people of the gold fields at the removal of something which they firmly believed they would retain for some time to come, probably because it had been fought for so vigorously by their Federal member, who at that time was a member of the Opposition. They believed that the matter would be carried on indefinitely. Unfortunately, in the first Labor Budget for cent, thus putting into jeopardy millions of many years these benefits have been removed.

The rate a solution. I support the Budget. are discussing the first and I trust and believe the last Budget of this Labor Government. It is a national disgrace. It is the blueprint of a Government which is committed to worshipping at the shrine of national irresponsible economic management. It comes at a time of record inflation and does nothing about it, in spite of the iniquitous effects of inflation on all Australians-o n the working man, the housewife, the exporter and particularly people with small financial resources. For people on pensions, low incomes and fixed income inflation leads only to economic destruction. The Government claims that it is conducting a war against inflation. It is a phoney war. In this phoney war the Labor Government, in addition to the provisions of the Budget, has allowed an effective series of dollar revaluations which have appreciated the Australian dollar against the United States dollar by more than 20 per These moves have affected all Australians who depend on the servicing or producing ment in this country.

224,Mr Sinclair (New England) (8.22),"W e20 per cent before the end of this-year because of the Government's lack of economic expertise. Immediately before the Treasurer ( Mr to attract a profit but it does not give the small Crean) introduced the Budget he released a Treasury White Paper that identified the degree to which demand-pull was already becoming a significant factor in the economy. But what did he do about demand-pull? He ignored it. He introduced a Budget designed supposedly to implement the policy program of the Government but which ignored the economic costs which will result. The Treasurer ignored the economic trend of which he spoke and as a consequence the Budget will aggravate that trend. Fuel slugs, increased charges on cigarettes, beer and spirits, increased post office and telephone charges, tax increments-thes e are the stuff of the Crean Budget. It is all very well to turn to the few areas of benefit but each one has to be studied to see how it will affect the intended recipients. The Budget has directly lifted the cost of living of all Australians. For the average family man the increased tax slug of the Budget will be at least $3 a week before the end of the year. As with 'No. 96', each day we wonder what the next series will bring. On Sunday last a further revaluation was announced together with a rise in interest rates. What will tomorrow bring forth? Perhaps the share market will collapse again and the hard earned savings of many thousands of Australians who have invested in shares will be further eroded. This is the product of a Labor Government. The Budget and the Government's subsequent economic decisions have already caused the biggest shakeout on Australian stock exchanges for more than 12 years. Make no mistake, it is not the little man who bought in today. It is the big man. The people who are selling their shares are not the little men. The people who are frightened are not the big people, those with a lot of money to spend; not the people who are able to put in their millions and take over shares when prices fall. The people who are hurt by the shakeout that this Government has caused are the men and women who have turned to the stock exchange because of their past faith in the future of this country. How rudely and sadly has that faith been shattered. For the small investor the shakeout means Mercedes and ask for the reaction of a few financial peril and there is no solace in past average Australians who are facing their own fluctuations as the Treasurer seeks. Today's battle against the inroads of inflation. movements are his doing. Where does advice not to sell take the small investor? It might give the institutional investor an opportunity investor a chance to hedge against inflation or to build up his savings. The spending licensed by the Budget has led the Government into further unwise decisions. Government supporters claim that they have a licence to do all manner of things. I wonder where the licence for the Galston airport decision originated? Did they take into account a comparison of costs of the Galston extension with other alternatives that were before them? I doubt it. The whole tenor of the administration of the present regime is towards the spending of money if the Government believes that some short term political objective can be met. There is no indication that the Government has considered the way in which public funds should be spent or how the little man should be protected. The Budget allows for a massive increase in the Public Service. It allows for an annual growth rate of 10 per cent, if the trend continues, while the national work force will grow only at the rate of 3.3 per cent. Do we honestly need all these extra public servants? Who will pay for them? What of the high cost of the flow-on of salary rises of between 12 per cent and 16 per cent and the extraordinary generous pay and conditions which have been handed to public servants? I refer to furlough, maternity leave, paternity leave, annual leave and the 35-hour week. These are all desirable and we would like to see them, provided that they are related to productivity and there is some way in which the community will benefit, but the old concept of service has gone altogether. The Budget has set the tone for the socialised Australia that the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) espouses and for a build-up in Government sponsored cost pressures which will deny the value of the benefits provided for pensioners, scholars and pedestrians for whom the Budget seems intended. The Government argument that its massive misuse of Government money in many areas of public involvement was well researched by the task force report on continuing expenditure-the Coombs report-is of course false. It is a budget of discrimination. Perhaps the Prime Minister will wind down the window of his new At question time today in reply to a question by me the Prime Minister indicated that the Government does recognise the impact of public sector spending on the inflationary pressures in the community. It is a pity it does not demonstrate it. What, eroded by the Government's economic outof course, he intimated today was mat far rages which will remain a scar on the products from the Budget being the conclusion to the of the producer's labour.

One of the disturbing aspects of the Labor With inflation it most probably will be $200m Government is its chauvinism. Let us consider in added taxes and loss of assistance by the the actions of the Government in relation to end of this year. The Budget strikes at every rural people. It has been said in this House country person, every person in a producing that the Budget changes for rural industry industry and every exporter. In the rural sector affect only Pitt Street farmers.

We in the Country Party share the concern of our colleagues on this side of the House that the strength of these significant producing sectors will be forever c There is one Australia, not two as the Govall city dwellers but selectively for only a few. Under this Labor Government the added cost of the Budget to rural Australia will be $160m. charges. All these are selected areas picked out by the Treasurer iu order to ensure that the country will find it more difficult to survive. We hear nonsense of how the changes will perhaps affect some in a beneficial way. Let us consider one matter-rura l reconstruction. We are told that this year rural reconstruction will cost $47.2m. This has been related to the 19 per cent increase in Government spending. Of this $47.2m an amount of $18m was already committed in the previous Budget by the previous Government. In other words something like $29m additional is being provided this year. Never before has there been a need to ensure that people in country areas consolidate on the advantages that they have because of good seasons and good marketing conditions abroad. But we hear none of this under a Labor regime. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer said that from 1 October 1973 to 30 June 1976 there will be a meat levy of lc a lb on meat exports. That charge is expected to yield $40m in 1973-74. How constant is the Government in its policy? We heard one nonsensical remark this afternoon by one member opposite suggesting that this Government can be trusted. Immediately prior to dinner the Meat Export Charge Bill was introduced. According to that Bill the charge will be 1.6c a lb on meat and edible offals derived from cattle, including buffalo and calves For mixed produce containing beef and offal the charge will be 1.6c a lb. The Government already has revised its Budget but it has told nobody about it. The Treasurer did not mean what he said. On each occasion when we have introduced into this House a Bill concerning another Budget proposal we will hear of another increment which will affect country people? The Government cannot maintain its economic policy week by week. What sort of economic management is this? What sort of discrimination is it against country people? The fuel excise is to be increased and there will be fuel equalisation discounts. We have heard much of the South Australian wine industry. On 25 May 1972 the honourable member for Riverina, the present Minister for Immigration ( Mr Grassby), said very diabolical things about a wine excise which the previous Government imposed. That excise was designed to produce $12m in a full year. On 25 May 1972 the honourable member for Riverina committed himself to ensure that never again would there be a measure of this sort affecting the wine grape producer. I wonder whether he has looked at the Budget. Perhaps he was not present when the Budget was considered. Perhaps he does not know what it is all about. However the brandy differential and the changes in the value of trading stock of grape producers manufacturing for wine are designed to produce $20m to this Government in a full year, yet when the previous Government proposed an excise to produce $12m the honourable member for Riverina said some terrible things. What utter nonsense! What hypocrisy! But this is the type of economic management for which this Government is responsible. The Budget has been based on the premise that the rural community can absorb the costs because it has had a good season. No account is taken of droughts or of falling commodity prices. What happens if things go bad on the farms? Can people rely on the Government to help the rural community? Surely not! What of the activities of the Australian Wool Corporation? Last week for the first time the Australian Wool Commission was called on at an auction sale to buy 14 per cent of the wool offered. I wonder for how long the Government will allow the Corporation to continue. I wonder whether it will be prepared to demontrate intestinal fortitude in respect of the future of Australia's major export industry. I doubt it. Will the Government help those farming industries which get into trouble. Do not forget that it is the wealth producing industries, the export industries, that contribue so disproportionately to Australia's growth and to the prospects of a better quality of life for us all. It is not only the rural industries, all the producing industries, that are affected by the tax changes. The Treasurer has outlined tax changes for the private companies. An expenditure of SlOOm has been earmarked for a pipeline authority, destroying for private enterprise the opportunity to do its own thing for the advantage of the Australian people. Instead of private investment we are spending taxpayers' money for that purpose. The mining industry has been affected by the removal of tax exemptions for gold mining and mining for prescribed minerals and also by revaluation. These measures are diabolical in their impact. In my own electorate Woodsreef Mines Ltd is mining for asbestos. It is the only company producing asbestos in Australia. There are over 280 families in the Barraba community, a small country community, dependent on this industry. This Government is driving these people out of business. It could not care less about the unemployment that will be generated there. It has provided no compensation for revaluation. Woodsreef Mines Ltd sells its asbestos on a United States dollar base. There is no alternative price structure in the world. This Government shows no sympathy for them. They are. allowed to wither. They do not matter. They live in the country. Now the Federal Labor Government is arguing for price control. For how long does it want these powers, and in what way? Should it have them when one recalls the litany of economic horrors it has already brought down on all our heads? The Government's increased spending and taxing in the Budget is aggravating recent rises in the cost of living. If it wants to reduce would be 11.5 per cent, compared with his the cost of living why does it not cut back its own charges? Then there is the deplorable defence vote. It is a national tragedy being acted out by the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard). To his shame it is on his own initiative and not at the behest of a Treasurer concerned with Government spending. Re-equipment programs have been shovelled aside to the detriment of national security. This Budget is contemptible and irresponsible. It ranges from taxation of old age pensioners to sociological and economic discrimination against Australians in country areas to promotion of greater inflation and reduction in our defence effort. It is a Budget of destruction, not construction. In the advocacy of Australian nationalism it denies the capacity to assert it. Above all it sets the parameters within which the initiatives of the individual will be contained, and under the guise of public interest Government involvement in every sinew of commercial activity will be progressively extended. I support the amendment and reject the Budget in its entirety. support the Budget. I do so at a stage of the misleading as a result of both the method of debate at which most of the Opposition big calculation used and the assumption on which guns have been fired. What a feeble barrage it it is based. The method of calculation ignores has been. What small impact it may have had all tax deductions other than those for depenhas been dependent on misstatements of facts dants, and if allowance is made for the quite relating to pensions and after-tax wage rises, substantial additional deductions the picture is on misuse and misrepresentation of economic considerably different. Allowing for other analysis concerning the economic impact of a deductions equal to 10 per cent of gross income Budget and on a misguided refusal to look the real after-tax income of the man on $100 beyond Australia's shores for the principal a week last year wouW increase by 10.7 per causes of inflation in this country. In the course of my address I will be looking to each of these points. I will deal firstly with the Opposition's misstatements of fact. The principal example of these was the repeated insistence by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) that the 2 increases of $1.50 in the single age pension, which would increase it from $21.50 to $24.50 in this financial year, would represent an increase of 11.4 per cent. He then compared this with the projected 13 per cent increase in average weekly earnings in this financial year and concluded that pensions would fall behind earnings rather than begin to catch up with them. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch) made much the same point but he said that the pension increase Leader's 11.4 per cent. Both of them were quite wrong. An increase from $21.50 to $24.50 is a 14 per cent increase, not 11.4 per cent or 11.5 per cent, which puts the whole exercise in a different light. The true position is that pensions will rise faster in this year than the 13 per cent rise in average weekly earnings and so the various assertions by the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy that pensions would fall behind earnings, that pensioners would be worse off and that Labor was not moving towards its objective of a pension rate of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings are all shown to be quite false. The Leader of the Opposition indulged in a couple of exercises designed to show that a wage earner with a wife and 2 children to support would be worse off, or at least no better off, in real terms in this financial year than he was last year. His calculations showed that despite a 13 per cent increase in earnings this year a man on $100 a week would have only a 10.2 per cent rise in his actual after-tax income. He then said this would be less than the price rise of 10.5 per cent that would follow from a rise in earnings of 13 per cent compared with a productivity increase of 2.5 cent this year, not the 10.2 per cent arrived",83,Appropriation Bill No 1 1973 74
225,Mr Willis (Gellibrand) (8.42),"I rise to per cent. The fact is that this exercise is quiteat by the Leader of the Opposition. This 10.7 per cent is slightly above the 10.5 per cent price rise he says will eventuate if earnings rise by 13 per cent and productivity by 2.5 per cent. But even here he has the arithmetic wrong. If, as he insists, the difference between the earnings increase of 13 per cent and the productivity increase of 2.5 per cent will be made up of a price rise, that price rise is 10.2 per cent, not 10.5 per cent. You do not deduct one from the other. It is a compound sum. If he wants to know the exact arithmetic it is 113 over 102.5 multiplied by 100 over 1. Thus the after-tax income rise is 10.7 per cent, not 10.2 per cent, and must be compared with a price rise of no more than 10.2 per cent, not 10.5 per cent. But even this 10.2 per cent price rise is probably too high. The Budget estimated a productivity rise of between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition used only the lower productivity figure so as to obtain a higher price rise. If productivity rose by 3 per cent the price rise on his assumption would be 9.7 per cent, so the actual after-tax income of the man on $100 a week would increase notably faster in this year than would prices, and he would in fact be better off, not in the same position as before, as the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe. However, this exercise was remarkable not only for its arithmetic inaccuracy but also for the assumption on which it was based. The suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition that a particular rate of wage increase and productivity increase implies a price rise to make up the difference indicates the adherence of the Opposition to that old shibboleth about the rate of inflation being determined by increases in wage costs. It probably never occurred to the Leader of the Opposition to consider what the position of the man on average weekly earnings would be if his wage rose by less than 13 per cent this financial year. In fact, as I will show later on, much of our inflation is determined by forces outside Australia and it does not follow, as the Leader of the Opposition implied, that with a lesser percentage increase in average weekly earnings the price rise would be correspondingly less. If earnings rose by less than 13 per cent the real after-tax position of wage earners would undoubtedly be less advantageous than will actually be the case. A keynote of the Opposition's attack in this debate has been that the Budget will be inflationary. The Leader of the Opposition set the pattern for this attack in his address, and to substantiate his claim he quoted a couple of sentences on page 10 of statement 2 of the Budget papers, from which he concluded: On the Treasury's own approach the Budget is therefore inflationary and expansionary-no t neutral. In fact the Treasury made no statement in the Budget papers which indicated that that was its opinion. Indeed, in the same section of the Budget papers as that referred to by the Leader of the Opposition the Treasury gave quite a different impression. The first paragraph on page 11 of statement 2 of the Budget papers states: The' taxation measures proposed by the Government in the 1973-74 Budget have been formulated, for the most part, to steady the pace of growth of private sector activity, and thereby modify the pressure of total demands on available economic resources. Such a check now, designed to counter over-rapid expansion in a period of widespread economic recovery, would be generally seen as preferable to deferring action to a time when much stronger corrective measures would be required. This hardly seems to be saying that the Budget is inflationary or expansionary. Indeed, it says it is checking growth now rather than having to do it later on. Having falsely attempted to portray the Treasury as supporting his attitude, the Leader of the Opposition then sought to clinch his case by supposedly relying on the approach to budget analysis advocated by Professor J. W. Nevile in his book 'Fiscal Policy in Australia: Theory and Practice'. The Leader of the Opposition contended that if we take the increase in domestic outlay and subtract from it that increase in revenue which results from new tax proposals the resultant sum is a measure of the budget impact. He theft said that Professor Nevile 'measures the net stimulation of budgets by calculating budget impact in this way and relating the result in percentage terms to the gross non-farm product'. An analysis of Professor Nevile's book will reveal that he did not measure the net stimulation of Budgets in this way at all. What he did was to calculate the initial year multiplier for various classifications of government expenditure and the negative initial year multiplier of tax revenue resulting from increased rates of various taxes, and then apply the appropriate multipliers to the respective increases in government expenditures and tax revenues resulting from increased tax rates and relate the resultant sum to non-farm national product. The Leader of the Opposition has taken no account of Professor Nevile's multiplier analysis at all; so he cannot possibly be correct in his claim to be using the Professor's method. Obviously he has never read the book. But, not content with this substantial blunder, he then produced an even greater one. He went on to explain that Professor Nevile related his calculations of the money amount of Budget stimulus to non-farm gross product, and quoted Professor Nevile as saying: 'We can define any increase greater than 2.9 per cent as inflationary'. The Leader of the Opposition then declared that on this measure the Budget represents an increase of 4.2 per cent and is therefore one of the largest stimulants ever. However, what he in fact did to obtain this 4.2 per cent figure was to apply his incorWannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) referred to an rect calculations of the amount of Budget stimulus to the wrong figures for non-farm national product. He applied his Budget stimulus figure to the amount of gross non-faim product for 1972-73-the previous financial year-wherea s what Professor Nevile did was to apply his calculated Budget stimulus to the figure for non-farm national product in the financial year covered by the Budget-no t the previous year, as the Leader of the Opposition has done. Of course, the effect of using gross nonfarm product for 1972-73 rather than an estimated figure for non-farm national product for the currentfinancialyear, which he would have to do if he were using Professor Nevile's technique, is to overstate considerably the percentage that the Budget stimulus bears to nonfarm national product. Thus his calculations can be seen to be an awful mess and his comparison of the resultant 4.2 per cent figure with Professor Nevile's average figure of 2.9 per cent becomes utterly meaningless and tells us nothing whatever about the impact of this Budget on the economy. From what I have said to this point it is clear that the attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to show that this Budget is inflationary, by supposedly using Professor Nevile's technique, is an absolute shambles. There are in fact other deficiencies in his calculations, but I do not think it is necessary to deal with them. He has clearly not used Professor Nevile's technique in any essential respect, and the House should completely reject his calculations and the conclusions that flow from them. Even if he had followed Professor Nevile's technique exactly, he would have found that there were numerous economists Who would not have agreed with him that that was the correct approach to measuring Budget stimulus. The fact is that this is one of the most difficult and contentious areas in a notoriously inexact science. For instance, some economists would argue-correctl y so, in my opinion that the increase in average income tax rates which occurs as incomes increase in the face of a progressive tax schedule is just as relevant to the question of Budget impact as an increase in .the schedule of income tax rates. There is no generally accepted measure of Budget impact, and different economists have different notions of how to go about measuring it. In this debate the honourable member for alternative measure of Budget impact, which is to relate the Budget deficit to total Budget receipts. However, he tried to make out that such an analysis showed this Budget to be inflationary by comparing the percentage that the deficit bears to receipts in this year with that for the years 1969-70 and 1970-71. He neglected to mention, though, that in those 2 years the ratio was quite unusually low. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the ratio of Budget deficit to total receipts for a period of years. being no objection, leave is granted.

227,Mr Willisi Thank The House. The Table,"simplified approach to measuring budgetary impact referred to by the honourable member reported the same distinguished economist, on for Wannon, this year's Budget looks decidedly whom the Deputy Leader of the Opposition neutral. Apart from the material to which I relies, as making some even more pertinent have referred, the Opposition has produced remarks. The article reads, in part, as follows: nothing to support its basic contention that this Budget is inflationary. From my analysis terday, said he doubted that any action taken in to this point it can only be said that the Australia alone would control inflation. Opposition has failed dismally to prove this central facet of its case. However, what does remain very clear is that the Opposition is firmly of the belief that our inflation can 'be brought under control by budgetary policy acting in association with an incomes policy. The faith of honourable members opposite in such policies is indeed remarkable in the light of experience elsewhere in the world. They seem not to have heard of stagflation which has been a feature of world economic experience in recent years. Countries all round the world have tried to cut back inflation by reducing demand; but the result, in contravention of previous economic experience, was continued inflation despite greater unemployment and reduced economic growth. To adopt a policy of moderating the growth of government expenditure now, as the Opposition would have us do, not only would deprive this nation of desperately needed social reforms but also would be a quite ineffectual means of combating inflation. Just as futile and dangerous is the plan of the Leader of the Opposition for a 90-day wage-price freeze as a means of breaking the circuit of inflationary expectations. This also has been tried in other countries and has been proved a failure, l n 1971 the United States had just such a freeze and followed it with wage and price guidelines, but it is still struggling with an inflationary problem. In this connection it is rather ironic that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition commenced his speech in this debate with a nebulous quotation from a man to whom he referred as 'the distinguished American economist, John Kenneth Galbraith'. A few days later that same distinguished economist arrived in this country and immediately said that a 90-day wage-price freeze would not cure Australia's inflation. The Melbourne 'Sun' of Tuesday, 4 September, reported him as saying that the practice of a wage-price freeze, of using phases of the moon, was the wrong way to go about it. So much then for the Oppositions's prescription for the prevention of inflation. The Melbourne 'Age' of 3 September Professor Galbraith, who arrived in Melbourne yes'The decisive question is that it be brought under control in my own country-the United States,' Professor Galbraith said at an airport Press conference. 'Inflation is a world wide problem, and it's going to be serious as long as it isn't tackled in the metropolitan economy. 'As long as inflation is out of control in the US, it is likely to be out of control in those countries that do a lot of trade with the US-lik e Australia. These remarks by Professor Galbraith should be studied closely by the Opposition because they are indicative of the increasing acceptance by academic economists around the world of what we on this side of the House have been saying for some time-that is, that in the current situation of substantial world inflation it is not possible to prevent inflation in a relatively small open economy such as ours. The truth of this proposition has now been recognised not only by many economists but also by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Incredibly, the Leader of the Opposition tried to use the OECD to support his argument that budgetary action and an incomes-prices policy were the way to control inflation. But he was apparently relying on a report by the Secretary-General of the OECD, which report is almost 3 years old. Things have changed considerably since December 1970. Inflation is now a much more severe problem throughout the world. The July 1973 edition of the OECD publication 'Economic Outlook' had a special section headed The International Transmission of Inflation'. This article examined the complex mechanics by which inflation is transmitted around the world. It specifically made the point that Australia is comparatively heavily exposed to international inflation. It said that it is clear that no open economy can in the long run maintain a lower rate of inflation than its trading partners under conditions of fixed exchange rates. The article also mentioned various devices by which countries can attempt to protect themselves against imported inflation. These are: Revaluation of the exchange rate, cutting tariffs, preventing large foreign capital inflows through the imposition of high deposit requirements, taxing of exports, and the introduction of price controls. With the exception of taxes on exports, these are policies that this Government has initiated while it has been in office. It has twice revalued, it has cut tariffs and has done everything except tax exports. All these measures have been sneered at by Opposition members who are years out of date in their economics. Throughout this debate the Opposition has made virtually no mention of external inflationary factors although the OEOD, on which its leader relies, says that they are clearly of importance in determining our rate of inflation today. An obvious example is meat prices. In the June quarter of this year two-fifths of the consumer price index increase of 3.3 per cent was accounted for by the increase in meat prices, but these increased meat prices have nothing to do with the overall level of demand in Australia or the increase in wage costs. They are substantially due to increased overseas demand for our meat, particularly from the United States. This debate has revealed how bankrupt the Opposition is in policies to fight inflation. It would apply the policies which have failed elsewhere and been abandoned because of the stagflation which has accompanied them. There can be no doubt that the economic policies being applied by this Government are the ones which will produce for this country full employment, rapid economic growth and the minimum amount of inflation which is consistent with those objectives in a world increasingly troubled by rising prices. of Monday, 3 September last, in a report on Professor Galbraith said: The author of 'The Affluent Society' and The New Industrial State', here to lecture on the world's economic ills and his solutions to them, pounced upon a reporter who asked if we could live with a 10 per cent inflation rate. 'Certainly not. Inflation is a mean thing which causes an arbitrary and uneven redistribution of income from the poor to those who are fast on their feet. No decent economist should stand for an inflationary policy.' The 1973 Crean Budget is already proving itself to be an abysmal failure as an instrument for controlling inflation. Rather than control it, there are many aspects of the Budget which will fan the fires of inflation already burning in an overheated economy. History will condemn this Budget as a Galbraithian mean thing. Those benefits, which it is proclaimed to have by the Labor Government, will prove themselves to be illusory. They emanated from a document formulated in the fantasy land of doctrinaire socialism. The Budget seeks to create the illusion of increased concern by the allocation of increased money, but more and more people are coming to understand that this is no more than a cheap political trick. Unless the increased money allocation means an increase in the allocation of resources, when measured in real terms, increased money incomes can coincide with a withdrawal of aid or a reduction of support for worthwhile projects. Despite its protestations and sham concern, Australia's socialist Government has a vested interest in inflation. It seeks to delude people into believing that they are better off as a result of rapidly rising money income. The Government not only condones but also actively encourages extravagant wage demands. It pays little heed to the significance of the relationship that should exist between wage demands and productivity. Though money incomes are rising, those who receive them in this economic climate find themselves worse off. They are worse off not merely because of spiralling prices but also because the higher money incomes go the higher is the proportion of those incomes which is taken in tax. There are some who earlier on speculated that the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) would introduce a Robin Hood budget. People soon came to realise that this was not an apt description of the document he presented to the House. In view of the fact that so much of the Treasurer's economic theories belongs to the 1920s and 1930s and not to the 1970s and 1980s, it is surprising that he has taken no notice of the views expressed by Mr Scullin, a famous Labor Prime Minister of the 1930s, who said: 'Inflation robs the worker of his wages'. The consequences of this Budget will be to do just that. It is a robber budget. It will rob the school children of the nation of the real improvement in education that all would like to see and and that many have come to expect will be achieved by this Budget. They will be disappointed. It will rob young men and women of their earnings and of the opportunity to establish homes of their own where reasonable standards of living and adequate opportunities can be provided for their children. It will rob the pensioners of their savings and, if present trends continue, will reduce the real value of their pensions when we should be increasing",89,Ratio Of Budget Deficit To Total Receipts

Health schemes and superannuation schemes yet to be introduced for consideration by this House can be financed only by increased taxation, whether labelled so or not. Labor will increase the tax take by fostering and fanning inflation and by retaining the present rate structure in breach of its election promise to retard the increase in tax payable by middle and lower income earners. The tax structure is in urgent need of overhaul. The social objectives sought to be achieved through it must be redefined to take account of contemporary needs and present circumstances.

Under the present inflationary pressure growing numbers of families find themselves unable to reconcile the financial difference between the childless 2-income situation of early married life and the single income situation that comes with parenthood.

The Australian promised pensioners that it would increase pensions to a level equal to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Having achieved this goal pensions would be automatically adjusted. As average weekly earnings increased so pensions would be increased. The Labor Government, by repeating its promise, has endeavoured to create the impression that it has performed. The Australian Labor Party seeks to deceive the pensioners and the public into thinking that it has carried out or is carrying out its promise. It has done neither. Pensions are not index related. Pensioners are not getting 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Pension increases are not even linked in any way with increases in average weekly earnings. Labor promised to increase pensions by 1) and to oppose the amendment moved by SI.50 every 6 months. At the time, this the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden). appeared an attractive proposition.

Let me illustrate. If past 23 years.

Similarly at that time when the Snedden) disapproving the Budget for the Australian Labor Party was in Opposition, it reasons outlined in that amendment. listened attentively to speeches submitted in this debate by members of the Opposition and the kindest remark that I can make is that I sympathise with their endeavour. As a member for the past 9 years in Opposition when previous Budgets were debated, I cannot recall a more half-hearted, futile attempt to criticise the Government's Budget. AlthoughI understand the ideology which motivates conservatives' action, it is always disheartening to them when socialist parties present a Budget. So, as a socialist, I wish honourable members opposite well and, for the future advancement of Australia, may they have many more years on the Opposition benches.

231,Mr Nicholls (Bonython) (9.21),"1 havemotions seeking the Federal powers by referendum or to approach the 6 States, which on many occasions were controlled by Liberal governments, to concede the powers whereby the Australian Government could establish a Federal price control system. It is true my own State, South Australia, has a limited price control system, but only the Australian Government can effectively legislate price control. On each occasion when these matters were discussed, our opponents opposite, by the use of their numbers, defeated our attempts to grapple with the inflationary problem. Now we see the Leader of the Opposition calling for talks between the Federal and State governments, unions and employers, to combat inflation. This conference would identify the harms and evils of inflation and set an agreed program for restraint of income and prices with the national conference to consider guidelines for moderated price and wage advances in the future. He further advocated that, throughout the period of guidelines application, it would be desirable to have a prices notification system. Companies with a turnover of more than a determined figure would be required to notify price increases. The Whitlam Labor Government has already placed on the statute book legislation for a prices justification tribunal. This Parliament has also established an all-Party Parliamentary Committee on Prices representative of this House to the Senate, to inquire urgently into price movements. My own personal view is that, while this machinery will provide important information to the Parliament on price movements, it will have little overall effect on the general gallop of prices in this country. The only positive alternative is to clothe the Australian Parliament with the Federal powers to initiate a Federal price control system. I would hope that this Labor Government would give serious consideration to the proposition that, at the first opportunity when a national election is held, the people of Australia be asked by referendum to alter the Australian Constitution to enable legislation of this nature to be given effect. Now, Mr Speaker, I will take the opportunity to speak during this Budget debate on 2 matters that are of important interest to me and which affect all Australians generally, namely the fiasco of the present health discussions and the criticisms by a minority of the people of the Labor Government's policy on education. Since the announcement of the Government's proposal to introduce in 1974 a national health scheme to replace the present unfair, inefficient voluntary health scheme of the previous Tory governments, the doctors, together with other people who have a direct commercial interest, have unleashed a tirade of abuse, for the express purpose of creating confusion and doubt within the community as to the benefits and protections which would be enjoyed under a national health scheme. I can recall this same atmosphere when the Chifley Labor Government in 1947 introduced and passed legislation for a free national health scheme. On that occasion the same interest which is loudly denouncing Labor's health policy-namel y the Australian Medical Association-too k an injunction against the legislation to the High Court of Australia. ber will be a little patient, I will tell him. The Court, on that occasion, ruled in favor of the AMA and its decision, in so ruling, was that it was unconstitutional to require doctors to write in triplicate a medical prescription. The High Court judges claimed that to compel doctors to perform this act was industrial conscription. The national Press has widely publicised the doctors' case how much work they are required to do, the long hours worked, the low financial remuneration, plus the high cost of maintaining their clinics. I took particular interest in a Press article, which recently appeared in a South Australian newspaper, highlighting the case of the poor doctor trying to make an honest dollar. The article was headed: '$30,000 per annum, $120 per week'. 'This doctor, a central Adelaide general practitioner, is an unapologetic $30,000 a year man. he work? ber will be a little patient I will come to that in a minute. He earned $29,000 in the financial year 1971-72. When he adds the figure for the year to last June 30th, he expects his income will be $32,000. Such a sum would appear to brand the doctor as one of the money-grabbing ogres in the public-politicia n -doctor s battle. But appearances, claims the newspaper, can be deceptive. This doctor's income takes on a different complexion when the surgery on practice expenses and taxation is performed. He claims practice and other costs reduced his 1971-72 income to $14,000",94,Ratio Of Budget Deficit To Total Receipts

The same newspaper article went on to say: 'I expect this year to be better' he said. ""The figure should be $9,000 . . .' That would be a 50 per cent increase on the previous year.

This doctor does not want any part of a nationalised medical scheme. He fled Britain to escape one. He is bitter about politicians, claiming they continually mislead the public by giving doctors' gross incomes instead of their net earnings. He sums up his professional philosophy this way: Tn niy own practice, I am my own boss, I can I am indebted to my good' friend and colreports submitted each year to this Parliament able membeT for Hunter drew the attention of receptionist who understated her income by doctors are mentioned in the reports and I have mentioned these cases, not from the will pay less for health insurance coverage than they do now; that as patients they will be guaranteed a free choice of doctors; their doctors will be paid for each service they perment will assume full financial responsibility form and will continue as private practitioners. for tertiary education at universities, colleges Under the present scheme people have to pay a flat amount whatever they earn. This is most unfair as it means that those earning more pay less for their health care after claiming tax concessions. We will also automatically cover unemployed people, certain pensioners and large families on low incomes. Hospital care will be free in public wards of hospitals, but if they want to have private ward or private hospital treatment, or wish to have their own doctors treat them in hospital, they can do so. under existing scholarship schemes. Part of the cost of this extra service will be paid by the Commonwealth, as at present, and they can insure privately-as now-to recover the dfference. These contributions will be tax deductible. NowI come to the question of education, and on this issue I am proud to be a member youths' education for political advantage, and of the Australian Labor Party. For the last I refer to the various legislative Acts of science 23 years children have been neglected in laboratories, school libraries, and sectional obtaining a reasonable education standard, handouts, all announced just prior to election other than students whose parents were in a days for the past 23 years.

Australian Schools Commission, from which this Parliament has already received a report. Now8 months after the election, the Labor Government in its first Budget to this Parliament, has earmarked a total of $843m to be spent on education during the 1973-74 year, and development in primary and secondary or almost double the amount provided in the education. He further states that the special previous Liberal-Country Party coalition programs for socially disadvantaged schools Government's budget. In effect, education spending in Australia will get a $404m boost. From1 January 1974, the Australian Governof advanced education, State teachers' colleges and other approved teachers' colleges, including the abolition of fees at all these institutions and at technical colleges. In addition, from the beginning of 1974, a non-competitive means tested living allowance will be offered to all full-time unbonded Australian students admitted to approved courses in tertiary and approved post-secondary institutions. The allowances will be higher than those available But it is in the field of primary and secondary education, I believe, that the greatest need of assistance is required. Previous Liberal-Country Party governments have deliberately used this important section of our Education stated that special programs will promote rapid development in areas of particular ment and education of the handicapped, and Educational strategies and techniques must of course change to meet changing needs and the Government will support programs recommended by the Committee to foster innovation represents an important departure from AustraJian traditions in public education. Supplementary funds will be made available to schools identified as being disadvantaged on the basis of certain characteristics of their cachment areas, so that they can respond to the particular educational difficulties faced by a group of relatively poor children. The Government's needs policy requires that special attention and resources be devoted to the education of those groups of children who, in the past, have had least public money spent on their education, because they leave school earlier and gain no benefit from expensive tertiary education facilities. If the revolution in accessibility to education is to be achieved, we must discriminate in favour of those children in greatest need. So, it is the Labor Government which will provide for all students, irrespective of whether their parents are in a financial position to afford to educate them. Provided that they have the talent, the fullest opportunity will be available to each of them to obtain the education to which they are entitled and which they will be able to receive under this Government. it extremely difficult to follow the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Nicholls). I listened attentively and, quite truthfully, I cannot find anything in his speech worth commenting on, as should be done in a debate. It was well worked ground if ever I have heard it. So, I should like to make some comments on the broad fields of the Budget and the discussion up to date of the effects of the Budget on the future welibeing of Australia. Firstly, I sincerely support the amendment so ably moved by my leader, the Leader of the Oppostion ( Mr Snedden), on 28 August and commend him for his achievement that night. the Leader of the Opposition for the substance of his speech and the forthright manner in which he stated it. Personally, I am amazed at the Budget and endorse the comments made by all Opposition speakers during this debate. It is a highly inflationary Budget that blatantly takes away from the private sector to spend on the public sector at a time when inflation is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Of this there is no doubt. This has been well explained by my colleagues on this side of the House. During this debate we have heard continually from Government supporters, in reply to our criticism of the inflationary trend of the Budget and the massive 19 per cent increase in Government spending: 'OK, what would you not have spent money on?' The honourable member for Corio( Mr Scholes) on 29 August said: The Premier He was referring to the Premier of Victoria and the Leader of the Opposition have both stated publicly that the Commonwealth should cut back on spending. That is a very nice sentiment indeed. It is one they do not believe for one minute, because neither is prepared to suggest what moneys should not be spent that will be spent in this Budget. Similar comments have repeatedly been made by members on the Government benches. I believe that if ever I have seen the 3-card trick in action, this surely is it. Say, for the sake of argument, the Government had allocated in the Budget additional money for pensions, health, housing, education, social security, conservation and urban and regional development-yo u name it-amountin g to many more hundreds of millions of dollars than has been allocated under this Budget and it had balanced its budget by dipping still further into the private sector. Would it not still be extremely difficult for an Opposition to say: 'You should not have spent so much on any one of those projects'? It is not possible to endeavour at this stage to be selective. No matter how much is spent on, say, urban and regional development there still will be room to spend more and, once an amount of money is promised, it is not reasonable to suggest that an Opposition should selectively say, or be in the position to say, that this is too much, and that it should be cut back here or there. This would be like one person giving a bag of lollies to a child and another charged with the task of taking back half. That is completely unreasonable and I hope that we do not hear any more of this attitude during the debate. I have no doubt that the previous Government would have liked to introduce such a grandiose budgeta budget to advance the welfare, standard of living, education and quality of life of the average Australian. There is no doubt also that there has been a tremendous lift in all these fields over the last 23 years. But the previous Government could not have introduced a budget such as we have before us today. There is one particular hurdle that the previous Government could not have",95,Ratio Of Budget Deficit To Total Receipts

238,Mr Drummond,"Thank you. I commendavoided or overcome and that was its responsibility to bring in a responsible budget and its duty to maintain a strong private sector out of which true wealth for all could flow. It was the previous Government's duty to lift up all the people and not to smash down some-thos e 'some' being the people who create the wealth of this nation. It was its responsibilty not to kill the goose that, year in year out, laid the golden egg, as this Government may find it has done. SoI condemn the Budget and support the amendment. Turning to more specific aspects of the Budget, I was intrigued by the statement of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Doyle) on 28 August when, among other things he said: The Treasurer has won the admiration of the majority of Australians. The 1973 Budget has brought products together with the cost price squeeze an abrupt end to the stop-go, boom-bust policies of successive Liberal-Country Party governments. honourable member for Lilley. the very ruthlessness of the Budget towards the rural areas, mining and private companies, one can assume only that succeeding budgets will follow the same pattern. They will have to follow this pattern for the Government to maintain its heavy programs of public expenditure into which it has entered. So, the honourable member for Lilley may be dead right. There will be no more stop-go, as he wishes to interpret the last 23 years of sound economic management; rather, it will be all stop. Let me refer briefly to the treatment of the rural industries and, so, the rural people of Australia by this Government in the short space of 9 months. I will be brief because I realise that this matter has been well canvassed during the debate by my colleagues from this side of the House. The Government has slashed rural reconstruction funds, the butter and cheese bounty and free school milk. It has imposed an export tax on meat. Fuel will be dearer and country prices will rise by up to 7c a gallon. Telephone installations will rise and rentals will increase in the country areas alone. Postal concessions are being abolished and the main brunt of the resultant increases will fall on country communities. We have had revaluation after revaluation. Interest charges are now being forced up. Election promises, such as the promise of S500m at low interest to assist the rural areas which was made just before 2 December-no t so very long agohave been quickly forgotten and replaced with this punitive attitude. All these naturally add to the cost of living and production for the greatest decentralised industry in Australia, namely, our rural industry. This Budget makes sure that we do not have a stop-go rural economy and that it is all stop. On top of these charges there is to be a loss of taxation incentives. I believe that it is going to be extremely difficult for an average farmer to attend to the maintenance of his property, let alone carry out improvements and developments. For many years, the rural industries, lumped as a whole, have had a hard time. Drought and calamitous prices for rural have caused difficulties we have all experienced. What joy was felt when good prices returned and, I remind honourable members, this is the first year of good prices for many primary producers. For one reason or another many primary producers did not participate in good prices and/or good seasons last year. The satisfaction was felt of being able to put the farm in order and to catch up with the jobs that had been neglected through lack of finance. Fences were to be brought up to scratch and new haysheds erected. The yards could be upgraded. Why, Mr Speaker, people started to walk tall again. The wheel had turned and faith was seeping back into rural areas. Properties would be restored and able to utilise the resources of land for the good of all. More acres could be cleared and a modest development program entered into. These things should have been done years ago. But now it is clear that this is not to be. Assistance through taxation deductions isfinished,or all butfinished.I can assure you, Mr Speaker, and the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) also, that fear and confusion are abroad down on the farm and in the rural areas generally. What of the future? Can rural areas expect this erosion to continue? Are the untouched suggestions in the Coombs report to be left on the tram or are they merely on ice for the next Budget? Are country people now expected to put up with disadvantages in relation to the people of cities? What has become of Labor's vaunted commitment to decentralisation? That this Budget will kill the growth of rural industries appears to rae to be a perfect example of the unsound manner in which the Government attacks most problems.

245,Mr Enderby,"There was a time in Ausour Liberal-Country Party predecessors did but say that we accept the challenge and the fact that geography and history have placed our nation in control of vast resources and not waste the chance. That is our position in Australia today. Our numerically small nation controls a significant portion of the world's wealth. I say the 'world's' advisedly because the day has long passed when a nation can afford to regard itself as a single unit isolated from the rest of the world. We are all one community now-the global village, as Marshal McLuhan called it. As trustees for such a major part of the resources of mankind, we are on the cutting edge. It is rich societies such as ours that must discover the keys to survival of our increasingly over-populated arid depleted globe and point the way to a just and viable future for all mankind. These are the responsibilities which our predecessors-the Liberal-Country Party coalition government shirked and of which it probably was not even aware. They are grave responsibilities indeed. It is a tremendous task to justify the advantages we have and to develop our society so that Australians can reap the full benefit from their inheritance and so that we, as a nation, can play our part in advancing the interests of humanity. -Order!

But because of the particular responsibilities that I hold as Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister for the Northern Territory, I will confine my remarks in the short time allowed to us in this debate to a discussion of the relevance of this Budget to the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. In the Australian Capital Territory and to a lesser extent in the Northern Territory, the Australian Government has the power to act directly for the welfare of its citizens. It is my intention that these Territories should act as beacons, pointing the ways in which our society can develop not, of course, because the Territories should be singled out for special attention in any way but merely because they can be examples where the Australian Government has the power that it lacks in the rest of Australia. Provision is made in the Budget for a community health centre in the Australian Capital Territory, in the new suburb of Melba. This is the first of its kind in Australia. Residents of the appropriate suburbs can receive free treatment on the spot by government employed doctors. Also available is a chemist to fill prescriptions, a physiotherapist if that sort of treatment is needed, a dentist and social workers. In Scullin, an adjoining suburb, a similar commumty health centre is operating on a different basis, using doctors on a fee for service type system to give an alternative and a freedom of choice to the people of Canberra. This is a system that needs to be extended into other parts of Australia. One would hope that sooner or later Canberra.

In the near future a whole new system of S9.2m worth of education facilities, among land distribution and a new integrated housing which will be Canberra's first transitional policy will be unveiled in the Australian colleges for fifth and sixth form pupils. This Capital Territory. We are convinced that we is yet another example of what can be done can get owner-occupied homes and rental by a government which has the will and the accommodation on to the market cheaper than determination to do it in the places where it it is at present and certainly cheaper than it can do it. There will be increased expenditure would have been had our predecessors, the on social, cultural and welfare undertakings. Liberal-Country Party government, remained Expenditure on social welfare will rise by 30 in office. The Budget for 1973-74 will give us per cent from $518,000 last financial year to a 56 per cent increase in government accom$649,000 this financial year. This will cover modation units in Canberra. There, will be payments for distressed housing, for the new 1,505 units compared with 965 in the year right of pensioners and others in need to a 1972-73. It is a notorious fact that under the 50 per cent cut in rates, bus fare subsidies previous administration the percentage of for pensioners, cash sustenance, food orders homes built by the government of the day and clothing for people in need, and to bridge declined from something like 70 per cent of the time gap between applying for social beneall built in 1957 to less than 30 per cent of all fits provided by the Australian Government built in 1972. We are restoring the balance. The Budget provides also for the servicing in 1973-74 of enough land for the Government and private enterprise for the building of about 1,800 more homes than the 5,500 which were built last year. This is a significant percentage increase. I am reminded that my colleague the Minister for Housing( Mr Les Johnson) put it to me earlier this evening that the percenti.ge increase of funds for housing throughout Australia coming from this Government is something in the order of 26 per cent-anothe r significant percentage increase. This, again, is an attempt to redress the balance of the degree of rundown that had occurred under the previous Government. These initiatives will be welcomed by people on the government housing lists whose turn for a dwelling should come more quickly than was thought possible before the introduction of this Budget. The provision of more land should help those people in our community who prefer to help themselves with housing. Overall, the amount available for expenditure by the Department of the Capital Territory in 1973-74 will be $48m, an increase of 37.5 per cent over the amount spent on comparable functions by the former Department of the Interior in 1972-73. This is consistent with the large percentage increases that have taken place throughout the whole of Australia, whether it be on education, housing, social services, Aborigines, money spent on the cities through the Department of Urban and Regional Development or public transport. Tbe Government will begin work in the on a program of civil works amounting to some $120m. These new projects include and their approval. The Government will go ahead with construction of an Australian Capital Territory remand centre to provide a modern alternative to the present unhappy arrangement bequeathed to us by the previous Government of holding ACT male prisoners in the Goulburn Gaol and of sending women prisoners to the Silverwater complex in Sydney. An amount of $20,000 has been allocated to extend the activities of the Family Planning Association beyond the present 2 centres for advice in Beauchamp House and the Woden Plaza to Canberra's 2 public hospitals, to the health centres and to Jervis Bay. The Canberra Theatre Trust grant will be increased from $37,900 last financial yeai to '$67,000 this year. To assist old people the Department ot the Capital Territory will make sites available free in various parts of Canberra to non-profit organisations interested in building homes for the aged. This offer will be open to acceptable organisations such as the usual charitable institutions, lodges and professional bodies. Let me sum up some of the benefits the Government has brought to the Australian Capital Territory. I deal first with land. Dwelling units on serviced sites are up $1,800 on last year to $7,300, a rise of 33 per cent. Government houses and flats are up $540 to $1,505, a rise of 56 per cent. Estimated expenditure on Commissioner for Housing loans is up $14,950,000 over last year to $18,750,000. Expenditure on public transport is doubled to an estimated $2,311,000. In the area of social welfare and culture expenditure is up $1*56,91-5 or 15 per cent. So the story could go on. More important than money, of course, are the ideas that are being implemented in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. I instance selective price control, shopkeepers' charters, law reform and new methods of land distribution. Canberra is a young city, just as Australia is For example, a first step has been taken toa young country.

Development in its broadest sense cannot be achieved unless full recognition is given to the social needs of the community. One of the most satisfying features of the Budget from the point of view of the Northern Territory is the record amount of $53m to be spent on capital works. Here again the Government has sought to achieve a balance between the economic and the social needs of the Territory in apportioning this record figure. We recognise Aborigines are a major proGovernment, we have outlayed more than $117m for Aboriginal advancement.

248,Mr Calder (Northern Territory) (10.15),"did not just stay overnight at Batchelor and flit up to Darwin and so on. I thought I would point that out because the Minister really does not know what he is talking about. This Budget is a complete and utter disaster for the Northern Territory. The Minister said that the works program is costing $53m. That probably has something to do with the departmental people who have remained behind-the y have put up the works program. But the policies that have been introduced by this Government are sadistically designed to ruin completely the Northern Territory-and also anyone who lives in any such place other than some suburb of some city in the south. This is obvious. It is also a disaster for Australia generally and for our defence system. It ignores innation. The Treasurer ( Mr Crean) escapes from every question that is asked of him by saying simply that innation is not confined to Australia alone. Of course it is not, but he should be doing something about it. This Budget is an inflationary Budget. To get back to the one-sixth of Australia which I represent and which the Government in its tax-grabbing attack seems to have completely forgotten or Ignored, T would like to point out a few things to the Ministers concerned. If the Minister for the Northern Territory were to go to the Territory now he would find that what is supposed to be and has been heralded by honourable members opposite as a fabulous Budgei -th efirstof the few, I would think-is viciously aimed at the people who live in the part of Australia that I live in. It is aimed at battlers. It is aimed at ordinary people in the streets, no doubt unwittingly, because I am sure the people who compiled it were aiming it at some entirely different section of society. They did not realise that when they slapped an increased tax on fuel and then virtually doubled the increase by removing the equalisation subsidy of 2c a gallon on fuel used in outback places their action would increase the cost of everything that goes into these places, whether in outback Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia or the Northern Territory. The price of everything will rise to cover the extra 5c tax on petrol used for cartage. Once the fuel reaches these areas, the 2c long distance freight rebate has conveniently been removed. I would like the Minister to go to places such as Tennant Creek and Katherine and see how he gets on. The people there would string charges and the extra costs that no doubt will him up, and not without reason. On top of all these things, some unwitting idiot has done away with the 25 per cent long distance freight rebate from the Commonwealth Railways. The Government has produced an inflationary Budget. It has decided to attack inflation. There is a prices controller wandering around the Territory. What can he do in the face of a more than 25 per cent rise in freight charges from the Commonwealth Railways? correct? sent the Minister a telegram. The Government's actions are quite incomprehensible. who will suffer are not the ones at whom the Government is aiming-the Pitt Street farmers or whatever they are. The ones who will suffer are the men who work in the mines at Peko, Warrego and Frances Creek, to mention a few in my electorate. They will have to pay more than 25 per cent more for their foodstuffs to be brought down the road because this Government is aiming at someone who lives in Sydney. I do not know what the Government really thinks it is doing. It is quite obvious that the Minister lost his battle. I do not know whether he even fought. do not think he realised what was going on. Overall, the increase in fuel costs in the Northern Territory together with the removal of the Government freight subsidy will amount to $3.5m. I have only taken out some rough figures. The Minister can check them. He will probably find it is twice that amount before it is through. Many people there rely on road transport. Automotive distillate will be taxed. Motor car fuel will be taxed. One cannot escape from the increases because aviation fuel and aviation kerosene will be taxed. People will not be able to obtain anything by air at the normal price. There will be a 10 per cent increase in airport charges. In the Northern Territory, outback Queensland and northern Western Australia every station, town and mine has an airstrip. That is the way they operate. These costs were high even before this attack was made. Living in the outback is very expensive.

The Government's actions are completely incomprehensible to me and to everyone else in the Northern Territory and such places. Apart from revaluations, opinions about who runs the mining industry and how competent they are-whethe r or not they are hillbillies-thi s Government is tending to destroy the income earning sectors of our commerce. After all, how did we get to the position of being able to afford all these social benefits that have been splashed around and the benefits that will flow to suburbanites out of this Budget? Where did that wealth come from? It came from our primary industries. It came from the mining industry, which after all is a primary industry. It came from the pastoral industry, which certainly is a primary industry. Now this Government is calling the organisers and the people who run these industries hillbillies. They are being attacked by revaluation. They are being attacked by the disparity between the Australian dollar and the United States dollar. They are being attacked by increased fuel costs and by the slashing of freight rebates. Where does the Government expect to get the money tofinanceits fabulous schemes? The Government is going to finance them on straight inflation. In the meantime industries such as Peko-Wallsend Ltd in Tennant Creeka town of some 3,000 or 4,000 people, taking in the whole mining setup-hav e of their own volition invested approximately $60m in the mulga or the scrub. Yet they are being attacked by this Government. pany. A consortium of Ministers has tied up its business to such an extent that its uranium province cannot be worked. The company cannot meet its contracts because no one is saying anything about what is to happen out at its uranium province which is west of Arnhem Land. On top of this, the company, in the face of all the attacks through export controls and revaluations, was financing its exploration and development through the sale of gold. What has happened to that? Half of the company's income will go in gold tax. I imagine that this Budget is supposed to be aimed at assisting the worker-the man who obviously voted this mob into government. These miners and transport men are the ones who will suffer. They will suffer more than the fat cats about whom we have heard so much. The whole thing leaves someone coming from the outback speechless. I invite the city slickers here, with their 4-square-mile or 900square-mile electorates, to get out in the sticks and see how they are received. Most of them would be strung up if they went there. I refer again to the 10 per cent tax on airports, aviation gas and fuel. This Government has decided to put out of business the biggest private enterprise in Alice Springs-Connai r Pty Ltd. The Government can do this by all means, but 120 or 130 people are involved in this enterprise. They are all technical men. They want to live in Alice Springs and they have done a very good job. But no, it is to be shut down and handed to someone else. Whether those who take it over can run it I do not know. At Alice Springs airport on any day of the week there is standing room only. There might be two or three jets and a couple of Friendships on the airstrip but there is no room to sit down at the airport. Yet passengers are paying through the nose for this disservice. At Tennant Creek airport there is a Friendship service but no jet service. Yet there is a 10 per cent charge. At Katherine the same thing applies. Katherine has one of the finest airstrips in Australia. It has no jets but it will be charged another 10 per cent just the same. This is ridiculous. By all means charge the people in the cities who have airports like Tullamarine to go through but in the country areas the Government is victimising the people who are living away from the cities, who have been prepared to go to the country and work for Australia. I do not know what the Government wants. Darwin airport is not air conditioned and it was 92 degrees Fahrenheit there today with 88 per cent humidity. Go there, you blokes in your blue suits, and see how you get on. The Minister goes there in a BAC 111 with his staff and sweeps in and out overnight. He does not have to sit around in these places and wait for the Friendship. either. Party cheer squad to keep quiet. appreciate that.

People do not want this in the Northern Territory. They do not want to be socialised and run by a mob of centralists in Canberra. They just do not want that sort of thing. We cannot comprehend the thinking of the people who introduced this Budget. The feeling of the people in the Northern Territory is that it was inspired by city dwelling socialist madmen, and that is so. They cannot understand what it is all about. What is more it is being implemented by people who do not understand. They are vindictive, unscrupulous, political crooks. This is what the people in the Northern Territory think and I agree with them.

It is fair enough for the Opposition to pick holes in the Budget and to criticise the parts of it with which the Opposition disagrees. The Opposition's job is to oppose. It would be surprising if it could not find some things in the Budget which it opposed, especially considering that it has an entirely different philosophy to that of honourable members on this side of the House. But it would not hurt the Opposition now and again to be big enough to give some praise where praise is due. Some time the Opposition may come to realise that it would do it no harm if it gave some praise to the Government. In fact, it would do it a lot of good. The public becomes sick and tired of constant criticism which is not sometimes alleviated by praise. That only leads to criticism, when due, having less impact. I do not believe that anyone in his right mind could condemn the Budget out of hand. I ask the Opposition: Why not be magnanimous for a change and praise at least some parts of what I believe is a very worthy Budget. As I said a moment ago this is a Budget of a Party which believes in what it does. I am not one to say that the Opposition did that period. This Budget is a beginning.

263,Mr Coates (Denison) (10.35),"I shall nothing right and everything wrong duringtaxation reform next year after there has been time to study the best and most equitable way of doing it. I wish to spend some time highlighting some of the less spectacular but nevertheless important parts of the Budget to show some of the new initiatives which have been taken by this Government. No doubt in the past other governments have been saddened by the same thing but it is rather a pity that so many of these matters have become obscured by the major items of expenditure and taxation, especially tbe latter. People may be forgiven for thinking the contents of the Budget related only to increases in the tax on cigarettes and petrol which unfortunately were a necessary means of raising more revenue but nevertheless were justifiable on social grounds. I am pleased that so many have accepted this point and have acknowledged that if we smoke a little less because of it our health will be improved, and if we use a little less petrol because of it the resource tends to be conserved, there is less pollution, less of the costly traffic problems, greater use of public transport and so on. These points have got home to the public and I think the Opposition ought to be a bit careful and recognise this. Even on the major items of expenditure some people would like to ignore the fact that this Budget almost doubles the spending on education. It might have been hard to believe last year that this sort of huge increase could occur, but it has. On social security benefits we are doing what we said we would do-a n increase of $1.50 twice a year. All the Opposition can find to say about that is to repeat the incorrect calculation of its Leader that this is an increase of only 11.4 per cent. It is in fact an increase of 14 per cent. I wouid have liked the increase to be greater, but this has increased the percentage which the pension bears to average weekly earnings. I acknowledge that we will have to make the pension increase more than $1.50 at least once to meet our pledge to bring the basic rate up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings within the 3 years of the Parliament. moving ahead. We said we would do it and we will, within the 3 years of this Parliament. I wish now to highlight just a few of the overshadowed but important social innovations in the Budget of which the House ought to be reminded. A couple of examples in the field of education are the $304 per annum means tested educational allowances to assist the children of low income families to complete the final 2 years of secondary school, and the grants to provide additional places for much needed trainee social workers. In health, $7.5m is provided to assist the States to develop community based mental health, alcoholism and drug dependency services, and $7.9m for the national school dental scheme. In social welfare, we are doubling the contribution towards the capital cost of senior citizen centres and increasing by one-third the subsidy towards Meals on Wheels, back dated to the beginning of the year. The handicapped children's benefit is being doubled. There is an overall doubling of expenditure on Aboriginal advancement in the areas of housing, health, education and employment. I notice that the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) who has now left the chamber did not mention that area of expenditure. speech one would ever hear. regional development, finance is provided for the planning of future growth centres, including $500,000 for Tasmania. This will allow an overall assessment of how the State should develop in the future. There is $30m for the States earmarked to overcome the backlog in sewerage provision in major urban areas. There is $32m for upgrading urban public transport services. In the general area of quahty of life the Budget provides $7m for the National Library, $ 14.7m for the National Gallery and $14m for the Council for the Arts. I wish the Opposition would stop for a moment and give some thought to those aspects of the Budget, which are new. The sum of $3.2m is provided for the development of community recreation complexes and $lm so that Australian sportsmen and sportswomen can be assisted to participate in national and international events. As part of our commitment to the environment and conservation $3m is set aside for the first time for national parks and the preservation of the national estate. Of specific help to Tasmania is the Sim a year subsidy to the Australian National Line so that the important tourist link-the 'Empress of Australia' service across Bass Strait-ca n continue to operate.

271,Mr Wentworth,"The honourable memThat is a very good question. I have stated already in this House that, in my view, no need exists for a second airport in the Sydney area. But a second international airport for NSW should be located in this Canberra area. There are good technical reasons for putting one here. As honourable members know, a site has been selected in the Bungendore district. That site would not cause any interference with any assembly of people. It would be a good site technically and would be welcomed, I think, by people in that area as noise interference would not be a problem and an additional facility of which people could take advantage would be provided. People would take advantage of that facility particularly if the airport were correlatedagain I remind honourable members that I made this point in the House a couple of weeks ago-wit h an upgrading of the rail system and the utilisation of the new techniques which would allow rail services at a speed which is not considered customary in Australia but which is quite technically possible even over the terrain of that area. That facility could be correlated with the desirable improvement of the railway line between Sydney and Albury. Certainly the section of Wagga is one of the worse aligned railway sections in the world having regard to its present and potential volume of traffic. SoI thank the honourable member for his interjection. Yes, there is an alternativea constructive alternative-and that is the one which I urge upon the Government at present.

A decision to change, made once, can be made again. I do not believe that the demonstration would have been as persuasive as it has been if a by-election in the Federal electorate of Parramatta were not pending. It may be for the most unworthy motives from the Government's point of view that the change would be made. That decision might be made not because the Government believes in the need for the change but because it is worried about the outcome of the Parramatta by-election. This motive would be unworthy but, nevertheless, the action taken would be worthy and worthwhile. I do not think that the Government should be reluctant to take this decision even if the motive behind it were unworthy. But I do say that even when or if the Government does change its decision a need for vigilance will remain. Once the Parramatta by-election is over the Government will be able, if the motive is an unworthy one, to do as it has done so often in the past, that is, short change and deceive those who voted for it. I do ask for this change to be made, but I would point out that even if it were to be made there would be grounds for vigilance because when it made its original decision, which was an off-the-cuff decision, the Government did not really know where Galston was and probably did not even know that the electorate of Parramatta could be affected. The Government has in this instance acted in haste and in ignorance but in a way which, I am afraid, is so characteristic of its other actions. member's time has expired. Postmaster-General) (10.56)I wish to reply briefly to the comments of the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), who put forward a reasonable case for consideration. As one must always look at the reasonableness of any argument, particularly one that line between Sydney and which relates to the location of an airport, one cannot overlook the fact that the honourable member was for many years a prominent member of the previous Government. It is therefore rather peculiar that he should come forward at this stage with a suggestion as to a suitable site. That site may be a good one, but it is rather interesting to think that it was never considered at any stage by the previous Government. As professional politicians, ws all use our skills during debates in this House to attract attention to what we term a good cause that is in the public interest. There is no doubt that neither the people of Galston nor the people of any other area want an international airport in their locality, but nobody ever gave any consideration in this respect to the people of the Kingsford-Smith area. In fact, the plan of the Government of which the honourable member for Mackellar was a member was to duplicate the runways at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. It could not care less about the people in that locality. That was the whole issue. The previous Government set up the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, which heard some rather interesting evidence as to the probable growth in air",108,Adjournment

(10) Will he be present at the meetings. member's question is as follows: (1) Invitations were sent to Aboriginals who 1 judged, on the basis of my own knowledge and the advice of my Department and Aboriginal organisations, would make a worthwhile contribution and would provide a reasonable representation of the range of communities in which Aboriginals live throughout Australia. In all, 78 delegates attended. (2) A Steering Committee, elected from the National Aboriginal Consultative Council at its first meeting, studied methods of arranging for the election of a fully representative National Aboriginal Consultative Council, and its recommendations were considered by a second meeting of the Council on 3-4 May. A series of regional consultations has since been held to discuss proposed arrangements for elections with Aboriginals throughout Australia. Planning is proceeding for elections later in the year. (3) and (4) The Council for Aboriginal Affairs provided me with a good deal of formal and informal advice in relation to the establishment of consultative processes, but the establishment of the body was on my own initiative. (5) and (6) As indicated above, invitations were sent to individuals, not to organisations. Amongst those invited were the Chairman '( Mr J. 'McGinness) and the then Secretary ( Mrs F. Bandler) of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. A considerable number of those invited to the National Aboriginal Consultative Council have attended one or more of the annual conferences of F.C.A.A.T.S.I. since its establishment.

Australian Wool Corporation: Wool Testing (Question No. 730) Mr Whan asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) With reference to the answer to question No. 395 (Hansard, 8 May 1973, page 1843), does the Australian Wool Corporation call tenders for its wool testing requirements. (2) Is it a fact that Auscore have quoted lower rates for wool testing than other test houses; if so, what is the explanation for the lack of Wool Corporation support for this company. Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. The policy of the Corporation in allocating testing of wool owned by the Corporation was set out in the answer provided to Question No. 395. (2) The test requirements of the Corporation are predominantly for normal post sale certificate purposes. I am informed that during 1972-73, Auscore quoted lower rates for such tests than did the Australian Wool Testing Authority; the Auscore price list dated 1 July 1973, however, indicates that its charges for the cunent year are not lower than those",110,Adjournment

Age Pensions (Question No. 737) D r K l u g m a n asked the Ministerf o r Social Security, upon notice: (1) What was the original justification for paying age pensions to women at 60 and men at 65. (2) Is this distinction still justifiable. member's question is as follows: (1) The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908 provided for pensions to be paid to both men and women at the age of 65 years. It provided also that at a time to be proclaimed, namely, when finances permitted, women were to be granted pensions at the age of 60 years. This was implemented by the Fisher Government from 15 November 1910. History does not specifically reveal the reason for granting pensions to women five years earlier than men. However, one interesting factor which does not seem to have been given any consideration, at least in recent times, is the life expectancy rate of males and females at 60 and 65 years of age. The expectancy in each case is(Life Expectancy Years Age 60 years 65 years (2) The question of qualifying ages for age pensions is a matter of Government policy.

281,Mr Enderby,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The honourable member will be to the honourable member's question: aware that I have suspended land auctions in Canberra for the present. The existing policies and options available in the provision of land and housing are under review with the object of identifying principles and guidelines for possible Government action within Clear fell the Canberra land and housing market. The National Capital Development Commission proposes servicing about 5,300 blocks in 1973-74 of which about 3,800 will be available for lease for detached houses. As well, sufficient blocks will be available for lease to accommodate about 850 town house units and 1,150 residentialflats.The remaining blocks will be used for Government houses and flats. Indications are that this amount of residential land should be sufficient to meet the housing needs of over 20,000 people. The honourable member would know however that Canning there is an inevitable time lag between land release and house occupation. Canberra's present land shortage relates back to supply decisions taken last .year and earlier by the previous Government.

(2) If so, will he list the 14 proposals which were cleared between 9 and 31 March 1973. (3) What were the criteria, in detail, on which clearance to proceed with the proposal was based in each case. (4) What were the criteria on which the decision was made to approve the Babcock Australia Holdings Ltd and the Security Mills Pty Ltd proposals. (5) What were the criteria on which the C. T. Bowring International (Anst.) Pty Ltd proposal was decided to be contrary to the national interest. member's question is as follows: (1) The Treasurer's press release of 6 April 1973 regarding the administration of the Companies (Foreign Take-overs) Act during the period 9 March 1973 to 31 March 1973 included the following statement: 'The preliminary examination of 17 proposals was completed. The Government had indicated that it had no objection to 14 proposals going ahead as presented. They included a number of proposals which were found on examination not to lead to loss of Australian control, or to be related to take-overs of companies with assets of less than $lm which did not raise any important national interest considerations.' (2) As explained in answer to question No. 208, it would not be appropriate to provide the names of the companies concerned in all foreign takeover proposals coming' to the Government's attention because in many cases information has been provided confidentially. (3) , (4) and (5) Under the Companies (Foreign Take-overs) Act 1972, action to prevent consummation of a particular takeover proposal is subject to the Government being satisfied that it would result in effective control of the 'target' company being transferred from Australian to overseas interests and that this would be contrary to the national interest. Accordingly, these are the bases on which individual takeover proposals are considered so far as the taking of action under the Act is concerned. Because confidential information is involved, it would not be appropriate for me to provide detailed information abojt the application of these criteria in the particular cases instanced by the right honourable member.",115,State Rental S Per Square Foot Per Annum

291,Mr Crean,"The answer to the honourableAustralia: Diplomatic Privilege (Question No. 750) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) On how many occasions did diplomats in Australia claim diplomatic privilege in respect of parking and traffic offences during (a) 1971-72 and (b) 1972-73. (2) What sum in fines was not collected as a result of the exercise of diplomatic privilege during each of those years. member's question is as follows: (1) Accurate statistics are not kept, as in all but the worse cases the offenders are not charged but are given at most an oral warning. Diplomatic privilege is not claimed, rather it exists as a right at all times and is respected as such. Where a serious traffic offence is involved the facts are reported to the Department of Foreign Affairs which then takes the matter up with the Embassy or High Commission concerned. (2) As no accurate statistics of offences are available, the value of fines not collected cannot be supplied. Australian Airline Industry: Equal Pay (Question No. 766) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labour, upon notice: (1) Did he give an unequivocal commitment to the Federated Clerk's Union of Australia that equal pay would be introduced into the Australian airline industry from 1 January 1973 on the basis requested by the union. (2) If not, what was the nature of the commitment which he gave. Mr Clyde Cameron-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. I am not able to speak for or on behalf of the Australian airline industry. (2) No commitment was given. In accordance with the Government's stated policy I was anxious that the principle of equal pay be implemented so that female employees of the Australian National Airlines Commission were no longer subjected to wage discrimination based on sex. I believe that the wage rates now being paid by the Commission to its clerical employees meet the concept of equal pay in that they remove the element of discrimination in wage rates which formerly existed. Prices Regulation Ordinance 1949-1973 (Question No. 802) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the Prices Regulation Ordinance 1949-1973 has no provision to allow a person or organisation wishing to oppose a price rise to appear at a hearing and argue his case. (2) Do the declaration of secrecy provisions of the Ordinance prohibit the A.C.T. Controller of Prices from disclosing any submissions made to him and from publishing the reasons for any judgment he makes on prices. (3) If so, how does the public ascertain the ciroumstances under which a jrrice rise has been approved or refused. member's question is as follows: (1) The Prices Regulation Ordinance 1949-1973 has no specific provision to enable a person or organisation to argue his case before thc Controller of Prices without the Controller's approval. In practice, however, it could be expected that the Controller would welcome information from any responsible person or body. (2) Yes.

People who furnish information to the Price Controller are of course free to publish that information.
