Otherwise we shall have to settle down here to a sort of political perpetual motion, and that I do not think would be good for the country. Certainly it would not conduce to good government. Administration is just as important as is legislationa great deal more so, in fact. If we had better administration we could do without very much of the legislation that we are called upon to enact. No Government can attend to its administrative functions properly at the same time that its members are called upon to attend here week after week and month after month during two-thirds of the year, or longer. The suggestion which I have made, would, if acted upon, be in the best interests of the country. With regard to Supply, I would call attention to the immense amount that we are asked to vote under the heading of "" Contingencies."" If honourable members will look through the schedule they will find that no less a sum than £ 1 3 5 , 0 0 0 is sought to be appropriated under that heading. Chief nearly all these contingencies are but I have no objection to giving the honitemized. honourable member will find that there are been inflicted upon a man who has done a very large number of items which are not as much for the credit of the Australian specifically set out even upon the Estimates forces as has any individual in those in Chief.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE We have followed the plan which has been previously adopted. be sufficient to have one group of contingencies in the Department instead of a score. My remark is particularly applicable to the Defence Department. There we are frequently called upon to vote £ 1 0 0 by way of salaries, and £ 2 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 by way of contingencies. We ought not to vote money blindly in that way. There is just one other matter to which I desire to direct the attention of the Minister of Defence. I have a very serious complaint to make against the Department over which he presides. It seems to me that a certain action by that Department' amounts to nothing more nor less than a piece of gross favouritism. For three months I have been patiently waiting to see justice done to a man, and perhaps I had better wait a little longer.

External Affairs) [11.28] -Every honourable member of both Houses of Parliament must realize the truth of the statement made by the honourable member for Parramatta, that under present circumstances our sessions of Parliament are unduly prolonged, and info an extremely inconvenient time of the year. It is highly desirable, both in the interests of administration and of honourable members who desire to return to their homes so that they may place themselves in touch with their constituents, that the abnormal length of sessions should be curtailed, and that in some way or other the legislative business of the country should be transacted in a less number of months and close at a more convenient time of the year. If u l ly admit that. To restore a more healthy condition of things should be the aim of all sections of the House. practice -of appointing Grand Committees, as is done by the House of Commons? unfavorable to the appointment of Grand Committees, I have yet to learn that their appointment has much expedited business in Great Britain, where the Legislature is in a chronic condition of overwork. ment has more work to do than we have. whilst recognising the force of the remarks of the deputy leader of the Opposition we must recollect that we are still in the constructive Federal period. A t the present moment we are dealing with the most complicated, the most arduous, and the most burdensome task which can await any Legislative Assembly, that of reviewing the whole of our commercial and industrial conditions. In our only previous experience of a similar kind, we were compelled, with very great reluctance, but in obedience to the necessity for concluding a state of commercial unrest, to allow a session to overflow. The same obligation rests upon us at the present time. Then the Tariff has to be supplemented by certain measures to which the deputy leader of the Opposition has referred. These must be disposed of before we can think of concluding the session. I take it that in making his suggestion the honourable member has some knowledge of the wishes of honourable members in another place, and shall endeavour to learn from my colleagues in that Chamberi f there is a means of arranging the business to meet their convenience. to honourable members of another place in regard to the matter. some of them had spoken on the subject to the honourable member. If we can, without retarding legislation, so readjust our business as to meet the wishes of honourable members elsewhere, we should endeavour to do so. I am satisfied to take the suggestion made by the honourable member for Parramatta as the starting-point for fresh inquiries. about this House as -well as the Senate. entered upon the work of the second session of this Parliament, and desiring to leave a complete and satisfactory record, we must look to some extension of the ordinary adjournment or some readjustment of the next session as perhaps the best way of counterbalancing the excessive demands which will be made upon us during the present one. we are going to be here all next year. the permanent assistance of the honourable member in his capacity as deputy leader of the Opposition, we might avoid such a T h a t is true.

We can never look forward to very short sessions of the Federal Parliament. We have two Houses elected on the broadest possible franchise, and are entering upon a class of legislation which is out of the old groove.

The question of compensation to military officers has again come up for consideration. Colonel Tom Price was given a grant by the Government, and Parliament was called upon to ratify the Executive act in order that the Government might keep faith. The Government, after counting heads, I suppose, came to the conclusion that Colonel Tom Price was entitled to some .compensation, though I may saythat was not my opinion when the question was before us on the last occasion. Colonel Bayly fought in South Africa, and there, in consequence of exposure, developed a disease which was disastrous in its results.

I have known officers refused transfer, but subsequently granted it on offering to pay the cost of their own removal. I do not think that that is a fair proceeding. If it is right that a man should be transferred, his expenses ought to be paid, and if it is not right that he should be transferred, he ought to remain where he is. It would be satisfactory to public servants to know that, after having served for a number of years in the back-blocks, they have the right of transfer to some more desirable part of the Commonwealth. The post-office at BrokenH ill is still considerably undermanned.

But after the subdivision had taken place, I found that the inspector for BrokenH ill and Wilcannia was resident at Wagga Wagga, and that the inspector for White Cliffs was located at Orange.

128,"Versation, Mr Mcdonald, And, Since No","ago when a Supply Bill was presented to this House, the Government promised that they would not bring forward another similar measure during the current session. They urged as an excuse for this slovenly method of doing business that they desired the Tariff debate to proceed without interruption, at the same time admitting that the passing of Supply Bills involves the surrender by honourable members of effective control over the finances. Personally, I should have been prepared as a protest against the slip-shod manner in which the Ministry, are conducting the business of the country to limit to one month the Supply for which they have asked. If we pass this Supply Bill we shall have voted half the Supplyf or the current financial year, and consequently when the Estimates in chief come under review we shall not be in a position to exercise any effective control over them. members charged the Government with maladministration in connection with the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. If those honourable members are dissatisfied with the administration of the Government they cannot take any stronger action than to refuse the Supply which is now asked for, or to reduce the period which it is intended to cover. Had anybody submitted an amendment in that direction I should have most warmly supported it. But, of course, it is idle to fire blank cartridges at the Treasurer. that honourable gentleman promised that at the earliest possible moment he would introduce a Bill embodying the new protection proposals of the Government. I admit that the subject is a complicated one, but I think that ere this he should at least have presented honourable members with a rough memorandum of the intentions of the Government in this connection. By so doing he would have expedited the consideration of the Tariff. As one who desires to see the operatives engaged in various industries obtain a fair share of the plunder, I should be more disposed to look favourably upon high protective duties if that information, disclosing, an effective scheme, had been supplied to us. There are many honourable members who are strenuously fighting the Tariff, but who might not do so if they were acquainted with the. nature of the new protection proposals of the Government. The honourable member for South Sydney has attempted to excuse the appropriation of such a large _ sum under the heading of ""contingencies."" As the honourable member for Parramatta has poirted out, if the amount which we are now asked to expend under this heading be continued in the same ratio throughout the year, it will total no less a sum than £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0. I ask honourable members to give this matter their serious attention. It is useless for the Treasurer to tell me that I can identify items included in the proposed vote for ""Contingencies,"" since, as the Bill stands, I am unable to move the reduction or omission of any of them. I come now to the question of defence. The Treasurer has always been an ardent protectionist, and his enthusiasm for the cause, when he is out of office, is even greater than it is when he is in power. As a member of the present Administration, he has been a warm supporter of the policy of encouraging local industries, and I ami pleased that he has caused an order for the construction of a steam trawler Only yesterday several honourable to be placed with the New South Wales Government shipbuilding works at Cockatoo Island. I am glad, not merely because many of my constituents are employed at the works, but because I recognise that an opportunity will be afforded the public to see what can be done in the way of shipbuilding under Government supervision. I trust that the administrative officers, as well as the workers employed in the shipbuilding yards at Cockatoo Island, will be put upon their mettle, and that they will turn out a vessel that Some time ago will be so excellent an advertisement of the capacity of the Government works as to cause the Commonwealth, as well as the States Governments, to place further orders with them. The Government contemplate the construction of several torpedo-boat destroyers and submersibles for coastal defence purposes, and if they find that the State shipbuilding works at Cockatoo Island can construct a trawler equally as well as can private shipbuilding firmsand at a price that is wholly satisfactory --I am sure that they will consider the desirableness of having our defence vessels built there. Some people say that we cannot construct warships in Australia. I do not share that view. I .do not think that the mere transfer of an artisan from a British to an Australian shipbuilding yard has any prejudicial effect upon his ability. Australians are blessed with the imitative faculty. They are quick to acquire any art, and there is no reason why they should not excel in the work of shipbuilding. I hope that the Treasurer will urge the men at the Cockatoo Island works to do their very best in connection with the construction of the Commonwealth trawler. Sir done so. ber would occasionally visit the works and encourage the men to do their best, I am sure that good results would follow. member is always after Cockatoo Island. eral election that since I found that every honourable member was prepared to do a bit for his own electorate, I intended to take up the same attitude. able member think that the Mort's Dock Engineering Company ought to have been able to construct the trawler? good dockyards in my own electorate. secured by that company, many of the men in the Cockatoo Island works would have been employed in the construction of the vessel. not sufficiently enterprising to obtain the contract; but I hope that the placing of this order with the Government works at Cockatoo Island is the first step towards the establishment of a great ship-building industry in Australia. The industry gives employment to a good class of men, and as we desire to have in Australia a sturdy class of iron workers and engineers, it ought to receive every encouragement. Reference has been made to the widow and family of the late Colonel Bayly. honourable member for South Sydney made out a good case for consideration.

164,Mr Spence,"But officers ought nottherefore mirrimize the cost of removal. In any case, justice is more important than money. If officers in the back-blocks have given satisfactory service, and possess the necessary qualifications, they ought to receive justice in the way of transfer. The way in which many men have been kept in the outlying districts for years is heart breaking. In the old days, before the appointment of the Public Service Commissioner, there were refusals on the part of officers to go into the back country; but, of course, under the law now, there is power to enforce transfer. No reasonable man would complain of being sent to the back-blocks if the term of service there were limited to say three years; on the contrary, I think it would be recognised that more frequent change of officers would be good for tbe service and the officers themselves. compulsion, should be exercised, so that public officials may take turns in serving, for reasonable periods, in places which are not climatically desirable. ber think we shall ever have that done? done by insisting. I have suggested that if some of the heads of the Departments, who object to the transfers, were sent for a year' or two into the back-blocks, their feelings might become more sympathetic. The honourable member for Coolgardie represents an immense district in which the disadvantages of isolation may be even greater than in New South Wales; and I think I may say the same of other representatives from Queensland and other States. I appeal to the Postmaster-General to take an active interest in this matter, and see that some change is made in the administration. to the effect that transfers should be more equitably arranged; but those promises have in many cases not been carried out. Indeed, I know of instances where preference has been given to ""the wrong man on the score of expense. We cannot expect good service if men are given cause for reasonable discontent. the honourable member for Barrier that married men, in the outlying districts, should receive consideration, is one that calls for serious thought. that the climatic allowance is sufficient in many cases; but if the term of service in these districts were shorter, there would not be so much complaint as at present. There is a feeling on the part of officers that if once they go into the back-blocks, they are forgotten, though many of them go on the understanding that they do so for only a limited term. Public servants are, of course, prohibited from exercising political influence, and, therefore, they feel somewhat helpless in the matter. Many are situated in isolated spots, where no proper schooling, or other advantages, are to be had; and the present arrangement is both unreasonable and unnecessary. I hope the Minister will see that no excuses are allowed to stand in the way of the reform which I have indicated. instrument of the Public Service Commissioner. ought not to be the instrument of the Public Service Commissioner. cases of Colonel Price and Colonel Bayly have been mentioned; and I should like to call the attention of honourable members to the fact that in our Defence Forces there are many similar cases of hardship. I particularly refer to the case of a man named Mitchell, who served in the war in South Africa. This man was cafetaker at a court-house, and yet he gave up his comfortable appointment in order to take part in the_war as a member of one of our contingents. He is a man in the prime of life, with a wife, and a family so young that they cannot work for their own support; and he is suffering from an incurable disease, which, I am afraid, may not allow him to enjoy many more years of life. It is difficult to obtain any evidence that his disease was contracted when on active service; but, in such cases, there ought to be some provision whereby the Minister Promises have been made may, at his discretion, allow compensation. The fact remains that here is a man who has been a good and faithfu l servant to the country, and yet he is left to-dav practically without a roof to cover his head. Of course, we have our benevolent asylums, patriotic funds, and so for t h ; but these are not sufficient to meet such' The suggestion of cases as I have mentioned. An employer is responsible to a certain extent for the welfare of anv servant who has served him faithfull y and well; and there ought to I am not sure be some system of insurance so that deserving"" men may not be allowed to starve.

I am very much afraid that so far my representations have been of no avail.

Then, perhaps, the people for whom I am plead ing will receive something like the justice that they demand. sire to say a few words upon the administration of the Defence Department. I have no wish to add in the slightest degree to the burden which the Minister of Defence is called upon to bear. He is charged with the wise expenditure upon defence of £ 1 3 7 , 0 0 0 . largely with the necessity which exists for providing munitions of war. But surely men are just as essential as are munitions of war, and it is upon the rank and file aspect of the question that I wish to make a few observations. A t Burraga, in my constituency, there are some 130 men who are anxious to form a volunteer rifle corps. But owing to the fact that the Department cannot afford to incur further expenditure in equipment, the formation of this corps has been allowed to hang fire. I have been told that the maintenance of each unit costs about , £ 1 3 per annum. But I would point out that if we are serious in our proposal to initiate a compulsory system of adult military service which would in some measure be comparable to the Swiss system, we should be only too glad to receive the offer of a number of men to place their services at the disposal of their country. . Surely the Department will at least make a point of preparing the way for those who are so anxious to serve. I trust that the Minister will make a note of my representations, and besides incurring expenditure upon the establishment of small arms and ammunition factories will-prio r to introducing any measure providing for compulsory military training -mak e provision for enrolling those who volunteer their services. patiently awaiting an. opportunity to ventilate a serious grievance under which country districts labour in connection with defence matters. I refer to the embargo which is placed upon them in the matter of the formation of companies of AusA t present I am tralian Light Horse. The present attitude of the Defence Department towards this important branch of the service,, so far as rural districts are concerned, is one of hostility. As an instance of the way in which those districts are treated, I have only to cite the case of Condobolin. In that centre a company of Australian Light Horse was formed. In passing, I may mention that this particular locality was well represented in the South African war, where some of its residents greatly distinguished themselves. As a matter of fact, one of them was selected as a representative of Australia to attend the coronation ceremony in London. After their return from South Africa, a number of the young men of this district determined to establish a company of Australian He has dealt Light Horse. They did so, and enrolled about forty comrades from the adjacent farms and stations. They then went into active training, expecting that the corps would obtain official recognition. But although they have been carrying on operations for the past four or five years, they are no nearer securing that recognition today than they were at the beginning. RecentlyI have received an application for the formation of a corps of Australian Light Horse at a place near Cowra, and in reference to a similar application from TemoraI have been informed that "" the matter is under consideration."" I can quite understand what that means if the policy which the Department has hitherto pursued is to be adhered to. It will be readily recognised that during the South African campaign the most suitable men for our contingents were drawn from the inland districts. We have there men who practicality live in the saddle, and who, by reason of their training as horsemen, constitute the best material for the formation of such companies.
