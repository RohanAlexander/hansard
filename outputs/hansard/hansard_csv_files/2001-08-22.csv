This bill is currently before the parliament-it has been passed by the House of Representatives and is to be considered in the Senate, possibly later this day. The amendments which I sought to move in the House of Representatives, and which I hope will be considered in the Senate, relate to the question of establishing a register with respect to these particular medical devices. There have been several reports in recent times of problems with implantable devices-for example, the St Jude’s heart pacemaker issue last year and recently the question of defective hip replacements. The amendments proposed by the Labor Party with respect to this particular issue are about establishing a register that will ensure that, when a recall is required, those involved will be able to be contacted quickly. The amendments are also about making sure that, if action needs to be taken, it is taken. To use the example of hip replacements, often people who require hip replacements are of quite a senior age, and often they may be in a situation where the chances of their being aware of a publicly notified recall may be quite small. The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the situation of a 75-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s, for example, who is therefore not aware of a recall of her hip replacement, will be taken into account. We think it is quite a sensible measure. However, at this stage, the government is refusing to accept this proposal. The recommendation came out of the government’s Council for Safety and Quality in Healthcare last year. The council identified that such a system would be a good idea in terms of ensuring that there was greater safety within the system and therefore greater efficacy in terms of the operation of the system and the health of those involved. Since that time, the government has been unwilling to engage us on this issue. Despite numerous attempts by my office to have discussions-and initially there were some signs that there may be some hope of having some discussions-the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care and his office have been unable or unwilling to get back to us. I understand that Senator Tambling has had a bit on his plate recently, given the situation in the Northern Territory-although I understand from some reports that he was smiling quite broadly on election night, which is understandable given the recent issues within that branch. However, I hope that now that the matter is before the Senate he can find time to focus his mind on it and ensure that this matter is considered in the fullness of time and that it leads to a better health system for all Australians. International Livestock Resources and Information Centre Mr St CLAIR (New England) (9.43 a.m.)-I rise today to thank the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources and the government for the major national research facility program that has delivered for the city of Armidale and my electorate of New England the International Livestock Resources and Information Centre, with funding of some $4.5 million. I also congratulate those who were instrumental in making that application. We have a high number of agricultural and livestock science people in my electorate.

More and more breed societies are coming into the New England region and settling in the Armidale district because we are developing that area-and have done so for many years-as a centre of agricultural and livestock science excellence. The proposed International Livestock Resources and Information Centre is a virtual research facility. The facility will operate as a high-speed communications centre and will provide a substantial livestock resource knowledge database. The objectives are to coordinate the activities of existing research and livestock industry organisations associated with the University of New England, to develop software to harvest large volumes of livestock data and install high-speed service and communication links to permit analysis of very large data sets, to enhance research aimed at doubling the rate of productivity improvements in the Australian livestock industries and to use the knowledge base of the ILRIC to provide modern business intelligence solutions via the Internet to livestock enterprises throughout Australia. The facility itself will support research essential to maintain Australia’s leading position in the global marketplace in livestock industries. Research supported by the facility includes advanced genetic evaluation procedures to be applied across all livestock species, acceleration of discovery of gene markets for performance efficiency adaptation and product quality traits, use of vast international databases to identify elite genetic material, development of new animal health products, improved systems of livestock management and development of Internet systems for collecting and warehousing livestock data and delivering results via modern business intelligent solutions to increase profitability. Werriwa Electorate: Direct Internet Democracy democracy ballots in the seat of Werriwa. On the controversial issue of stem cell research, 54 per cent of voters had no objection to the use of human embryos in the cloning process. COAG invited public opinion on this important issue. The majority opinion in my seat is to allow the stem cell research to proceed with the use of human embryos in the cloning process. Our next ballot on politicians’ entitlements-an issue of vast and enduring interest in this place-also gave an interesting result: 71 per cent of people were willing to support a higher up-front salary for members of parliament providing the other perks of office, such as superannuation and travel allowances, were brought into line with community standards. That is a significant result: the public is not opposed to a decent salary for members of parliament; it just wants our other entitlements to be brought into line with the proper public standard. I think that is a very reasonable outcome, and it gives further support to those who want lasting reform of our system of salaries and entitlements. Our most recent result concerned gated housing estates, a new form of housing development that allows people to block off their neighbourhood from the rest of the community. With so much public concern about crime, only 37 per cent of voters were willing to ban gated estates. The message here for government is very clear: address the law and order problem or we can expect a growing number of Australians to gate themselves off with private security and exclusive facilities. This is a very clear trend in our society. People are not antisocial; they are just anti-crime, and they want maximum security and protection for their family-a very natural reaction. Currently, my web site is asking people to vote on the controversial issue of the National Crime Authority’s proposal for a heroin trial. This is a major national question on which people in my seat deserve to have their say. The ballot closes on",130,Representatives Main Committee

Currently, the voting is running about 50/50, indicating split community opinion on this important issue of heroin trials. Finally, I note some comments about this scheme in my electorate from the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston. A while ago, he was asking the question, ‘What is Internet democracy?’ He now knows that from my trial in Werriwa, but then he wrote to one of our local newspapers saying: Take for example Labor’s so-called Internet savvy. Mr Latham, who has again exposed Labor’s complete understanding of new technologies saidAnd he quotes me‘If you do not have access to the Internet please let me know by replying by email.’ The minister is just demonstrating his own ignorance about these new technologies. Many people have access to email but not necessarily the Internet. In the New South Wales police force, for example, every police officer has email but Internet access has been banned because of some abuse of pornographic sites. So the minister for communications in this place does not have a basic understanding of how the new information technologies work. No wonder the government is in so much trouble on issues like digital television. (Time expired) Brisbane City Council: High Density Housing Development tivities of the Brisbane City Council. Yet again, they are trying to turn parts of my electorate into another Coorparoo, with high density housing and flats and units now proposed for the Holland Park West and Tarragindi area around the Holland Park West Busway bus station. The Brisbane City Council simply have a philosophical hatred of backyards and with it the families that would like to play and maintain a reasonable traditional Australian lifestyle within them. This is a real example of the Brisbane City Council being out of touch on this issue. They have written to some of the property owners in and around the Busway station and have told them that a change to the town plan will mean that they will be able to densify their housing site; in other words, sell their homes to developers, providing they have been built since 1946, and in their place developers can put up six packs of units, twoand three-storey brick monstrosities to replace wonderful suburban household living. It is quite distressing to the residents to know that those on the other side of the road from those who received a letter from the Brisbane City Council were not even given the courtesy of any sort of notice about these matters. The Brisbane City Council and Lord Mayor Soorley, as the member for Fisher suggests, has an absolutely well-documented close relationship with developers. This is what it is all about: favoured treatment to some who of course contribute highly to the Labor Party’s campaign in city hall and other efforts. It is all about higher density and trying to devalue traditional Australian housing blocks in and around suburbs like Tarragindi and Holland Park. They do not understand that when there are two cars per household on average and you replace it with six households in a six-pack unit development you have got 12 cars but they only provide parking for six places. There might be three single people living in that place, so you might have 18 cars where there were once two in a certain area. Where do the extra cars go? Out on the streets, and parking is already a huge problem. If the council wants to try and get more people on the Busway and it has got problems with car parking facilities, build a car park. That is what the local residents are saying to me: build a car park but do not ruin the backyard style living. Do not ruin the fact that local schools like Holland Park High, Wellers Hill State School and Marshall Road State School have been enjoying increasing numbers, not decreasing numbers. In other words, families are moving into",131,Representatives Main Committee

Paterson Electorate: Law and Order Morning Herald today that the Liberal Party will be ignoring federal issues in the upcoming election and concentrating on muddying the water between state and local government issues, particularly law and order. Just note the previous speaker. We know that law and order is not a federal issue. Police are employed by state governments. Yet in the Paterson electorate in recent weeks we have had Kerry Chikarovski and the Liberal candidate and George Souris and the National Party candidate out there whipping up a storm of fear on law and order and claiming they will do something about it. There is a time when the federal government could do something about law and order and that is when the federal government owns the property that is being targeted for crime and by criminals. TodayI want to mention a disgraceful act of neglect by the Howard government in allowing the Gan Gan army camp to fall into disrepair by withdrawing security services and by these actions encouraging vandalism and theft. On one occasion it was used to store stolen goods from another robbery. I was contacted two weeks ago by Sergeant Paul Holland of Nelson Bay Police, who advised me of the problem that was being created. This problem can be avoided. All it needs is the federal government to accept its responsibility and restore security surveillance over this very valuable property. Defence has indicated Gan Gan is for sale. It is valuable, as I said. It is adjacent to Tomaree National Park. It is adjacent to Gan Gan wetlands. It is situated right on the main Nelson Bay Road. It is over the road from the Tomaree Sports Complex. The Salamander shopping centre is within walking distance and the Tomaree education centre, which is a kindergarten to TAFE institution, is just down the road. Buildings and infrastructure are extensive. There are tar sealed roads, curb and gutter, underground power, solid buildings, completely fitted mess halls, brand-new cool rooms, plenty of open space and a sports field. It has enormous potential as an education facility, an environmental centre and a whole lot of things that I cannot comprehend but I am sure experts could. But all this government can do is allow it to fall into disrepair before it sells it. I believe that Minister Reith should be condemned for the obvious contempt he holds for the people of Port Stephens who have been very good friends and supporters of the Department of Defence over a long period. That friendship and support should be reciprocated by the Howard government; it certainly is not being reciprocated with respect to Gan Gan. HMAS Brisbane stration) (9.55 a.m.)-I take this opportunity to applaud the decision of the Howard government to have HMAS Brisbane sunk as a dive wreck off the Sunshine Coast in the event that the Queensland government is unable to raise funds to have the Brisbane as an above-water memorial. The future of the Brisbane-a 133-metre long Royal Australian Navy destroyer class ship-after it is decommissioned in October 2001 has been the subject of some conjecture. This ship has been in service for 34 years and is the only ship to have looked after our nation’s interests in two wars. The government initially has given a period of five to six weeks to enable proposals to be brought forward for the preservation of the Brisbane as an abovewater memorial. I do not see this as being viable as the Queensland state government has indicated that it is not prepared to commit funds.

However, the government has given the option for that to occur. I am hopeful that the Brisbane will be sunk off the Sunshine Coast as a memorial. It will last for 500 years as a dive wreck. It will create 70 new jobs and bring 10,000 to 12,000 tourists to the Sunshine Coast-the most desirable tourist destination in our nation. We have wonderful facilities there-tourist infrastructure, lots of accommodation and restaurants. The fact that 10,000 to 12,000 new people will be coming to our area will be a tremendous boost to the economy. The only reason that HMAS Brisbane will be sunk as a dive site off the Sunshine Coast is that I, as the local member, went to see Minister Reith and Minister Scott and pointed out that it is very important that the ship not simply be given to the Queensland government for Premier Beattie to allocate as some sort of reward to his Labor mates. Initially, Premier Beattie supported the Sunshine Coast proposal but then reneged and wanted to sink it off Stradbroke Island. I support very strongly the bid to have the Brisbane sunk off the Sunshine Coast. The fact that we had an outstanding submission supported by local authorities, state government representatives and the private sector was persuasive. The decision by the government to give the ship, as a dive wreck, to the Sunshine Coast, in the event that it is not going to be an above-water memorial, is to be applauded and commended. members’ statements has concluded. BILL 2001 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 June, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 is to revise criminal offence provisions in seven statutes in the Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs portfolio so that they harmonise with the principles of criminal responsibility found in chapter 2 of the Criminal Code. The amendments also remove gender-specific language in three of those statutes and replace it with gender-neutral language. The Australian Labor Party support this bill and take the opportunity today to put our concerns on record, not just about this bill but about the general direction of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs under the Howard government. We often debate, regarding the Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander portfolio, about indigenous-specific funding and about targeted programs, and which political party is, was or will be, spending more on what. There is no doubt that this is useful. Due to the discrimination against indigenous people in this nation, it is clear that there is a need for specific programs to try to alleviate the poverty and the social and economic conditions which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people currently are forced to continue to endure. What often gets missed from this debate is how mainstream programs offered either by the Howard government or a Beazley Labor government would affect indigenous people. There is a need to focus on that as well, because it is clear that indigenous people are missing out. This is an issue beyond party politics.

278,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (9.58 A.m.),"The primary purpose of the Reconciliation andWednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30043 year, but during its centenary the parliament has not had a great record in its treatment of indigenous Australians. This week we have had a debate about health and education. The health and education of indigenous people particularly need to be addressed, as well as housing and other basic issues. There is a crisis particularly in relation to indigenous housing. In a survey last year, it was found that one-third of all properties occupied by Aboriginal housing organisations were in need of major repair or replacement. Of the 348 communities throughout Australia with a population of 50 or more, 58 had failed water testing standards, 57 had 20 or more power interruptions in just one year and 204-that is over half-had sewage leaks or overflows. These figures are an indictment of government policy and programs and show the need for a concerted government response from whichever party comes to government at the end of this year. The Australian Bureau of Statistics did that survey. It was an independent survey. In my view, the federal government has not adequately responded to that survey at this point. In areas of health and education in Australia, this government’s vision and John Howard’s vision is a blank page. Over the past week, the Prime Minister has repeatedly asserted that he has done enough for health and education and his sole priority will be the mysterious on-again, offagain income tax cuts-unfunded, untargeted and unbelievable. It is difficult to see how income tax cuts will help the bulk of indigenous people who are, without a doubt, amongst the most disadvantaged members of our society. This is one of the differences that we see between the major political parties in this parliament. It is something that is deserving of debate. On one side of the House, the Howard government really get excited about tax. They only get excited when talking about income tax cutsleging a scare campaign about taxes. But that is what they concentrate on-taxes and tax cutting. They do not focus on what taxes are for. Taxation is only a means to an end. Taxation is there to provide services to all Australians: health, education, housing. In particular, we need to be able to provide those basic services for the people who are most vulnerable. The essence of income tax is redistribution. The Labor Party, it is true, opposed the tax package which imposed a GST at a flat rate-and so taxed people not according to their incomes-and which in return gave income tax cuts primarily directed to benefiting the wealthier people in this country who got the most out of those tax cuts. That is the problem with the tax package which was put forward by the federal government. When we speak about the need for government programs and the need to address the severe needs of indigenous people, we are talking about what taxation is for. We need to look at service delivery, particularly the needs of health and education. Indigenous people have the poorest education outcome of any group in this country. Although indigenous tertiary participation rates rose between 1986 and 1996, it appears that they have subsequently plateaued and are now falling. According to the government’s own department, indigenous commencements and enrolments have fallen dramatically in the last year-by 15.2 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively-to either below or just above what they were in 1996. In health there remains a threefold discrepancy between indigenous and non-indigenous mortality rates. To put this in context: the mortality rate for Australia’s indigenous population is approximately twice the Maori rate and 2.3 times that of the indigenous population of the",134,Representatives Main Committee

280,Mr Albanese,"Again, we hear fake rhetoric from the opposite side of the House al30044 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 United States. While the indigenous mortality rate in Australia hardly fell in the two decades between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, the rate declined by 44 per cent in New Zealand and 30 per cent in the United States. Income tax cuts are not going to help government, or indigenous people on the ground, to deal with these problems. The only way to address these problems is through a commitment to delivering services. To look again at government policy: the ACOSS report on breaching, which was released on Monday, 13 August, identified the most vulnerable people as being the most targeted and the most breached. Indigenous Australians are three times more likely to be breached than non-indigenous Australians. They literally go without income after the third breach. Penalties such as $1,300 for the third breach mean that indigenous people are then put into the situation, just as other vulnerable groups are, of having to get money by perhaps less legitimate means and going into a cycle of poverty and crime. That then helps to explain why there is such an atrocious level of incarceration amongst indigenous Australians, and why they are so overrepresented in our jails and juvenile detention centres. We need a much more compassionate response than the ‘shoot first, ask questions later’ policy of the Minister for Family and Community Services. Centrelink’s official policy is now being imposed on these indigenous Australians. Without a doubt, indigenous people as a group are amongst the most disadvantaged members of our society. I wonder, then, how the Prime Minister can say, as he was reported by the Sydney Morning Herald over the weekend as saying: We make our commitment about income tax, claiming the next bite of the cherry off the back of having invested a lot of money already in public and social infrastructure. If only that were true. For indigenous Australians it certainly is not the case, and we well recall that the first cut made by this government, upon coming to office in 1996, was to the When it comes to a debate about the law and how it relates to indigenous people, yesterday we saw a great example of cooperation and consultation being used, rather than the court system being used, to resolve areas of potential conflict between indigenous and nonindigenous Australians. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Tjurabalan people and the Western Australian government for their negotiation of a consent agreement on native title, which settles some 26,000 kilometres in Western Australia as a result of the Tjurabalan native title claim. This is a very practical example of where dialogue, negotiation and settlement achieve a greater outcome and certainty for both indigenous and non-indigenous people rather than the old approach of conflict and expensive legal action-of which the only winners are the lawyers. The Labor Party believes that the key to resolving these native title issues is through negotiation rather than through legal action and that the money which is being wasted on the courts in the legal process would be much better spent on reaching lasting agreements which enrich all of us, not just the people directly affected. Last night on the television we saw positive images of the Premier of Western Australia, Geoff Gallop, and the indigenous people of the Tjurabalan native title claim in Western Australia celebrating that cooperation. This is preferable to images of lawyers going in and out of court. That negotiation has been extremely successful in that it provides certainty. It gives them the right to live on their land; it gives them the right to make decisions about the land’s use and protects sites of cultural significance; and it gives certainty in terms of the mining community and the use of that land for all the participants. I congratulate those people who have participated in that agreement and, once again, call upon the government to reject the approach, which is bad one economically in terms of legal Wednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30045 costs and a bad one socially in terms of producing conflict. I urge the government to move towards supporting a negotiation regime of native title. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Strait Islander Affairs Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 amends offences and related provisions in a number of acts relevant to the Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs portfolio and provides for the application of the Criminal Code. The first thing I would like to say is that, despite my rather ominous brief description of what the bill says, the bill does not change the current law and does not create any new strict or absolute liability offences. Rather, it ensures the current law is maintained following the application of the Criminal Code in December this year. In fact, the Criminal Code is a significant step in the reform of our system of justice in this nation and in the harmonisation process which brings so great a consistency and clarity to Commonwealth criminal law. I guess it is true to say that the respect of the Australian people for the Criminal Code and the criminal law is absolutely important to its success, so it is necessary to ensure that, from time to time when inconsistencies arise or acts of parliament of bygone years treat things differently, there is a harmonisation of the approach to the application of the Criminal Code for all Australian citizens. That will ensure that the criminal system of enforcement of offences is not undermined by the people losing confidence in it. I guess that is the basis of this legislation, which I support and which I recommend all members support in this House. I congratulate the minister, Philip Ruddock, and his colleague Daryl Williams, the Attorney-General, for their work across Australia in relation to that. The bill gives me the opportunity it gave the previous speaker to make some general comments about our indigenous brothers and sisters in Australia. I would like briefly from time to time to refer to extracts of a very good speech by the Prime Minister, John Howard, which he gave on 13 December 2000 at the State Library of New South Wales on the topic of Australia and reconciliation today. I respect my colleague the member for Grayndler, who just spokehe was a member of a committee that I chaired, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs-but I was a little sad to hear his approach. Not once did I hear him acknowledge the progress being made by the Howard government in respect of addressing the serious disadvantage our indigenous people still suffer in this country. Furthermore, I tuned in to the fact that the member spoke about the political issue of reducing taxes vis-a-vis some of the statements made by the Prime Minister, but he did not speak about the Prime Minister’s vision for Australia to give people confidence to invest, to work and to help the country prosper and grow, from which the government will obtain a source of revenue to enable it to improve services, especially for disadvantaged people. That is the context that I see it in. Contrast that with the comments of the previous speaker. Whilst he was very heavy in his criticism of the Howard government’s approach to addressing the disadvantage of indigenous people, he did not say where his alternative government-and he is a senior member of the Labor Party in opposition-would get the money he appears to be promising. Furthermore, he did not acknowledge the fact that the states are primarily responsible, as they should be, for things such as housing and hospitals. I did not hear one acknowledgment from him at all that the states are now getting a reliable source of revenue, through the GST, which will grow over a period of years and thus enable the premiers of each state to improve services. I was minister for health in Victoria for a while, and I know the frustrations of being in that sort of portfolio, having to beg every year through Premiers Conferences for funding and then having to introduce and rely on anti-employment type taxes such as payroll tax because the",135,Representatives Main Committee
281,Mr Lieberman (Indi) (10.14 A.m.),"The Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres30046 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 state source of revenue to provide the basic services of health, police, emergency services, law and order and the like has not been adequate. I thought the member might have acknowledged in his heart the fact that, whether you like the GST or not, John Howard has now been able, despite a lot of opposition and difficulty, to introduce into Australia in the year of our celebration of the Centenary of Federation a financial arrangement whereby the states will get increasingly large sums of funds through the GST to expand and address these serious issues. I acknowledge the serious issue for indigenous people in housing, which is primarily a state responsibility but which the Commonwealth accepts that it has a leadership role in. We hear not a word from the senior member of the opposition-offering himself to this nation as leader of an alternative government-in the context of debating questions of how we can do better to help indigenous people address the disadvantage. But the Prime Minister, in the speech I referred to, said that the government’s approach to policies affecting indigenous Australia is based on the belief that everyone should have a fair go, that all people should have equal opportunity and access to services provided by government, and that we can move forward together for a prosperous and good future for all Australians by being pragmatic yet being absolutely dedicated to achieving benefits and changes in the systems that have been trying to help indigenous people so that we can focus on practical outcomes. We all know the Prime Minister has dedicated his government and his ministers to this. If you look at them you will see some great work being done through the Howard government ministers in employment, education and training, health and small business, for example, to help indigenous people. By means of the Prime Minister’s approach-by being practical, dedicated and focused despite some systemic, cultural, entrenched opposition-the outcomes for indigenous people will be much better. The Prime Minister, in his speech, referred to a speech that Evelyn Scott made about some of the problems of her people. Evelyn Scott is a great Australian and one whom I admire very much. She regards welfare dependency, which is one of the terrible things that have held back indigenous people in this country as ‘almost totally destroying Aboriginal culture’. Peter Yu, another well-known indigenous leader in Australia, asserts that communities are being ‘crushed with the weight of the welfare economy’. Noel Pearson argues very persuasively: … the scale and nature of indigenous problems changed dramatically after passive welfare became the economic foundation of their communities. Pearson went on to say, as the Prime Minister noted in his speech: … there is a causal connection between the change in their economy and their social relationships … it is passive welfare combined with substance abuse that threatens to disrupt traditional valuesvalues which the Prime Minister says had previously mandated reciprocity and responsibility. The Prime Minister, whilst acknowledging that there is a heck of a lot of work to be done by all Australians-let us not doubt that-commented that we are making progress. The previous federal government, the Keating and Hawke government, also was making progress. I would like to place that on record. More politicians should be acknowledging the good work of each of us, pointing out the failures or weakness of each of us but working together to overcome them. The Prime Minister, in his speech, said: I have looked at the level of progress made over the past 20 years and while no one denies that as a nation we need to do better than we have in the past, there are examples of real achievements in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. And so there are. I admire the Aboriginal people who are having a go and really showing great things for their people and for Australia. The Prime Minister continued: I don’t agree with those that say that the community has little to show for what is now some 30 years of effort. This criticism, that nothing is getting better, is common to both extremes of the debate-those Wednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30047 who would abolish all such special programmes, and to those who say that nothing less than a legally enforceable treaty and special Constitutional rights will ‘solve the problem’. As the Prime Minister wisely said: Neither view is correct, nor is the underlying premise that things haven’t been improving. There is in fact indisputable evidence of long-term improvement in many Aboriginal socio-economic indicators. For example, the proportion of indigenous Australians who own their own home has increased from 1 in 4 to 1 in 3 since the 1970s. I would like to see us aim, in the next decade, to get it to be equal to that of non-indigenous Australians. Why not? There has been that progress. The proportion of indigenous students completing high school has quadrupled over the same period, but I am not satisfied with the number who have not completed high school. Particularly, I am not satisfied with the number who appear to have completed year 12 but who still cannot speak or read English and who, therefore, cannot get employment-and I observed this some years ago in the Northern Territory. So that is a problem. I know that former Labor Senator Collins did a great report on that and I recommend reading it, because it has some good ideas in it. The Prime Minister went on and said that the infant mortality rate has been cut from up to 20 times the non-Aboriginal rate to four times the national rate. It is still too high and it is frightening; but there has been that improvement. Aboriginal enrolments in higher education increased by 60 per cent in the 1990s. The Keating government and the Howard government have been able to get that increase under way. There is a lot more to be done; we have still got Aboriginal kids not going to school. The truancy rate is frightening in some areas of Australia. There are lots of reasons for it. Some of these kids have parents who have never been to school before. So you have to understand the huge differences. I have seen some great leaders and good teachers talking about an outreach program where they, with volunteers, actually go to the homes, talk to the parents and bring the children themselves into the school over a period of time. Over a few months with that sort of assistance and support the children are coming to school because they want to come to school, and the parents, who unfortunately may not have understood the reason for their children going to school, are starting to see the benefits also. So, by working together and by being both quite sensible and practical, good progress is being made, but there is a lot more to be done. In this wide-ranging speech I have also strayed a little from the technicality of the Criminal Code. I want to put on the record that there is a lot to be done for reconciliation and for our Aboriginal people. We must not rest. We are on the right track. John Howard, the Prime Minister, has allocated $2.3 billion in his budget for special indigenous programs across this country. I am not gloating about it, but it is a record amount-there has never been that amount in the history of federal governments in Australia. The challenge is to make those dollars work better.

I would also like to thank you for being a good colleague and friend in that committee.

With those sorts of concepts-partnership, mutual respect, goodwill, recognising the job ahead without deluding ourselves but remaining dedicated to practical policies to improve health, education and training, to address unemployment and to improve housing and all those things-if we just say, ‘Nothing is going to stop us from working to that end,’ there is no way we can miss. We can get good systems going, such as some of the ideas that the Deputy Speaker and I have shared in a committee and which we cannot talk about now, although I wish we could. There are some great things happening out there. As a student of indigenous affairs-and I do not know enough about it, although I think it is fascinating-I obtain the greatest happiness from the number of indigenous people who are taking the initiative themselves to get the management skills to lead the issues, to develop programs from the bottom up, to argue the case for their people to be equal citizens with bureaucrats and members of government throughout Australia, to remain focused on the need to address disadvantage and to have the courage to stand up to some of the stars of the past who for too long have dominated the debate because they have managed to capture the media. Not enough attention has been given to the good people on the ground who will actually do it. They will without a doubt deliver, provided we all remain very fixed, determined and objective about our strategies. and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, impacts across the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs portfolio through its application of the Criminal Code. As previous speakers have found, it is an opportunity to discuss a number of social justice issues in indigenous communities. My comments are heavily influenced by a recent visit to Cape York Peninsula and, in particular, by the work of Noel Pearson and his Cape York partnerships project. Noel Pearson has reached a conclusion which I believe is set to fundamentally change the nature of the debate in this country about Aboriginal issues. In the past, problems with alcohol and drugs in Aboriginal communities were seen as a by-product of centuries of dispossession and racism, but the problem is now so widespread, in Pearson’s eyes-and I think, to any independent observer, we are talking about a problem of epidemic proportions-that it can no longer be regarded as just a by-product. It goes to the heart of the integrity, stability and even the survival of Aboriginal communities in this country. Therefore, we must fundamentally change the way in which we tackle questions of Aboriginal disadvantage. We have to change the way in which we think about these problems and the role of this parliament. We must change all our attitudes and policies in this absolutely vital area of social justice. I would like to quote at length from Noel Pearson himself. He has made a very powerful statement. He says: The prevailing analysis is that substance abuse and addiction is a symptom of underlying social and personal problems ... According to this theory we must address the “underlying issues” if we are to abolish substance abuse. The severe substance abuse in Aboriginal communities is said to have been caused by immense ingrained trauma, trans-generational grief, racism, dispossession, unemployment, poverty et cetera. But the symptom theory of substance abuse is wrong. Addiction is a condition in its own right, not a symptom ... Of course substance abuse originally got a foothold in our communities because many people were bruised by history and likely to break social norms. The grog and drug epidemics could break out because personal background and underlying factors made people susceptible to trying addictive substances. But when a young person (or an older non-addict) is recruited to the grog and drug coteries",139,Representatives Main Committee
283,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (10.43 A.m.),"This legislation, the Reconciliation and AboriginalWednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30049 today the decisive factor is the existence of these epidemics themselves, not his or her personal background. Pearson continues: For those who did begin using an addictive substance as an escape from a shattered life and from our history, treating those original causes will do little (if indeed you can do anything about those original causes). The addiction is in itself a much stronger force than any variation in the circumstances of the addict. ... at this advanced stage of the grog and drug epidemics it is not a breach of social norms to begin with substance abuse. It follows that we cannot divert young people away from substance abuse. No matter how much money and effort we spend on alternative activities, drug free activities can never compete with the more exciting drug-induced experiences for young people’s attention, because all hesitation about the appropriateness of an abusive lifestyle is long since gone. Pearson is talking about a fundamental breakdown and disintegration of social norms and standards. He writes: When abusive behaviour is deeply entrenched in our communities it is not the material destitution, the social ills and historical legacy that fuel the abuse epidemics. It is the epidemics that perpetuate themselves. … … … Put it this way: today people begin abusing grog and drugs in our communities because other people do. And if “underlying issues” make somebody start drinking or using drugs, the most important “underlying issue” today is the chaos caused by the grog and drug epidemics. And addiction is not a symptom of bad or chaotic circumstances anyway; removing them will not cure addiction, and hence not stop abusive behaviour. The problem is so widespread that conventional diversionary and health care strategies will not work. This is what the evidence is showing on the Cape York Peninsula. These epidemics have worked their way into the social norms of communities. During my recent visit, Noel Pearson told the story of a drug and alcohol diversion strategy in the Aboriginal community at Aurukun. The government paid $25,000 to bring in a consultant from the bureaucracy to develop an alcohol diversion strategy. His recommendation was to purchase a minibus to take the drinkers away from the canteen, to remove them from the location that was causing so much damage. For outsiders and for many in the bureaucracy I am sure it looks like a logical thing to buy a minibus. This ended up being a $100,000 strategy to take the drinkers away from the canteen. What was the practical reality? The grandmothers and the children trying to get a decent sleep at night in the community did not want the disruptive drinkers to come back and wreck their night, so they said, ‘Get back on the minibus and go back to the canteen.’ That was the practical reality in Aurukun. Over time, the minibus-this do-good consultancy strategybecame a taxi service to get people to the canteen. The government was paying money through this consultant for a bad purpose, for a bad outcome in practice. It was a theory gone wrong; a theory that did not match up to the views and practices of the Aboriginal community at Aurukun. This is the sort of woolly-headed thinking that we try to combat. It is an example of wrong-headed thinking in public policy. I have seen some of these problems in my own electorate, particularly in public housing estates. These are problems that not just affect Aboriginal communities but stretch right across our society. After decades of poverty, the problems are inevitably passed on from one generation to the next. This is the cruelty, the tragedy, of intergenerational poverty. It is not just an economic problem; it is an intensely social problem. It unglues the normal habits of neighbourhoods. It unglues the trust and cooperation between people. It unglues social norms in a sense of social 30050 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 responsibility. It unglues the regular habits of work and community. It unglues the most important capital of all: social capital, the bonds between people. The prevailing analysis of poverty positions it as an economic condition. The conventional approach to welfare treats it as a form of economic compensation for poverty. Both these positions ignore the socially corrosive impact of long-term poverty. What starts out as a form of economic disadvantage over time becomes a debilitating social condition and causes a breakdown in the relationships between people. Ultimately the social impact of intergenerational poverty is more damaging than its economic impact. The loss of moral norms and responsibility is passed on from one generation to the next. Infants and adolescents are deprived of a normal social environment, an environment that teaches them the difference between right and wrong, an environment that teaches them about restraint and responsibility. Well before they can ever access the economic advantages of work and a regular income, well before they can ever join the real economy, at this young and tender age they develop significant social problems and disadvantages. Ultimately the social impact of poverty is more damaging than its economic consequences. These social problems act as an obstacle. Very often it is an insurmountable barrier to economic participation. Noel Pearson understands this point well. He states: It is clear that the problem is social. Surely the solution must also be social. … … … When you look at a drinking circle you see people who are socialising around grog ... Everyone involved in the drinking is obliged to contribute resources-money-for the purchase of grog. Everyone is obliged to share the money and the grog. These social and cultural obligations are invoked at every turn by members of the drinking circle. These invocations are very heavy indeed and they most often draw upon real obligations and relationships under Aboriginal laws and customs ... Outside of this drinking circle are the women and the children and the old people and the non-drinkers. The resources of these non-drinkers are used to feed the families-including those who have spent most or all of their money on grog, when they are hungry. But more than that, these non-drinkers are placed under tremendous social and cultural pressure to contribute resources to the drinking circle for buying grog. So the drinking circle becomes the suction hole for the family’s resources. Wives and girlfriends, parents and grandparents, are placed under tremendous pressure-social and cultural, ultimately through physical violence ... to contribute to these pathological behaviours. There is a major problem and we need to recognise the proper role for government. Government is good at many things but community development is not one of them. Governments have worked out how to run open and efficient economies. With the end of the Cold War, it is no secret that market economics is here to stay. By and large, governments have worked out how to promote technological progress and the wonders of the information age. So too the welfare state is highly skilled in the mass production of entitlements and services. The downside of all this success by government has been on the social front. Bureaucratic organisations are more likely to destroy social capital than to create it. The mass production of services inevitably leads to the depersonalisation of service delivery. Big companies and big governments share a common methodology. They rely on standardised rules that deliver a standardised product to a large number of individual clients. This process unfortunately leaves little room for the development of personal relationships-the mutualism and cooperation upon which a good society relies. Big government bureaucracy leaves little room for the development of the thing we call community. Governments, and to some extent the welfare sector, have adopted a dispensary model of governance. They dispense services to a waiting public without first ensuring that these services can be used effectively by the intended recipients. It is not enough to dispense services. Wednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30051 You have to make sure that the services can be well used by the people to which they are directed. We can provide top-class schools, for instance, but they are not likely to be of any use to a boy with severe behavioural problems and troubles at home. We can provide advanced health services, but they are not likely to be of any use to people rutted into socially pervasive addictions. Governments can provide an army of consultants, studies and reports in disadvantaged communities, but they are not likely to be of any use to people lacking self-esteem and confidence, which is the basis of social capital. This, of course, is Noel Pearson’s point in the Cape York Peninsula. The mainstream debate in Aboriginal affairs is concentrated on questions of native title, education, health, housing and even parliamentary apologies. In reality, these are second or third order issues. The threshold question concerns the problem with alcohol and drugs. Unless in practical terms Aboriginal people can access and make good use of native title, schools and health centres, these basic human rights are entirely abstract. They make no difference in practice. Abstract rights need to be converted to practical outcomes, but that will only happen if the recipients of rights and services are in a position to make good use of the benefits of government. As Pearson puts it: Almost all of our other social and health problems are derivative of our grog and drug problem: we solve grog and drugs, we solve everything else. “harm reduction”, “clinical care”, “public education programs-dynamic poster workshops!”There is one: dynamic poster workshops“family violence strategies”, “school attendance strategies”, “life promotion programs”, “economic development strategies”-these are all either (i) diversions from what really needs to be tackled or (ii) they are totally futile or (iii) will only have marginal and temporary success as long as we don’t confront the grog and drug epidemic amongst our people. Another big mistake has been in our analysis of Aboriginal health. In the prevailing debates, poor health is automatically seen as a product of Aboriginal disadvantage. But our material circumstances have improved greatly at the same time as our life expectancy has decreased. Pearson also says: What our people need more urgently than an expansion of the health care system, is an immediate dismantling of the passive welfare paradigm and an end to permissive thinking about grog and drug policy, because it is those factors that generate the endless flow of Aboriginal injuries, neglected children and unnecessarily sick people to the clinics. Pearson concludes: Aboriginal people don’t have health problems that can be solved with medical treatment; they have passive welfare injuries inflicted upon them. Unfortunately, government is aiding this process. What sort of system pays money to a pregnant girl to drink at the canteen all day, passing on foetal alcohol syndrome to her unborn child? It is a social tragedy when these things happen. It is evidence of the rights agenda gone mad. The right to receive welfare payments needs to be matched by the exercise of personal responsibility, and there can be no greater responsibility in our society than that of a mother to an unborn child. The grog epidemic in Cape York is a social problem which requires an intensely social solution. The answers do not lie with government agencies, consultancies and reports. The proper role for government is to back community led solutions, to act as a junior partner to the leadership of people such as Noel Pearson-a great and inspiring leader of people such as Noel Pearson. As a first step we need to face up to the truth. It is no longer sufficient to regard the grog problem as a by-product of dispossession and racism. It is a problem in its own right and needs to be treated as such. It is no longer sufficient to regard long-term poverty as primarily 30052 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 an economic condition. Its roots are fundamentally social and it needs to be treated as such. Most importantly, it is no longer sufficient to explain away the epidemic in terms of Aboriginal culture. The Aboriginal tradition of sharing resources can be no excuse for the sharing of money and alcohol within drinking circles. Pearson makes this point most powerfully indeed. We need to be frank about the problem and fanatical about the solution. Four strategies can make a difference. The first concerns community responsibility: backing the indigenous leaders who want to take direct responsibility and action in response to the drug and alcohol epidemic. Welfare rights need to be matched by social responsibility. I once more quote Noel Pearson: The community strategy must be aimed at creating an environment which makes it more uncomfortable for substance abusers to continue with the abuse than to quit. There must be no more unconditional support if people don’t change (ie. there must be a material cost). And, very importantly, there must be an immediate rejection of abusive behaviour by the environment (ie. there must be a social and emotional cost). The other main element of the strategy must be enforced treatment, because we need a cure for the current epidemic. The absolute intolerance of illicit drugs, absolute enforcement of social order, and enforced treatment is the core of the strategy. In order to cure an epidemic there must be involuntary, mandatory and humane treatment of people who are engaged in abuse. Everything that the addicts encounter must be designed to force them into that treatment. Every law, every social norm, every action by governmentand community organisationsevery word the addicts hear must be consciously designed with this purpose in mind. Pearson is serious indeed about community leadership and community solutions. The justice system also needs to support rather than hinder these acts of public responsibility. The female elder, for instance, who rips out a fuse box to close down an all-night drinking party is not a vandal; she is in fact a community leader who deserves the support of the law. So too the grandmother who confiscates drinking money is not a thief; she is the sort of person who needs to be backed by the police and encouraged by government to lead her community out of its troubles. A second strategy involves breaking the supply line for alcohol. Once a community takes a democratic decision to crack down on drinking, that decision needs to be enforced by the community itself by drying up the supply of alcohol, with the support of the legal agencies. The third strategy involves diverting into socially useful and responsible purposes the welfare payments that currently resource the drinking circles. I am not saying end welfare payments; I am saying redirect them to better areas of social need and social purpose. For instance, Noel Pearson has said that welfare payments in Aboriginal communities should be paid into a trust administered by elders-an act of Aboriginal self-determination-and that funds would only be released once the recipients demonstrate proper social behaviour and responsibility. We could also look at the introduction of smartcards that do not allow the purchase of alcohol-that is, the payment of welfare support through smartcards-restricting use of those cards to socially responsible activities. We could also ensure that transfer payments are made into education accounts, food accounts or housing accounts that are released for these specific purposes. We need to divert government and welfare resources into socially useful and responsible activities. The fourth and final strategy that I put before the House-thankfully in the presence of the minister-involves backing the work of social entrepreneurs. Social entrepreneurs are special people who combine the best of social practice, bringing together social cooperation and trust, with the best of business practice, building an entrepreneurial and risk-taking culture. In my Wednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30053 recent visit to Cape York Peninsula, I had the absolute pleasure and joy of learning about the wonderful work of Milton Jameses-a real social entrepreneur. He has undertaken a tremendous program called Boys from the Bush, which is designed to teach young Aboriginal offenders about moral leadership and decent social standards, ultimately turning them into young business entrepreneurs. This is a behaviour modification program for young indigenous offenders which uses the distillation and sale of eucalyptus tree oils-they call it bush medicine-that sell well in the markets of Cairns on any day or night of the week. We need to back people like this. We need to back the Milton Jameses who are not content with putting people in a holding pattern but are looking for new innovative solutions. We need to back these people, whether they are found in churches, community organisations or within the middle management of bureaucracy. We also need to use the police-a wasted resource-for these social entrepreneurial processes. Solutions can be found, once we face up to the reality and start to think with common sense and logic about the great things that need to be done by and for our Aboriginal citizens. Islander Affairs Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, as we know, is simply designed to line this legislation up with the standardisation across various pieces of legislation in our federal system. I want to compliment the member for Werriwa on his comments. In the last fortnight, I have come back from the Pitjantjatjara lands, which are in my electorate. I drove through those lands on the Stuart Highway-from one side through to the Western Australian border-and whenever I do that I am always absorbed by my feelings of frustration, fascination and absolute amazement at the contrast that I see. All that the member for Werriwa talked about is there in the Pitjantjatjara lands. When I drive through one of the communities at dusk on a newly prepared bitumen roadwhich is there to keep the dust down-I have to carefully avoid the petrol sniffers who are walking down the road. When I listen to people who have to endure the violence, the absolute chaos of the results of substance abuse and many other difficulties that those in those lands experience, I look for another way. In fact, it is fair to say that when I return home and go back to what would be regarded as a more normal Australian life, it takes me a week or two to actually get my own life back into some kind of balance, such is the impact on my own psyche. In the Pitjantjatjara lands, currently we have what I would regard as a welfare abyss. We have $50 million to $100 million of Commonwealth and state government funding going into well-intentioned programs in most cases, but the community is still left with profound difficulties without, I would suggest, great solutions being offered. The whole problem is entrenched. To highlight that, I raise the real issue surrounding law and order, which I briefly mentioned earlier, and that is that we have no police presence. We have community police officers, but effectively we have no police. So imagine a society which has intentions of law and order and general respect for it within the community but with a very limited capacity to do anything about it. Indeed, they have to call the Marla police, who are up to 500 or 600 kilometres away. The Marla police might do a fortnightly or monthly round just to check how the community is going. It is little surprise that we see people with scant regard for normal community practice. In terms of the general structure of the lands, a South Australian act some 20 years ago was brought in with all the confidence and positive attitudes of land rights for Aboriginal people. With all the discussion about the Northern Territory land rights legislation and native title over the last decade, let us remember that the AP lands legislation in this part of my electorate in South Australia was the first land rights granted in Australia. Yet, as the member for Wer-",140,Representatives Main Committee
284,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (11.03 A.m.),"The Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait30054 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 riwa has described, it is exactly the same situation as we see in Cape York. So we have a long journey to travel to even try to get some kind of sense and balance to give people a reasonable approach and a reasonable outlook on life. Once again looking at my own electorate, the Pitjantjatjara is a closed society. It takes up a very large area of South Australia-about 20 per cent, or whatever it is-and it is supposed to be a dry community, but I can assure you that it is far from dry. The issue, once again, comes back to how you implement basic respect for the law without the presence of those people to uphold the law. Of course, there are a whole lot of other issues around that. I was quite surprised by the member for Werriwa’s comments. It was not at all what I expected, so I guess I have framed my comments around the future, and I will stay with the Pitjantjatjara lands. I have talked about the welfare abyss that is there and the fact that there does not seem to have been any progress; in fact, they are probably going backwards. If we were to bring in ‘involuntary mandatory action’-to quote the member for Werriwa-which would no doubt be highly controversial, I do not know how we would strike the balance between responsibilities and rights and the welfare gone mad situation. The way we are going at the moment is clearly not balanced. I will just paint a picture of what I would like to see a generation in the future. I would like to see Pitjantjatjara land open to the community; I would like to see that community in charge of its own destiny and with the confidence to work together and focus on serious issues for their young and for what they would like to do to have some-in the old legal term-‘quiet enjoyment of their land and their way of life’. IfI can be bold, and even no doubt be accused of being patronising, I think we have some of the best pastoral country in Australia, so the opportunities for pastoralism with the beef cattle industry are very strong. There is just a modest base of the arts. Aboriginal art is quite strong and I see no reason why that could not be greatly developed. It does provide a useful and quite satisfying outlet for particularly many of the women in the Pitjantjatjara lands. In terms of tourism, this country is absolutely magnificent. It is the most beautiful country. Coming from the Stuart Highway through the Pitjantjatjara lands into Yulara and to Ayers Rock, you can imagine the potential that could be managed and negotiated working with the Aboriginal people. It is just one of the great journeys through Australia. I would very much like to see that sort of thing happening. Mining certainly is very much untapped, but that is a more difficult area. You get into the whole issue around sacred sites and the general respect for the lands of Aboriginal people. Nevertheless, sensible management and the taking of a very practical view by the legal profession in considering the well-being of the people and community, particularly in the Pitjantjatjara lands, would very much enhance the prospects for some mining agreement for some future benefit. There are a whole lot of very positive things that this part of Australia could do, but at the moment it is locked into a dependence on welfare. I will conclude by reminding us all that the community of Ernabella really only became a community, in whitefella terms, back in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Remember that these people were nomadic. We have created five or six communities in whitefella style and have expected people to live in these sorts of structures. I find it quite remarkable that we have thought that we could impose this sort of structure on people and expect it to work. I have seen an old military photograph of Ernabella with about six or 10 buildings. As a farmer, I could make out the shearing shed and the layout of the yards, including the forcing pens, et cetera. Think of the Ernabella of 55 years ago and the Ernabella of today, which probably has 100 to 200 buildings and a whole lot of white people and white civilisation imposed solutions. It just struck me as stark. To expect people to adapt to that and then appreciate it is, in the very least, to be totally optimistic. Wednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30055 This morning gave me an opportunity to hear a surprising but absolutely welcome contribution from the member for Werriwa. If we are going to have any hope in this place of doing useful things for the Aboriginal people, in terms of our own and their well-being, these are the sorts of things we really need to tackle, and tackle in a much more innovative way than we have in the past. ister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (11.14 a.m.)-in reply-I will not detain the committee long. I would like to thank the members for Grayndler, Indi, Werriwa and Grey for their contributions on this bill, the Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001. It is fascinating because I have listened to the debate and I have not heard the bill mentioned once. The bill amends certain provisions of the provisions of the Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs portfolio to provide for the application of the Criminal Code. It is similar to other Criminal Code harmonisation bills that are being introduced by other portfolios. The effect of this bill is to maintain the status quo. I could sit down now and say that they are the comments relevant to the bill, but please excuse me if I divert for a moment to some of the comments that have been made by my colleagues. The contrast could not have been greater. I was not here for the member for Grayndler’s speech, but it was typical. It said that we need more specific programs for indigenous people to alleviate disadvantage, that there is a housing crisis, that in the health area there are high infant mortality rates, that in the education area enrolment levels are inadequate, that there was an ACOSS report critical of indigenous disadvantage, and then there were some comments about Western Australian native title. What do I want to contrast that with? I want to contrast it with the speech of the member for Werriwa, because he focused very clearly on the crisis that indigenous people are telling us they face. He focused on the solutions that they face. It was an extraordinarily comprehensive speech that drew heavily upon the comments of Noel Pearson. It addressed many of what I would call the orthodoxies-the orthodoxy that brought us to the view that you should dismantle the employment arrangements for indigenous people in a quest to ensure that all people were rewarded on exactly the same basis, rather than over time to maintain that employment and develop new opportunities but to leave people with some dignity and self-esteem. In time we might look back at those efforts in relation to giving people reward that we thought was appropriate by our standards but which deprived them of much of the self-esteem that they had. The member for Werriwa spoke about welfare. We have a view that all people are entitled to welfare if they are in need. But say you have not had the experience to be able to develop the capacity to manage the funds that are given to you, or if they are given in the form of what some people euphemistically refer to as ‘sit down money’, where you have none of the commitments that often utilise the funds that people on welfare in the broader community have to meet-no rates, no insurance, no life assurance payments. If you run through the sorts of things that people commit themselves to, then you find people with large amounts of disposable income that could be used in ways which for them have not proven to be desirable. I listened to the comments for the member for Werriwa because I think they are very challenging comments. He linked the right to receive welfare with a need for responsibility. He talked about the need to embrace and back indigenous leaders who are prepared to work in these areas. He talked about the need for enforced treatment for people who are suffering substance abuse. He talked about the supply lines by which people are able to access alcohol. But I might say what you find with supply lines is that there is very often somebody who is exploiting another’s vulnerability.",145,Representatives Main Committee
285,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Min30056 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 He also talked about the ways in which we might be able to direct welfare payments to a social purpose. Let me just say, in relation to the latter matter, that that is an issue that Senator Vanstone, my colleague, is looking at in terms of Noel Pearson’s proposals for family income management and, at an appropriate time, will have something to say about. We will look at whether or not a trial, with appropriate monitoring arrangements, might be useful here. Noel Pearson was recently at a meeting of Commonwealth and state and territory ministers for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, which is called McATSIA. What was regrettable was that Noel Pearson spoke to about half the Aboriginal affairs ministers, because the ministers from New South Wales, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and the Northern Territory were not there. Certainly, we had the minister from Queensland, the minister from Western Australia and the minister from Victoria. So some of us heard what Noel had to say. Noel made these same requests. He emphasised the urgency of addressing substance abuse and a need for changed attitudes. He made it very clear that it was not sufficient to say that this is a problem which is there because we as a community, as a society, have not done enough in terms of housing, welfare, health and education programs, and employment. He was saying that you can move to cure all those matters but if people are hooked on drugs, in one form or another, and are dependent upon substances then the problem will remain and it is of endemic proportions. Part of the reason for that is that people have never had to develop the social controls in indigenous Australia to manage alcohol. It was made freely available in circumstances in which we did not try to develop those social controls. I think the member for Werriwa has done us all a public service by putting those arguments in the public arena. It was a very constructive speech and it was welcomed by my colleague the member for Grey and the member for Indi. There needs to be a place in which people with constructive ideas can contribute. This is not a matter that the Commonwealth is going to be able to address alone. It may be able to do something in relation to the way in which income payments are managed, but what happens in communities is an area in which the state governments have a direct responsibility. Licensing outlets and the way in which people access them are matters of state responsibility. This is an area in which we are going to have to work together, in which we are going to have to put aside some of the orthodoxies and in which we are going to have to stop trying to score-and forgive me for saying this-the cheap points. I am brought back to the speech of the honourable member for Grayndler, who spoke for the opposition. He is in a sense part of the problem and not part of the solution. If his views are being advanced as the opposition’s alternative, it indicates that there is no solution there. Somebody like the member for Werriwa really has to be given an opportunity to develop some of those solutions. There is an enormous amount being done to alleviate disadvantage. The symptoms can be alleviated through increased levels of funding-as the member for Indi said, today it is $2.3 billion, which is a record-and increased housing and infrastructure, and you heard the member for Grey’s comments about that. Infrastructure has changed. I have been going to indigenous communities for over 28 years, and the infrastructure I see today is totally different to the infrastructure I witnessed decades ago. There has been enormous change. There is still some way to go, but the infrastructure has changed. Even this year there was increased funding of $75 million for housing and infrastructure. We have seen a situation in which indigenous home ownership is increasing very significantly and where few communities today do not have access to adequate water and electricity services. We have seen a situation in which Wednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30057 the infant mortality rates have declined from 20 times worse to three times worse, I think. There is still a way to go but it is a significant change. In my remarks I would like to pick up the comments that were made about native title. Native title is part of the rights agenda, which the member for Werriwa has told us is really not the main game, but let’s assume that it is important to make some adjustments. The adjustments were made. The adjustments that were designed to produce non-litigated outcomes were made by the government. In fact, 26 indigenous land use agreements have been registered with the Native Title Tribunal and a further 13 have been lodged for registration. The tribunal estimates that there are a further 105 indigenous land use negotiations under way. If everything had to be negotiated, that would be fine. But what you find is that sometimes people negotiate and they do not get the outcomes they want. Then what happens? I can tell you what happens: they litigate. There is an idea that you can stop people litigating, that you can say to indigenous Australians who are anxious to pursue native title claims, ‘If you have not negotiated an outcome in good faith, you can’t litigate.’ There is an idea that you are able to achieve that outcome. arguing that there need to be negotiated outcomes. I think he was not aware that there was a capacity for negotiation. I do not think he was aware of how much negotiation had actually occurred, but he was holding out this view that the government is in some way stubbornly committed to long and expensive court cases to resolve native title claims. He says that John Howard should open his eyes to the progress that has been made through negotiation rather than litigation. If one is serious about getting out of litigation, there are only two ways: you negotiate to give people everything they want-and I suppose if you have unlimited resources you might be able to do that-or you eliminate people’s entitlement to litigate. I have heard some interesting propositions recently, and I would like to put them on the record in the Main Committee. I have heard in relation to separated children, for instance, where there are claims that are being made for some recompense, that you might be able to establish a tribunal to deal with those claims and thereby avoid litigation. It is said that those claims can be pursued without people having to give evidence and experience the hurt and trauma of saying what has happened to them. I do not know how tribunals would make decisions if you did not get some evidence, but that seems to be the view. My experience has generally been that if people do not get what they want out of negotiation they resort to litigation. So the idea that in the native title area you can avoid litigation, or that in relation to separated children you could set up a tribunal and avoid litigation, is dependent on being able to remove the opportunity for judicial review. How would you remove the opportunity for judicial review for a tribunal that was going to deal with compensation issues? It would be by what is known as a privative clause, which would boost the final decision of the tribunal to final and conclusive-in the same way as we did with our industrial tribunals, in the same way as was done in New South Wales with casino tribunal decisions. Yet this is the same Labor Party which, wearing another cap, tells me that one should not reduce access to our courts for people who come from abroad and are not satisfied with tribunal outcomes. In other words, there is the view that if you come from abroad you should still, as a matter of justice, have access to our courts, but if you are an Australian-an indigenous Australian-we can set up negotiation arrangements in which we could get the lawyers out; the money is being wasted on lawyers in the courts. Or we could set up a tribunal to deal with compensation issues, and so avoid litigation. The only way in which you could do it would be to limit access to judicial review. I find it extraordinary that we are talking about limiting access by Australians to judicial review at the same time as we defend the entitlements of those who come from abroad to unlimited access to our courts.",147,Representatives Main Committee
286,"I Guess That Is What The Opposition Shadow Minister, Mr Mcmullan, Is Saying. He Has Been","30058 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 While I welcomed the speeches of all of my colleagues, I particularly commend the member for Werriwa and the members for Indi and Grey for their very sensitive, thoughtful and constructive contributions. I have to say that the opposition might do well to look elsewhere for some constructive ideas and to ensure that in future when we are debating matters of this sort we have some contributions by which we can see that the opposition is part of the solution and not part of the problem. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 August, on motion by Mr Anthony: That the bill be now read a second time. (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 makes a series of amendments to 15 pieces of legislation in the Health and Aged Care portfolio. Like several similar bills for other portfolios, the purpose of the bill is to harmonise a number of offence creating and related provisions with the general principles of criminal responsibility, as codified in chapter 2 of the Criminal Code. The Criminal Code, which is contained in the schedules to the Criminal Code Act 1995, will alter the way in which Commonwealth criminal offence provisions are interpreted regarding offences contained in the legislation in the Health and Aged Care portfolio. If the legislation containing offence provisions is not amended by the end of this year to conform with chapter 2 of the code, the code may alter the interpretation of existing offence provisions. The opposition supports the concept of applying a standard test of criminal responsibility across similar legislation, and therefore supports the general intent of this measure. Expressed simply, it means that it will be necessary to show both the physical element of the offence and the fault element. In situations where there is a strict liability, it is not necessary to show the fault element, and the defendant has the defence of being able to show they acted under a reasonable but mistaken belief about certain facts. These are not obscure legal points, but important questions in the growing area of medical litigation. Patients have every right to expect that they get quality health care, in whatever setting they seek treatment. We have known since 1996 that the rate of medical injuries in Australia is at very high levels by international comparisons and that much needs to be done to improve the quality and safety of medical practice. It is a matter of regret that the current minister has wasted five years before taking action on these issues. He recently boasted about the newly established Council on Safety and Quality in Health Care and the National Institute on Clinical Effectiveness, but if he had not been so slow these organisations could now be celebrating their fifth birthday instead of just starting out. Labor will actively drive the health quality agenda through our proposed national health commission and we will tackle the root causes of medical injuries. I think everyone involved in this issue would prefer that Australia does not go down the American road, where every event in a hospital runs the risk of ending up in a courtroom. The TV dramas ER and The Practice are entertaining, but they demonstrate to Australians why we are much better off here than in the USA. We should focus on ensuring that medical injuries are minimised and that doctors do not live in fear of having to justify every action in a crimi-",149,Representatives Main Committee
287,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (11.33 A.m.),"The Health and Aged Care Legislation AmendmentWednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30059 nal court. This bill will set a standard that has an appropriate balance between ensuring that doctors are accountable for criminal negligence and that they have appropriate defences for actions which are taken on reasonable grounds. Labor want Australia to enjoy quality medicine and to do this we need to establish the right mechanism for accountability and to ensure there are not perverse incentives for excessively defensive medicine. In closing, I would like to mention another area where Labor has adopted groundbreaking policy that will encourage better quality medical practice and actions within the profession to reduce the frequency of adverse events. Medical indemnity insurance has been spinning out of control in recent years because the current government has been unwilling to tackle the underlying pressures which are making professional indemnity insurance unaffordable for many doctors-in particular, obstetricians and GPs in rural areas. Recently the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Jagajaga released a detailed package of reforms which is intended to restore stability to insurance premiums, increase the security for patients that they will be covered by insurance should they suffer a medical injury and make clearer to doctors what they need to do to ensure they are practising in accordance with the best current medical practices. Labor’s reform package for medical indemnity will: reduce the frequency of medical injuries by setting national benchmarks and guidelines, and promoting the use of information technologies to help doctors decide on the best treatment and avoid misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment; promote structured settlements by changing the tax treatment of periodic payments to ensure injured patients have adequate regular payments to cover their health care costs for the rest of their lives; establish a national database on health care litigation to target the problem areas and to ensure that adequate support mechanisms are in place; seek consistent state reforms to legislation covering court procedures, the calculation of damages and the regulation of medical indemnity organisations; tighten the prudential regulation of medical indemnity insurance to ensure that all funds operate soundly and have transparent accounts, while the open discretion held by some medical defence mutuals to decline coverage will be removed; require all doctors to hold the appropriate insurance for the work they undertake, while red tape will be reduced by harmonising requirements for doctor registration; improve risk management by medical indemnity funds, including working with the royal colleges to reduce the rate of medical injuries and provide incentives for quality practice; and seek to refer the current problems with indemnity insurance for midwives to the Senate inquiry into nursing to look at options to ensure that home births remain an option for expectant mothers. The bottom line is that patients must have confidence that when they seek medical treatment they will get the best quality care with minimal risk of something going wrong. They also must be confident that, if they suffer through negligence, they will be properly cared for. Labor supports the bill, which will put in place another element in the broad picture of the legal framework under which people in the health sector will work. I hope the government will make suitable arrangements to implement the changes and to educate people about the implications of the changes and the test of proof of criminal negligence as part of the necessary broader education of health professionals about the legal implications of their actions in delivering services to the Australian public. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (11.38 a.m.)-The Health and Aged Care Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 is a technical bill and it applies the Criminal Code across Commonwealth legislation in the health and aged care area. It has been occurring in other portfolio areas, and this bill harmonises health and aged care legislation with the Criminal Code. This bill amends 15 statutes in the Health and Aged Care portfolio. 30060 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 The Criminal Code, which was created by the Criminal Code Act 1995, codifies the most serious offences against Commonwealth law and establishes a cohesive set of general principles of criminal responsibility. From1 January 1997, the Criminal Code applied to all new Commonwealth offences. Now this legislation is to ensure as part of this agreement that, from 15 December 2001, the Criminal Code will apply to pre-existing Commonwealth offences. In order to meet this deadline, the Commonwealth has been reviewing the pre-existing provisions. Similar amendments, as I said, have been made to other Commonwealth legislation containing criminal offence provisions. The bill applies the Criminal Code to all offence creating and related provisions in acts within the Health and Aged Care portfolio. It makes amendments to these provisions to ensure compliance and consistency with the Criminal Code general principles. Further, the bill ensures provisions of the code are interpreted as they are intended. While a majority of offences in the Health and Aged Care portfolio will operate as they previously have, without amendment, there are some that require amendment. One of the most important amendments is the express application of strict liability to some offence creating provisions. These offences must be expressly identified and then the prosecution does not have to find fault elements. At present most strict liability criminal offences under Commonwealth law do not expressly state they are offences of strict liability and a judge decides their interpretation. This bill amends each existing strict liability offence provision to expressly state that the offence is one of strict liability. In addition, the bill amends provisions to expressly apply strict liability to individual physical elements of offences where that is appropriate. The bill will also improve the prosecution of offences by clarifying the physical elements, correcting inappropriate fault elements and by clarifying provisions relating to proof of criminal responsibility. Where there is an offence, first of all the code establishes that there is a physical element, which covers the conduct, circumstances or result under which the criminal offence occurred. There is also a fault element, which covers intention, knowledge, recklessness and negligence. Several provisions in health and aged care legislation require a defendant to bear an onus of proof where they have to prove beyond reasonable doubt. This is unnecessarily demanding and inconsistent with the Criminal Code. The bill amends the health and aged care legislation so that where an evidential burden is placed on the defendant it must be discharged on the balance of probabilities. Where a provision in the Health and Aged Care portfolio is duplicated in the Criminal Code, the bill will repeal the provision in the portfolio legislation. If relevant offences are not revised as set out in the bill, many will become more difficult for the prosecution to prove and therefore reduce the protection which was intended by parliament for the people against criminal acts within health and aged care. The bill covers key amendments: strict and absolute liability; correcting inappropriate fault elements; substituting equivalent Criminal Code fault elements; lawful authority and lawful excuse defences; better identifying defences and exceptions; clarifying physical elements in offences; and implementing the Criminal Code ancillary provisions. It also retains, within the health and aged care legislation, corporate criminal responsibility. There is one exception where it has been applied to ANZFA. It also codifies defences such as reasonable excuse or inability to comply with the statutory requirement. Ancillary offences have been moved from the Crimes Act to the Criminal Code. False and misleading statements are removed from the health and aged care legislation, and part 7.4 of the Criminal Code applies instead. This bill raises a number of issues. The bill overall is a technical application of the Criminal Code to health and aged care legislation. There are some questions that have been raised. Wednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30061 For example, why are there some penalties in dollar values and not penalty units? Dollar values do not keep their value over time. For example, with the Health Insurance Act, you have in one section 19CC one penalty unit for an offence and a penalty against subsection 19D(2) of $100. There are some inconsistencies within the act. Some penalties are less than one penalty unit. In the area of strict liability, another question that has been raised is why ‘failing’ or ‘refusing’ are included in strict liability offences. ‘Refusing’ implies that there is some fault, which is not necessary to prove with a strict liability offence. When the legislation covering Prime Minister and Cabinet was debated, refusal was deleted as it was inconsistent with strict liability. That having been said, this is a technical bill that applies the Criminal Code to health and aged care legislation. It is hard to see what immediate implications there will be from this bill. It is more just harmonising the bill across all Commonwealth portfolios. Ms ELLIS (Canberra) (11.45 a.m.)-I value the opportunity today to briefly contribute to this debate on the Health and Aged Care Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, which, as we have heard from previous speakers, covers a very broad range of subjects within the health and aged care legislation and brings into conformity many aspects of that legislation. It is also fair to say that the subject of aged care generally is a big and growing concern among many in my community and among others elsewhere in Australia. Governments have a vital role to play in ensuring appropriate levels of care for older folk who require special care in a particular facility or within their own homes. No matter who is in government, the role of the Commonwealth government is integral to that service provision. Canberra has a statistically smaller percentage of older folk than the national average, given the nature of the ACT and its history. Nevertheless, the numbers are increasing and, proportionally, the demands on services and the demands on systems are growing. It has been sad in recent times to see residents requiring what we now term psychogeriatric services, for want of a better term. People who have pretty severe dementia and Alzheimer’s disease reach a point where they need very special care. Unfortunately, at the moment in Canberra we do not have that facility. I am very anxious to see that we do something about that, given the level of stress and distress that is caused to the individual and to the families involved in situations like that. I have heard-and I give credit to the ACT government in this instance-that a small number of beds may be opening very shortly which will begin to address the psychogeriatric problem in Canberra. If that is the case, as I am led to believe it might be, I welcome that initiative, especially given the enormous social and family problems that face some of these folk. However, it would be nice if we did not have to have a crisis before we had a result-and I do not think I am being unfair in saying that. I hope we can track it a bit better in the future. The same could be applied to the area of respite care. Everything I am saying probably impacts on every member of the House who shares my concerns on behalf of their communities. Respite care is a very severe problem in many communities. We have a wonderful respite care facility in my electorate which performs a terrific service. That facility is so good that it is usually booked out 12 months or more in advance. That facility is booked out by families whose older folk are being cared for at home. The families are in a position of having to plan holidays or medical needs or whatever in advance. They can therefore appropriately lodge their needs for respite care, but if there is an urgent need for respite care-and that could be because of illness of the carer, a crisis for the person requiring the respite care, or another family emergency of some kind-it is really needed right there and then. I do not necessarily have the answer to this problem, but it is something that we need to consider very carefully. 30062 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 When that sort of emergency occurs, it is more than distressing to the family to know that they cannot get assistance when they require it. I would like to think that, no matter who is in government and no matter who is in charge of or debating the issues relating to aged care, we can somehow highlight-and I am taking the advantage of doing that here this morning-this very important social need within our communities. We should not have a pot luck sort of attitude to this that you happen to get the help if you are lucky. I know that the families that have come to me in my electorate in recent times have not felt lucky at all. They are not critical in a political sense; they are just critical of a system that does not seem able to respond to their need when they have it. We have actually had distressing photos on the front page of the local paper of old people being shipped interstate, to Goulburn and elsewhere, because they have not been able to receive the service they need here. I think that any one of us would not like to see that happening within any of our communities, and we probably all have at different times seen it happen. I just think we need to take the time to highlight that and to do what we can collectively to try and address it. The other very brief point I want to make is in relation to people awaiting access to a permanent place, be it low level or high level, within aged facilities. Some of them are in hospitals. Some of them are at home. Many of those who are in hospitals may be fortunate enough to go on to rehab services and return to their homes but some of them may not. Some of them are actually sitting there awaiting the allocation of a place with their family waiting with them. While we have stresses within our hospital systems, I do not think it is helpful, on that level of the debate, to have those places occupied in this way. I think more importantly the care that that older person requires should not be serviced by sitting in a ward bed in a hospital when they really need that very careful, nurturing love and care that these facilities are able to provide for them. I think we need to have a very clear picture and a very honest look at where the pressures and the priorities are and attempt as much as we can collectively to address them in the best way that we can. The last thing that I would want to do would be to play with this in some political fashion. That is not my intent. My intent is to try and have an honest discussion about where the requirements are, where those pressures are, where people in our communities need that sort of help and how we, as a federal parliament, can assist in that. I would doubt very much that anyone in the parliament would disagree with the sentiments that I am expressing here today. In concluding my brief remarks, I would just say that the overwhelming majority of those people who are out there working in the aged care sector-and some of the ramifications of this bill will come across them in different ways-approach their work in an incredibly honest fashion. They dedicate themselves to the task at hand. They are in a sector that I believe professionally for them is undervalued in comparison to other nursing or care sectors. Yet when any one of us Australians is surveyed to give a view as to how we believe we ought to treat the older people in our communities we say we would not wish in any sense at all to have them in a sector which is serviced in an undervalued way. I think that the other part of this debate is for us to somehow build into our systems a way of financially and socially gearing those services and the people within them to meet on an equal level the expectations that we all have in terms of the care of our older people. If we could gain nothing else but that within the federal parliamentary system I think we would be doing an extremely good service, let alone the other things I have talked about this morning which are far more monetarily geared than in the sense of the workers within the aged care sector to which I have to pay absolute due homage. I am now in a position of personally experiencing this sector and I can say, without any equivocation whatsoever, that I have not met one person in this sector who is not dedicated to Wednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30063 it, cares about it passionately and really would like, I believe, to provide the absolute highest level of care and the highest level of dedication and who sometimes resource-wise by government or by institution may be frustrated in doing so. I would like to believe that through the federal parliamentary system we take every opportunity to highlight this particular area of our community, to talk about it in a very honest way and to do what we can to elevate the priority we put on it, the honesty we apply to it and the level to which we value those who are working within the system generally. Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 is a very small bill, but it does contain some interesting aspects. It shifts the responsibility for false and misleading statements into the area of the Criminal Code and other parts of the law. What is interesting in this bill is that people applying to the government or the minister for funds can now be seen to be in breach of the code if they make false or misleading statements. On the other hand, if the minister makes remarks about the people applying which are false and misleading, the minister will be applauded by the government. There seem to be two sides to justice here. The example I want to refer to is St Catherine’s of Siena at Waratah, which is a nursing home run by Catholic Care of the Aged. It is an excellent facility but has announced that it has been forced to close. The minister, in response to questioning from the Newcastle media, said that it was due to bad management, that it is all their fault. If you look at the organisation and its figures, the actual operating costs have come down in the last year but then, of course, so did the grant. The Commonwealth subsidy was reduced by $150,000 between last year and this year. The minister says that the government have actually given the nursing home more money when, in fact, they have given them less money. The minister then says that the government gave this nursing home some money for extensions in 1997. The government might have paid the bill, but the money was not given by this minister. The money was given by the previous government back in 1995 from a capital grants program, which was wiped out in 1996. But because the commitment was made, the government was forced to pay it. The constant use of false and misleading information by this Minister for Aged Care is criminal. I would have thought it would be nice to have the code apply both ways. If St Catherine’s were to apply and put false information in their application, they would be charged with an offence, yet the minister publicly and constantly makes false and misleading statements about the organisation and its funding and gets applauded by her backbench. People need to understand that back in 1996 this government did a series of things which it now wants to forget about. It cut huge amounts of money from a number of different programs. The government cut $500 million from the residential aged care program-half a billion dollars was chopped out of that program over the following four years. The government then starts quoting figures about how much it spent, but it is always after that time. The government does not want to make the link between the years. The wiping out of the capital grants program for nursing homes has been an absolute disaster. The complete change in funding for nursing homes has been a disaster. We are seeing nursing homes now falling over and collapsing, not through bad management but because the government has totally changed the system to a model that does not work anymore; it is not a workable model. The $12 a day for capital replacement is non-viable; it does not work. The minister is blaming the victim. This is an incredible government for blaming the victim. If anything goes wrong, it is the victim’s fault; it is the fault of the person complaining or suffering. We hear that almost daily. We are hearing it now about the doctors as well. It is quite fascinating to hear the Minister for Health and Aged Care blaming the doctors for the medical",150,Representatives Main Committee
288,Mr Allan Morris (Newcastle) (11.55 A.m.),"The Health and Aged Care Legislation30064 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 problems. For years we listened to him blaming us in government for the medical problems which doctors face; now he is blaming the victim. The government cut half a billion dollars from the nursing home budget and then spent it. The government did not put the money away and save it; the government spent it. The $12 billion in tax cuts last year did not come from the GST; they came from health, aged care, and home and community care. In 1996, $18 million was cut from HACC. This program, which we desperately needed to expand, was actually reduced. They spent all the money from the dental care program and all the other programs that were cut in 1996. It is not as if we can find the money and then restore the program or as if the government can say, ‘We made a mistake,’ and then correct that. We cannot do that because the money has been spent. It was spent on tax cuts, half of which went to the top 20 per cent of income earners. The tax cuts were so biased towards the wealthy, yet it was the poor who were paying. Those who suffered from those cuts were predominantly people on low incomes, people with difficulties, people in nursing homes, people seeking health care, people seeking home and community care, and people seeking education. The cuts were targeted to one group and the benefits went to the other group. So the people who benefited were not the people who were hurt the most by the cuts. Then this government wants to boast about the money that is spent on aged care. I understand the problems of the government backbench, and I do not doubt that privately many of them have the same anxieties and the same concerns that I have when watching this system now spiralling towards collapse. This is not because of the organisations. Catholic Care of the Aged and St Catherine’s in Newcastle are managed by Mr Ralph Watson. Ralph Watson has been an impeccable operator. He has worked in health care and aged care for 15 to 20 years. His record is unmatched as a decent, competent and capable citizen. He has now been accused of being incompetent and his nursing home has closed. That is an absolute slur on his reputation and on his ability. The poor man has said, ‘Come and look at my figures.’ The subsidy has gone down and there were changes to the assessment scale back in 1997. The government said that we have to take into account dementia and behavioural problems in nursing homes because it has now become a major problem. So, rather than creating a new category for those, they just took over the old category. St Catherine’s in particular suffered because suddenly behavioural problems became a key part of the assessment process to receive maximum funding. They could not take people with behavioural problems. Most of their people are bedridden but do not have behavioural problems. So they get less support than if they had behavioural problems. The change to the classification scale in 1997 cost them $200,000 a year. Bang! Chop! The minister said, ‘You can afford to do it for $200,000 a year less.’ What a nonsense! We all understand that what has been happening with medicine has been wonderful and what has been happening with medical care has been great because people are living longer. This has meant that nursing homes have residents who are more dependent for longer periods. People are not dying as early as they used to in nursing homes. But there is a cost to this. Nursing home costs are going up. The government says, ‘You do not need to have nurses anymore,’ so we now have nursing homes where for parts of the day they do not have any nurses. Why? Because the only way they can cope is by cutting down the staffing costs and by getting rid of professional staff. There is going to be a scandal one day. I do not doubt it will be very long until somebody dies when the person on duty was not a nurse and where the care they got was not adequate. There will be a major scandal. The government will say, ‘It’s all their own fault; they did that.’ Of course they did not do it. The government is actually forcing deskilling in nursing homes. It is forcing them to lower their standards. Every day the minister boasts about its standards, but the same minister Wednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30065 changed the laws and the rules that required nursing homes to have nurses on duty 24 hours a day. That used to be a fundamental requirement of a nursing home. What is a nursing home without a nurse? I wonder what that is called. It is not a nursing home if there are no nurses there. Not to have professional staff on duty 24 hours a day is not just unreasonable, it is dangerous. Then we have this bill talking about harmonising false and misleading statements-not by the minister but by everybody else-in the Criminal Code. I do not doubt that within the next few months we will see some more nursing homes fail. I have talked to some around the countryside. I once chaired a parliamentary inquiry into home and community care. I do have a lot of contacts in the field, and the feedback I am getting is that it is disastrous. These are not people lobbying or pleading a political issue; these are people asking what on earth they should do. They say, ‘Nobody is listening to us. The minister tells us it is our fault and we do not know where to turn.’ There is a problem now with corporate law-if they trade when they might be insolvent, it is dangerous. Charities cannot raise money anymore, because people are not giving in the same way. So we are seeing organisations relying on chook raffles to maintain their nursing homes, being forced to deskill their organisations by not having professional staff on duty because that is the only way they can save money, and being faced with the decision to keep going or close. I guarantee that more nursing homes will announce their closure before the next election. I also guarantee that the minister will blame them. The government will blame everybody else and say, ‘We’ve got a wonderful system. We all think that. It’s just tough if no-one else agrees with it.’ The arrogance of that position is unbelievable. The government and the minister changed the system. They did not consult the industry. They did not ask people what the best thing was. They did not have an inquiry and work out a better model. Those changes came out of thin air. Someone in the Department of Finance and Administration said, ‘You can save a bucket of money here. Here is half a billion dollars, Treasurer; chop half a billion dollars out of nursing homes-they are all overprovided for.’ And they did. In 1996, Finance had a field day. The government fell for it like you would not believe and the backbench went along with it. Those chickens are coming home to roost. The cuts made by Finance officers who did not know what they were talking about, who did not know the industry, who did not know the organisations, are now coming back to haunt them. It has been five years and the wind-down has been continual. Every year it has gotten worse and worse. Before the year is out, before the election comes, nursing homes will be announcing that they can no longer survive. I am appealing to the government backbench, because I know that in every government member’s electorate there are nursing homes in difficulty. At least one nursing home in each electorate is facing real problems. We either take the minister’s point of view and blame the nursing homes or we try and find an answer. We need an answer. We need to solve the problem, not blame the victim. The tragedy was that those Finance cuts were savage. The dental care program, the HACC program, the aged care residential program and the state health programs were all cut. You may think it was for the good of the country, but it was not. All those programs and a bit more went when the tax cuts were introduced last year to pay for the GST. The GST did not pay for those tax cuts; they were paid for by the poor people in this country who need services. The suffering that those people have gone through and are still going through will stay until such time as someone recognises what the real issue is. 30066 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 This is one of the last chances I will have in this place to speak about aged care and nursing homes. I am sorry that I am coming to this particular debate so angry, but I am at my wit’s end. I know of six or seven people in a nursing home which they love-in many cases that nursing home has been their home for many years-who are being forced to leave. There is nowhere for them to go. Their families are distraught. They are distraught. I have not got an answer. The minister says that it is their own fault. I say, ‘Minister, it is not their fault. They did not change the rules.’ The minister changed the rules. The minister changed the funding. Unless somebody in the government faces up to the problem, we are going to have people all over this country in the same boat as the people at St Catherine’s. I implore the government backbenchers to make this minister face reality, because eventually she is going to have to. speak. However, as you allowed the previous speaker to range very widely outside the terms of reference of the Health and Aged Care Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, which is about the Criminal Code, and to use the opportunity to denigrate the government and its health and aged care programs, I will take the opportunity to speak. I will just make a few comments. This government has spent more on aged care than any other Australian government. The previous speaker talked about St Catherine’s, capital costs and so on. When this government came to power it found that the Labor Party had reduced capital spending on nursing homes by 75 per cent over the previous four years. Why would the member for Newcastle come in here today, talk about St Catherine’s and cry crocodile tears? He also talked about health care and dental care. Dental care is very interesting. Mr Horne interjectinghere at the time, that for 96 years of Australia’s 100 years, dental health has been the responsibility of the states. The Keating government-and it was quite clear on this-introduced a four-year catch up program for the states. It was cobbled together in the dying stages-I may stand corrected-of 1992 in the lead-up to the 1993 election. It was made very clear to the states what it was for. It was to be a catch-up program. When we came to office that program had not been completed, and we completed it. It is hypocrisy to say that we terminated dental care, because in your own forward estimates you had made no provision to continue it for another four years. And you perpetuate this untruth in every forum by saying that this dreadful coalition government cut out dental health. That is untrue, and it was never your intention when in government to continue it for any more than four years. When it comes to nursing homes, I make a big thing about nursing homes. I visit them regularly and I am familiar with the improvements to nursing homes. It is interesting that, if it is so difficult to run nursing homes and they cannot be made to meet their costs, how is it that when there is a new allocation of beds in both regions covered by my electorate there are any number of existing and new bidders who want to take up those 20 or 40 places or whatever the number might be? In fact, there is quite intense competition for them. SoI just find that view about difficulties a little bit hard to take. Nor did we do anything unjust when we altered the scales from seven to eight. All it did was distribute the load over eight categories instead of over seven. So obviously some would come down a bit and some would go up a bit, depending on where you slotted in. We introduced the system of the ACAP team assessing people to make sure they fitted into the right categories. I do not have the figures here at my fingertips, but for a level 1 patient, the government’s contribution is over $30,000 a year, and levels 2, 3 and 4 are also quite generous.",155,Representatives Main Committee

290,Mr Neville,"The honourable member opposite would know very well, because he wasWednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30067 Nursing homes that are well run not only operate well but some of the commercial ones make a profit. I know that a number of nursing homes in Australia. I am not familiar with the full circumstances of St Catherine’s-and some of them are big old two-storey buildings, have had a lot of difficulty in converting to units that can be modernised and made to work effectively for old people. That is part of the problem. It is not so much the amount of funding from the government but rather that some nursing homes have difficulty with their capital costs. The previous government did leave nursing home care in a parlous state. When we came to office we found also that the previous government left us 10,000 places short on their own benchmarks. They went out of office 10,000 nursing home places short of what they benchmarked for themselves. That is a huge catch-up for any government to make in five years, but we have made a real effort to do it. The member for Newcastle complained about the difficulty in getting nurses. That is interesting. I am a Queenslander and I take a lot of interest, as I said, in nursing home care. For many years the Keating and Hawke governments perpetuated a program that saw nursing homes receive less funding in Queensland, and to a lesser extent in South Australia, than the other states-appallingly so. I did some rough figures one day and I saw that there would be a difference of up to half a million dollars a year for some nursing homes because the daily rates were paid differently for each state, and Queensland in particular-and to a lesser extent South Australia-received less. So we introduced a system of coalescence where over seven years, without reducing the level of funding to states like Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, the other states were brought up-and I might again stand corrected, I am not speaking from notes-but we are about four years into that seven-year process which will deliver greater equity to those states. Of course, in delivering equity you allow the homes a better opportunity to be able to fund the nursing component of the care of aged people. Regions need to have strategic plans for aged care in place. I have two ACCs in my electorate. The Central Queensland ACC, in the northern part of my electorate, in looking at employment generally, very generously funded a scheme to look at aged care needs in the northern part of my electorate. The scheme cost over $50,000 but it gave us great data that resulted in Gladstone getting 40 nursing home beds within 12 months. ACC, which is in the southern end of my electorate, and we are now going to have a $120,000 program, covering parts of the Wide Bay and Hinkler electorates, to enable us to strategically place high care and low care beds. The member for Newcastle had a few free hits at the government, most of them quite unjustified. It is true that we cut back in a number of departments in the year we came to office. There is no secret about that. You all know the reason: when we came to office we found a $10.3 billion black hole-that fact has never been contested-which had to be addressed by all departments. Had we continued, year after year, to do what the member for Newcastle said, he would have some grounds for criticism. But from the 1995-96 financial year through to the 2001-02 financial year, our funding of residential aged care increased from $2.5 billion to $4.2 billion. That far exceeds any increase by any Labor government. You might argue that needs have increased-of course they have-but that increase is well ahead of inflation and well ahead of the ageing of the population. We had to bring in tougher rules for nursing homes because, as I said, when we came to power 13 per cent of nursing homes did not meet relevant fire standards, 11 per cent did not",158,Representatives Main Committee

I then approached the Wide Bay30068 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 meet health authority standards and 70 per cent did not meet outcomes standards. In 51 per cent of nursing homes people were in wards of three or more beds. That was not quality of care, and that was the other thing we had to address. We set up new standards, as you know. At the last count I saw, 137 nursing homes have been closed or relocated. That shows a fair amount of commitment. Those homes are subject to spot checking. There has been a difficult situation with a home in my electorate, and I know just how well the department supervises these things. Yet when Labor was in power only one, I think, was ever closed. A lot of the problems that we are encountering are because there were no standards in place. It is like maintenance of property: if you do not keep your maintenance standards up over a period of time on anything-whether it is a public building or facility or a theatrethere comes a point when you have a huge bill and have to scrap everything and totally renovate. In nursing homes that maintenance was not happening because they were totally and utterly neglected during the term of the previous government. I found the presentation of the member for Newcastle to be a little bit self-serving. I understand his concern about St Catherine’s. As I said, I am not fully aware of the circumstances, but I suspect that it is one of those older homes that need major renovation from the ground up or perhaps it needs relocation. It is also interesting to know that, in the two years to June 2000, $1.4 billion throughout Australia was committed by the industry to capital works. In other words, there has been a commitment-because of the new standards we set-to building better and more acceptable aged care facilities. Twelve per cent of all aged care homes in Australia have been either newly built or rebuilt. Considering that we had a year to do the assessment, a year to find out that the previous government had fallen 10,000 places short of its own targets, we have virtually had only about 4½ years to get where we are now. I think we have done a pretty good job. many of these things would really zing along. I apologise for intruding into the debate, but I found that the member for Newcastle misused this debate and I felt that some of the matters that he raised were worthy of rebuttal. the specifics of the debate on the Health and Aged Care Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, but having listened to the member for HinklerI think I have a certain licence to range wide and far. I would like to point out that, with the closure of St Catherine of Siena and St Joseph’s at Lochinvar, two of the Catholic Care of the Aged facilities in the Hunter region, we lose 88 high care beds. Last year the Hunter region was allocated a total of two high care beds. stage, 88 have the potential to disappear and we had only two allocated last year for the whole of the Hunter region. So, as they close, even if they are transferable, it will require the building of a facility to house the beds to accommodate the people. I may be a cynic, but when a debate on health and aged care is relegated to the Main Committee I wonder what the government has to hide, and where its priorities are. For the Labor Party, health and aged care are right on top. We are a party with a proud tradition of extending health services to all Australians, first through Medibank and then through Medicare. We were the party, when in government, that introduced quality, affordable aged care.",159,Representatives Main Committee

All we know is that, at thisWednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30069 Just to refer to comments made by the member for Hinkler, all I can do is talk about experiences in my own electorate. When I think of my first term as member for Paterson, between 1993 and 1996 I certainly remember Mount Carmel nursing home being opened in Maitland, the Tanilba Bay facility-a 40-bed hostel-being opened and the expansion of Harbourside Haven. These were all brand-new facilities. I remember the Dungog nursing home being opened; it was 20 beds nursing home and 20 beds hostel. I must be quite specific there. These are the sorts of things that I remember in a three-year period. In the five years since we lost government, I am not aware of a single facility opening. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs De-Anne Kelly)-Order! I feel I must correct something the member for Paterson has said. I apologise for interrupting your address. Earlier you said that it was a decision for the government to refer bills to the Main Committee. It is a consultation between the opposition and government, and always a matter for both. My apologies for the interruption, but I felt it was important to clarify the point. Minister and Ministers Wooldridge and Bishop, no-one can deny the disastrous state of affairs in health services in Australia today. I do not mind what sector of the health service the government wants to refer to, it is in crisis. Let us start with public hospitals. Despite the Prime Minister’s rhetoric in question time this week, waiting lists have blown out. Services have diminished and nurses have fled a system where their labour has been exploited. They have been used to prop up a failing system that is struggling for funds. The Prime Minister may be correct in saying that more money is being devoted to health, but what he conveniently omits is that the cost of services in the health industry has escalated at a greater rate than the increase in funding. In other words, services have contracted. In areas I represent, whole communities-and some of them are quite large, being in excess of 10,000 people-do not have access to publicly funded hospital beds, which is something that we on this side of the House would consider a basic right of all Australians. That access is denied to tens of thousands of residents in the Paterson electorate. What magnifies the problem for my constituents is that many of them are retirees with the relatively greater need for access to health services, yet these are the very sorts of communities that are denied even basic services. I talk about communities such as Tomaree, which includes a whole host of smaller communities like Nelson Bay, Shoal Bay, Salamander Bay, Fingal Bay, Corlette, Anna Bay, in excess of 20,000 people. There is no public hospital. There is a clinic where you can be stabilised and prepared for transfer to Newcastle 30-odd kilometres away. I talk about communities like Foster and Tuncurry with another 14,000 people. They have a private hospital but no public beds. Those people have to go to Manning Base Hospital 25 kilometres away and with very limited transport connections. The irony is that because of its growth the Foster-Tuncurry area will be bigger than Taree in less than a decade. Yet it is the Howard government that is hell-bent on expanding the private health sector at the expense of the public sector. We have already mentioned aged care. The member for Newcastle elaborated over a crisis that is eventuating in the Hunter region over high care beds. Again, let us talk about a convenience that this government uses of confusing the issue between high care and low care beds. High care beds, obviously, are at an enormous shortage in our area. I refer to one of my constituents whose case I highlighted in the media only a few weeks ago. Mr Carmody, a multiple stroke victim, waited in the Mater Hospital for 20 weeks. We heard the minister in question time yesterday talk about stabilising people and trying to get people to see whether they could go back home. This man waited 20 weeks in a hospital bed and we wonder why",160,Representatives Main Committee
298,Mr Horne,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Despite the posturing by the Prime30070 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 there are waiting lists in public hospitals. One of the reasons is that thousands of people are waiting for access to aged care facilities and they are taking up bed spaces in hospitals. We also know of bed licences that were allocated two years ago but have not been put in place at this stage. I just wonder where these bed licences count. Do they count as bed places? They are not there yet; they were allocated but they have not been built. This is in areas that are growing rapidly. It is a retirement area; the demand is greater. That was certainly shown in the report that was sent to members that was recalled. I used the information to show that the demand in Paterson for aged care was far greater than the average yet the provision of facilities was far less. Let us move on to bulk-billing. Again, I have communities that cannot access a medical practice that bulk-bills. For pensioners this is tragic. If they have to go to a medical practice that does not bulk-bill it means they are confronted with an upfront charge and they then have to apply for a Medicare rebate. But they live in communities where there is no Medicare office. Communities like Tomaree and Foster and Tuncurry do not have Medicare offices. Of course, people can go to the easy care claim, or whatever you call it, at the local pharmacy where they have to wait for up to 20 working days to get a rebate of their upfront cost from Medicare. To a pensioner, that is money out of their pocket for the 20 days that they have to wait. We need a far better system. The immediate rebate of upfront costs has to be a priority, particularly for pensioners. Concerning doctors: I have communities like Medowie which has 8,000 people and one and one-third general practitioners. It is a rapidly growing community with lots of young families. Why can that community not get doctors? Again, we could go to the RRMA classification because next door to Medowie are two very similar communities-Tanilba Bay and Lemon Tree Passage-with similar numbers of people. The point is that Lemon Tree Passage and Tanilba Bay are classified as rural and they have four medical practices, two of them with two practitioners. So we can see that communities that are very similar but have different classifications are certainly treated very differently. Hawks Nest and Tea Gardens are fairly well known because the Prime Minister used to go there for his holidays. I hope he did not get sick when he got there, because the only general practitioner in Hawks Nest is a formerly retired doctor. He retired to Hawks Nest and decided, when he got there, that the need was so great that he would take up practice again. Actually, we had two of them, but a month ago Dr Everett decided that he would call it a day. We have a community like Karuah, situated right on the Pacific Highway, with one part-time doctor who is not very well and practises only part time. There is a pharmacy in Karuah associated with that practice. If that doctor simply withdraws his services, that community will also lose its pharmacy because anyone who has to go into Raymond Terrace or beyond to access medical services will obviously get their prescription made up there. So the whole health service in that community is under threat. Look at a town like Bulahdelah. Bulahdelah has a hospital, a 60-bed nursing home and one doctor. Before Christmas last year, that doctor had a major heart attack and had to have a stent put into his aorta. He now works for only half a day each day. Yet this town is situated right on the very busiest section of the Pacific Highway. Bulahdelah is fairly well known for quite horrific and fatal accidents and the demands for a doctor are great. Yet there is only one doctor-that is quite tragic. If the Howard government wants to rest on its laurels over the way it treats health, so be it. If the Prime Minister wants to jump up at question time and posture about expenditure on health and aged care, obviously that is his prerogative. I represent a regional and rural electorate. People out there know the truth: they are being denied access to the sorts of health servWednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30071 ices that they used to have, and they want to know why. As we approach the election, I am sure they will be asking: why have health services, in whatever category, been reduced, restricted and cut back? We all know they certainly have been. tended to say a few words of thanks to the people who contributed to the work on the Criminal Code and the harmonisation of offence creating and related provisions in health and aged care, but, in light of the speech I have just heard, I will preface those thanks with a few other remarks. I understand that the member for Newcastle, as well as the member for Paterson, made some remarks concerning St Catherine’s of Siena, which is in the Hunter region, and St Joseph’s at Lochinvar. St Catherine’s of Sienna is one of 10 homes which are managed by Catholic Care of the Aged in the Hunter region. They have received for the management of those homes some 82 per cent increase in funding as a group since this government came to office. The expenditure in 1995-96 was something in the vicinity of $4 million and the income that those homes only have received in this last financial year was in excess of $7 million. I make this point because there has been a business decision by Catholic Care of the Aged, which manage those homes on behalf of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maitland and Newcastle, to close St Catherine’s. It is housed in an old heritage building, which has three floors. They have made a business decision that they wish to close that facility. It has 67 beds and they will not be lost to the region. They will stay in the Hunter region and I understand that Catholic Care of the Aged, although they have not made a final decision, will probably want to redistribute those beds around the other homes that they already operate. With regard to St Joseph’s at Lochinvar, this is a home owned by the Sisters of St Joseph and they have also had Catholic Care of the Aged manage that home for them at Lochinvar. They are intending to move those new beds to Swansea, still within the region, where they believe they will have a better operational group once those beds are transferred there. They will also be able to bring on in a quite speedy manner 10 new beds that were allocated to them fairly recently. That is a good outcome for that. They are also in discussions about changing the group that manages their home for them from Catholic Care of the Aged to another group. I understand that has not been finalised, only discussions are occurring. In the Hunter region, between 1 November 1998 and 31 December 2001, 461 new beds will become fully operational. It will include five brand new aged care homes and seven which have had large and considerable extensions. They are five new homes, seven extended homes and 461 brand new operational beds, which will come into effect in the Hunter region. Among those will be a very significant facility called the Warabrook Centre for Aged Care, which is operated by Baptist Community Services. This is the first teaching aged care home in the country. It is about absolute excellence in every way. I add that Baptist Community Services were the winners of my award for excellence in development of staff for the delivery of aged care services. In replying to those remarks of the member for Paterson, allocation of places is made in accordance with aged care planning regions, not electorates or postcodes or any other definition. They are done in accordance with aged care planning regions of which the Hunter region covers, as its name would suggest, the Hunter. He also mentioned the need for high care and I would say that, in those lists of places-and they are all beds in homes that are being opened-a number of them are high care places. In addition to that, we also have now Ageing in Place and that means that as people move from low care to having high care needs-what we used to call nursing home need-those people can remain in that place so long as the management brings in the right staff mix, in-",161,Representatives Main Committee
299,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar,"Minister for Aged Care) (12.34 p.m.)-I had in30072 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 cluding registered nurses as required under the act to ensure that proper care is given. I think Mr Morris said there were no requirements to have nurses in nursing homes. First, they are all called aged care homes now because we have united hostels and nursing homes and 85 per cent of all our homes have a mixture of high and low care. Second, the act specifies when registered nurses must be present and so his statement is quite wrong. It was also mentioned that the John Hunter Hospital had people who were waiting in hospital beds simply to be moved out into aged care beds. I would point out the very important fact that older Australians have the right to go to hospital just as much as anybody else. Because older people will often have a multiple number of co-morbidities and will have complex needs, their need to remain in hospital will very often be much longer than the 5.6 days that state hospitals like to keep people over the age of 70, or 3.6 days if you are under the age of 70. It may well be that the gentleman whom the member for Paterson cited as being in hospital for 20 weeks required to be there. He may have needed rehabilitation or he may have needed a whole range of services which are actually provided for in the health agreements with the states. Those health agreements provide money from the Commonwealth-the $6 billion that we provide, which is 43 per cent of all their funding. They are obliged to provide proper rehabilitation and discharge policies, and yet if you look at the statistics, as published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, you will see that it is only a minute percentage of patients who are receiving that required rehabilitation treatment. That is why I have put on the table my proposal for having some transitional arrangements for people going from hospital to home or to their correct level of care if it is in a residential setting, but the states must pay for the rehabilitation treatment that they are entitled to have. I might say in the Hunter, at the John Hunter Hospital, we indeed have in situ in that hospital a transitional unit where people who are chosen as suitable are given rehabilitation to get them to go home, or at least to a level of care that would be less than they otherwise would have been seeking, and that again is conducted by Baptist Community Services. It is a pilot program and is already up and working, but there is a most worrying attitude from hospitals to older people: they just want to get them out. They will mark their files ‘acopia’, cannot cope at home. I said yesterday there were 2,056 people who were identified across all Australian hospitals, and I might say that all public hospitals right across Australia have been reducing the number of beds they have. Indeed, in the last 12 months right across Australia, state and territory governments have reduced the number of beds in public hospitals by a further thousand. So we have gone from something like 77,000 beds in the mid-1980s or, say, 1987 across Australia in public hospitals down to 52,000. They have been closing them at the most disgraceful rate, and I am appalled to say that last year New South Wales underspent its health budget. Can you believe that? It underspent its health budget. Quite clearly, there is a need to be looking at, from my point of view, whether older Australians are getting correct treatment and the respect and proper attention that they deserve. I have established a committee, headed by Dr Michael Murray from St Vincent’s in Melbourne, of consumers, including, for instance, the president of the Council on the Ageing, which is looking at this question and at the horrendous stories of the way that older people are treated in hospital and thrown out of hospital. They have pressure put upon them. They are discharged in the middle of the night, with no underwear on, just one of those dreadful nighties tied up at the neck, without proper contact with GPs, families, carers or anything. There are horrendous stories and they have got to stop. We fund these hospitals to carry out proper disWednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30073 charge policies and it is not being done. So we have to have the data. We have to look at these things so that something can be done about it. Looking at the question of aged care means looking at so many aspects of the way in which older people are cared for. I said that whereas in public hospitals state governments have been shutting hospital beds at a rate of 23 per cent over the last dozen years, in the same period in aged care we have opened an additional 24 per cent of beds. The statistics are these: we have 3,000 aged care homes in Australia; we have 143,000 beds in those homes, in which we have a 96 per cent average occupancy. On the other hand, there are now only 748 public hospitals in Australia, with 52,000 beds. The really interesting statistic is that in the last 12 months the number of patients treated in public hospitals-there were 3.8 million episodes-increased by only 0.3 per cent. In other words, in a year they only took another 12,000 patients, whereas private hospitals, because of our reforms to private health insurance, had an eight per cent increase, treating an additional 150,000 patients. I think that says something about whether or not the states are meeting their obligations. I would like to sum up debate on the bill, on behalf of Dr Wooldridge, and say that the Health and Aged Care Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 advances the government’s program to harmonise offence creating and related provisions in Commonwealth legislation with the Criminal Code. The Criminal Code will codify the most serious offences against Commonwealth law and establish a cohesive set of general principles of criminal responsibility. This harmonisation of offence creating and related offences in health and aged care legislation with the Criminal Code is an important step in the government’s program of legislative reform that will achieve greater consistency with Commonwealth criminal law. I thank the honourable members for their contribution to this debate and their support for this bill. I commend the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

300,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (12.48 P.m.),"These two bills introduce amendments to30074 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 The No. 3 Bill amends the Corporations Act, the Insurance Contracts Act and the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Act to reflect the application of the Criminal Code to existing offence provisions in those acts. It also amends the Treasury Legislation (Application of Criminal Code) Act (No. 1) 2001 to remove a non Criminal Code definition of recklessness that was inserted into the Insurance Act, the Life Insurance Act, the Retirement Savings Accounts Act and the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act by that act. The Financial Sector Shareholdings Act is also amended to remove a non Criminal Code definition of recklessness. These bills do not seek to change the current law but rather seek to ensure that the current law is maintained following application of the Criminal Code to the legislation. If offences in the legislation are not harmonised with the Criminal Code by 15 December the Criminal Code will operate to apply default mental elements to all physical elements of an offence that do not otherwise contain a mental element. We have not had any submissions concerning either of these bills. We assume that they are not controversial. They are essentially technical amendments in nature. They arise from the requirement to recognise the application of the code, specify whether an offence is one of absolute liability, that is to say an offence for which intent does not need to be proved, or strict liability, that is to say an offence for which intent does not need to be proved but a defence of an honest and reasonable mistake of fact will be available. The amendments also clarify the physical elements of the offences and the corresponding fault elements, especially where those fault elements vary from those specified by the Criminal Code. The amendments also separate defences from offences and identify the evidential burden in relation to a defence, replace references to provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 with references to corresponding provisions in the code and convert penalties in dollar amounts into penalty units. Under the Criminal Code, all strict or absolute liability offences must be specifically identified as such. Without specific amendments, all offences that currently apply a strict liability or absolute liability will attract the default mental elements in the Criminal Code and would cease to apply strictly or absolutely. In relation to the Corporations Law, which is amended by the No. 3 bill, Treasury has advised us that, in general, offences attracting a penalty of less than six months imprisonment or 25 penalty units and offences of omission attracting a penalty of less than 12 months imprisonment or 50 penalty units have been made strict liability offences. Accordingly, the types of offences which attract strict liability include the lodgement of certain documents with ASIC, the obtaining of consents to act as a director or landlord, consents if a leased premise is the registered company office, complying with directions from ASIC, the maintenance of company registers and financial records, the giving of certain notices to shareholders and allowing a reasonable opportunity for questions at an annual general meeting. The types of provisions which attract absolute liability include where it is necessary merely to prove that a fact occurred-for example, that a company incurred a debt. According to the explanatory memorandum, these bills have no financial implications and the opposition supports them. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (12.52 p.m.)-At first glance, the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 2) 2001 and the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 3) 2001 might not excite the attention of the followers of parliamentary debates. In fact, it is going to be hard not to make this sound like a tutorial in Criminal Law 1. There is a very serious purpose and intent behind the bills, and I am aware that the amendments to the legislation to which these bills refer will be poured over by criminal law practitioners, both defence and prosecution, and others within the criminal law system of justice. There are some fundamental changes contained in the bills as part of a revision of criminal offences in legislation administered by the Treasurer. In the case of Treasury legislation amendment bill No. 2, it relates essentially to a range of taxation legislaWednesday, 22 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 30075 tion, and in the case of Treasury legislation amendment bill No. 3, it relates to legislation also administered by the Treasury portfolio, specifically the Corporations Act and others. These amendments are being revised in the light of the principles of criminal responsibility contained in chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. When I was at law school back in the 1970s, criminal law was a first-year subject. If you could come to terms with the principles of criminal responsibility, then you could come to terms with just about any legal concept. At common law, there was the traditional division of criminal offences, the elements: actus rea, meaning guilty act and mens rea, meaning guilty mind. We learned that the physical elements of the offence were matters such as conduct, the circumstances in which the conduct occurred or the results of that conduct. We learned that the fault elements related to a person’s state of mind, intention, knowledge, recklessness and negligence. Every law student learned that for each physical element of a criminal offence, the prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant had the requisite fault element. The issue of criminal responsibility as it related to Commonwealth criminal offences came under scrutiny in the 1980s when the Gibbs committee was established to review the Commonwealth criminal law generally. Its terms of reference included the need for provisions relating to criminal responsibility to be contained in a future act consolidating the criminal laws of the Commonwealth. When the committee reported in 1990-it was an interim report-it observed that the methods then used to adopt principles of criminal responsibility for Commonwealth offences had led to obscurity and inconsistency. I think this was caused in the main by the fact that, in relation to offences under the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914, the common law principles of criminal responsibility applied but, as we are aware, the greater number of Commonwealth criminal offences were contained in other statutes. We had the scenario relating to these other offences that a court, exercising federal jurisdiction under a Commonwealth criminal law other than the Crimes Act, determined issues of criminal responsibility according to the law of that particular state or territory. A court in a common law jurisdiction, Western Australia or New South Wales, would apply common law principles and in Queensland, a code state, the code principles would be applied. So there was an anomalous situation relating to Commonwealth offences so that, if they were brought under the Crimes Act, the common law applied and, if they were offences contained in other statutes, it depended upon the particular state court in which the offence was to be prosecuted. Ultimately, the Gibbs committee recommended that there be a Commonwealth law enacted to codify all relevant principles of criminal responsibility, and it was said at that time, in 1990, that this was needed to achieve uniformity of principles throughout Australia in Commonwealth criminal trials and to give certainty and clarity to the principles. This led to the development of the uniform Criminal Code. In the development of the Model Criminal Code, one of the fundamental chapters was chapter 2 on the principles of criminal responsibility. This now forms a substantive part of the Criminal Code Act 1995. In essence, chapter 2 sets out the fundamentals for Commonwealth criminal law. Generally, it adopted a common law approach to criminal responsibility based on subjective fault elements. We have had a staged process of implementation, but all the while it has been intended to avoid a situation where there might be just three sets of principles in existence during the implementation or transitional stage. You have got the code principles, the Crimes Act based on common law and then the application of different state and territory law in relation to offences other than those under the Crimes Act. Since 1995, the Commonwealth has been examining all the offences in all of the statute books to ensure that there is harmony with chapter 2 so that the principles of criminal responsibility are revised and simplified for Commonwealth 30076 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 22 August 2001 criminal law purposes. Chapter2 applies to all offences against the Criminal Code. From 1997, it applied to all new Commonwealth offences, and from December this year it will apply to pre-existing Commonwealth offences. Turning to the bill, I will take an example of how chapter 2 is going to apply to give an indication of the sort of technical application we are talking about. The Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 2) 2001 seeks to amend the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. Under a subsection of that act, it is an offence for a superannuation provider to intentionally refuse or fail to provide documents to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal that are considered by the tribunal to be relevant to the offence. This bill-and this is just an example-will remove the word ‘intentionally’, because the Criminal Code specifies that the default element in respect of prescribed conduct is intention and, therefore, you do not need the word ‘intentionally’ in the legislation for that offence. Mr Deputy Speaker, I could go through the various pieces of legislation, but you will get the picture. Ms JULIE BISHOP-You do get the picture. These amendments are of enormous significance to criminal lawyers and practitioners in the criminal law system, where the elements of an offence and the defences available under the Criminal Code are examined in the greatest detail-much akin to using a surgeon’s scalpel. In closing, as this group of bills amends legislation administered by the Treasury portfolio as part of the attempt to harmonise criminal offences within these statutes with the general principles of criminal responsibilities set out in chapter 2 of the Commonwealth code-thus leading to greater certainty, clarity and precision in the application of Commonwealth criminal laws-I commend these bills to the chamber. p.m.)-in reply-I thank the member for Curtin for her erudite and persuasive treatise on the important legislation before the chamber. I know that time is limited, so I will sum up by saying that the government’s amendments to the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 2) 2001 make minor technical corrections to the amendments to sections 8N and 8Q of the Taxation Administration Act to resolve ambiguities that developed out of the drafting process. The amendments moved by the government to the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 3) 2001 make a technical amendment to the penalties for contravention of the consumer protection provisions in the Trade Practices Act. The amendments do not change the status of the offences but simply ensure that penalties that currently apply will continue to apply following the application of the Criminal Code. These bills do not change the criminal law. Rather, they ensure that the current law is maintained following the application of the Criminal Code to Commonwealth legislation. I commend the bill to the Main Committee and will be moving some amendments when we go into committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. p.m.)-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 2) 2001.

Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with amendments. Main Committee adjourned at 1.03 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Aviation: Pilot Briefing Services (Question No. 2263) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 February 2001: (1) With respect to Airservices Australias new charging regime for pilot briefing services, what is the total cost to a pilot to access the briefing services under the respective access options. (2) Is the information only accessible if the relevant fees are paid. (3) Is the information necessary for safe flight and which parts of the service are mandatory for a pilot. (4) Are there any systems in place to monitor how many pilots are choosing to not access the services due to either cost or principle. (5) Is he able to say whether pilots are charged for this information and service in other countries, including the USA, Canada, UK, France, South Africa, Greece, Germany, Italy, Indonesia, Singapore. (6) Is he also able to say whether pilots with internet access can obtain the relevant Australian information without cost from US internet sites. I am advised by Airservices Australia that: (1) Current costs for the respective access options for each of the pilot briefing services are tabulated below: Access Option Implemented Pilot Costs Airservices Internet Pilot Briefing– via ISP Access Cost of ISP connection Airservices NAIPS Pilot Briefing via Direct Dial– In Access Local Call Airservices Pilot Briefing Voice Submit Plan– via Airservices/ $0.50 Telstra PhoneAway Airservices Pilot Briefing Fax Submit Plan– via Airservices/ $0.50 Telstra PhoneAway Airservices Pilot Briefing Check/Change Plan– via Airservices/ $0.50 Telstra PhoneAway Airservices Pilot Briefing Fax Back (AVFAX) – via Airservices / $0.50 Telstra PhoneAway Airservices Pilot Briefing IVR (DECTALK) – via Airservices / $0.50 Telstra PhoneAway Total cost to pilots will depend on which combination of the above services is used. Many pilots use Internet pilot briefing, however the following are alternative examples using the Airservices/Telstra PhoneAway system. ExampleA is for a visual flight rules (VFR) pilot accessing pilot briefing information via AVFAX, submitting a SARTIME flight notification by facsimile and checking with the briefing office that it has been received in a legible state. ExampleB is for an instrument flight rules (IFR) pilot accessing pilot briefing information by facsimile and activating a stored flight notification. Example Using access options (as above): Total Cost@ 50c per item A 6 – AVFAX 4 – FAX 5 – CHECK $1.50 B 6 – AVFAX 3 – Voice $1.00 (2) No. When the information is accessed via options 1 & 2 above then it is available free of Airservices charges – pilots are still required to pay for their own connection costs. Pilots having unusual access difficulties can contact the Airservices’ helpdesk free of charge for connection with the briefing office to gain access to the information. Further, in urgent situations, pilots can still access information by radio for which there is no charge.",169,Representatives Main Committee
307,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Yes, weather forecasts and Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) information are necessary for safe flight, and for certain mandatory operations. Aeronautical information Publication (AIP) ENR 1.10, 1.1 refers: “Before beginning a flight, a pilot in command must study all available information appropriate to the intended operation and, in the cases of flights away from the vicinity of an aerodrome and all Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flights, must make a careful study of: (a) current weather reports and forecasts for the route to be flown and the aerodromes to be used; (b) the airways facilities available on the route to be flown and the condition of those facilities; (c) the condition of aerodromes to be used and their suitability for the aircraft to be used; (d) the Air Traffic Control rules and procedures appertaining to the particular flight; and (e) all Head Office and Flight Information Region (FIR) NOTAM applicable to the en route phase of flight, and location-specific NOTAM for aerodromes. The pilot must then plan the flight in relation to the information obtained.” (4) Airservices continues to monitor changes in user access preference since electronic briefing services became available early last year. The data shows that the total number of clients accessing pilot briefing by all means, and the number of pilots using electronic mechanisms, both increased during last year. This data together with the PhoneAway card sales indicates that pilots are not opting out of the briefing systems but are, in fact, becoming more discerning about how they access pre-flight information. The data also indicates that the new technology is being well accepted and adopted by the industry. (5) Airservices’ research has revealed that pilot briefing services are provided without charge in the United States and Canada. It would also appear that there are no specific charges levied for pilot briefing services in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Africa, or Europe. The extent to which the “free of charge” service applies is not clear without a detailed understanding of the elements of that pricing structure. This ensures a comparison of like with like. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for example, is funded by appropriation and taxes and does not charge user fees. It is therefore inappropriate to compare it with self-funding organisations operating under the ‘user pays” principle. Further, research has been unable to rule out other mechanisms that might be in place in these countries to fund pilot briefing services, eg whether or not pilot briefing services are funded from general revenue, through en-route charges (and hence cross-subsidisation) or through some other form of revenue collection such as a general charge to the pilot for a range of related services. Charges for pilot briefing services are recovered through enroute charges in Europe for IFR operations. Eurocontrol levies charges for the en-route phase of flight and distributes the revenue to the different member States. The rate for the charges is negotiated on an annual basis. In the case of Spain for example, this includes the costs for the Aeronautical Information Services and costs for pre-flight briefings. A similar situation exists in Japan where pilots are not charged a specific fee to obtain pre-flight briefing services, nor are they charged to submit a flight plan into the ATC system. However, pilots are charged user fees for aerodrome and air navigation facilities that are classified as being for public use. In the United Kingdom, NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen) are available without charge, but pilot access to weather information attracts a specific fee from the UK Meteorology Office (“DialMet”). Airservices does not have any information on briefing service charges in either Singapore or Indonesia. (6) Airservices cannot be certain whether pilots with Internet access can obtain Australian information without cost from US Internet sites. However, pilots from Australia, the USA or anywhere else in the world can register and then obtain information without cost (other than connection (ISP) costs) directly from the Airservices Australia Internet World Wide Web Pilot Briefing site or via linked services from various pilot associations (eg AOPA). Airservices’ pilot briefing is accessible at http://www.airservices.gov.au/brief/. Aviation: Fire Services (Question No. 2695) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 18 June 2001: (1) Does the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) conduct quality and safety audits on the aviation fire services provided by Airservices Australia; if so, how many audits have been conducted at each airport in each of the past five years; if not, why not. (2) Does CASA conduct quality and safety audits on the aviation fire services provided by the RAAF at RAAF airports and bases; if so how many audits have been conducted at each airport or base in each of the past five years; if not, why not. (3) Does CASA conduct quality and safety audits on the aviation fire services provided by private sector providers at RAAF airports and bases; if so how many audits have been conducted at each airport or base in each of the past five years; if not, why not. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised the following: (1) Yes. CASA does audit the Aerodrome Rescue and Fire Fighting Services (ARFFS) provided by Airservices Australia. In the last five years, one (1) audit has been carried out at each of the following airports: Alice Springs, Hobart, Karratha, Launceston, Mackay, Port Hedland and Rockhampton. In the last five years two (2) audits have been carried out at each of the following airports: Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra, Coolangatta, Darwin, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. (2) Yes. CASA does audit the ARFFS at Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) bases provided that those RAAF bases have significant movements of civil passenger carrying aircraft. Other RAAF bases are only audited by the RAAF. In the last five years one (1) audit has been conducted at each of Townsville, Williamtown and Tindal RAAF bases. (3) CASA does not audit ARFFS provided for military purposes at bases that do not have a significant number of civil passenger movements. It should be noted that CASA does audit ARFFS provided for civil purposes by private service providers such as at Norfolk Island and Broome Airports and previously at Avalon Airport (1 audit has been conducted at each airport, in the last five years). Lowe Electorate: Aged Care Facilities (Question No. 2699) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 19 June 2001: (1) How many spot checks of aged care facilities have been undertaken by her department and the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency in the electoral division of Lowe between 7 September 2000 and 17 June 2001. (2) On what dates were the checks made. (3) Will she appoint an Aged Care Ombudsman to investigate complaints against aged care facilities if not, why not. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question, in accordance with advice provided to me, is as follows: (1) As at 16 June, 1334 spot checks have been undertaken. A number of these have been in the electorate of Lowe. (2) This information is protected information under the Aged Care Act 1997. (3) The Aged Care Complaints Resolution Scheme was established in 1997 and provides a free and accessible complaints resolution mechanism to resolve complaints about Government funded aged care services. I established the position of the Commissioner for Complaints (Committee Amendment Principles 2000 (No 1) signed on 31 August 2000) to oversee the operation of the Aged Care Complaints Resolution Scheme. To have called the Commissioner, an Aged Care Ombudsman, would have",175,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
308,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:confused his role with that of the Commonwealth Ombudsman who remains competent to act in the area of aged care at all times. The Commissioner’s role and responsibilities are as stated in Item5 of the Committee Amendment Principles 2000 (No 1) which inserts s.10.34A to the Committee Principles. Aged Care: Ethnic Aged Care Framework (Question No. 2749) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 26 July 2001: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2284 (Hansard, 25 June 2001, page 28540) concerning the withdrawal of funding under the Community Services Settlement Scheme, in considering requests for funding from the Australian Greek Welfare Society and Co., VictoriaAs.It, did she or her office receive requests for such funding from the Prime Minister, his office or any other member of the Government; if so, who made such requests and on what dates were those requests made. (2) As the Turkish Association of Victoria lost funding under the Government’s Community Settlement Services Scheme at the same time as the Australian Greek Welfare Society and Co.As.It, were any requests made at the same time for funding assistance under the Ethnic Aged Care Framework. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question, in accordance with advice provided to me, is as follows: (1) Discussions took place with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Hon Philip Ruddock as per our joint Press Release dated 31 August 2000. (2) No. Illegal Immigration: Port Hedland Detention Centre (Question No. 2839) Mr Sciacca asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 8 August 2001: (1) What was the projected cost of the security fence recently constructed around Port Hedland immigration processing centre. (2) What was the actual cost of the construction. The Department of Finance and Administration has advised that: (1) The original cost estimate for the construction of the new fence and associated security works at the Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre was $3.1 million. (2) As the works are not yet complete, the actual cost of the construction cannot yet be confirmed.",177,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
