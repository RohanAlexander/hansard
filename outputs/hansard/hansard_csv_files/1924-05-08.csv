Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [2.59] I prefer that the motion shall be dealt with now. May I explain the position? This subject was discussed on several occasions early in the session. I put quite a number of facts, or what I believe to be facts, before honourable members to support my contention that a Select Committee should be appointed. The debate was then adjourned until a week or so later on a motion by the Ministei"" for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman). I point out to the honourable member for Denison that no debate, strictly so called, can take place on this motion of adjournment. As the honourable member is the mover of the principal motion he may briefly give reasons why the debate on it should not be adjourned, but the House cannot now debate the question itself. Mr O'KEEFE -My reasons for wishing the question to be decided one way or the other are very simple, and should be quite plain to the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman). When I moved the motion I gave the Minister a lot of information, and he and the Government have had ample time and opportunity to decide whether the proposed Committee should be appointed. The matter is one of urgent necessity. There is no doubt about the urgency of it, ancl I cannot understand why the Minister is not prepared to state his reasons for or against the appointment of the Committee. A t least he should explain why he desires the debate to be adjourned. I would prefer a vote to be taken on it. If the debate is not adjourned I assume that I ' shall have the usual right of reply.

83,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [3.10].,"feel, however, that I must say it is absolutely esseutial, in a House like this, elected as it is by the people of the Comfacts to show that one of the most importmonwealth, that honourable members should take an intelligent interest iu the progress of events, and have a clear understanding of the manner in which important public works are carried out in this country. Unfortunately, it appears that, even at this late hour of the day, it is necessary for the voice of the missionary to be heard amongst those who live politically in the dark ages, to do what is possible to educate them to the advantages of a properly organized system for the carrying out of Government works. I haye no hesitation in saying that whenever those who are regarded as authorities in this matter-me n not necessarily of the same political colour as myself or other honourable members on this side of the Househave been asked which method-da y labour under proper supervision or contract-is the better for the carrying out of public works, they have stated that the balance of expert opinion was in favour of the day-labour system. In view of this testimony from the most highly-qualified engineers and contractors in the Commonwealth, I cannot conceive how any honourable member can attempt to justify the contract system. It has been tried certainly, but in connection with the bulk of our public works, even in the constituency represented by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Room. In this matter I need not .Killen), the responsible authorities have had to resort to the day-labour system. The most important public body in VictoriaI refer to the Metropolitan Board of Works-approve s of this method. The Board consists, for the most part, bf meu representing municipal councils throughout the metropolitan area, and in recent times it has carried out public works involving ths expenditure of considerable sums of money. I believe that on many occasions when tenders have been altogether too highI do not suggest collusion between, ;dontiractors-p n the advice of its engineers the Board has carried out the works by day labour, which is now its recognised system. As far as I have been able to gather, this is proving most satisfactory. The pace at which work is being carried on is as good, if .not better than under the contract system, and the Board's experts are thoroughly satisfied with tlie quality of thc work that is being done. I state these ant public bodies in the Commonwealth has, after a long experience of the contract system, reverted to day labour. If the contract system is the best, as the honourable member for Riverina would have the people of the Commonwealth believe, it is strange that he does not advocate its adoption for practically every class of work. whenever that is possible. member apply it to his own household? Would he apply it to the Public Service of the Commonwealth? M.r.

Does he say that it could not be applied to clerical work ? adopt it. member were to seriously suggest its adoption in our banking institutions he would be laughed out of the Board appeal to the Minister, for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart), who represents a district where, I suppose, more railway construction has been done with day labour than in any other part of Victoria. many agitators there. ber himself was an agitator. That is the reason for' his presence in this House. Practically all railway construction in Victoria for the past 25 years has been carried out with day labour. Proposed neAv railways are referred to the Railways Standing Committee for investigation ancl report.

I week or a fortnight perhaps, Labour has not been in power in Victoria; the State -has always been under so-called Nationalist Governments. Yet so convinced are they of the superiority of day labour construction that they never think of calling for tenders for the building of any railway, whether it be in the level Mallee country or in districts which present great engineering difficulties: In the district in which I live the Railway 'Commissioners went to considerable trouble to provide equipment and accommodation for their workmen in order that a comparatively small line might be constructed by day labour. lowed by the Electricity Commission and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. carry out all their works by day labour. The Electricity Commissioners are a live body of men. They have had to contend against serious difficulties .and a big risea Labour sympathiser. He was giving in the prices of materials, as a result of which the scheme they control is costing slightly more than was anticipated when it was authorized by Parliament, but when it is in full operation and all the initial difficulties have been overcome, the people of Victoria will be grateful to the State Parliament and to the constructing engineers. Throughout Victoria great sums of money have been saved by the construction of railway lines by day labour. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) interjected sarcastically about the EastWest railway. I am confident that if that line had been built by contractors the cost to the Commonwealth would have been considerably more than it was, and the results would not have been as good. If the honourable member has any practical knowledge, and will coiapare works carried out under the contract and day labour systems respectively he will agree that day labour, under strict supervision, gives the best results. man who is being paid a reasonable daily wage has no reason for scamping bis. job. In tbe final analysis the contract system is. only day lalbowr plus the 'Contractor and his profits. no profits. judge by results.

Visitors, from other parts of the world testify that the Australian workman is the best in the world.

I knew that for a number of years Hoskins Bros, had been carrying on the same class of work, the construction of prat, "" Y o u have started great works, in which you are employing thousands of men, and the works are proceeding most satisfactorily. How have you managed?"" He replied, "" We had, of course, to import a few leading hands, but beyond these all employed in the works .are Australians."" I mentioned that the industry must be practically new to most of them, and he said, "" Yes, but there is not a more adaptable nor a better workman in the world than the Australian workman.""

FENTON -That is the honourable member's opinion; but others may think differently. Why should honourable members cast a slur upon the Australian workman? Are we going to say that because in this country ""there are a few black-hearted criminals, all the people are criminals ? Are we to say that because there are a few wasters amongst both employers and employees they are typical of Australian employers and workmen ? British and American workmen who have worked beside the Australian workman, and their opinion has been that the Australian workman works too fast for them altogether. No one can deny the merits of the Australian workman who thinks for a moment of the work done by the hornyhanded pioneers of Australia and by the handful of people in .this great continent. up in this Parliament and say that Australian workmen have not done a fair thing would be, not only a libeller of his fellow men, but a libeller of his country. Australia, are the handiwork of the Australian workmen. The great works and buildings that have been carried out in Australia are a magnificent testimony to the industry and a great monument to the skill of the Australian workman. We hear in this Blouse sometimes sneers at the expense of the Australian workman, but there is not a man in the Country party corner or on the Ministerial benches who, on the platform when electioneering, would say .that the Australian workman !s not worth his salt. Yet some say that sort of thing here. has made any such assertion. their actions as well as their words. Many of us on this side have had to work hard for a crust. I am not here to defend the waster, no matter in what line of life he may be employed. J have never stood up for the waster, and never shall. If honourable members oppo? site are going to search for wasters, I can take them to a place where they will find them. They will not be found amongst the workers, but amongst the men who are riding on the backs of the producers; I refer to the middlemen, who are taking what they are not entitled to from the pockets of the producers, and not to the workmen who are doing something to make the farm of the farmer better, and the run of the Australian squatter better. Where would the Australiau sheep-grower be were it not for the shearer, and where would the Australian farmer be were it not for the labourer on his land ? Where would the contractor in this country be were it not for the expert Australian workmen he is able to employ ? Let us be fair to the workmen of Australia, whatever our brand of politics. I say that the workmen of Australia are the best workmen in the world. I will stand to that on any platform and in any country. It is of no use for the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) to attempt to protest and apologize now. He put this motion on the paper,' and he must stand The man who would stand by it . The people of Riverina will judge him, and I know that there are some splendid stalwarts in that district. I do not wish to say anything that may be regarded as offensive, but I must protest A ll the great works in when I find a man standing up and. in a half-hearted way, trying to make out that the day-labour system is bad, and that Australian workmen are not good workmen unless they are driven all the time. I believe that the great bulk of the workmen of Australia will work well whether under the eye of the overseer or boss, or when the boss is a hundred miles away. Many of us in this House know what it is to work for wages, and also to employ men. I have known what it was to pay men to do work for me, and, speaking from my own experience, I say that very few workmen will take down an employer: The Australian workmen axe not only as honest, but I believe even more honest, than workmen in any other part of the world.

108,Mr Fenton,"We judge men byexperience recently, when it was proposed to send out of Australia for railway engines when we have our own workmen here able to construct them. That was a scandalous proposal, and I am sure the honourable -member for Corio( Mr Lister) does not -stand for that kind of thing. We have .'here the material and skilled labour* for 'jfche manufacture of railway requirements. I can refer honourable members to what has been done under the Railways Commissioners ih Victoria. I am speaking now, perhaps, of what occurred a few years ago, but we know that the thousands of workmen employed at the Newport Railway Workshops have done magnificent work. They have constructed railway engines at a cost £1,000 less per engine than the Baldwin Company of America could have constructed them for, and did better work. They have constructed all the girders required for our electric railways. All this work was done by day labour, and more cheaply and better than some of the work done under the contract system. I trust that, if this motion comes to a vote, the House will xise to the occasion. The motion proposes that the contract system shall be adopted for all Government work, and if it is passed, and the Minister for Works and Railways receives a tender for works, he may feel himself bound by the resolution of the House. advise him that tenders are too high, and on that account he may refuse to accept them, but, if we pass a motion of this kind, he may feel himself bound by the vote of this House, and the passing of this motion will practically tie his hands. He may then say, "" The House, by resolution, has told me that I must insist upon the adoption of the contract system."" words "" as far as possible "" appear in the motion, but surely we do not desire to tie the hands of the Minister for Works and Railways in any way. When I had to do with tenders I know that it was always the practice in advertising to use the words, "" The lowest or auy tender not necessarily accepted."" I have frequently voted for the acceptance of a higher tender than the lowest' because I knew thc contractor putting in the higher tender would do better work. I knew that he knew more about the work and would give a better job than the lowest tenderer, and that although the institution I represented might have to pay a few more pounds for. the job, it would be getting a better class of work than it would get from the lowest tenderer. I am sure' that the Minister for Works and Railways is in a position to say, from his own observation and experience, that work carried out by day labour is to be preferred to work carried out by contract labour, and that it is carried out as expeditiously as well as more efficiently. Under the contract system, if the clerk of works or the architect is not on the job, it is not uncommon for workmen to be told that defective work will do, and to have such work covered up. Some of the worse experiences we have had in connection with war service homes construction resulted from the' contract system. There are contractors who, to-day, ought to be in gaol, without the option of a fine, for the work that they did in the construction of war service homes. YetI believe that some of these men have had the unblushing audacity to demand from the Government more money under their contracts. The names of those contractors should stink in the nostrils of the people of Australia, and particularly of thc members of this House. From our experience of them we should be wary about adopting the contract system, in the Now his omcers may future. If there is anv work which should be carefully carried out surely it is work done for the men who did their best in the time of crisis to serve Australia. In connection with war service homes construction scores of pages of sworn evidence are filled with references to contractors who tried to dip their hands into the pockets, not only of the taxpayers and the Government, but of the returned soldiers. These revelations warn me that we should keep clear of the bulk of contractors. I do not say that all contractors are alike, because I know that there are some who carry out their work faithfully and well, bnt one may say that the better class of work is that done by day labour. I can give a concrete instance in support of this statement, and it is that there has not been one yard of railway constructed in Victoria within the last 30 years by contract labour. adjourned.",25,Government Works

The object of this B ill is to create a Commission to supervise the construction work at the Federal Capital. It is difficult to understand why this particular work should be placed under a Commission, as the Minister himself has said that the present arrangements are satisfactory, and that the Advisory Committee which now operates there is doing good work. One reason given for the change was that there is now dual control. pointed out that two Departments are operating in the Federal Territory, and that a change is desirable. I do not advocate dual control, but it is not a sufficient reason for creating a Commission to administer the Federal Territory. I see no legitimate reason why the administration of the Federal Capital should not be placed under the control of one Department-whicheve r is the most suitable. It has, however, been decided otherwise by Ministers. But to do what they propose will add to the cost of government in this country. It is proposed to create positions for three men, each of whom will be paid a good salary, in addition to travelling expenses. The President of the Commission is to receive £3,000 per annum and expenses, and each of the other Commissioners £2,000 and expenses. To-day only two members of the Advisory Committee are paid officials; the others receive expenses only. The cost of the Advisory Committee is a mere bagatelle in comparison with that -of thc proposed Commission. The Minister admits that the Committee is doing excellent work, and took to himself credit for the progress which has been H a d the debate continued, I made in the construction of the various buildings and other works at Canberra. If I hope that the honourable everything has been progressing so satisfactorily, what is the reason for this contemplated change ? Ever since the commencement of the war jwe have been getting away from responsible government. While thc war was in progress such action was understandable, but the Government appears to have forgotten that it is time we were returning to normal conditions. The control which it is proposed to give to this Commission should be retained by this House. I shall probably be told that control will not be taken from Parliament. But, like many other measures, this B ill gives power to make regulations, and, although provision is made for such regulations to be laid on the table of this House, and for objection to them to be taken within 30 days of presentation, honourable members know that very often littl e notice is taken of them. Consequently, administration is left entirely in the hands of the Board or Commission which frames the regulations. While the Government retain control, matters which honourable members consider should be ventilated can be brought up in this House, It was and the persons concerned can be dealt with if necessary, and first-hand knowledge of matters pertaining to the Federal Territory can be obtained.

It is idle to say that we shall have control after the appointment of a Commission. After our recent experiences we should not be led astray by any such contention. The Government should not be able to shelter itself behind a Commission. The policy of appointing Commissions of this nature is spelling disaster to the country. Parliament should not be the subordinate body; it should be supreme. gentleman does not contend that Parliament will give up its powers if it agrees to this Bill. position very clear. I contend that if we create this Commission we, as a Parliament, shall count for very little. The statement that these Commissions are responsible to the Minister means next to nothing. That story is about played out. The War Service Homes Commission provides us with an. apt illustration of what will happen if we agree to this measure. That Commission, although in much closer touch with Parliament than this proposed Commission would be, made a huge bungle of the business it had to handle, and the country has paid very dearly for its. mistakes. Yet Parliament has not been able to place its hands on the culprits. I trust that honourable members will not -shirk the responsibility of exI pressing their convictions on this measure.

I think he is very much underpaid. He. is wrapped up in his work, and is giving his whole heart to it . The same may be said of Colonel Owen, who is an enthusiast. He has organized the work in such a way that he will be able to comply with the request to complete the construction of the provisional Parliament House within the specified time. Shall we obtain better administration and better work if we appoint a Commission, as suggested in this Bill? I cannot see that we are justified in expecting such a result. It is proposed to pay the chairman of the Commission a salary of £3,000 a year. That is more than the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth receives. sede men who-have done good work is any necessity to appoint three men to administer the Territory. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is responsible for much greater public expenditure than will be incurred in the Federal Territory, and his time is occupied from morning to night. His position is a worrying one. Yet we are content to pay him less than it is proposed to pay the chairman of this Commission. It is not fair. Then consider the work done by the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart). He has to look after works in all the States. He has to inquire into the construction of railways, telephone exchanges, and other buildings. He does not receive as high a salary as is proposed for the ordinary members of the Commission. There is no justification for the appointment of three men, one at £3,000 a year, and the other two at £2,000 a year each, to supervise work at Canberra. There is another aspect of the of the question that merits consideration. The Commission, as soon as it comes into existence, will create a staff of its own. There will be secretaries, typists, clerks of works, and numerous other subordinate officials. They will constitute a small parliament in Canberra, and will usurp the functions of the National Parliament. It is proposed to give the Commission wide powers. It will be allowed to float loans for building purposes without consulting Parliament. Reports on the matter will no doubt be tabled by the Minister, and that will be the end of it . There will be no obligation on the Commission to submit to Parliament designs for buildings. The designs for proposed works are now referred to the Public Works Committee, which investigates them, takesevidence, and makes recommendations to Parliament. Is Parliament willing to relinquish its power in that regard? It should insist upon retaining a tight hold on all expenditure, and supervising all .designs. We are asked to hand that power over to a Commission. The Commission should consist of capable men, but however capable they might be, they would not be more capable than the members of the Advisory Committee. I am acquainted with Mr Ross, who is one of the ablest architects in Sydney. He stands head and shoulders above other men in his profession, and enjoys the utmost confidence of the people of that State. He is a member of the AdvisoryI do not think there Committee, and gives his services for a nominal sum. It would be impossible to find a man more qualified for the position. I understand that the Government has already decided upou a land ordinance. It has determined the conditions upon which people may lease laud. The ordinance will be issued on a certain date, and by the time the Commissioners can be appointed, the spade work will have been done by the Government. The water supply system is complete, and ample for quite a large city. The sewerage works are almost complete, and light and power are available. Brick-works are in existence, and 70 or 80 houses have been finished. A hostel to accommodate members of Parliament will be ready in three or four months, and another hostel is in course of erection. The roof of Parliament House will be in place by October next. All the large works have been done by the Government and officials of the Works Department, and it is now late in the day to propose the establishment of a Commission. The works to be undertaken in. the future will nob be so big as Parliament House or the hostel. I cannot see what the Commission will have to do. Al l the work at Canberra should be transferred to one Department, and I would be satisfied to hand it to the Works and Railways Department.

I do not know whether it would decide to go abroad or borrow locally. When there is some population in Canberra, the Government can make provision for municipal government.

The present position ia satisfactory to all concerned, and no money is being wasted. number of occasions I have defined my attitude towards the expenditure of public .money at Canberra. Members generally know exactly where I stand in that matter. It is strange for me to sit here and listen to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) advocating economy at Canberra, particularly in view of the present position there. There have been many debates upon the wisdom or .otherwise of commencing or continuing the work, but this is about the first utterance I have heard from the other side of the House in opposition to the Government expending money on that questionable Surely, with Parundertaking. The Minister, with the enthusiasm which one would naturally expect from a recent -convert, has -uncelestial city and its surroundings.

I cannot support the expenditure of another penny in this The Territory, especially in view of the sections of the report recently 'furnished by the Public Accounts Committee. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition were illuminating. He referred to Uhe proposal to pay to three members of the proposed Commission ""very ""high salaries. I remember that, when iSie Minister was introducing the Bill, I interjected that it was proposed bo pay 'the Chairman .of the Commission a nigher salary than that received by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth.

No man, no matter haw able, is entitled to a salary larger than that paid to the political head of this country for the time being. With the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton!).

The present condition of Australia does not warrant the spending of money on. Canberra. I wish to make it quite clear that I am not opposed' to carrying out the terms of the agreement; but, in view of our financial position, it should not be prosecuted further until' we have relieved ourselves of many of the responsibilities and obligations imposed upon us by the war. If the Commission is to be appointed, I should certainly like to know its' personnel. If , as was suggested by a previous speaker, a certain gentleman is to b'e appointed, the House should be informed of the fact. I know nothing to that gentleman's detriment. I understand thab he is an exceptionally fine officer, but the Government is not justified in creating a position and appointing to it a man who is already in the service of the Commonwealth at a salary of about £1,200 a year. We have evidence on every .hand of extravagance on the part of those who have been responsible for what has been done at Canberra up to the present. I find, from the fourth report of the Public Accounts Committee, that a four-roomed house constructed under the most faivorable conditions, much of the material being readily available, costs from £955 to £1,076, and' that a five-roomed house costs from £1 31S to £1,435-. ; These figures disclose that building costs in Canberra, under the day labour system which the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Penton) eulogized so much this afternoon, are excessive. facts. stated.

In view of all the facts, I emphasize that we are not justified in continuing the present policy in connection with Canberra. If some of those who axe controlling affairs now axe to be appointed to this Commission, then the House should not pass the Bill, especially in view of the fact that it is pro. posed largely to increase the salaries now being paid to these gentlemen. member suggest we should do? there for the present. tion to defray the cost of building the Capital without throwing' too heavy a strain upon the financial resources of the Commonwealth. We ought to set our house in order before we attempt to build another house. The proposed Commission, according to the Bill, will be comprised of gentlemen possessing, an extraordinarily wide range of ability. They will be expected to have a special knowledge of architecture, engineering, construction, town planning, finance, and general administration. It is hardly possible to expect to find all these qualifications possessed by three individual's. But they will have duties imposed upon them requiring other qualifications as well. They will be responsible for land settlement, with all its attendant difficulties, and for the development-of a system of local government. Surely it is too much to expect to get all these qualifications in any three men. I am somewhat astonished at the pptimjsm of the Minister( Mr Stewart), and of many of my honourable friends, particularly the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman).

177,Mr Mahony,"I regret exceedinglystated,, let the Minister announce thts names of those whom the Government does intend to appoint to the Commission. As one who has always been consistent in the advocacy of Canberra, I want to be assured that it is friends of Canberra who are going to be put upon the proposed Commission. I shall give no vote to bring into being a Commission which will hand the destinies of Canberra over to a man like the honourable member for Swan. I want to be assured that the administration of the Pederal Capital will be in the hands of men who will see that the work there is carried out expeditiously and properly. I take another objection to this measure, and it is that it proposes the appointment of a new Board. It proposes the appointment of a Commission to take the complete control of Canberra out of the hands of this Parliament. It will be of no use if they support this measure for those who believe in the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra as soon as possible to complain of delays and obstructions placed in the way of the completion of the Capital. They will be met with the reply with which I was met yesterday when I complained of the action of the Commonwealth Shipping Board in robbing workmen of a day's.pay for a day off, which they, were compelled to take towelcome the; visiting British squadron. The Prime Minister told, me that the Government had nopower in the matter; that it was absolutely in the hands of the Shipping Board, and the Government had no say. S'O' it will be if this measure is carried. The Commission it proposes to. create will be the sole authority to decide what works shall go o« at Canberra, and what shall not, and what is of more, importance still, to decide the rata of progress at the Federal Capital.

I dealt with Canberra. I gave in then, and I do not go back am what I said. able membersupports Canberra. I do not know what will happen next. This measure represents a serious departure from constitutional practice. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has said, Board after Board is being appointed, and scarcely a single Department of the Public Service is being administered by a responsible Minister. If that is to be the policy of the Commonwealth, why have Ministers or a Parliament at all? If that is to be our policy, let a Board be appointed to administer the whole of the affairs of the Commonwealth. The essential principle of British parliamentary 'institutions is that the people by their votes shall send representatives to Parliament to administer the affairs of the country, and that these men shall be responsible to the people. That is the foundation of our British parliamentary system.. Yet we find that it is being undermined day after day by the appointment of these Boards and Commissions-. I strongly object to this Bill, not only on these general, principles but because I doubt the sincerity of the Commission to be appointed. I believe that it is being brought into existence purely for the purpose of spragging the wheels of progress at Canberra. I hope that the friends of Canberra, who desire to see progress there, will politely pass this Bill out. We are all satisfied with the way in which work has been progressing at Canberra during the last twelve months. Why alter the present system ? I read very carefully the speech of the Minister for Works and Railways in proposing the second reading of this Bill, but I am still waiting for some reason for the establishment of the proposed Commission. for a few of the Government's friends. the honourable member for Swan, is to beappointed chairman of the Commission, Well may the honourable for tha purpose of killing Canberra. ber sure that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) is. sion ? ber, is am ardent advocate and fighterfor Canberra,, and it was whispered that he was to be Chairman of the Commission, but that was merely to throw dust in the eyes o.f honourable members..

I hone that the friends of Canberra will realize that they cannot expect support in this matter from honourable members who, in season and out of season have strongly opposed the completion of the Federal Capital. But we do look for and expect the support of honourable members who represent constituencies in New South Wales. that they will refrain from giving any vote which would in any way jeopardise the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra. Let me say that honourable members representing New South Wales constituencies will be asked very serious questions by the people of that State if they vote to bring into being a Commission that will stop the progress of work there. In the first place they will have to convince the people of that State that work has not been going on satisfactorily at Canberra for some time past. They will have to say what is their complaint, against the condition of affairs at Canberra at the present time. If there were anything to complain of, I suppose I would be one of the first to raise my voice on the subject in this Chamber. But I am perfectly satisfied with the progress of work there at present, and I do not want to see the existing system for the administration of the Federal Capital altered. When the friends of Canberra are satisfied with the way the work is going on there at present, I immediately become suspicious about a proposed alteration in administration. what is behind this proposal. I believe that political motives are behind it. It is to get the honourable member for Swan out of the way and placate members of the Corner party so that the Government may remain on the Treasury bench in security. three for whom the Government must find tice their mouthing of economy and to jobs. member for Swan takes up the position of which is now being well done by an existChairman of the Canberra Commission, ing department. The Bill provides that the chairmanship of the Public Works the employees and officers of the CommisCommittee will become vacant, and that sion shall not be subject to the Public will be a job for another member Service Act. It is perfectly clear from of the Corner party. This move is this that it is the intention to bring into not in the interests of the probeing a big army of employees as an adgress of Canberra, but merely to ministrative staff at Canberra. If that conciliate the two divergent sections were not so, why provide that the Public of the so-called Composite party opposite. Service A/ct shall not apply to the staff. I can see no other purpose for this measure. The members of the party in the Corner prate of economy. What does this measure mean? It means not only the expenditure of £7,000 a year in salaries for the proposed Commissioners, but also the establishment of a huge department. Let honourable members consider for a moment what this proposal involves. The control of works at CanWe expect berra is to be taken away from the Works and Railways Department, and this means the building up of another big staff of advisers and employees. Before we know where we are the cost will run into thousands of pounds per annum for the staff that will be required to do the work which is being so effectively and well done by the Works and Railways Department to-day. How can members of the Country party continue to prate of economy if they support such a measure as this? If the measure will not involve the creation of a new staff at Canberra, where is the need for the proposed Commission at all ? The department in existence to-day is doing the work and there is no need for the Commission. Let honourable members in the Corner who prate of economy answer this contention The people of Australia and not only of New South Wales, and especially the people of the country districts, will ask members of the Country party some pertinent questions on this matter. They will want to know later on when Estimates are submitted to cover the expenditure for the I want to know new department, what attitude they adopted when they found that thousands of pounds of additional expenditure per annum was being proposed for the creation of a new department at Canberra.

The whole thing is a. sinister move intended to k ill Canberra by loading it up with expense that the place cannot carry. It is playing into the hands of the opponents of Canberra. No man can challenge my honesty as an advocate of Canberra, and as a supporter of that place in season and out of season, I say that this is a dangerous proposal, and one which will do more to kill Canberra than anything else I know of. TheM i nister has to show the House and the country exactly what the cost of the proposed Commission will be. Further, he has to tell us whom he proposes to appoint to the Commission. I conclude with the> expression of the hope that all the friends of Canberra will stand by it in this particular matter, and w ill not be deluded by this sinister move on the part of the opponents of Canberra to prevent the establishment of thc Federal Capital there. am not now as favorable to the appointment of a Commission to take charge of the construction of Canberra as I formerly was. The idea is not a new one. The proposal was first brought forward by Sir Joseph Cooki n 1913, and if his Government had been returned to power at the elections in 1914 a Commission would have been constituted almost immediately afterwards to take over the responsibility of administering the Federal Territory quite free from interference by Parliament; except of course that Parliament would always have a certain amount of control by reason of its obligation to findthe necessary money. That Commission was to have been intrusted with the task of financing and supervising the work of construction. However, I am not now anxious for the appointment of a Commission, because such a body ought to have been constituted before the Commonwealth was committed to the expenditure in which it is now involved. As a matter of fact, this Parliament is already committed to almost all the ex]>enditure that will cover the initia l stages of the development of the Capital, say, for the next 20 years. I am also opposed to the appointment of three highly paid Commissioners, because the work of supervising the development of the Capital for the next 20 years will not be sufficiently great to justify paying a chairman a salary of £3,000 a year, and two other Commissioners salaries of £2,000 a year each. Such appointments would involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure for supervision equal to that which is incurred in the control of some of the big State railway services, with a capital of over £40,000,000. I have intimated to the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) my views upon this point, because I am anxious that my attitude shall not be misunderstood. UnlessI can get an absolute assurance that three Commissioners will not be appointed at the high salaries proposed, I ' shall vigorously oppose the B ill , and endeavour to influence every one else to put it on one side. The length to which I would go would be to support the appointment of a permanent chairman, and that I could not do with a great deal of enthusiasm; and I would have him appointed for a period of not more than five years, with, subject to review, a further period of five years. The Government that did not I provide an absolutely efficient chairman would find the appointment a millstone around its neck for all time. As a matter of fact, the success of such Commissions as this depends entirely upon their jjersounel. If an antediluvian Commissioner is appointed, who has never had vision and is never likely to have it , the choice w ill be bad, and the Commission is not likely to be a success. However, it is quite possible the Government may get a gentleman of the highest financial experience, and with great organizing capacity! Those two qualifications are absolutely indispensable. Such a man would probably save the country a great deal of money. The only assistance he would require for the work in view would be two Commissioners paid by fees whose services would not be required more than two days, and possibly not more than one day, a week. One of the reasons why I favour the appointment of a Gommission on the lines I have suggested is that the building of the Capital should be removed entirely from parliamentary influence, and from the possibility of the policy of construction being dragged this way and that way every year through political changes. There should be continuity of. operation and continuity of supervising responsibility.

Chairman_ and with exceptionally good representatives assisting him, we should have all that is required, and certainly all that is justified. To provide for more would be to incur a shocking waste of money. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) has spoken about the cost of the work at Canberra. Whilei t is perfectly true that the cost of the work there is high, it is relatively not higher than that of work in almost all the big cities of the Commonwealth. mad rush to make provision for Parliament meeting at Canberra at the end of this Parliament, if it runs its f u l l term. It is causing a shocking addition to the cost of the work. Moreover, under existing conditions no Government in Australia, in order to gain perhaps eighteen months, is justified in rushing work of this kind, to the detriment of enterprises all over Australia, which cannot develop their factories, through inability to get skilled labour. HereI wish to refer to the recommendation appearing in the report of the Public Accounts Committee upon Canberra housing, in regard to the writing down of the cost of certain buildings at Canberra. While I was Minister, I declared that the cost involved in building houses at Canberra could never be passed on to the public servants who would be obliged to occupy them, and that, therefore, every care should be exercised in the construction of that class of buildings. It would be unreasonable to transfer public servants from Melbourne to Canberra and insist upon them occupying houses ab rentals for all time based on abnormal cost of construction. Therefore. I worried the officers of the Public Works Department to reduce the cost of tlie buildings required for workers and officers who, whether they liked it or not, would be obliged to go to Canberra when Parliament was transferred there. quite agree with the recommendation that the cost of these buildings should be written down by 25 per cent., but only urgently-needed houses to be provided. The Commonwealth officers transferred to Canberra should not be made to suffer for bhe peculiarly unfavourable condibions of the moment. method be to fix the rent at so much per were submitted to the Public Works ""With a good cent, and then make a special allowan<>e to the officers? responsibilities due to the war, I do not like the idea of rushing the ouilding of Canberra, which is not an undertaking of utility. To do this hampers every enterprise in the country that is crying out for men to increase the size of its factories and is unable to get them. If the Government were debermined bo increase the pace, they should have gone to the Old World, or somewhere else, and brought I object, however, to the house-builders into the Commonwealth. If they had brought in 10,000 such artisan's, these would have been absorbed by the different States. In fact, they would have been taken from the ships' sides and paid more than the average award rates. The excessive cosb of building at Canberra has been entirely due to bhe scarcity of skilled labour, and nob bo the fact that the men there have been going slow as compared with those in the capital cities.

This Bill might very well have been entitled "" A Bifi to recognise the incapacity of two Federal Departments-the Works and Eailways and the Home and Territories Departments."" Up to the present the two Departments mentioned have been doing the work which under this Bill a Commission is to be appointed to perform. Some people consider that the work has been done satisfactorily, but I .make no comment on that. The Minister seems It is not to consider that these Departments cannot carry on the work any longer, and that it is necessary to appoint a most expensive Commission. The public of Australia would be justified in saying that if these Departments are not more capable than is indicated by the action of the Government, it would be as well if a Bill exceeding our responsibility. were brought in to abolish them altogether. The control of the Federal TerriIt tory is their work, and the work of the Minister controlling them, but it is to be shirked by both. That is a strange condition of affairs. The reason given for the change is that because of dual control the work can not be efficiently carried out. It is remarkable that a Commission to cost £7,000 or £8,000 per annum is necessary to harmonize the work of these two Departments. I object to the appointment of the Commission, on the ground of expense; the work could, and should, be done by the Departments which have been carrying it out up to the present time. I also object to the appointment of the Commission on the ground that it is taking' from Parliament the con1 trol of its affairs.

That is a very serious position. The Bill leaves it entirely to the Miuister to suspend one or more of the Commissioners or Deputy Commissioners, but if .he did not feel disposed to .take such .action, not even a vote of both Houses could accomplish it. I take exception, also, to the clause which provides that the officers of the Commission .shall be taken from the control of the Public Service Board.

In his lan.) advised that all the officers employed by the Commonwealth Government should be placed under one control so far as promotion and transfer were conoerned.

But now a Commission is proposed which will undertake very important work, and will employ a great number of officers, but for some reason not yet made known to us, the Government proposes to remove its stafE entirely from the control -of the Public Service Board. Such a proposal is not fair to either the public seragain under the Public Service Board. vants who would be placed under the Commission or those remaining under the Public Service Board. Those of us who have had experience of. Public Service matters know that on many occasions prior to the appointment of the Public Service Board promotion went, not by merit, bub according to social or political influence. Public servants generally havo been satisfied with bhe sysbem of promotion and transfer at present in operation. What is bhe reason for the introduction df this pernicious practice in connection with this important Commission ? Once they are taken over by the Commission, public servants will nob have bhe protection which bhey now enjoy, as bhe -present sysbem of control insures to them a reasonable chance of promotion by merit. The moment bhab control is baken away, the old insidious favouritism will creep in, because these things are inseparable from human nature. The man wibh social or political influence will receive promotion under the Commission which bhe majority may consider he does not deserve. Does the Minisber bhink that the Commissioners, in addition bo [8 MAY, .1924.] (Administration) BiU. 517 'beiug experts in administering the Federal Territory, will be experts in the manageznemb of public servants; or does he anticipate., as suggested by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), the appointment of another Public Service Board under the Commission to manage the public servants who will be baken over ? The public servants consider this a matter of great importance. If bhe Minisber intends to proceed with this Bill, I ask him to give this subject careful consideration.

That has been done with the consent and approval of the Chief Architect of the Commonwealth. We know perfectly well that if the building of the city had been l e f t in the hands of one man there would have been a uniform design throughout. Even although I have opposed the expenditure of money at Canberra, I hope that whatever we do w ill be a source of pride when eventually the seat of Government is moved there. Not one member of this House can say a word against my work as Chairman of the PubUc Works Committee. I have done nothing to thwart the wishes of Parliament in any investigation made by the Committee. Our work has been honest, and we have always desired to carry out the duties that Parliament imposes upon us. W h a t work warranting the appointment of a special Commission, taking great powers from this Parliament, is required at Canberra in the near future? Not only will the Commission have power over the Treasury; but in this B i ll it is given power to borrow any sum of money that it chooses; it may be £100,000 or £5,000,000. All they have to do to borrow the money is to get the consent of the Treasurer of the -day. Parliament w ill not be asked to express any opinion on the proposed expenditure. liament. the Parliament. I am not reflecting upon .the Treasurer, but in time to come there may be in power a Treasurer imbued with the idea that it w ill be a good thing to spend large sums of money for artificial lakes and other such works at Canberra.

I do not think Parliament would do right to vest it with such powers. We have not done so with other Commissions. The Railways Commissioners have wide powers, but those powers are clearly defined, and ( j the Treasurer is not able to consent to them borrowing money as they like. Probably the powers conferred upon the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works are somewhat comparable with the powers it is proposed to place in th© hands of the Federal Capital Conunission.

In. fact, the indications are that the work in the Federal territory will proceed in the future as it not ask the has done in the past in some respects. The Bill specifically provides thab big public works shall be referred bo the Public Works Committee, and that the Public Accounts Committee shall examine the accounts. It also provides that officers of the Works and Railways Department shall be employed where that can be done. What big public works will require attention in . the next few years? I do not think it is bhe intention of the Government to go on, at present, with bhe artificial lakes which are parb of Mr Griffin's scheme! They need nob be made for years to come. The report of the Public Works Committee on the railway connection, will be placed before Parliament as soon as it is printed. The heavy work in connection with water supply, sewerage, and the establishment of a power plant has been done. Really, I can see nothing which will require the appointment of specialists. I think ib would be advisable to place the Canberra work in the control of one Department, with a special officer to deal withl*.nd matters. Dual control means trouble are accused of and delay, and friction results. Single control is much to be preferred.

Naval Board and a Military Board there. During the last few weeks the Public Accounts Committee has been conducting an investigation into the expenditure incurred at the Naval College at Jervis Bay and the Duntroon Military College. We have been informed in the most definite manner that no reduction in the expenditure at these two establishments is advisable, and that if it wera contemplated it could only be done on the recommendation of those Boards. Then the members of the Note Issue Board are representatives of the largest loomnaercia] interests in Australia, and if an honourable member seeks information from the Government in connection with the note issue, he is told that that Department is under the control j f a Board which was appointed by a previous Government, and concerning it we know very littlea position not justiWhy, then, fied.

I have never forgotten those words. Since the last Labour Government went out of office, numerous Boards and Commissions have been appointed, and the power of Parliament has been frittered away by its successors.

234,Mr Mcgbath,They are providing,45,Honourable Members Hear Hear
235,Mr West,"That has already beenunjustifiable expenditure in connection with bhe appointment of Boards over which Parliament has no control. Even if administration were cheaper under a system of Boards, I would be opposed to the principle. Parliament is responsible for the taxation imposed, and, therefore, should control all expenditure. Do honourable members overlook the fact bhab bhey are senb here by their constituents to assist in controlling expendiing over the work of the country to Comture? If the people in New South WalesI cannot speak for the other Stateshad bhe opporbuniby they would dispense with the Railways Commissioners, and allow the railways to be controlled by a Minister. The action of the Government in appointing a resident Director of Works at Canberra was first suggested by the Public Accounts Committee. Colonel Owen is a capable and enthusiastic officer, will abolish them and return to a sane and is in every way qualified to carry oub the imporbanb work which he is now undertaking. Sitting mspended from 6.SO to S -p.m. rights of Parliament is bad enough, but there is a further objection that commissions do not carry out their work efficiently. They do not act in accordance with the. wishes of Parliament. Members on this side of the House have never been in favour of handing over the destinies of Australia to a Commission. Take, for instance, the War Service Homes Commission. No member of bhis House, nor of bhe public, can contradict me when I say that I have as, good a knowledge of the maladministration of the War Service Homes Commission as has any man. I have had an exceptionally favorable opportunity to gather information on that subject, and I have exercised my abilities, and used my knowledge as a contractor and journeyman, just as freely as if it had been a business of my view. own. I , and I think other members of the Public Accounbs Commitbee, have come to the conclusion that, had the War Service Homes administration not been placed under the control of a Commission, but had been in the hands of the Works and Railways Deparbmenb, greaterefficiency would have been secured. The staff of the Department could have been enlarged, and certain men could have been promoted to fill the new positions. We ought to encourage the promotion of men in Government Departments, rather than appoint outsiders to fill important positions. A boy entering a Government Department should have opportunities of promotion. If he is willing to make himself efficient in the Service, the highest positions should be open to him. The best positions should not be reserved for those who are born with silver spoons in their mouths. Members of this House are not fully alive to the danger of handmissions. I have been forced by my knowledge of Commissions to the conclusion that they are a dangerous obstacle to the progress of Australia. I am satisfied that if a change of Government takes place the incoming Government will have to consider very seriously whether it will allow these abominations to continue. I hope that it system of government. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lisber), in his criticisms of the work of public servants, only half stated the facts. Thab was a dangerous thing .for him to do. I advise him that when he wants bo make a statement he should get possession of all the facts, and not attempt to manipulate them for his purpose. It is a very serious thing for a member of this House to cast a reflection upon public servanbs, who have no opportunity to reply. Personally, I shall defend them against every attack made unjustly upon them. I should be unworthy of my position if I did mot. Honourable miembers will remember that a past Government decided to build Canberra on modern town-planning lines. Designs were called for all over the world, and ib was inbended bhat Canberra should be a ciby second bo none for beauty and utility. That action greatly increased the cost, but future generations will, commend that Government for its courage and breadth of The State of Victoria has at Morwell undertaken a large scheme for tlie supply of electrical energy. Members of the Public Accounts Committee recently . inspected the works, which are under the direction of Sir John Monash, with a view to seeing whether they could glean any information which would be of assistance in connection with the development of Canberra. We were told that it was a very cosbly scheme. The people of Vicboria do nob ""know what ib will cost.",45,Honourable Members Hear Hear
236,Mr West,"-The abrogation of theAlthough the expenditure .s heavy, ; benefits will be derived from it in the future. I shall endeavour to explain the facts regarding the cost of houses. Honourable members should obtain correct infefmatiou on such matters. The Public Accounts Committee has dealt with this subject in its report, which statesThe Parliamentary Standing Committee on (Public Works, while recently considering the .question of the erection of an omcers' hostel at Canberra, drew attention to the fact that at present the Commonwealth receives in rental for these dwellings 25 per cent, less 'than the estimated annual value, plus rates .and taxes. The decision authorizing this reduction was based upon a consideration of the increased costs of construction at Canberra, and of the fact that most of the tenants are omcers or employees who arc not in receipt of large incomes. The Government should have been the sole constructing authority, and the method of construction should have been day labour. One paragraph of the report justifies me in the conclusions I have drawn from my own personal experience. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) says the cost of the Does the honourable member for Corio construction of houses is excessive. It is disagree with that? He endeavoured to only those who know nothing 'if the facts create the impression that officers of the who talk such gibberish, but tlieir stateCrown residing in the Capital City were ments do not appeal to any man who being given a 25 per cent, advantage. knows anything of the subject. paragraph to which I refer saysThe necessity for a dc-fmite and continuous programme of building construction was emphasized more than once during the course of the Committee's inquiry, and specific cases were brought under notice where competent bricklayers and other tradesmen, after completing a particular job, had to be put off bewhich are essential to modern convenience cause further work was not available. Such men, on leaving the Territory, would naturally prejudice others against accepting employment there. The Government has already mad?, a move in the As the result of the observations of the Committee when it made an inspection prior to the preparation of the report, I 'believe the Chairman, when he returned to Melbourne, very rightly made certain recommendations to the Minister of ""Works, and a residential Director of Works was appointed. That was all that was required, and it is in accordance with constitutional government. The Director of Works is subject to the control of the Minister, who can advise him of the wishes of Parliament. A Commission, on the other hand, would be beyond Parliament, and would be capable of doing a lot of damage. I am satisfied that the appointment of an expensive Commission is absolutely unnecessary. able member. orable member for Corio( Mr Lister) showed that he had not read the report intelligently. He is opposed to the transfer of the Pederal Parliament to Canberra, and, as a biased man always does, he regards the matter in the wrong light. The report statesI t was explained to the Committee that as thc development of the Federal Capital proceeded it was realized that the cottages being erected hy the Government, and made available for the officers stationed there, were not strictly quarters for which a charge of 10 per cent, on salary was reasonable, and it was desired that some better return be secured to the Commonwealth on its outlay. At the same time, it was recognised that officers whose duties took them to Canberra in thc pioneering stages should not be placed at any financial disadvantage as compared with those residing in the capital cities. The Under the heading, ""Committee's Observations and Recommendations,"" the report statesThe establishment o£ Canberra as the Federal Capital of the Australian Commonwealth, planned as a garden city, has aSorded an exceptional opportunity for the exercise of foresight in the provision of those services and comfort. Road-making, water supply, sewerage, storm-water drainage, electric power and lighting, and other services are being provided ahead of settlement, and are being designed to meet the ultimate need of a modern city, although in the first decade right direction. actual requirements may be but a fractional part of the completed project. In approaching tbe question of a basis for assessing rentals at Canberra, the Committee has had to keep thia aspect in mind. It is obviously impossible, and would be quite unfair, to expect a small, initial population-the majority of whom would be public servants compulsorily residing at the Seat of Government-to carry the burden. D i d the honourable member for Corio read that portion of the report? I am quite sure he did not read a line of it . Further on the report statesThe Committee is of opinion that residential accommodation at the Federal Capital, whether in cottages or in hostels, should be maintained on a strictly commercial basis.",46,Honourable Members Hear Hear
237,Mr Lister,I agree with the honor,47,Honourable Members Hear Hear
238,Mr West,"The remarks of the honThe business members of. this House surely cannot object to that. The report continuesOn the other hand, officers employed, at Canberra during the initial stages: of its. development should, uot be expected! to suffer pecuniary loss by reason of their compulsory transfer to the Seat of Government; and' the Committee recommends that a scale of allowances be instituted which will compensate them for any such disability. The reason for that recommendation was that the. Committee thought that omcers should not be penalized because of the necessity for transferring them from their present location to the Federal Capital. Corio did not read that portion of the report, otherwise he. would not have said, that officers at Canberra were privileged to the extent of 25 per cent., which the taxpayers had. to pay. Before any honourable member makes a statement he .should have some knowledge of the facts, and should not draw entirely upon his imagination. The following portion of the report is very interestingThe assessment of rentals involves the question of rates for water supply, sewerage, &c. At first sight the capital cost of these works appears out of all proportion to the. population to be served, hut, as already stated, the main engineering works have been installed with a large ultimate population in view. It is not to be expected, therefore, that the small initial population should pay the interest and sinking fund charges on such outlay. Someloss is inevitable in the initial' stages of a scheme of this magnitude designed many years in advance. The Committee is oS opinion that, so far as the early residents bf the Capital are concerned, they should bear only a pro rata charge calculated on the basis of tlie population for which the respective engineering works have been schemed. The annual loss on the services, would thus decrease in proportion to the increaseof settlement. That recommendation come of the examination not only in the Federal Capital, area, but also in various municipalities. confident be agreed that we adopted a very broad and sensible view. This afternoon honourable Gregory) that ib was not necessary on this to deal wibh certain items of expenditure, because further opportunity be afforded when the Estimates were being considered. similar to that witnessed when last year's Estimates Mr West. there will be very littl e opportunityfo r any honourable member to discuss a number of items.

If such enormous powers as are proposed under the Bill are conferred upon the Commission, honourable members who subsequently desire to be enlightened concerning affairs at Canberra will be told by the Grovernment that they must shut their eyes, open their mouths, and swallow whatever is given them. The Commonwealth Director of Works (Colonel Owen) is a most efficient officer, not aware of the fact that the party and is qnite able to undertake the responsibility of supervising the constructional work. After the exhaustive inquiry made by the Public Accounts Committee the Government should have no doubt upon the matter. Colonel Owen has given faithful and assiduous service. I should advise the Government to increase his emolument, and place him in charge of the whole of the works. Does any honourable member support the action of the Shipping Boardi n granting Christmas holiday pay to all the permanent officers at Cockatoo Island Dockyard when the labourers in the yard were not granted one day's pay? That is the sort of thing one may expect from administration by a Board. It means class distinction all along the line, and the "" bottom dog"" is not recognised as having thc rights of an ordinary human being. I do not think the Prime Minister will have the temerity to admit in this House that he is in favour of such a distinction being made. No member of the Ministry would have the courage to support such a course of action. When the responsibility has been thrust upon a Board, Ministers are glad to brush the matter aside as no concern of theirs. I am afraid that what I have said will be lost on the Government. the Corner party are afraid to take action in connection with the proposed Commission, and Ministers themselves are nervous lest the members of that party bring them to book. If only the press of Australia would rally to the cause of the people most telling articles could be published pointing out the fallacy of government by Boards. Every responsible newspaper knows that administration by this means is a delusion and a snare. The literary staffs of the newspapers of Australia include men of high calibre and honour, and I hope that they will render service to the people as a whole by vigorously protesting against this method of administration. Amongst the first words uttered this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) was the statement that he hoped the Bill would be discussed in a non-party spirit. I should share his wish with greater confidence were I opposite has already made up its mind to vote solidly against the Bill. numbers go up. Honourable members seem to be concerned about handing over the control of the Federal Capital Territory to a Board instead of adhering to the present arrangement of dual control by Departments with conflicting interests. I listened to the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), and 1 concluded that his argument was entirely in favour of the constitution of a Commission such as is suggested by the Government. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) stated that he wished to praise the action of the Government iu expediting the work at Canberra. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) made a similar assertion, and I give both honourable members praise for rendering credit where it is due. If the Government has earned the praise of honourable members opposite, Ministers can surely be trusted to consummate the work that has been so well begun. Operations at the Federal Capital are progressing, and honourable members who have not recently visited Canberra would be amazed at the strides made Members of in all classes of work. Sewer construction has been so far advanced that the main tunnel is almost completed. The water supply is ready in most places for connection to the houses in course of construction or to be built, and the electric light service is available. Soon there will be notices to send out and rates to be collected.

The history of the development of Washington is on all fours with that of Canberra, even to the dismissal of the engineer whose design for the construction of the Capital was accepted. In course of time, the Parliament of the United States of America was asked to agree to a motion similar to that passed in this House last session, stipulatthe Department of Home and Territories. ing that the Parliament should meet at the new Capital within a certain time.

I have nothing but praise for Mr Goodwin. He has done good work, and I hope that such officers will remain at Canberra to help consummate the present plan; but there should be some authoriby ab the Pederal Capital with power to administer the law. We are dependent, at present, upon New South Wales for the maintenance of law and order there. The Commonwealth is dependent upon the State Departments of New South Wales for police and educational services. Certainly the teacher at present stationed at Canberra is a credit to the Education Department, and the school is as good as any other State school in Australia. But there are many matters of administration which require quick decision upou the spot. I know of a man living in a Government cottage on the Yass-road whose gate came off its hinges, but he. was not allowed to touch it. He had to refer the matter of its repair to A local administrator would be able to deal with this and with many other matters on the spot without any of the red tape incidental to dual and centralized conbrol. There are members on' all sides of the House who have worked hard to consummate the Canberra proCentralization in administraject, but upon this proposal to appoint a Commission we hold different opinions.

I hope it will always be animated by national ideals, and that it will look at every question with a proper regard for the welfare of the .nation as a whole. It is not desirable to bring the Commonwealth Parliament down to the level of a shire council, that attends to roads and bridges, but that must be the effect of bringing all pettifogging details of Canberra administration into this Chamber for discussion.

To-day there are probably not more than 150 permanent residents at Canberra, but the time -will soon arrive for the creation of an elective municipal authority to control the city. In the meantime a Commission is necessary to administer municipal affairs and the ordinances of the Territory. We all have complained because land ordinances have not been issued, and the land has not been thrown open for selection. I believe the Government were wise in deferring selection. I understand that there will be an obligation on the purchaser of a block of land to commence building within twelve months. It would not have been fair to have allowed selection twelve months ago and compelled the leaseholder to build when there was no population in the city. to auction the leases at an early date, and who will administer the ordinances governing them? Are honourable members satisfied that existing Departments, Avhich already have their hands pretty f u l l of work throughout the Commonwealth, can yet find time to attend to the details of territory administration? Surely a Commission is needed until such time as the population of Canberra is large enough to elect a municipal body. All supporters of Canberra hope that there, will be a big population there at an early date. I expect that there will be 5,000 people permanently residing at Canberra within three years water power, sewerage, and roads prober is very sanguine. based upon the report of the Advisory Committee. To the honourable' member for Corio( Mr Lister) and others who think as he does Canberra is like a red rag to a bull; they are opposed to everything connected with it. That attitude is not fair. I give due credit to those honourable members who were opposed on principle to the creation of a Federal Capital. If I had been a member of the Federal Convention that drafted the Constitution, or of the earlier Parliaments that had to choos& a site for the Federal Capital, I would have favoured the selection of some large town or city, and converted it into a Federal Capital would hold controlling officers responsible rather than create a new city in an unfor bhe successful couduct of their Depopulated area. But we have an obligapartments, and if a man failed I would tion to carry out the compacts that have Washington is still controlled been made by thos© who preceded us. Mr Lis TEE.'-No time limit is specified for the creation of the Federal Capital. argument too often. The honprable member is for ever saying that the time is not yet ripe. There is' no time like th© present. If a thing has to be done, do it now. The creation of th© Federal Capital is like the standardization of railway gauges in that the longer it is left the more costly it will be. Our obligations have to be faced. What is the use of shilly-shallying and throwing upon the shoulders of posterity a responsibility that belongs to us? Every member of this National Parliament should take a personal pride in making the Federal Capital the finest city in Australia. It is a project for the service of not only the present generation but of posterity The Government proposes also. This Parliament calls for men of vision. Members who have not vision are wasting their own time and that of their constituents. Let us take the broad Australian point of view. AlthoughI represent a Sydney constituency I recognise that the men who are tilling the soil are the backbone of the country. W© are all trying to help the men upon the soil to establish themselves, and by their production make the country more wealthy. Let us help along the Federal Capital scheme in the same national spirit. No city in the world started under such favorable conditions as Canberra. What other city in Australia had electric light, vided in advance of settlement? Those services ar© in existence at Canberra, and some authority is required for th© levying of taxation, th© collection of revenue, and the control of expenditure. Th© honourable member for Barton( Mr F. McDonald) expressed a fear that if a Commission were appointed those public servants who were transferred to its control would lose some of the benefits of the Public Service Act, but a clause of th© Bill definitely provides that they shall retain all existing and aecrued rights. . Apart from that, more Departments and employees of th© Commonwealth Government are outside the Public Service Act and regulations than are inside.",50,Honourable Members Hear Hear

258,Mr Marr,"I do not think it is. Isack him and appoint another mau who would make the Department a success. At the present time a Public Service Commission controls all appointments, promotions, and reductions in the Service. . But the person most fitted to judge the worth or worthlessness of an officer is his departmental head. Unfortunately in the service there is dual control and triple control. officers for the faults that are inherent in the existing system. Years ago I was a member of the Public Service; I do not regret the experience, but I shall take care that nobody over whom I have authority shall ever enter the Service. Whilst the public servant is not exactly a slave, it is a fact that the system destroys his initiative. A man's spirit is stifled by red tape before he has been in the Service twelve months. That is the curse of the system. We have an opportunity of removing that curse from the administration of Canberra by placing in charge men to whom Parliament can say, "" You are expected to make a success of this project. Australia, and Parliament will .see that your work is recognised."" Parliament will retain control, for every year the Commissioners will have to submit their estimates and reports to this House. We shall have a perfect right to discuss how they, shall raise and expend money. The Shipping Board, to which reference has beeu made, is on a footing entirely different from that of the proposed Commission. Certain assets were handed over to the Board, and it was told to make the Commonwealth shipping enterprise pay or it would be wiped out. The Pederal Capital Commission will still be under the control of the Treasurer, it will still be supervised by the Auditor General, and it will have to submit reports and estimates to Parliament every year. many officers to do all that. man, I should be prepared to lay five to one that as a result of co-ordination of work, the proposed Commission could reduce the staff at Canberra by 25 per cent. able to deal with questions on the spot and at once, and matters will not require to he sent from one Department to another as at present. that the appointment of the proposed Commission will lead to a reduction in the staff at Canberra. A good deal has been said in comparing day labour with contract labour, and as I believe in giving credit where credit is due, I am bound to say that work carried out at Canberra by day labour has been done in excellent fashion, and more cheaply than it would have been done by contract. I do not blame the There is in charge of the sewer channel at Canberra an excellent man named Dillon. He completed the first part of the channel, and then the late Government decided to call for tenders for the second section. The man in charge of the day-labour workers on the job asked to be allowed to submit a price for the second section. That was denied him because he could not be financed, 'but I believe the Minister. for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart) will confirm the statement that his estimated price for -carrying out the second part of the work was £28,000 lower than the lowest tender submitted for it. He was given the job, and has saved the Department about £30,000 Some of the work done Build a city worthy of by day labour at Canberra stands to the credit of those who did it. There are Of course, no better bricks made in Australia than those which are produced at Canberra. Mr Griffin's plans required the removal of a certain hill. It would have cost a great deal to remove the hill, but the Department concerned established the Canberra brick works close to the hill, > and proceeded to make bricks out of material removed from it . The ex-Minister for Works and Railways, the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), referred to the cost ' of the carriage of coal to Canberra. Newcastle coal costs, at Canberra, probably more than it costs at Melbourne, because it has to be carried there by rail, and the rail carriage of coal is very expensive. We have a power house at Canberra which is a monument to the people who built it . It supplies power and light to the neighbouring town of Queanbeyan. When our employees go into their houses at Canberra they will find sewerage, light, and water services provided for them. I have only one fault to find with the houses that have been erected there, and it is that they have been built The Commissioner's staff will be too closely upon an English design, and insufficient verandah space has been provided for.

260,Mr Marr,"If I were a bettingview to looking for faults. I believe that the appointment of a Commission, or a -Commissioner, to administer Canberra will be a step in the right direction. If we do not appoint a Commission it will be imperative to give those who are now administering the Federal Territory more power than they at present possess. When one visits Canberra and stands on the top, of Camp Hill or Kurrajong, and looks around the Territory, he looks into the future. If he does not possess a national outlook or broad vision he should not be assisting in the building of the city. cemetery he will find that an old lady was buried there 64 years ago, and on her tombstone are the words: "" Here we have no abiding city, but we seek one to come."" Those words are prophetic of the city that Canberra will yet be. The obligation is upon us, as representatives of the people of Australia, to visualize the city to come at Canberra and to build there, not for to the bank and will hand the territory back day, but for all time. We hope that continuous employment offering at Canberra will lead to settlement, and that will be promoted by the appointment of the proposed Commission. I have nothing to say against Melbourne as the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. I have said before, and repeat now, that if the Seat of Government had been established in Sydney, that probably would have been attended with worse results than have followed its establishment in Melbourne. I say this, because there are bigger financial and commercial interests in Sydney than there are here. This is proved by the fact that between 50 and 60 per cent, of our taxation revenue is derived from New South Wales; 48 per cent of the taxation on land and 46^ per cent, of the income tax comes from that State. These figures speak for themselves, but I hope that in New South Wales we have learned to look upon Australia as our land and not only New South Wales. We look at Commonwealth matters with broad vision. I hope that we shall all view Canberra in the same way, and will assist to make the Federal Capital a city worthy of the people of Australia. first. argument is like that of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), who says that the time is not yet ripe for Canberra. [23] Let me inform honourable members that at the present time we are paying £28,000 a year in rent for Central Administration offices in Melbourne. If we capitalized that £28,000 and put -the money into buildings at Canberra, honourable members would see how much we should have over for administrative offices. By letting land at from Is. to 4s. per acre at present we are receiving a revenue of over £30,000 a year from the Federal Capital Territory. What is the revenue from the Territory going to be when we sell leases of land there by auction? I am reminded of a If a visitor goes to the statement made by the late Sir Denison Miller, whom I consulted on this question. He said, "" Let the Government give me the Canberra Territory for 20 years, and I will build them a Parliament House costing £2,000,000, put up the houses they require, present them with all necessary administrative offices, and at the same time. I will make a very good dividend for to the Government in 20 years' time."" If we are getting a revenue of £30,000 from the Federal Capital Territory to-day when nothing is being done to develop it, how much may we not expect to get when we do develop it? I believe we shall get such prices for leases of land there that we shall be able to pay more than interest, working expenses, and depreciation on buildings and machinery. come from ? it is cheaper to live on the money of other people than on one's own. The man who wipes off the debt on his home when he could do better by putting his money into his business is a fool. I do not believe that this Bill will deprive Parliament of any of its power. If I thought it would I should not vote for it. The Commission, which will really be a Commonwealth Department, will be obliged to refer everything to Parliament.

Why cannot we trust this Commission in the same way ? (he present control ? What is wrong with it? lacking in that it cannot administer municipal laws. In the near future there will be a municipal council at Canberra, but the number of permanent residentsabout 200-ther e now is hardly sufficient for us to set up such a body.

There are honourable members who know more about municipal government than I do. They know very well the functions carried out by State Parliaments. I hope thab bhe Pederal Parliamenb will never become a roads and bridges, ababtoirs, and sewers Parliament. ""Yet a body capable of dealing with such matters is essential at Canberra. A few weeks ago I saw some of the roads and bridges built in the Pederal Territory. They are worthy of bhe Deparbmenb bhab has builb them, but all these things must be administered.

276,Mr Marr,"I am not. I have justthe B ill ; and if little rumours whicli are Parliament within the last few years is circulating are correct, we may have two or three others from that side of the Houso voicing the same opinion as was expressed by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister). I am opposed to this measure, as I believe that Parliament should retain to the fullest extent all its existing powers. Some of us remember the magnificent' oratory to which we listened on the occasion of the laying of the first foundation stone at Canberra. It was then predicted that the new Capital City would be a model for all Australia, and even the whole world. If Canberra is to be such a model city, Parliament should exercise the fullest control over it . Instead of retaining that control, we are asked to hand over to this Commission very drastic powers. We have only to. look at sub-clause 2 of clause 5, which readsThe Commission shall be a body corporate, witli perpetual succession and a common seal, and may acquire, hold, and dispose of real and personal property, and shall be capable of suing and being suedto see that. That clause shows the powers which this Parliament-the elected representatives of the people of Australia*-is asked voluntarily to hand over to a Commission. It is all very well for the M in ister to say that Parliament w ill retain very great powers, but we shall find that many things will be done by the Commission with which Parliament might not agree, but concerning which it will be absolutely powerless, because it wil l be too late to alter what has been done. The argument that this business could be better handled by a Commission reminds' us of some of the Commissions which have been appointed by this Parliament in the past. Some of us have bitter recollections of the enormous blunders made by the War Service Homes Commission in the earlier days of its existence; we meet with them every day. When individual members are consulted by returned soldiers who want some concession in respect to their homes, and bring the cases before the Government, we are told that already the War Service Homes Commission has been too costly a creation, and that too great a sum of money has been spent. We know that the enormous losses which were incurred were due to the War Service Homes being originally under the War Service Homes Commission instead of Parliament retaining greater control over them. Our experience of .many of the Commissions appointed by the Pederal not such as to create in us a desire for the appointment of other Commissions with wide powers. In the teeth of considerable opposition, I have at all times in my own State supported the building of a Federal Capital. Outside of New Soutli Wales the people of Australia are not so keen on the building of the Federal Capital as are those resident in the Mother State. That is only natural; but I have always maintained that Parliament shall observe the condition laid down when we entered into Federation, namely, that a capital city should be established in New South Wales. I have had great difficulty in making the electors of Tasmania understand the necessity for this new capital. I was in this Parliament when the first measure for the creation of a new capita^ city for Australia was introduced, and had I considered my individual opinion only T would have voted against it , as I did not think it necessary then. T do not know that it is really necessary now, but we must honour the compact made with New South Wales; and on every occasion that the question has come before Parliament I have voted in that direction. I shall have still greater difficulty in making the electors in my State understand the reason for the expenditure of another £7,000 .a year on this Commission. To me, the creation cf this Commission, of which the Chairman is to get £3,000 a year, and two other members £2,000 each, is an absolute waste of public money. sioners w ill only be the departmental heads. MrO ' KEEFE If one Commissioner only is appointed, he w ill probably be given a larger salary, although it may not cost the f u l l £7,000; but such Commissioner would still only be a head, and there would still have to be experts, and other officers and employees, in the various departments, the same as if there was no Commission at all. I cannot understand why this work cannot go on as at present for at least another two or. three years. there long before that; we shall be there next year.

If the Government does not consider the ""Works and Railways Department should have control, or if the interests of two Departments clash, what is to prevent the whole of the work being placed under' the control of the Home and Territories Department, _ and the expert official heads of that Department being in charge of the work as in the consider that years will elapse before the of necessity does not exist at present. I do not oppose the measure on party grounds, as, from my point of view, this is not a party measure at all. The whole of my actions respecting Canberra for a number of years have shown that, while the great majority of electors in Tasmania have always opposed the expenditure of even £ 1 on the desert city, or the bush capital, as it is called, I have continually tried to impress upon them the necessity for honouring the compact with New South Wales. tainly vote for the B ill if I thought that the creation of this Commission would facilitate the carrying out of that compact. Asi t will not, I do not feel inclined to vote for the second reading of the B ill . I wish to point out that, although clause 10 purports to protect the Government from maladministration on the-part of the Commission, the proposed safeguard is entirely insufficient. of clause 10 readsIf a Commissioner, or an Acting sioner, becomes in any way concerned or interested in any contract or agreement by or on behalf of the Commission, or in any way titled to participate, . in the profit of, arising member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons, he shall be guilty of an indictable offence. There is no safeguard in the clause to prevent any member of the Commission from furthering his own interests at the expense of the Commonwealth. be possible that, in an incorporated company consisting of , say, 26 persons, a Commissioner the shares. The clause is inserted palpably to prevent any member of the Commission from enriching himself at the expense of the general taxpayer; but it will Mr O'Keefe. at least require alteration, as, in its present form, it is no safeguard against corruption, such as that which the majority of people allege occurred in the early stages of the administration of the War Service Homes Department. I honestly believe that the appointment of the Commission will have no effect on the progress of the work at Canberra, and that the expenditure of £7,000 for the salaries of three Commissioners will be money wasted. There are thousands early days of Canberra? I of returned soldiers in Australia to-day who are claiming assistance from the necessity for the appointment Government. Many of these men, through this Commission .arises; that no fault of their own, are derelicts. The Government contend that the state of the finances w ill not permit them to assist these men to any great extent; therefore, we have to look very carefully into proposals such as this, -under which £7,000 per annum will be practically thrown away. In any case, a few heads of Departments will benefit by the expenditure. As has been interjected during this debate, when this Department is created it will grow to an enormous extent, just as many other Commonwealth I should cerDepartments have done. I wish to inform the House that I have been to Canberra, and, incidentally, that I have returned with a few impressions and a very bad cold. The cold I intend, if possible, to keep to myself, and the few impressions I shall endeavour to convey to the members of the House, if my limited vocabuSub-clause 2 lary will permit .'me to do so. Pirst of all, I wish to express my appreciation Commisof the services being rendered to Australia by those in charge bf made the operations at Canberra.

I am not old enough, I suppose, to have a wide vision, but probably when I am older my vision will expand; bub at prest/nt I cannot visualize with the honourable member.

Respecting the day-labour system, my experience has been that under good control men w ill do more by the day-labour system than they w ill do by the contract system. I do not care whether the leader of the men be called a Minister, a foreman, or a director. If he is the right man he w ill get good work out of the men. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) said today that the contract system was simply the day-labour system, plus the contractor's profits, and I believe, in some instances that that is so. It is a great thing that the directors of the work at Canberra have confidence in the Minister. It is a still greater thing that the foremen have confidence in the directors. The greatest thing of all is that the workers have confidence in the foremen. I am opposed to the appointment of this Commission, because I think it is quite unnecessary, and is an altogether useless expense. It may k ill the enthusiasm at present being displayed. The work is being carried on more economically than would be possible under a Commission. The suggestion that the officers at present in control should be given a little more power may be wise.

The erection of the Capital is at present being eai'ried out in the most expeditious way, and there is no need for the appointment of a Board of Commissioners. If I can be persuaded that if the Seat of Government is transferred as is snggesbed, a national Australian sentiment w ill be created in such a way that we w ill be able to rise to the occasion, shoulder our responsibilities, and dispense w i th party bickering, I shall be one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the project. quite understand, as the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) has said, that one has to have a "" vision "" to appreciate the value of the Capital city.

The real truth is that the electors, who sent us here, do not know tbe extent to which money is being wasted at Canberra. I have no desire to request. criticize the general lay-out of the city. It may be all right, but when I was there the section of the Molonglo River, forming part of the artificial lakes scheme, was a series of little billabongs, and there sees during the summer in the River time.

There we have also a dam and an artificial lake, and lately the authorities have been pumpthrough ing away deposits of silt known as Cohen's Island and Frank Moulden Peninsula, names given to these deposits of silt because civic fathers of that name allowed them to appear in the river. I feel sure that the same problems will present themselves in an aggravated form in connection with the ornamental lake That scheme at Canberra. In my opinion, the whole scheme is something in the nature of a bad dream, nnd the sooner we get rid of it the better for the people of Australia. Turning now to the sewerage system, I admit that the engineers have carried out a big job. There is no doubt that they have provided for posterity. The system is big enough to deal with the sewerage of There were at least a dozen almost any city in Australia. The main sewer is 5 f t . 6 in . high. I went down it. It is egg-shaped. Everything is up-to-date. All that is wanting is enough water to flush it .

I went down one of the sewer tunnels for about 200 yards. On the rock face side they have simply cemented the sides of the rock, but on the alluvial side tbe sewer is all timbered up, and the cement has been put over the timber.
