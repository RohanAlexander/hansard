0,"P.m., And Read Prayers. Minister Of External Affairs A Question Of A Non","party character. Will he kindly tell us how matters stand regarding the gift of the late Government-confirmed, I understand, by this Government-to the Palace of Peace at The Hague1 to look through the document, but I understand that it was about February that the suggestion that Australia should take part in the presentation of gifts by the countries of the world to the Palace of Peace at The Hague was acted on by the honourable member for Barrier. The High Commissioner was asked to inquire as to what form, having regard to the presentations of other countries, the Australian gift should take; and, in view of his answer, it was decided to present an office bureau table and a silver ink-stand. The silver for the ink-stand-abou t 270 ounces-wa s presented by the BrokenH i ll Mining Managers' Association, doubtless as the result pf a visit of the honourable member to the Barrier, and Australian wood of very fine quality has been obtained for the bureau table; but I have been informed by the A r t Advisory Board that it will take some time to finish this article of furniture. In due time the gift will be presented, and will symbolize the hope of the Australian people that the meek shall in due course come into their inheritance of the earth.. Igoiuse of i&epreaentatibes.

OLD-AGE PENSIONS. surer a question in regard to an old-age pensioner who, according to information I have received to-day, has had his pension reduced from 8s. to 3s. 3d., on the ground that his wife has some property. This pensioner has been living apart from his wife for nine years; and I should like to know, from the Treasurer, whether he can do anything in a case of that kindin a case where there is enmity between the husband and wife, and the latter will do nothing to assist the husband ? able member will let me have the particulars in writing, or in any other way, I shall be glad to lay the case before the Commissioner.

The proceedings during a portion of the time are open to the public, just as ours are. But when the Liberal delegates meet in Committee, they, exclude the press; and I can hardly think that the honourable member for Calare is so .simple as to believe that the delegates throughout the whole time carried on their proceedings in public. I draw his attention to a report published in the Melbourne Age on the 30thAugust, headed, "" Liberal Union Conference; Yesterday's Proceedings; Mr D. Gordon Elected President."" The report statesYesterday's deliberations at the annual Intertalists from introducing into Australia State Conference of the Australian Liberal Union were conducted in private. Gordon was elected President. If the honourable member turns to the Melbourne Herald of 29th August, he will see the heading ""Liberal Union; Annual Conference."" After some preliminary observations, the report says, '' The proceedings were conducted in private."" -Conferences are held mostly in private, a report of the proceedings is published. I ask the members of the Capitalist party -opposite whether there is going to be any report of the proceedings of the conference recently held at the Independent Hall? gained a certain amount of support from the misstatement published throughout Australia that our proceedings at these -conferences, at which the programme is -drawn up, are held absolutely in private, whilst the Liberal conferences, or, as I prefer to call them, the Capitalist conferences, are held in public. therefore, that the position should be explained. There is one advantage, Mr Speaker, about a debate on the Address-in-Reply, and that is that one may speak about anything without being pulled up by you, sir, with the question, "" Will the honourable member be good enough to connect his remarks with the question before the Chair?"" that my remarks may be of a somewhat -discursive character. First of all, I would say that this Australian National party, called the 'Labour party, deserved a better fate -at the last elections. We thought that ^we should still continue to occupy the Treasury bench. It must be admitted that honourable members opposite thought so too. We had done good work. We had a splendid political record. I invite honourable members to consider what that record is. First of all, when we were occupying positions on the Ministerial side, we had sufficient support in the Federal Parliament to enable us to carry out the plank in our platform in favour of the abolition of black slavery in Queensland. We did that with the aid of Mr Deakin, Mr Isaacs, Sir William Lyne, Charles Cameron Kingston, and other democratic Protectionists, who also enabled us to carry out the policy of this party of absolutely prohibiting the capiChinese, Japanese, Javanese, or any Mr David similar Asiatic labour.

We were able for the first time in Australian history to pass a law providing that there should be a minimum wage of £110 per annum for all persons over the age of twenty-one who had been in the PublicI t is well, Service three years. In 1901, when this law was passed, there were in the post office in New South Wales 203 men between thirty and forty years of age who were receiving only 30s. per week. Some of them were married men. As the Prime Minister was Postmaster-General in New South Wales, he will doubtless remember that fact. It is possible, therefore, had been over twenty years in the service, and who were receiving only 28s. per week. member for Grey says is, I believe, true.

There was another piece of national legislation brought forward by the Australian National party, and that was the measure to establish an Australian note issue. This party deserves the credit of that measure, notwithstanding the statement of the present Treasurer that it was amongst his papers when he left office some years ago. We do get credit from the opposing press sometimes, and I am very glad to embody in Hansard this statement from the Melbourne AgeIt stands to the credit of Labour that it was the first to utilize the public credit, and to reap the profit of it instead of leaving that profit to others. This money is now invested and bearing interest for the people instead of going into the coffers of the banks. I divide our legislation into two classes, namely, business legislation, to which I have been referring; and social, or humanitarian legislation-lik e the invalid and old-age pensions and the pension for the blind. legislation was the taking over of the Northern Territory and the building of 'self stated that we were like a lot of dinthe transcontinental railway. all the legislation which this party was has implied that we are the associates of able to pass when it sat on the other side tugs, thugs, spielers, whisperers, and tickof the House was of a national character. backers.

The kangaroo stamp is only a flimsy piece of gummed paper, but it still means a very great deal to the Australians. The Postmaster General, giving way to what he considered bo be public opinion, has adopted another design; but I look forward to the time when we shall not be so singular in adhering to one particular die, but will place on our postage stamps anything which is calculated to make Australians take a pride in their country. I even hope for the time to come when the photographs of some Australian statesmen, or of persons who have done good to their country in other walks of life, w ill appear on our postage He a r , hear !

The charge We have succeeded very well as a party, considering that we have had a political career of only about twenty years. I think that we should have succeeded to a greater extent but for the desertions from our ranks. Some very capable men have lef t our party and joined the ranks of our political enemies. I sometimes wonder to what extent the abuse to which we are subjected as a party and individually has been responsible for men leaving our ranks. I recollect the occasion when the leader of the Labour party in Queensland was described by a gentleman who occupies a very high position in Australia today as "" the associate of thieves.""

80,Mr Higgs,"The Prime Minister himtrouble to wire to the secretary of the Trades Hall, and I learn that there is absolutely no truth in the statement that there is any place in that building known as the "" thieves' gallery."" The fact that the Labour party is abused collectively and individually has, I think, had something to do with the desertion from our party of some most capable men. prepared to carry the burden of their association with the Labour party. No doubt they found that there was a certain social ostracism connected with it , and they were not prepared to tolerate it . Possibly they thought that they would be more comfortable in other spheres. Among these deserters is an ex-Queensland Premier and one or two other Ministers of the Crown. Quite recently Mr Beeby, in New South Wales, severed his connection with our party. But the most notorious desertion from our ranks is that of a man to whose history I would like briefly to refer. . This gentleman was born in Staffordshire, in the Black Country, England. Honourable members know what a reputation the Black Country has, because it is there that the Cradley Heath chain-makers eke out an existence. When a lad of ten years of age, he went to work in a mine there. I ask honourable members who are fathers to reflect how they would like a son of their own, at that age, to enter a mine and to do the work which was required of lads forty years ago. The lad to whom I refer was the present Prime Minister. No doubt he was then not a very robust boy. Possibly he was of very delicate constitution, certainly he was a very intelligent ladone who probably had a brow like the snowflakes and roses in his cheeks. A t ten years of age he was compelled to work from ten to thirteen hours a day in a mine, never seeing the sun except on Sundays, subject to all kinds of dangers, noxious gases, draughts, and, perhaps, falling rocks. He laboured thus in the Black Country until he was twenty-four years of age. More than any man in this House, therefore, he ought to know what tlie working classes in the mines of the Old Country have to suffer, and what the miners in Australia have to endure. A t this stage, perhaps, I may be pardoned for reading an extract from the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 1891-a n extract which I excised from that journal at the time. Mr Higgs. In that year there were several Labour members elected to the New South Wales Parliament, and a short history of each of them was published in the organ which I have mentioned. The extract referring to the present Prime Minister readsMr Joseph Cook (Free-Trade, Labour), senior member for Hartley, was born in North Staffordshire (in one of the coal-mining districts) They were not in December, i860. He began work in the pits at the early age of 10, and worked as a coal miner until about five years ago, when he came to New South Wales. After landing he went at once to Lithgow, and started in one of the local pits. He soon won the respect and acquired the confidence of the men there, and was elected general secretary to the Western Miners Association in January, 1889. He has held that position ever since, and has generally been recognised as one of the most intelligent men amongst the trade unionists of New South Wales. Mr Cook has represented the Western miners at various conferences in connection with Labour. In politics he was identified first with Protection, but, like many others in the Hartley district, was won over from that policy by the spread of the Georgian movement, and during the last two years has occupied a leading position in the Lithgow Single Tax League. Upon arriving in New South Wales at twenty-four years of age he straight away entered one of the coal mines at Lithgow. He was not there very long before he gained the confidence of his associates, who decided to appoint him check weighman-reall y a detective, whose duty it was to see that the men were not robbed by some of the "" rapacious coal-owners,"" as he himself has described them. The miners paid his wages. When the political Labour movement started in New South Wales, at the invitation of the daily press of the time, which objected to men exercising their right to strike, Mr Joseph Cook was selected as a Labour candidate for the representation of the district of Hartley. When it was suggested that a Labour candidate should enter the field, I can well imagine some of the old miners asking whether the individual who was to bear their standard was likely to prove true to them. When one looks through the history of the political Labour movement, one finds that there are dozens of individuals who have not proved true to those who were responsible for their election to Parliament. Some of the old hands, I dare say, asked if Mr Cook was likely to prove true to them, and they gave him the benefit of the doubt.

The Prime Minister, however, is welcome to his position. He is an ambitious man, and probably l e f t the Labour party because at that time he could see no possible chance of ever realizing his ambition. He is welcome to his position, bub I do not believe that he feels very comfortable in it . He occupies it only at the will of the Capitalist party, and if they dared they would make a change. We know that he only won his position by one vote in the Caucus held some time ago to elect a leader, and it was understood at the time that that decision was to be open to revision. Having won at the polls, however, the Capitalist party dare not shift him now, although they may attempt to do so at some time or other. The Prime Minister probably entertained the idea held by a Premier of Queensland, who was a former member of our party, that if he could only get into power he would be able to introduce some reforms. will never allow him to introduce any reform.

It is no use talking here of the sacred rights of property, about the people's castles, and so on. When you have those castles erected among squalid poverty they are not very safe, to say the least. people are patient beyond all possibility of conception. Many of them are dying quietly n this colony. . . . Because the outcry is not louder we take no notice. I am reminded of a statement that I read in one of the reviews that the dominant feature of the age is comfort. Everybody wants to live in a degree of comfort, and the moment they get into a state of comfort, respectability and decency, they seem to forget all about those not so well circumstanced as themselves. That, I fear, is the predominating idea among people in this country. We possess hundreds of millions of wealth, but there never was such squalid poverty here before. It is a glaring anomaly that with our boundless resources and possibilities for the creation of wealth, people have to stand idly by and perish in sheer destitution. Things have improved, to some extent, since 1893, but why ? Because the Labour party did not follow the Prime Minister's example, and join the capitalists, but continued to fight and work for a programme which has made a better state of things possible. In order to provide work for the 17,000 odd men who are reported to be out of employment, I am in favour of a revision of the Tariff at an early date. I do not agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Portsi n the attitude he takes up in relation to some of the manufacturers.

I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh on the question, and think that big incomes ought to be met with a heavy income tax and heavy proThese bate duties.

Mr Samuel Hordern died worth £3,000,000, but he lef t his large and wellstocked emporium; Mr WalterH a l l died worth £3,000,000, but lef t that and the Mount Morgan mine shares behind h i m ; and Mr Tyson when he died was worth £4,000,000 in pastoral lands, stock, &c.

Java, I remind honourable members, is about four days' sail from Australia. There are 30,000,000 of people there, and they are prepared to work for 3d. per day. Another picture shows a view of the foundry with the natives at work. Two natives, it is said, can do the work of one white man.

Australian National party, with its various sections in the State Parliaments, has succeeded in establishing-wit h the assistance, as freely admitted, of democratic kin, Charles Cameron Kingston, and othersa standard of comfort and of wages in Australia. See what we have succeeded in doing. I refer honourable members to pages 1130-3 of the Commonwealth Tear-Book, where they will see the rates of wages paid in the capital cities of Australia. Take furniture-makers, bedding-makers, cabinetmakers, chairmakers, frenchpolishers, and so forth. In Sydney they receive 64s. per week; in Melbourne, 60s.; in Adelaide, 56s.; in Perth, 69 s.; in Brisbane, 60s.; in Hobart, 57s.; mattressmakers are paid in Sydney 60s.; in Melbourne, 58s.; in Brisbane, 53s.; and so on. The list, which is a long one, includes timber-yard workers, the electrical trades, engineers, farriers, ironmoulders, iron-workers' assistants, sheet-metal workers, and so forth. I direct particular attention to the wages paid iu the engineering trades. Blacksmiths receive in Sydney 72s.; borers and slotters, 60s.; brassfinishers, 62s.; coppersmiths, 72s.; drillers, 50s.; fitters, 70s.; millers, 60s.; pattern-makers, planers, 60s.; shapers, 60s.; turners, 70s. Honourable members will be able to gain an idea from what I have quoted of the rate of wages paid throughout Australia, but let us take a country like Japan. The imports into Australia from Japan in 1891 were £52,887. In 1910 they were £718,462-a n increase in nineteen years of 1,350 per cent. What are the rates of wages paid in Japan? I have consulted the Japanese Year-Book for 1907, which is the latest copy I could obtain. Fromi t I take the following facts as to wages paid: Farm labourer, i8s. per year; silk spinner, 5id. per dav: gardener, I3$d. per day; fisherman, ro^d. per day; weaver, 8£d. per day; tailor (for Japanese dress), is. per day; tailor (for European dress), is. 4d. per day; shoemaker, is. 2^d. per day;, sake brewer, £ i is. 7d. per month; confectioner, 8£d. per day; tobacco cutter, is^d. per day; carpenter, is. 3d. per day; plasterer, is. 3d. per day; stone cutter, is. 6d. per day; sawer, is. 2$d. per day; tileroofer, is. 4<1. per day; bricklayer, is. s f d . per day; shipbuilder, is. 4d. per day; cabinetmaker, is. if d . per day; cartmaker, is. o|d. per day; harness-maker, is. 3^-d. per day; laquerer, is. o^d. per day: jeweller, is. i d . per day; blacksmith, is. i j d . per day; potter, n £ d . per dav; oil presser, io£d. per day; papermaker, 8d. per day; type-setter, io£d. per day; printer, qid. per day; day-labourer, io£d. per day; male servant, 7s. i | d . per month. Such are the wages paid in Japan; and the patriotic capitalists of Great Britain. Germany, France, and other countries are prepared to send their money into Japan to establish factories there for the production of goods to be imported to Australia, or anywhere else where they can be sold. Does any one wonder that this party is opposed to the capitalists whom honourable members opposite represent? I wish to say a word or two to the farmers' representatives.

There are one or two other matters on which I would have liked to speak, but my time is too limited. I am in favour of increasing the land tax. A t the present time, the land-owner pays on an estate over £5,000 in value and up to £15,000 I d . in the £ 1 . Suppose that a man has an estate valued at £80,000. He pays 6d. in the £ 1 on £5,000, 5d. on £15,000, 4d. on £15,000, 3d. on £15,000, 2d. on £15,000, and I d . on £10,000. We made a great mistake in not framing the law so that a man with £80,000 worth of land should pay 6d. in the £ 1 on the total value, less the £5,000 exemption. That is a proposal which I make to honourable members if we get a chance of occupying the Treasury bench again, and my reason is that the land tax, although some honourable members have opposed it and complained about it , does not touch certain country in Queensland. ""There are certain towns like Clermont, in Capricornia, which are surrounded by the most beautiful land-lan d which, if it were in Victoria, near a railway, would bring £ 5 0 an acre, but which at present is valued at about £ 1 an acre, and escapes the land tax to a large extent. We want to increase the tax on the big estates, and compel the owners either to use them to better advantage or to let other persons use them. Some of the towns in the Western District, in Queensland, are unable to extend on account of the huge land monopoly, which cramps them in every way. tunity of increasing the tax, and of making those gentlemen put their land to better use. I would, if I had the opportunity, amend the Constitution in several respects. I would alter the provision with regard to the Governor General, so that His Excellency should be, not a gentleman appointed from abroad, but an Australian born, or a person who had been resident here for a number of years. I take the view that the Australian boy ought to have an opportunity to work his way up to the highest position in the land, but that he cannot do at present. Prime Minister when he saidIt seems to me that the better way to harmonize colonial with Imperial interests would be to allow the people of the colonies to select Y o u were saying that it a. Governor General of their own, who would be in touch with the aspirations of those people, who would know what their prejudices and aspirations are, and what their conditions of life are, more intimately and closely by reason of I will not go into that his having lived there a great number of years himself. No doubt it will be some time before the Constitution is altered in that respect. It w ill not be so altered in my time, probably, but, in my opinion, it will be altered some day, and an opportunity will be given to the Australian boy to work his way up to the top of the tree, and to some Australian girl to occupy the position of wife to the Governor General. I would make another alteration in the Constitution, and that is to provide for the nationalization of hospitals. I believe that the public would agree to the nationalization of hospitals and health. will A t every hospital we ought to have doctors employed by the State. Under the present system there are thousands of doctors who have not enough to do, and really the incentive to the doctor is not to cure a patient. I do not want to do an injustice to an honourable profession, because there are thousands of doctors who do a great deal of work for the community and for poor persons without receiving any remuneration. It would be better for the doctors themselves, as well as for the community, if health were nationalized. We could better deal with the maternity allowance if the hospitals were nationalized. A t the present time, no mother cares to go to a hospital, because a stigma of pauperism is attached to the fact, but if it were understood that the hospitals were State institutions, and I hope that we w ill get an opporthat there was no lowering of a person's status in the community in going to a hospital, it would be better, I believe, for the community. The effect of the maternity allowance in Queensland has been, so I am informed, that some nurses, who used to charge £ 2 2s., have now in creased their fee to £ 5 5s. It may be that these aire isolated cases. I am sorry that I have no time to deal with the question of the cost of living and the fixing of prices; I shall have to wait for a future occasion. As I said, we as a party have no reason to feel disheartened at our removal from the I agree with the Treasury bench. We may not be able to get back there for a few months, or, perhaps, for a few years, but I think the Capitalist party in Australia can rest as-",26,Value Of Direct Oversea Imports

133,Mr Higgs,"sured that when 912,000 persons voted for the Labour party, with its advanced programme, in spite of abuse and misrepresentation, it is very unlikely indeed that the party who now hold the Treasury bench are going to stay there for any length of time. I desire to make a few observations before I deal with the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition and the document which has been laid before the House by cne Government; I do not know whether to call it a statement of policy or not. Reference has been made to the length of this debate, but I find that in the first session of the first Parliament the House put up a record. In the session of 1901 the debate on the Address-in-Reply was spread over a period of four weeks. the session of 1910 the debate lasted from the 1st to the 19th July. In the session of 1911 the debate lasted from the 5th to 19th September, and was finished by you, sir, in magnificent style. of 1912 the debate extended from the 19th June to the 11th July, or a period of three weeks aud two days. sion we have not yet reached the record of the last session of the last Parliament, but. by this evening we shall have occupied three weeks on this debate. more numerous in this Parliament than it was in the last one. that some of those who are complaining of the length of the present debate were the chief offenders in previous sessions in delaying the House from getting to business. In the session of 1912 their speeches covered 788 pages of Hansard, and I do not think that when the record of the present debate is made up, that record will be beaten. week we had very short sittings. have passed a SupplyB ill , and quite a number of questions of great importance have been discussed. member think that we shall get to a vote ? ber of honourable members upon this side of the Chamber who have not yet contributed to the debate, and, including the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, there is an even dozen. I do not know how many honourable members opposite intend to speak wish to speak, but the Caucus will not allow them to do so. graph of the Government policy reference is made to the question of electoral reform. The Government, and the press which represents their views, have attempted to make a great deal of capital out of the few irregularities which occurred during the taking of the heaviest poll which has yet been recorded in the Commonwealth. A t the general elections in 1903, I find that 887,312 electors exercised the franchise; at the 1906 elections, 1,059,168 electors voted; at the 1910 elections, 1,403,976 persons voted; and at the In recent elections, 2,030,000 electors voted. Thus, more than 600,000 votes were recorded in excess of the number registered on any previous occasion. Seeing that so many votes were cast, the marvel to me In the session is that more mistakes were not made. I have no sympathy whatever with the charges of fraud which have been hurled In this sesabout promiscuously in connection with the recent elections. I quite agree with the utterance of the Leader of the Opposition, who, the moment those charges were formulated, declared .that he could Opposition is not for a moment believe that even a section of the people of Australia had suddenly become corrupt. It behoves us to I find think a good deal before we give expression to views which are calculated to place Australia in an improper light before the world. Occasionally we suffer from the publication of exaggerated views, and thus a distinct harm is done to the country in which we live. Other nations are much more careful in this respect. If they discover any defects in their business methods, or in their legislation, they endeavour to remedy those defects without proclaiming them to the world. But in Australia, if any slight defect be disclosed, for example, in connection w it 1, our export of produce, the press of this country, and sometimes even responsible W h e n does the honourable Ministers, are inclined to publish them broadcast. Only a few persons can be I counted the numblamed for theso offences, and they should be punished. But no industry should be penalized as the result of exaggerated statements.

142,Mr Fenton,"In the first parawhich was held into the votes cast at the recent election for Maribyrnong, I at' once came to the conclusion that the charges of corruption, which had been circulated wholesale, were utterly without foundation. I found, for instance, that there was one elector in my constituency whose name was ticked off as having voted twice. He is one of the most respected clergymen in the. district. I am satisfied that he would never attempt to vote twice, and it would be absolute folly for any individual to attempt to impersonate such a well-known man. Another gentleman who is credited with having voted twice is a superintendent of police. The same remark is applicable to a sergeant of police, and to certain members of the Women's National League. I do not believe that any of these in dividuals voted twice, nor do I think that anybody attempted to impersonate them. But despite the disclosures made as the result of the inquiry into alleged electoral irregularities, the press of this State persists in declaring that there were 5,700 duplicate votes recorded. I say that in most of the investigations which have taken place, it has been conclusively proved that there was little or no duplication of votes, and that the charges made regarding electoral irregularities are ill influenced in this connection by his assofounded. In connection with the question of electoral reform, I propose to quote an extract from a speech which was delivered by the honourable member for Grampians a little while ago. That speech is reported in the AvocaFree Press and Farmers' and Miners' Journal, published in July of the present year. In passing, I would direct attention to the fact that si nee the general elections the honourable member has been very much in the company of the Prime Minister. A t Kyneton the other night the Prime Minister was once more at a social gathering in company with tbe two Irvines. He saidThe two Irvines seem to gravitate together, Liberal. The great majority are Conserand the more he saw of them, together or apart, the more he liked them. That is all very well. He may like them, can inflict any damage upon the party and he may pay considerable regard to with which I am associated is by limiting the suggestions caucus. It is idle for honourable members sion of opinion which I have already opposite to deny that they meet caucus, because, as a matter of fact, they might expect to hear prior to a very prohave already decided many of the most nounced proposal being placed before this important questions which could be dealt Parliament. However, to be forewarned with by a Caucus. Mr Fenton. casual reference was made to this utterance by the honourable member for Grampians, who then stated that he was not sure that he had made the observations attributed to him, but as he was reported to have made them, he supposed that he must have done so. He saidAt the present time they had universal suffrage. If it was proved to work for the good of the people it would be all right. However, he thought it would be better to take the ratepayers' roll for electing members of Parliament. The man in the street should not have a vote if he is on the ratepayers' roll. The waster, the loafer, and the beer-sparrer should be debarred from voting. Why should such men be placed on the same standing as those who are industrious and a credit to the nation? I take serious objection to any such expression of opinion. In the very same hall, the honourable member for Kennedy and myself placed before the people of Avoca the true gospel, and dealt with the gentleman from whom those remarks emanated. I can assure honourable members that the people of that town do not appreciate expressions of opinion such as that which I have quoted. They believe in universal suffrage. They say that successive Parliaments have been elected upon that principle. I would like to know whether the Prime Minister is being ciation with the honourable member for Grampians, because I find that he is slipping from many of his old moorings. Of course, I am aware that during his career he has believed in almost everything in the political calendar, and believed in nothing long. Thusi t comes about that whilst yesterday he may have believed in universal suffrage, to-day, under the influence of the two Irvines, he may be induced to introduce a franchise which will not be acceptable to the people, or he may be tempted to do damage to our old-age pension scheme. Out of the large number of honourable members to be found on the other side of the chamber, there are very few whom I would call vatives, and the only way in which they which they make in the franchise. I believe that the expresin quoted is merely the murmur that we The other night a is to be forearmed. I wish now to say a few words in reply to the statements of the honourable member for Riverina as to the amount of union funds which are spent for political purposes. Of course, I can speak with confidence only of the society to which I belong-the Melbourne Typographical Society. I want to tell the honourable member that in New South Wales there are some unions which are conserving their funds, and which are not applying them to political propaganda work. tribute to any political f u n d . my recent election campaign, if there was any man who attempted to harass me, it was an out-and-out unionist. He had in his brain an exceptionally big Protectionist microbe, and he was constantly accusing me and my party of having neglected to revise the Tariff. There was no more bitter opponent of our party than this man, who professed, at any rate, unionist. The half-yearly balance-sheet of the Typographical Society shows that in 1907 our liquid assets amounted to only £3,705 , whereas in 1913 they had in creased to £10,300. I wish to endorse the statement that has been made by more than one honourable member of our party that, unless a man has been associated with a trade union, and understands, therefore, the principle that guides it , he cannot possibly interpret the actions or sayings of trade unionists. Honourable members opposite need to know something of the spirit of the movement. need to have gone through the mill-to have tasted of the boycott-to be able to appreciate what trade unionism really means. The Typographical Society has an unemployed allowance f u n d , of which it is proud, and out of that f u n d , since 1907, it has expended no less than £1,918 19s. 4d. Its total receipts, I may add, amount to £4,222. Whilst dealing with this subject, I think it appropriate to refer to the question of preference to unionists. I shall begin by quoting the views of one or two gentlemen who do not belong to our party. The first of these is Dr. Rentoul, the Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly of Australia, who, when speaking at North Melbourne a few Sundays ago, gave expression to the following sentimentHe had no doubt that within fifty years every korking man would be in a union and a unionist. tian. timistic Christian. An optimistic Christian would say that long before fifty years have elapsed every working man and woman in Australia-if they have any regard for their own interests-wil l be unionists. the workers in Denmark are unionists. These unions do not conso. D r . Rentoul went on to sayIn The medical men were unionists, and even, the clergymen had a union, for they would not admit a man unless he was a good man. Gjreat economists stated that men should be trained to protect one another, and that could be done by being unionists. But the capitalists and the newspapers said that the freedom of the individual must not be interfered with. They did not say that so long as only the freedom of the poor man was being interfered with, but they said it now that the freedom of the rich man-the gentleman-wa s being interfered with. to be a very pronounced The freedom of the individual was being interfered with in a thousand different ways._ The freedom of the man who recently broke into a well-known gentleman's house was being interfered with. The gentleman referred to is one of the owners of a leading Melbourne newspaperTemperance reform, social reform, land reform, and health reform all interfered with the freedom of the individual. Surelyi t is time that we learnt that lesson. It should not be necessary for it to be constantly repeated,, that the freedom of the individual is interfered They with when the freedom of others is likely to be interfered with unless that be done. As they say in churches other than the Church of the WaterL i l y "" No man liveth unto himself."" Another eminent churchman, Bishop Mercer, as recently as 27th July last, made an important statement on this question of trade unionism. His address was reported under the heading of "" Bishop's Remarkable Views."" I am very glad to know that many bishops and archbishops in this country, as well as other countries, are giving expression to exceptional views. Many of the most prominent and thoughtful bishops in the Old Land have been speaking of trade unionism as being practically next to Christianity in its elevating influence upon the human family. Bishop Mercer, in an address on "" Distributive Justice in the Rewards of Labour,"" said thatHe was an ardent trades unionist down to the ground.",28,Value Of Direct Oversea Imports

Dr. Mercer went on to sayThere was a lot of talk about union tyranny, but it could not be taken much notice of. That is the advice that he tenders to honourable members opposite, who talk of tyranny on the part of unionsHe looked at it in the light that, while they had the same conflicting forces as at present, there was bound to be strife, but the view that the unionist could not have his own he could not account for, and never would champion. He did not agree with fixed rates of pay for equal hours of work. Workers were bound to do things in a wholesale way until they got what they deserved-recognitio n of their rights. He did not look upon the present system as the ultimate way of arriving at the value of services, but the trades unions were bound to continue in that way in spite of temporary injustice. Until they were able to bring a further delicacy of manipulation into their organizations, the way of arriving at distributive justice thinking man who reads and studies the and getting over the present difficulty was free exchange in open market, and that was being prevented by the monopolies to which he was directly opposed, more particularly as they interfered with a man obtaining a living wage. There could be no better statement concerning preference to unionists and unionism generally than was expressed by these two eminent gentlemen. It is the custom for honourable members opposite, when addressing a way-back audience, to say that they have no quarrel with the unions, but that since their unionism has taken on a political aspect they are against it. "" As long as the trade unions tamper with politics,"" they say, ""we cannot conceive of its being a good thing."" I do not blame them for speaking in this way, but those who declare that it is only of late that trade unionism has assumed a political aspect cannot be familiar with the history of the movement. In Germany and Prance, the unions have a great deal to do with politics. That, however, is not the position in the United States of America. I believe that the great body of workers in America are not yet awake politically to their own interests, but that when they are alive to their true position and strength they will be able to send a President to the White House and to secure majorities in both Houses of Congress. Presidents of the United States of America, with the exception of Roosevelt and Washington, came from the working classes. Argus of 16th ult., there was published a short criticism of an article entitled "" Socialism in the Colleges,"" which appeared in the Century Magazine. The first"" few lines of that criticism are as follow: The principles of Socialism are taking hold upon theminds of youth through teaching permitted or, in the name of "" academic freedom,"" actually encouraged, in our schools, colleges, universities, and even in theological seminaries.

Our party's course has been mapped out on right lines, and the great mass of the people will surely swing behind it. Let me tell honourable members opposite, who claim to be the sole representatives of the farmers, that the day is not far distant when the farmers, too, will swing behind our party. Many intelligent farmers now say that the Labour party is the only intelligent national party in existence. During the 1911 campaign I met a gentleman whose name I can giveI believe he is still faithful to the cause-wh o had something interesting to say concerning the attitude of the farmers. I refer to a Mr English, who, at a public meeting at Traralgon, refuted some of the statements made by the Rev. F. C. Wood, an organizer of the Rural Producers' Association.

But since the change in the administration of the Home Affairs Department, this Australian-made machine has been set aside. any particular officer, but I believe that there is a strong inclination in the Department to have imported articles, and it is to the credit of the late Minister that in this matter, as in others, he always insisted, if prices were anything like reasonable, upon ordering the Australian article.

If it has since gone wrong, some one must have tampered with it, or fault has been found with it because the Ministry is anti-Australian. through the Molonglo after we were there, and got the boxes spoiled. desires to do all he can for Australian industries is frequently baffled by his officials. We have officers who seem to have no love for Australian-made goods. be found that they are nearly all like that. stances that have come under my notice, Ministers have had a great battle to get Australian-made articles used. the reasons why I think some of the present Ministers are not very favorable to our defence system is that it does not carry out true Australian ideas. The meanest proposal ever made in any Parliament was the borrowing of £3,500,000 to build a Dreadnought to be presented to the Old Country. the action of a young man in saying to his mother, "" Lend me the money, so that I may make you a present."" The Dreadnought so given was to be made ia Great Britain, and manned, as far as possible, with British sailors. There are few enough British sailors in British waters and in the Mediterranean, and it is time that Australia, with 8,000 miles of coastline, trained sailors for herself. It is to the credit of the Labour Government that they did everything that could be done for our defence, and especially for our naval defence. Buti t was the opinion of some of our opponents, members of previous Governments, that everything required for naval defence should be obtained from the Old Country, and that the ships we paid for should be kept in British waters. The elections of 1910, I do not make a charge against however, showed that the opinion of the people was that we should have an Australian Navy, manned with Australians, and kept in Australian waters. The Dominion of New Zealand thinks that by presenting a Dreadnought to the Old Country it is doing what it should for the defence of the Empire; but, in my opinion, no part of the Empire will be doing its best for the common interest if it merely has ships made in Great Britain, to be manned with British sailors, and to be kept in British waters. If there is one thing that has helped our naval defence scheme, it is that we have made it an Australian scheme, having our vessels, as far as possible, made here, to give employment to Australian workmen, and O'MALLEY -They ran ib manning them with Australian men and lads. The decision of the Labour Government to have gunboats and destroyers made in Australia has given a great impetus to our ship-building. A t Williamstown today there is a first class, well-found dock. I was at the opening of it , and it was I think it will then stated that there were orders in band which would keep it going for a period of two years.

That, and the naval ship-building policy of the late Government, have given a great impetus to the Australian ship-buildiiig trade.

Listen to thisLabour was more energetic. It seized the first possible opportunity presented by a fortuitous rise to power-it was then in a minority in Parliament-to spend the money on Australian warships; and later, when returned to office by the people with a majority of both Houses, it enforced a policy of naval construction and expenditure which has committed both parties in Parliament probably for all time adequately to subserve the national ambition. The great value of this virile action on Labour's part lies in the circumstance that it was timely to forestall a powerful Conservative movement which had been inaugurated with the covert object of preventing the growth of Colonial navies. That is what I am suspicious of to-daythat there is a powerful Conservative During their three years of office movement at work.

Parents know well that the Australian Navy offers a boy a career far more f u l l of promise than any career that will probably be open to him ashore.

I am very glad of that. I am proud of the fact t h a t I have parents in my constituency whose lads have joined the Navy, and some of them, though comparatively young in years, are likely, if one may judge from an amateur stand-point, to achieve high distinction.

As I have said, we have a 'total of 229,281 cadets and men, trained and partly trained, to defend this country. On the naval side, in 1909, three torpedo boats were suggested, and then the Defence Conference took place. Senator Pearce was selected to go as the representative of Australia, but another Government -Colonel Foxton was sent. things ever done I punish Colonel Foxton? wish to say anything about that. In 1.910, a request was made that Admiral Henderson should come to Australia in order to examine our coast and forts, and advise us as to the naval defence of the -country. We may presume that the I m perial Government sent out one of the finest Admiralsi n the Navy; and any one, especially a non-practical man like the new Minister, should be particularly oareful before endeavouring to upset the scheme of one with a life's training in this particular work. In 1910, when the Fisher Government came into power, there were 1,240 men in the Navy, and at present there are 3,400, showing a fairly in our waters, and there are also the Mel-, I have indicated a bourne, the Sydney, the Yarra, the Parramatta, the Warrego, and several other boats, including the Torrens, the Swan, and the Derwent, at present in course of construction. W it h the other vessels that have been given by, or bought from, the Imperial Government, we shall, when our battleship arrives, have the strongest fleet there ever has been in these waters for the defence of Australia. This is largely the result of the manner in which the Labour Government have carried on the defence administration? We have at Port Stephens, in New South Wales, at Cockburn Sound, in Western Australia, and in other parts of the conInstead of resorting to such tinent, ports which are eminently suitable for naval bases. If a word of mine They never thought of looking for can have any influence with this Government, I venture to tell them that the sooner they make suitable provision for our big ships on the western side of Australia the better it will be. The stoppage of the works at Cockburn Sound was a great mistake. To-day there is only one an expenditure of place in the whole of Australia where it will be possible to dock our big battle ship. Sydney is the only port to which she could go for repairs in case of accident. According to Admiral Henderson's report, backed up by the opinions of men who are entitled to express an opinion, it is absolutely essential that we should have a naval base at Cockburn Sound. The work should be carried forward as expeditiously as possible. I hope came into power, and the Treasurer will insist upon it being pushed ahead.

A special correspondent of the Argus attended him in Gippsland, and if he was misreported, he had ample opportunities of correcting the error. WhatI complain about is that at the very time when the honourable gentleman said that the Fisher Government were going to finish the financial year with a deficit of a million and a half, there was actually in the Treasury an accumulated surplus of over £2,000,000.

259,Mr Fenton,"The circular is datedThere we are told what ia being done for the farmers and the small wool-growers. There are, I understand, some honourable members who are very prominently identified with the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales. two matters have come up before that association which, I think, ought to be stated here. were asked to consider whether something could be done to bring in legislation to protect the tenant farmer, but they turned down the proposition, because a majority felt that the time was not opportune to introduce such legislation. The following statement was made on that occasion by Mr G. F . Oram, of MudgeeHe was a sheep farmer on another man's land for five years. It was sold. He could not purchase it, but it brought £13 an acre, and then he continued on it, and in ten years he bought it for £40 an acre-the high price being largely on account of the improvementSi-so that he paid twice for his own improvements. bit out of it , too. the owner got a big bit out of Mr Oram when he sold the land, and that is, I suppose, one of the greatest barriers to men of moderate means getting on the soil. Oram is one which is right. item comes from the Wagga district, where farmers are advocating what I have thought of for years. As many lionorable members know, my business for seven or eight years lay with the farmers and dairymen of Victoria and other States. The Marra branch of the Farmers and Settlers Association resolved, on the 1st AugustThat in the interest of the branch no person but a bond fide farmer shall be admitted to the membership. I was glad to note this resolution, but let honourable members listen to the remarks of the moverFarmers regard this motion as a move in the right direction, for many persons have been admitted to the association whose sympathy lies in the farmer's pockets and not in his welfare. That is my belief, too. I have attended a number of farmers' conventions, and one would have to do a bit of pin-pricking to find any farmers. One will find there a number of squatters, graziers, and storekeepers. leisure to attend these gatherings. These are the men who profess -to formulate a programme for the working farmers. The resolution passed by the Marra branch is a step in the right direction. The farmers do not want anybody but bond fide farmers in the ranks of the association, and they are quite right, too, One or because, as they say, there are very many persons getting into the association who are farming the farmers instead of being I believe that the farmers farmers themselves. There are many other items on which I intended to address the House, but as I have only a few minutes left now I must leave them for another occasion. I have been talking as fast as I possibly could. I had in tended to deal with the Tariff. I have dealt slightly with preference to unionists. I was going to say something about the bank, too. The honourable member for Macquarie said the other day that he would gladly contribute to some contributory form of insurance. That would be all very well for a man who had money in his pocket. The people who would It is very evident that principally benefit by an insurance scheme, if it can be so called, are those who already contribute to the revenue we have for expenditure. The private wealth of Australia is about £1,000,000,000, yet The position taken up by Mr 8,500 persoas own £810,000.000, leaving Another £190,000,000 for the rest of the community. I had these figures prepared by one of the best actuaries in the Victorian Statistician's office. I am in formed on the highest authority that we draw from Customs and Excise about £15,000,000, and those persons who own only a fifth of the wealth of this community contribute £12,000,000. When they are contributing the bulk of the revenue, if there is anything to be done for those who are not so well circumstanced, surely they can draw a little of that revenue which they themselves principally contribute, instead of being called upon to put their hands into their pockets still more. Whilst four-fifths of the wealth resides with one-fifth of the population, it is wrong to ask the poorer classes of the community to contribute to any f u n d of that kind. orable member's time has expired. has been claimed that this debate should These are the men who have be brought to a termination on the ground that it constitutes a waste of time.

But in the present instance we find the Prime Minister himself publicly stating that whilst he is in office he is not in power, thus admitting that he is not able to control the destiny of this country. In my judgment, if he did the right thing, he would send us to our masters-the people-and allow them to decide which party is to govern the Commonwealth. Every honourable member has a perfect right to place his views before the electors, who, despite the intention of the Government to hang on to office as long as possible, will, in the near future, determine which of the two political forces now facing each other is to dominate Australia. To-day both parties are equally divided on the floor of this chamber. know that the Prime Minister thinks that a dissolution of this House would be unsatisfactory, and that he desires to secure a double dissolution. But I am afraid he will experience considerable difficulty in reaching that goal. prepared to remain on the Treasury bench until he can secure a double dissolution, I am inclined to think that the people will .appraise his Government at their true value. What is the use of the honourable gentleman arguing that his party secured a majority of the votes recorded throughout the Commonwealth at the recent general elections ? What effect will that have upon the Senate? The Constitution provides the manner in which the other Chamber shall be elected, and we know that the so-called Liberal party there went to the country eleven strong and were returned only seven strong. That -clearly shows that under the Constitution the electors are not in favour of the party which now occupies the Treasury bench. That is the only comparison we can institute from the stand-point of the Senate. Consequently, the sooner we permit the electors to decide whicli party in this House shall hold the reins of office, the better it will be for all concerned. If the Government were returned with a working majority, it would be tantamount to an instruction to the Senate to pass legislation which had been approved by this House. -complains that honourable members upon this side of the Chamber have occupied too The Prime Minister has much time in debating the no-confidence amendment upon the Address-in-Reply, he forgets that previous discussions of a long. Personally, I see not the slightest foundation for the honourable gentleman's complaint. But there is an evident desire on his part to induce the people to believe that the Labour party are holding up the government of the country, when, as a matter of fact, we are merely doing what other parties have done previously in this House. Without this opportunity of placing our views before the electors, the latter would not be able to judge of the merits of the rival political parties. What we are doing is actually what the Prime Minister himself invited us to do. Does he imagine that he can put forward a statement of Ministerial policy which practically challenges the legislation that has been enI acted at the instance of the Labour party, and that the members of that party will quietly sit down and accept his dictum? As watchdogs of the public, it is our duty to stand up and tell him that we are prepared to accept this challenge and to fight If he is him. Had he desired to remain in office, and to avoid the necessity for holding another election, he could have introduced plenty of measures the consideration of which would have fully employed this Chamber, without interfering with the legislation which we have enacted, and as to the repeal of which he has received no mandate from the people. In the no confidence motion which has been submitted, the Government are indicted upon four counts. It is the duty of honourable members to confine their remarks, as far as possible, to that indictment. The motion declares that the Government(1) propose to destroy the beneficial character of our social and industrial laws; (2) indicate no intention of taking such steps as will reduce the high cost of living; and (3) f a i l to realize the urgent necessity of an immediate revision of the Tariff. With regard to the first count, is there an honourable member who will urge that it is not correct? Are not the Government endeavouring to interfere with our industrial laws ? In spite of their professed desire to give equality of opporWhen the Prime Minister tunity to all classes, do they not propose to deprive certain classes of their liberty ? Do they not intend to prevent the President of the Arbitration Court from granting a preference to unionists? I do not know of any honourable member sitting upon the other side of the House who told the people at the last election that it was proposed to repeal that section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which makes the granting of a preference to unionists optional with the Judge. In what cases has this preference to be refused? Only in cases where an industrial union, either directly or indirectly, supplies funds for political purposes. On the other hand, industrial unions which do not contribute to a fund for political purposes, and whose mission it is to destroy the legitimate unions which this promised legislation on the part of have been established for years, may apply for registration under the Act and thus obtain a preference for their members. the Independent Workers Union which has been avowedly created to assist the employers of the Commonwealth. Blackwood, a former president of the Employers Federation, has openly told the people of Great Britain that the Independent Workers Union was formed for the purpose of assisting the employers to destroy the existing unions. He pointed out that they could place men who chose to apply at certain bureaux, and who were prepared to join that particular organization. This union may be registered under the Arbitration Act, and may cite a case before the Court. The Judge will then have the right to grant a preference to a bogus union. Yet, under the legislation which the Government propose, the legitimate unionist, who has borne the heat and burden of the day, will be denied a preference merely because he contributes Is. or £1 to a political organization. During the early stages of this debate some honourable members stressed the hard fight which unionists had been compelled to wage in order to secure for unionism a legal standing. It was not till then that the community began to realize that in industrial disputes, apart from the combatants, there was a third party which had to be considered. That third party is the general public. What did we do ? We enacted that it should be illegal for any organized body of men to undertake anything in the nature of a strike or a lock-out. We asked these great industrial bodies to give up the weapon of the strike, and to recognise that the general community had a right to be considered. They did as we desired. They gave up Mr Charlton. their right to strike, and registered themselves under the Arbitration Act, under which a tribunal was established to deal with industrial differences. To the credit of the unions be it said that, so far, there has not been a single breach of any award made by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Having legalized industrial arbitration, what right have we to interfere, with the individual liberty of the men who constitute these great industrial organizations ? If they wish to support a political party, why should they not do so? To my mind, there can be only one reason-and the reason is self-evident-for the Government. It is prompted by a desire for retaliation on the part of those who imagine that the industrial workers We have an example of that in are opposed to their policy. Any Government, however, that brings in retaliatory legislation is doomed to suffer. The great Mr body of fair-minded people, whether they be trade unionists or not, are well able to determine what actuates a party in introducing such legislation, and will recognise that the attitude of honourable members opposite, in connection with this particular measure, is not genuine. The Government believe that if they take away from unionists the right of preference no money will be forthcoming toassist our party. Whilst they propose to> do this, they take no exception to the employing classes having the right to go to the Court, although they pour into their party funds thousands of pounds. The employing classes are to have the right to go to this Court just as an industrial worker may do, and may pay into the funds of the Liberal party as much money as they feel disposed to part with. Then,, again, the Independent Workers' Union is given the right to register. The members of that union are to have a right of preference to the detriment of the genuine trade unionists. There can be no doubt whatever that the Government is proposing to interfere with industrial matters, and that they intend to go even further, and declare that the rural worker shall not even have the right to register under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Imagine a party that claims to believe in liberty and equal opportunity depriving the unfortunate toiler in a rural industry of the right to go to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. -speak of a free Australia. lation is to be enacted. W hy should not a farm worker have, in this regard, the -same right that is enjoyed by the man who follows any other occupation ? Why should any distinction be made? not game to advertise in England their intention to except rural workers from the Act . -Conditions of labour can be regulated in relation to rural industries just as well as they can be regulated in connection with other occupations. with every other industry, the Court has to fix the conditions-to determine the hours of employment and the wages to be paid-and no Court would impose conditions that were not in the interests of the industry concerned. I do not think that -the Court would do what has been suggested by honourable members opposite, and fix conditions which would prevent the farmer from employing labour. The farmer as well as his employee would have an opportunity to give evidence, and the President of the Court, who is a Justice -of the H i g h Court, is bound to arrive at a determination upon the evidence given. As far as possible, he would see that justice was meted out to all, and would do nothing detrimental to the farmer, or to any other employer of labour. It seems to me that, because the farmers have complained about the rural workers' log-although , so far as I know, that log has not yet been filed with the Court;-honorabl e members opposite think they are in duty bound to except rural workers from the Conciliation and A r b i tration Act , inasmuch as they received a good deal of support in rural districts. In this instance, therefore, the promised legislation is also actuated by purely party political motives. liberty, where is the equality of which honourable members opposite preach so much, if they are going to prevent one set of workers enjoying the privileges which are given to others? We are told that the rural workers can be dealt with by the States. That is true of those engaged in other industries; but they may also go to the Commonwealth Arbitration Courti n the case of a dispute extending beyond any one State. The Liberal party's argument is not a genuine one. As a matter A f t e r this, we cannot of fact, in those States where the Liberal party is in power, the rural workers canN o t if such legisnot go to the local industrial tribunals. So far as the rural workers are concerned, the Liberalsi n the State Parliaments take up the same attitude as their brethren in the Federal Parliament. Clearly, therefore, it is not the intention of the Government to permit the rural workers to have any means of redressing their grievances through the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The rural workers may have been very slow to organize, but they are organized to-day. I would tell honourable members opposite, who say that the Liberal party alone reI n connection presents the farmers, that I have represented a farming constituency in New South Wales, and that two-thirds of the electorate which I at present represent is a farming community. I am always prepared to express publicly my views in regard to these questions, and I do not hesitate to say that, if honourable members opposite prevent the ruralworkers from going to the Arbitration Court now that they are organized, there wil l be only one alternative. The men know that at a certain time of the year it is necessary for the farmers to have additional hands, and now that they are organized they will strike their blow at that particular time if they be denied the right to seek redress in the Arbitration Court. If they do so, will the Liberal party say that the law ought to be put in motion against them ? Having denied them the opportunity to go to the Court, will the Liberal party say that the rural workers are committing a breach of the law by engaging in an organized strike in respect of which there are certain penalties and gaol provisions? If honourable members opposite talk about justice and equal opportunity for all while they deprive these men of the right to go to the Court, the people w ill take them at their true Where is the value, and it w ill not be long before the farmer will find that the Labour party is his best friend. A large number of farmers support me, and I think they will continne to do so, because they know that I have a genuine regard for their interests. If ever a strike should occur at harvest time because of rural workers being denied the right to go to the Court to obtain an amicable settlement of their grievances, a swing of the political pendulum will take place.

Without definite data it would be impossible for actuaries to frame a sound scheme, and such data could not be obtained for a voluntary system. Compulsory insurance, we are told, is to be substituted for tlie maternity allowance. I shall, of course, reserve my remarks on these proposals unti l they are actually before us; but I am sure that if this Parliament interferes with the maternity allowance in such a way as to cause the womenfolk of Australia to think that they will have to plead poverty in order to get the allowance, that independent spirit which is so characteristic of them will assert itself, and those responsible for the alteration of the law will be properly dealt with. I come now to the second oount of the indictment: that the Government has not indicated in any way that it is going to reduce the cost of living. badly from the Opposition, which has just been in power for three years without reducing the cost of living. But the question now is, not what another party did, but what the party in power is doing? party to give effect to the promises which it made to them a couple of months ago, when seeking their suffrages. -candidates told the electors from every platform almost that the high cost of living was due to the Labour"" party being in power. It is generally known that the Commonwealth' revenue does not amount to half of the combined revenues of the State Governments, yet the people were made to believe that because the Commonwealth Government was controlled by the Labour party the cost of living in creased. Moreover, four of the State Governments are Liberal, and the Liberal party must accept the responsibility for them. In my opinion, the high cost of living is not due to governmental action at a l l ; it is due to causes over which we have at present no control. The Labour party endeavoured to obtain for the people powers which would have enabled this Parliament to deal with the forces that are increasing the cost of l i v in g ; but our opponents advised the electors that that was not necessary. Now we search their programme in vain for any proposal to reduce the cost of living. Living has become dearer in every country in the world. According to the British Board of Trade reports for 1910, the cost of living in Austria has increased by 35 per cent., in Belgium by 32 per cent., in Germany by 22 per cent., and in Italy by 20 per cent. In none of those countries is there a Labour Government in power. Plainly, there are other causes than governmental action responsible for the dearness of living. I know of women who had been Labour supporters who this time voted for Liberal candidates because of the promises made by the Liberals to reduce the cost of living, and the electors expect that the promises made to them will be kept. The Prime Minister, whose utterances have been referred to so frequently in this debate, has said outside that the cost of living has been increased, by the increase of taxation under the Labour Government. I could bear out that assertion by quoting from a report in the Sydney Morning Herald. The Sydney Daily Telegraph, too, in its issue of It may be said that this comes the 9th A p r i l last, reported that, addressing the Chatswood Women's Liberal League, the honourable gentleman referred to the increased taxation, State and Federal, which, he said, amounted to from £ 7 to £ 8 per family, and when passed on The people expect the Liberal would mean from £ 1 0 to £ 1 2 per family. women's meetings?

W it h the exception of the land tax, which the Labour party was pledged to impose, what taxation did it introduce during its three years of office ? We did not interfere with the Tariff, and, indeed, have been condemned for not doing so, and it is the Tariff from which most of the revenue is derived. Incidentally, I might remind honourable members that the Prime Minister has spoken of the land tax as most unfair. He has stated that New South Wales contributes half of the Federal land tax, adding that "" there was no justice or statesmanship about that, and that the sooner it was altered the better for all concerned."" Does not every one know that the tax is imposed on a uniform basis, land-owners paying in accordance with the value of their land?

Except as to the land tax, which returned £1,366,000, the statement of Mr Parkhill is absolutely incorrect. It was the increased Customs yield resulting from the greater prosperity that added to the revenue.

I now desire to say a word or two about the Northern Territory, which, as representing an issue, would be suffi-cient, if there were no other question under consideration, to cause me to vote against the present Government. We are to l d that the Government propose to bring in a LandB ill to provide for the granting of freehold in the Territory. The question of tenure is a burning one -everywhere; and I realize that a man who advocates leasehold has very often a great prejudice to encounter, owing to the ignorance of the people as to what leasehold from the Crowni n perpetuity really means. There is an idea that leasehold from the Crown is similar to leasehold from a private individual; but, as we all know, there is a vast difference. Even the freehold that is given to-day by the 'Crown is conditional, and the freehold given in the Northern Territory will, we are told, also be conditional. This is in order to prevent the aggregation of large ^estates, and is a very wise provision that I should support in any LandB ill . An y banking or other financial institution, in advancing money on a property, must take into consideration the conditions, if they foreclose, to deal with a property, and if the holder of such a freehold as is sugthis period represents-Customs, Total, gested is unable to sell to another person who already has an estate, that to an extent is a disadvantage. The lease is an instrument granted by the Crown just as is a deed. What is a lease but an in strument granted by the Crown on certain specified conditions ? It gives a lease in perpetuity providing that certain things are done, but it means that a holder and his family will always be able to keep the lease in their possession unless they desire to dispose of it , in which case all they have to do is to obtain a buyer for the lease and improvements. They would thus sell the land just as they It was a tax put on by would a fee-simple, subject to the same conditions that w ill be imposed in regard to the freehold. The people, however, do Mr Parkhill goes not understand the matter or regard it in that light. They have been accustomed to deal with private individuals, who may, perhaps, own miles of land, and who, when they lease land to men like myself, for instance, make certain conditions and always reserve the right to themselves at the expiration of the lease to put it up to auction or tender. The result very often is that a better price is obtained, simply and solely owing to the work done by the previous lessee, who may, perhaps, have toiled with his sons for five or six years. Land which may have been worth, say, °£l per acre when first taken up, is, on account of this work, worth £ 2 at the expiration of the lease. The lessee has, since taking up the land, cleared it and built a home; and then the private owner invites tenders, and hands it over to some one else, who may be willing to pay a few shillings more. Isi t any wonder that the people of Australia, and farmers in particular, who have held leaseholds from private individuals, imagine that under the Crown they will be trapped as they have been trapped before. Only a few months ago, on an estate in my electorate, a man, after he had been on the land for some years, had to pay almost a third more than its value in order to retain the home he had built by his own exertion. This man w ill never be able to eke out an existence, because, like others, he has had to borrow, and the land will not yield sufficient for",46,Propty Limited George Hague Co Propt Limited

In the case I have mentioned the man will lose everything; and the same has occurred in many instances. I feel very warmly on this question, which I have dealt with on more than one occasion elsewhere. The time has arrived in this country when we should see that justice is given to every individual, and when there should be tenant right to improvements. A man who takes up land and improves it with his earnings should not be at the mercy of the owner, but, when ousted, should be entitled to the full value of those improvements. we never hear those men who most constantly condemn leasehold under the Crown say anything against leasehold granted by private individuals. It is all right if a private person owns the land and reaps a big income, probably residing in some other part of the world. Strong objection is taken, however, when the Government propose to deal fairly and squarely with the people by giving them leases in perpetuity, and permitting them to make homes under the best of landlords. Nothing could have been better than the ordinance of the ex-Minister of External Affairs, who, in the case of the Northern Territory, proposed to give the first 5,000 settlers homes without cost, with liberal concessions to future settlers. We ought to conserve to the people all the improvements made by the expenditure of public money; and in the Northern Territory, under the leasehold system, there would be a constant source of income for the Commonwealth, every twenty or thirty years, and a right to the tenants in all the improvements made. Any other improvements, which may be comprehended in the unearned increment, should go to the Crown and the people; and when the question comes before the HouseI shall deem it my duty to take a very prominent part in the discussion of the new Land Bill. I shall not, if I can prevent it, permit any departure from the leasehold system. I am not afraid of meeting strong advocates of the freehold system outside. am fully prepared to explain and defend my views, and am satisfied that the people will approve of my action. I have conceived it to be my duty to express my Mr Charlton. opinion on these important questions that After all, the true value of are contained in the indictment against the Government, because this occasion affords one of the few opportunities we have of explaining our views. Asfar as the Government are concerned, what the Prime Minister has said outside is correct-that they are in office, but not in power; but in making that admission the Prime Minister ackowledged his absoluteincompetence to deal with the affairs oi this country. He says that there is much to do administratively. I hope, however, that we shall not have a continuance of the kind of administrative work to which we have been treated during the last few weeks. Let us be honourable men. Do not let us go through the departmental reStrange to say, cords to see whether we can rake up anything that will tell against our predecessors. To the credit of the party with which I am associated, I will say that when they occupied the Ministerial benches no Minister ever went through his Department endeavouring to dig up things against his predecessor. Ministers acted in an honourable manner. I trust that we shall hear no more of efforts of the kind. Quite sufficient has been done in that direction. The party opposite have endeavoured to work up a case against the late Government on account, of the Fitzroy Dock. But the attack has-failed all along the line. It never made much of an impression in Sydney. Why? Because the workmen in Sydney who were acquainted with the dock were able tospread the true facts about the suburbs. Every one who had any knowledge of the matter was aware that the late Government took over the dock at a valuation which was made by competent men. They with reappraisements knew all about the defects in the machinery. They were not misled in any way.. They paid for the dock what it was fairly considered to be worth. It has beenstated, and will, I believe, on further in vestigation, prove to be true, that the charges made in regard to the state of theboilers are utterly fallacious. As a matter of fact, the manager of the dock was perfectly well aware of the state of theboilers, and, being a careful and capableman, always took precautions to insurethat the men working there should beI safe. He never allowed the boilers to be worked up to their full power. He didnot permit steam to be got up beyond acertain pressure, considerably under what, tests showed the boilers to be capable of: standing. There was absolutely no danger. That being the case, why should such an indictment be made against the late Government as that they made a bad bargain, and perpetrated an injustice on the people of Australia, seeing that they took over the dock at its true value, and were f u l l y acquainted with the state of the machinery, which they intended to improve ? The very gentleman who reported upon the boilers was, I believe, instructed to formulate a report in regard to what new machinery and power was required. That instruction was given by the late Minister of Defence himself, and it proves that Senator Pearce knew what the deficiencies of the dock were. Pearce had had to take action upon the report upon the boilers, he would have done what any sensible man would do under the circumstances-allowe d work to be continued as long as he knew that it was safe for the boilers to be worked, and that there was no liability to explosion. not a scaremonger. scare was only worked up in order to damage this party. sorry if there were an appeal to the people.

I will speak first of a profession that I greatly detestI would like to use a stronger word, but the personal equation comes in a profession in which I have many very dear and wellbeloved friends. I am alluding to the legal profession. Thirteen lawyers went out of the last House-and honourable members know whose number that isand faced their constituents.

A t present we have only two titled men in the House, and my honourable friends opposite have all the pleasure of their company. Much has been said about the Senate being dissolved. great deal in the press about bribery and corruption being extant throughout Australia, and of double voting. The constituency I have the privilege of representing has 45,258 electors on its roll. There were 27,325 ballot-papers issued, and there were only eighteen supposedly double votes"" supposedly,"" I say, because even the electoral officers never stated definitely that they were double votes, but said that mistakes might occur. I had some inquiries made, and I found that in the most aristocratic part of my constituency-that is, in East Melbourne -ther e were double as many cases as there were in Bourke electorate. Naturally, I made inquiries, and found that in three cases three individuals bearing exactly the same name, lived in the district. I have followed very closely the action of the head of the Electoral Department, Oldham that I believe he has capably and I think that I shall honestly carried out the intention of Parliament as enunciated in the last Electoral son, who had charge of the State of Victoria, I had an opportunity of in specting the splendid card system. It recalled to memory that I was a visitor to County Sligo during the last fight in which Mr Parnell took part. I was against h i m ; I am sorry to say: he was wrong in that election. I was with the whole of the party. W ill honourable members believe for a moment that when theyran short of ballot-papers at a little polling booth I was asked to take a supply of ballot-papers there? That is how they managed elections in the Old Country. In my belief, after much study of the electoral laws of various countries, in no country is there a more up-to-date roll, or is an election carried out more honestly, than in Australia. Mr Miller, one of the best officers I have ever met, also worked so hard, night and day, that he became ill , but still worked, though I , as a medical man, told him that he ought to go to his bed and not work any longer. If there is an amendment of the electoral law, I hope that it will l i m it somewhat the scope of the absent vote; for to me it is absurd that any one should be allowed to go into a polling booth in the next subdivision when it is only half or three-quarters of a mile distant from his own subdivision. I would We have also read a limi t the exercise of the absent vota to places outside a radius of at least 5 miles from the voter's nearest pollingbooth, and then two-thirds of the wor!< which nearly broke down the electoral officers would be eliminated. Let us consider the cry of why should not the Senate go to the country. I can imagine that if the Leader of the Government was on this side of the House, and any one 'dared to make that remark-wh y even you, Mr. Speaker, with your urbane temperament, would have a great deal of difficulty in controlling him. "" The idea,"" the Prime Minister would say, "" that when our party has a minority of one in this House, and a majority of twenty-nine to seven in the other, the Senate should be sent to the country.""

We have been assured that, owing to the splendid seasons that we have experienced during recent years, nothing can prevent our progress. But I find by reference to figures which have been compiled by Mr Laughton, the Government Statistician of Victoria, that in March of the present year there were 1,965,000 less sheep in this State than there were the year previously, that there were 107,000 less pigs, 95,000 less other cattle, and 43,000 less dairy cows.

Yet nothing that the If this matter were put party with which I am associated can do is good in the eyes of the Government supporters. If the electors had the power of the initiative, we would be able to obtain their opinion of matters just as it is obtained in Switzerland and in twentytwo of the States of America. Some time ago I was delighted to receive from the leader of the Opposition a telegram, in reply to a wire which I had despatched to him, congratulating him on his promise that the late Government would adopt the referendum and initiative. How small we must appear in the eyes of other nations when, with a population of only 4,600,000, we could not take a vote upon seven questions at the last election 1 W h y , at the last election in Ohio, which is the fourth State of the American Union, and which has a population of 4,761,315, If he were consulted he a vote was taken on forty-two questions, thirty-four of which were carried. derstand them all ? friend to take a t r ip to America for the purpose of asking them.

The thir d proposal was the adoption of the referendum and the initiative. If one were to divide the map of the United States vertically, all tbe States except six which would appear on the left-hand side already have the referendum and initiative, and seven of them have also adopted the recall.

I hold in my hand a letter giving information supplied by the late PrimeM i nister It readsDear Dr. Maloney, Some few days ago I think you asked me for some information with regard to the Swiss Constitution. The Cousul for Switzerland now advises me in the following terms :Part 1. The Federal Court of Justice consists of 19 judges and 6 supplementary judges; they are elected by the Federal Assembly. Federal Assembly means both chambers united. Part 2. livery citizen eligible to the National of a total of twelve senators who attended Council is eligible to the Federal Court of Justice. Part 4. All judges are elected for six years; kind of "" m a n on the j o b "" business vacancies are filled by the Federal Assembly for the rest of time. Part 5. The President and Vice-Presidents are elected 'by the Federal Assembly for the term of two years (from the number of judges). Yours faithfully, Thus every person who is eligible to enter the National Assembly is eligible to become a Judgei n Switzerland. In that country, which has a population of 3,000,000, 30,000 electors are required to initiate legislation, and 50,000 are required to secure an alteration of the Constitution. Applying the same ratio to our population, 45,000 electors would have the right to demand the enactment of legislation by this Parliament; but to secure an alteration of the Constitution, 75,000 electors would be required. I maintain, therefore, that we should certainly adopt the referendum and initiative. These constitute plank No. 14 of the platform of the Labour party, which is the only party that has ever adopted .them in its programme. makes its platform as plain as the Ten Commandments. Last session we heard a good deal about "" the man on the I s there always a job.""

Poor old Argus with the hundred eyes, and all of them on tlie squint! I am going to give my idea of "" the man on the j o b . "" There is a gentleman who was a member of this House for a period of twelve years. During that time, out of a possible 1,110 attendances, he attended only 533 sittings. He was absent from 577, and drew £3,000 for non-attendance. Another member of the last Parliament had an opportunity of attending on 152, and present on only ninety-seven, That is a pretty good illustration of "" the man on the j o b . "" In the Senate, during the first session of the last Parliament, the eight senators who attended every possible sitting were Labour men. During the second session, of two senators who attended upon every sitting day, one was a Labour man and the other was a Pusionist. During the third session of that Parliament the two senators who attended every sitting were both Labour men. Thus, out every sitting, eleven were Labour men and one was a Fusionist. That is tlie which deserves to be exposed. To the lionorable member for Darwin belongs the honour of having attended more sessions of Parliament, without missing a single day, than any other honourable member, though the honourable member for Yarra, however, runs him very close. troduced a measure providing for tlie referendum and the initiative. For such a measure the Government would be able to command the votes of the Opposition, since it would cover a plank in our platform to which we desire to give effect. I would rather die in the gutters of Melbourne a miserable beggar, and have the honour of having introduced such a measure, than die a multi-millionaire.

306,Dr. Maloney,"I wish to see i nmonument towering to the skies. A ge of 1st June declaredMr Cook whittles new Protection down to the vanishing point. The Argus, which is a much fairer opponent than are other newspapers which ought to be on our side, on the 24th May last published a paragraph in reference to the placing of an order for 307 miles of cloth to be made in the Commonwealth. It statedDelivery of the cloth is to be made at the rate per month of one-twelfth of the total order, the first consignment being made available on July 3T next. Three years ago it would have been practically impossible to obtain in Australia large quantities of material, but the industry has so advanced, owing in a large measure to the stimulus given by Defence orders, that almost any order can be taken up by manufacturing houses in the Commonwealth at a moment's notice. That is a great feather in the cap of Protection. The Age of 9th February, 1910, saidProtection was never in greater danger than it is to-day. It is in the keeping of a Government which is half Free Trade and which is openly nreferring Free .Trade candidates to Protectionist 'ones.

While prohibition. It is useless in these days to on the Continent of Europe, I never saw talk of 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, duties. the misery that I witnessed in England. I hold in my hand a box of safety matches I never saw so many hungry men and made in England by sweated women and pale-faced women as I saw in the Old girls, who are paid 2£d. per gross of Country. I never saw there a body of boxes, and have to find their own paste. workers so healthy as those at the NewThe Japanese can make these boxes for port workshops, except when I visited less than Id. per gross. What, then, is Port the good of a duty of even 1,000 per cent, a Socialistic on such matches? The Japanese exploited The the Sydney market by selling these matches as trade union matches until I brought the matter before the then Minister of Trade and Customs. The average contents of a box of European-made matches is from 55 to 60, but the Japanese are putting 100 matches in a box. There is a duty of Is. per gross on foreign-made matches; whereas, in the case of matches produced in the Home land a preference of 6d. per gross is enjoyed. By putting double the usual quantity of matches into a box, the Japanese are able to introduce their matches into the Commonwealth on unequal terms. The honourable member for Capricornia has given certain figures showing that wages have increased in Japan; but when I went Home for the Coronation as a representative Australian, I garnered a very interesting leaflet which throws some light on the subject. In this leaflet we have a copy of the motion proposed by Mr Will Crooks in the House of Commons in regard to the payment of a minimum wage for a working week of sixty hours. The motion readsthe right of every family in the country an income sufficient to maintain its members general minimum of 30s. per week for every worker should be established by law, and that the Government should set of the effect of long hours and insufficient nourishment, as the result of sweating, tion to the average height of men enrolled in the British Army. In the forties, it was 5 f t . 6 in. In sixties, this was lowered to time of the Boer war,, to 5 feet. Even body Sunlight, where I met with a fine of men and women, and listened to speech by Mr Lever. That gentleman said that he had not established Port Sunlight for the sake of charity. He had been led to do so as a keen business proposition. a philanthropist. Dr. words. He told us that he did not wish to see his workers coming to work tired after hanging on to the straps of trams, because there was no seating room. He therefore built them, at Port Sunlight, healthy cottages, which he let on the basis of a 3 per cent, return, and so furnished them with healthy homes and small garden plots. The result of his enterprise is that the death-rate at Port Sunlight is but one-half that which prevails but 200 yards away, where the heavy mortality is due very largely to insanitary conditions and unfair living. workers at Port Sunlight are forty-five in the case of the women, and forty-eight in the case of the men. ' All are given a chance of obtaining an interest in Lever's big business concern. The same remark will apply to Cadbury's employee's. Both Fry and Cadbury, following out the splendid legend of the Quaker race, are now trying to get a cocoa that is not grown by coloured labour. I would remind honourable members that Germany was, comparatively speaking, a poor country before it adopted Protection. But, in 1911, the savings of the people in the German Savings Bank amounted to £945,000,000 as against £227,000,000, the accumulated savings of the people of the United Kingdom. W it h in the space of fifteen years, the Savings Bank deposits in Germany increased from £50,000,000 to £945,000,000. I visited the homes of the workers in Germany, and did not see in Berlin one slum as narrow as is the roadway running from L it t l e Collinsstreet along Cole's Book Arcade. not see any hungry men or women there, and, what is more, Berlin has no Thames embankment, with its shivering women and hungry men. neither Free Trade nor Protection will abolish poverty. Hong Kong is the only Free Trade place that I have visited, and there, in the year 1905, 1,100 bodies were thrown into the street, 200 of that number having died from the plague, smallpox, and cholera. England is a Revenue Tariff country, but she raises through the Customs more per head of her population than does any European nation, with the exception of Scandinavia. While neither Protection nor Free Trade will abolish poverty, it cannot be denied that Protection will build up for us a body of skilled artisans and workers, so that when the He said he was not State is wise enough to have Government workshops, we shall have educated of industry prepared to overlook and manage them. I regret that the Attorney-General is not present. present. Move the adjournment of the House. courage as my honourable friend has. While the Attorney-General is being sought, I would point out that a Select Committee, appointed by the House of Commons, selected the towns of Batley The hours of the and Dewsbury as representing the woollen trade of England, and compared the wages prevailing there with those ruling in two towns in Germany, viz., Forst and Cattbus, as nearly as possible alike. It was found that in every case, save in regard to heavy woollens, the German wages were higher than those ruling in the industry in England. I purpose now to prove that the Attorney-General is a member of a union which gives effect to preference to unionists more firmly and strongly, and in more deadly a manner, than any other union with which I am acquainted. According to a report in the Age of 23rd August last, he stated that there is no profession that demands a higher standard of honour from those engaged in it than does the Bar. No one has spoken more strongly against preference to unionists than has. the Attorney-General. He has said t h a t he feels it a duty-o r words to that effect--to remove from the statute-book the I did provision granting preference to unionists. I shall show that there is no difference be : tween preference to unionists when they are members of a trade union and the preI recognise that ference given to the members of what iscalled the Bar Association.

A similar B ill had been passed time and again, and rejected by the body of fossils known as the Legislative Council of Victoria, on one occasion by one vote only. During the discussion of the second reading, a case was O ' MALLEY I s Maxwelli n mentioned in which a barrister had reHe is a Christian. ceived forty guineas to appear before the I dare say he is, by Pull Court.

I feel a little angry when dealing with this subject, because I have suffered personally. The University of Melbourne petitioned Parliament to throw out the Bill. Mr the Argus. They spoke in no uncertain Mason asked some questions on the subject. These are the questions1. How many members compose the Council of the University of Melbourne? 2. Is it true that the Council of the said University determined at one of its recent meetings to petition Parliament to reject the B ill providing for the regulation of the practice of the legal profession? 3. How many members of the said Council voted in favour of the said petition? 4. What are their names? 5. Did these gentlemen petition Parliament in their individual names, or in their corporate capacity as the Council of the University of Melbourne? To them, the following replies were given 1. Twenty. 2. Yes. 3. Three. 4. Dr. Morrison, Mr Grice, and Dr. Robertson. To the last question, no answer could be given. In the debate, Mr Young quoted the Hon. Sir William Zeal, who had saidI f in the practice of my profession I ' undertake to do certain work for a constituent, and f a il to carry out my undertaking, my constituent can obtain heavy damages from me in a court of law. Why should the barrister who fails to do his duty be exempt from similar liability? men who are in peril of liberty if not of l if e ; and I have known such clients to be deserted by their barristers at the eleventh hour. Could the letters of the English alphabet form a word sufficient to express the contempt which should be poured upon such an action ? Sir William Zeal, a man honoured with a title by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, and occupying a position of distinction in this State, thought it necessary to support the measure in the words that I have read. That measure is the Act that the Attorney-General breaks surreptitiously and secretly. When I heard that a coterie of barristers was illegally and unjustly defying and defeating an Act of Parliament, I asked the Victorian Attorney-General of the dayMr William Shiels-for whom I am sure the present Commonwealth Attorney General has a great respect;Whether his attention had been directed to the fact that it was alleged that a number of practising barristers had entered into a conDr. Moloney. spiracy for the purpose of defeating an Act which was passed by Parliament during the present session, and if he was prepared to take some action in the matter? The question had been so well thrashed out by the Melbourne pressI pay my meed of praise to the Age and tone about this despicable conduct, which is still being persisted in. I said that I could, not do better than to read what had appeared in the press, and I read the following quotation from the Argus of the 5th December, 1891It is by no means compatible with the dignity, nay, with the honesty, of the bar to seek now to neutralize, by direct and underhand means that will not bear the light of day-per haps not even the light of the criminal law. I further saidThat was followed by a statement in the Age of the same date, to the effect that the tactics of the Bar Association had been demonstrated to be of a desperate and thoroughly despicable character, that "" no trades union has ever attempted to go so far in the direction of prohibiting, freedom of contract,"" and that the members of the Bar Association, while claiming to embody the conscience of the profession, were ""really looking after their own fat fees."" He trusted that the honourable gentleman would not allow what struck him as a layman to be an infringement of the rights of Parliament, and, he might also say, a certain amount of contempt offered to this House. Mr Shiels said, in speaking to my question, that he had no official knowledge on the matter at all, but simply the information he had gathered from the press, and at this stage Barristers have at times to defend he really did not know whether an association had been formed by a number of practising barristers, or whether the rules which had been published in the newspapers were rules of an association that had been formed, or merely a draft ofrules for a contemplated association Year by year, as honourable members knew, he had felt it to be his duty to speak against that measure and to vote against it, but now that it had been placed on the statute-book it deserved from him and every man, whether he had opposed it or not, the same implicit obedience that he gave to those Acts of Parliament of which he did approve. The action by which it was sought to defeat the Act appeared to him to be not only wrong and indefensible but utterly inconsistent with the profession of the bar, and also with the attitude which he understood the bar to take up with reference to the recent labour troubles. That law has not been removed from the statute-book of Victoria, although the Attorney-General has been not only Attorney-General of the State, but even Premier. Old members with a knowledge of the labour troubles in Victoria in 1891 will recognise the applicability of the argument of Mr Shiels against the'",58,Maloney Thos E Were His Workers Ready To Man Them And Masters
318,By Mr Munro,"action of the legal profession. I am glad to say that the Age of last Friday showed some of the splendid fighting power of the olden times in commenting on a case in which a Mr Morley, a barrister, had attended Court without a fee written on his brief. It is quite possible that Mr Morley desired to charge a small fee to an unfortunate client who could not pay more. Archibald Michie, at one time one of the foremost men of Victoria, who, because he accepted a small fee, was threatened with being brought before the Bar Association, which is as private a caucus as could be imagined. Sir Archibald, however, was as witty as he was great, and his reply was, "" Well, I took all the man had, and if you think that is unprofessional, I am done with it , "" In the case commented on in the Age of last Friday, the barrister had appeared without a fee marked on a folded piece of foolacap; and then the Judge, in all the glory of his wig and feathers, delivered himself to the effect that the Legislature had given to members of the Bar the exclusive right to practise in the Courts, and the Bar should do its best to command the confidence of the Legislature and the public. The comment of the Age on this was that the Legislature, so far from giving this exclusive right to the barristers, had taken away from them all the exclusive rights they had ever legally enjoyed. Section 10 of this State Act provides "" that no person shall be permitted to practise as barrister or solicitor solely, but every person admitted to the Supreme Court shall be admitted both as barrister and solicitor."" This Bar Association is an association formed to defy and destroy an Act of Parliament; and one of the principal movers in it is the present Attorney General of the Commonwealth. It is his duty as a man to resign from that union. If a solicitor were to meet the AttorneyGenerali n one of the higher Courts, where justice is supposed to be dispensed, the Attorney-General would refuse to appear with him, and thereby might tend to injure that solicitor in the earning of his livelihood. I should like to know of such an action being taken by a trade union. Trade unionism is held in such honour in Denmark-whic h is, perhaps, the most educated country in Europe today-that the Government desire all workers to join, and when money is distributed to the unemployed, unionists are actually used to pay the non-unionists their weekly allowance. The Age went on to say. . . . the Victorian Parliament passed a law some years ago with the avowed object of .amalgamating the two branches of the legal profession ; that this law abrogated the exclusive right of ""members of the bar"" to practise in 'the Courts, and that it sought to simplify procedure and lo reduce the expenses of litigants by This puts me in mind of Sir permitting solicitors to practise in the Courts as well as barristers. The law, in fact, made every solicitor a barrister, and its central intention was, in opening the Courts to solicitors, to abolish the necessity of either making or marking briefs, by allowing any solicitor who pleased both to prepare the case in his office and to plead it in the CourtsI t shows how successful the legal profession has been in setting the w ill of Parliament at nought and .ia keeping the people in helpless subjection to the Bill of Costs. I pay my meed of praise to the Age newspaper for that article, which stamps the Attorney-General as breaking and defying the law. I have shown that Judge Hodges was either woefully ignorant of the law he has sworn to administer, or he used a perverted judgment, and he actually threatened to send the barrister, not to an open Court, where the press is represented, but to a private caucus, of which the Attorney-General is a member. When the Home RuleB ill was before theBritish Parliament, Mr William Waldorf Astor, a multi-millionaire, who, by the power of his money bags, had been able to leave liis country and become a naturalized British subject, desired to have a clause inserted that would have made the Constitution as iron-bound as that of the United States. This clause was opposed, in the first place, by Mr. J . Ward, a Labour member, who said that the effect of a similar provision in the United States had been to make the Supreme Court superior to Parliament, and that it was most dangerous. Then Mr Asquith, the great PrimeM in ister of England, whom I wish our A t torney-General would follow in regard to the highest ethics of the law, saidI don't want to see this clause put into the Irish Constitution. If you adopt this clause you are enthroning your judiciary as the ultimate tribunal of appeal. You must not limit the powers of the Legislature which you intend to create. No Government is sound unless the lawmakers have the supreme power. We in England can't afford to give our Judges the power to say that the laws we make are bad.

By the latter measure every police magistrate, every policehave control for every day, and every man, every civil servant, was robbed of his rights of citizenship, and could only vote for certain individuals. I am glad to say that two out of the three elected were Labour men, and the other one should have been a Labour man, because he signed our platform. The Government have appointed to the chairmanship of the Inter-State Commission a man who some time ago showed the white feather in a way that I have never seen equalled. Mr Piddington, because a few members of the Lawyers' Trade Union did not think that he was fit to be a High Court Judge, climbed down. If he was not fit to be a High Court Judge he was not fit to be the Chairman of the InterState Commission. I enter my protest against his appointment, and if ever we secure the power of a recall I shall vote to remove him. There are in Australia 52,000 permanent public servants, 13,000 temporary officers, and 15,000 exempted men, making a total of 80,000. The railways employ 60,392, including a salaried staff of 7,600 and 52,792 others, being a total of over 140,392. Attorney-General has been accused by the leader of His Majesty's Opposition in the State Parliament of having said from the platform that, under similar circumstances as occurred in Victoria some years ago, he would help to bring in a Bill in this Parliament to treat the public servants of Australia as he treated the public servants of Victoria some years ago. defy him to try it. He dare not. I venture to tell him that if , as is rumoured, that he intended to do. I trust that the he is appointed Chief Justice of the High Court, groans and curses will leap to the lips of the public servants, who have neither forgotten nor forgiven the way rights of citizenship when he had that massive majority of thirty-five. Since then years have passed over and have whitened his hair. Now he sits in a Government with a majority of one, and I tell him to his face that he dare not do it. Aa for the talk of a dissolution, although I sit for a constituency which gave me an enormous majority, I cannot say that I should welcome anything of the kind. I should not. I should like both parties in this House to pass a Bill providing for the referendum and initiative, giving the people complete control over Parliament. A t present they have control only once in three years. They ought to hour, in the three years. I trust that we shall not again see a Judge of tlie Supreme Court so far forgetting himself as to defy the law of the land which lie has taken an oath to uphold. If we do, I trust that the power of recall will be established, and will be used to remove him from the Bench. I make no attack upon the Courts. I believe that our Courts are as pure as any in the world. Although we have copied the English Judicature system, I believe that our Courts are even better than those in England. But we must remember that two-thirds of the law is not statute law, but Judge-made law. I should gladly welcome the passing of a law to provide that no law or decision should be quoted and be binding for longer than ten years. If that were done, we should not witness such a spectacle as we have had lately, when the charities of Victoria were robbed by a decision of the Supreme Court. My old friend, Charles Forrest, used to say to me that when he died his money would do good to the poor and needy. But the The charities have been robbed, not by an unjust decision, but by a legal interpretation of the wording of Mr Forrest's will. If ever a man wished to leave all he had to charity it was my old friend Charles Forrest, a man by whose side I sat in Parliament for years, and who often spoke to me with satisfaction of the good that his money would do. Yet these I legal gentlemen, by finesse or otherwise, have robbed the charities of the good day will come when the Judges of this country will be elected by Parliament, as they are in Switzerland. When that is brought about, there will be more he robbed them of their justice in the land. A t present, we have in this city a building which cost £300,000, and which is used, not for the administration of justice, but for raising points of law. My honourable friend the member for Capricornia has spoken of the nationalization of health. I have advocated a policy of that kind for many years, and I should also like to see the complete nationalization of law. Once again I venture to make an appeal to the Government, and especially to the Prime Minister. Let him accept the principle of the referendum and initiative, as advocated by the Age newspaper, which gave his party four seats in Victoria. It is a coming question, as shown by the fact that twenty-two States in America have adopted it . Why should we not extend the hand of friendship to each other, pass a measure of that kind, and then go to the country? If he does that he will erect such a monument for himself that I think future generations might even find themselves capable of blessing him.

331,Mr Brennan,"There are two greatmy critic that a finger is not sacrilegious, with profit and progress. What do the according to my view, in the political sense, unless it is superimposed with the prospect, or at least the intention, of moving or impressing the object which is to be affected by it . The mere fact of a finger pointing is not sacrilege. It may be rude to point, but it is not sacrilege. In other words, the sacrilegious finger, of which I was speaking, was not a fingerpost. So long as our Liberal friends content themselves with merely indicating with this finger, not the road which they intend to go, but which the country is to believe they intend to go, and which they would like to go, as the honourable member for Gwydir interjects, so long will the finger cease to be sacrilegious within my view. I would like the Prime Minister to listen to reason in this matternot to go abroad and talk about leatherlunged time-wasters. Mere vituperation is not argument; mere reference to ""howling dingoes"" cannot possibly convince anybody, and as a man of peace I would suggest to the honourable gentleman who leads the House that he should pay fair deference-reason able respect-to the observations of honourable members on this side in regard to the difficult position in which we are placed. I put it to the Prime Minister that there are three courses open to him. He realizes and admits that without our co-operation no business can be done here in this Parliament. stances, h3 can do one of three things. He can take immediate steps to go to our masters, the electors. He can introduce matters of controversy-that is, matters on which it is worthwhile to have a controversy, and which we may advance to some extent by controversy. I see that in the policy paper there are some matters which might well be considered by the House. External Affairs has indicated to honourable members the lines on which the proposed legislation in regard to national inters of national concern on which we surance on a contributory basis, embracing sickness, accident, maternity, widowhood, and unemployment is to proceed. Here, in themselves, are some matters which might well be discussed in a sane, reasonable manner on the floor of the House. There are a great many other questions within the jurisdiction of the Federal land monopoly in the Northern Territory. Parliament which, as honourable members have pointed out, we might discuss here Government elect to do? They elect neither to go to the country at once, m d say they are unable to carry on, nor to promise us something on which we might be able to come to a basis of agreement. Most honourable members have said, "" We are ready to go to the country."" I think that the electors treated me about as generously as they treated We must draw that distinction. any man on this side of the Chamber. I stand about fourth on the list of those who obtained a very large majority; but, while that is so, we have to remember that we have just come from the country. I am very hopeful and, indeed, confident that we would win on an appeal to the people, but, after all, there is no paper reason, so to speak, by which we can satisfy ourselves that the verdict of the people, if sought immediately, would be greatly different from that given at the election held a short time ago. We have to remember also that an election is a costly business, and, further, that the general public are not fond of elections. doubtful business. ful business generally, and the people as a whole do not care to have any more elections than they can help.

In these circumstances, it is unthinkable that we will so far forget the trust which has been reposed in us as to permit of the passing of measures against our view of what is right. that the Prime Minister says it is absurd to suppose that any Government would introduce legislation merely because they knew that it would be acceptable to the Opposition. that the circumstances in which he finds himself are very peculiar. suit himself to those extraordinary circumstances as best he can. In this House there is an equal number of members upon either side, whilst in the Senate there is an overwhelming majority in opposition to the Government. Minister should, therefore, either appeal to the country-recognising the present situation straight away as an impossible oneor he should introduce legislation which is likely to be acceptable to this House. Anything short of that is the veriest sham and humbug. we will sanction the robbing of unionists of their rights. He knows perfectly well that any attempt of that sort is foredoomed to failure.

I am not going to prove these particular cases. We could not, if we The answer given to them has been, '' Why do you not prosecute the offenders?"" The electors sent us here on that is not a legitimate answer. It is not a question of whether we can successfully prosecute and convict individuals; it is a question of whether the system of voting commands anything like public confidence. If there is one thing more than another which ought to be pure, it I understand is our electoral law. If that law is corrupt, then the whole edifice of Democracy reared on it will be of unstable character. Our electoral law should be sound, and, as far as possible, pure. My honourable friends I would remind him opposite, I dare say, will agree with that view. Now, the great test of purity is He has to public confidence. When we find-as we do find in this House-partie s equally divided, it is the strongest possible indication that the postal vote does not command public confidence, for that was one of the matters on which we were reThe Prime turned. We are about to appeal to the great jury of the people. But whenever you are about to appeal to a jury, I would remind the honourable member for Melbourne that jou have the right of challenge. There is the obligation imposed upon us of seeing that the It is nonsense to pretend that jury as far as possible is a clean onea jury free from all bias. In other words, every effort should be made to insure a fair trial. In attempting to restore the postal vote, which, according to the reHaving sults of the last election, is absolutely distasteful to at least one-half of the people of Australia, the action of the Government is tantamount to saying, "" We will We are make our appeal to the people, but before we do so we shall see that the jury is packed."" We have had sufficient instances of how the postal vote was misused. It is not necessary to repeat them. But I cannot pass from this subject without asking honourable members "" Who are the members of this party who talk about enfranchising electors whom the Labour party has disfranchised?""

It bringsproved to be a mare's nest. greedily seized upon by the Liberal party and their friends in the press as a scandal which they thought they might work up against us, but the threatened explosion proved to be a mere squib. uncommon experience, so far as we are concerned. We are not entirely unused to such a thing. While that is so, I am quite prepared to see the system of absent voting submitted to any reasonable test. I do not stand pledged to any particular form of absent voting. I am prepared to see the present system surrounded by any safeguards that can be suggested as likely to improve it. I do not say that we must have the system of absent voting exactly as it is at present, although honourable members opposite declare that we must have a certain system of postal voting. If they can suggest a better form of absent voting, let us have it with greater security, if greater security be needed. My final word upon the subject is that, while the Liberal party went into hysterics in regard to the absent-voting system, it has been proved, so far as the inquiry has gone, to be absolutely free from abuse; whereas, so far as we have gone into the question of postal voting, our case that it is inherently open to abuse, and that it has been abused in hundreds of instances, is substantially proved. The case against postal voting on grounds of public policy and public confidence has been made out; Perhaps at this stage the Prime Minister will agree that I should have leave to continue my remarks to-morrow. pared to go on, more especially as the Attorney-General, whom we do not always have with us, is present. I am going to ask him to do me the honour of listening to some observations concerning tlie subject of industrial unrest. I should like to have a heart to heart talk with him, as one fellow unionist to another, about this matter. It is curious that, in the last Parliament, one of the great complaints made against the Labour party was-indeed , if I remember rightly, it was one of the grounds of the want of confidence motion levelled against the Labour party-that we had failed to deal adequately with the great problem of industrial unrest. That was It was one of the Liberal party's grounds of attack. The question of industrial unrest is undoubtedly most important. I certainly would be the last to underrate it ; yet we find that the present Government, after the storm they raised throughout the country as to the cause and effect of That is no industrial unrest, have presented a programme-which , by our grace, they were allowed to digest and consider for a month-in which they make but two propositions for its settlement. Mark what these propositions are. In the first place, they propose to deprive one section of the people-the unionists, and that the most law-abiding sectionof their political rights; while, secondly, they propose to drive another section of the workers outside the law altogether. That is the' sum and substance of their political programme in regard to the great question of industrial unrest. Let me deal briefly with the question of preference to unionists. My words will be few, but I hope they will be enough. I am in the very happy position of knowing that the Attorney-»General largely agrees with me, or, rather, that I largely agree with him upon this subject. The Attorney-General says, "" I would wipe out preference of every kind."" On that point, I am not in agreement with him. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Lega l preference. gentleman said that he would wipe out legal preference altogether. When he made that statement, there were cheers from the ranks of Tuscany-fro m the party behind the Government. Nevertheless, his party is bound to the principle of legal preference to unionists; that is inferentially admitted In their programme. It is very interesting to know that the Attorney-General does not believe in the principle, and that honourable members of his party applaud him when he says that hedoes not believe in it. But, after all, beyond the fact that it shows that both the Cabinet and its supporters are somewhat divided on the question, it is not a matter of practical politics. The philosophic negatives of the Attorney-General will carry us no further. They may be interesting, but they do not advance usone step. He says that he would wipe out all sorts of legal preference. Hisparty, on the other hand, is committed to preference to unionists, as I understand, subject to the condition which -was",66,Maloney No T If Its Members General More Than That There Is An Obli

In other words, as the policy statement sets forth , they would prohibit preference to unionists being granted by the Court tomembers of any organization, any part of whose funds are directly or indirectly -applicable to political purposes. That is the principle upon which, under certain -conditions, preference is to be denied to -unionists; but honourable members opposite concede that, in certain other -conditions, preference should be granted to unionists. to mark that. Liberal party are very keen about the nlatter, or even that they really believe in it , but it is their avowed policy. They recognise that public opinion is strongly in favour of the principle, and they -come here, therefore, with a proposal for a modified preference to unionists. One of the reasons for this must be that they recognise that arbitration is based 'upon preference. Another must be that t h e y realize that the man who, as a member of an organization, submits himself to the arbitrament of the Court, and gives tip his right to strikea man who is a real friend to liis fellow workers-shoul d fee entitled, under certain conditions, to preference. These must be some of the reasons which move honourable members opposite to say that they will give preference to unionists under certain conditions. We say that the reasons are overwhelmingly in favour of the principle, and,, at least, they are sufficient to move the Government to. put preference to unionists in their policy, save where it is proved that a union's funds are devoted to political purposes. If . these reasons or any of them, are sufficient to induce the Government topropose preference to unionists, I ask the Attorney-General, and his supporters, how they can consistently deprive any man of the benefits of preference-to which they say he is entitled , for these reasons, or some othermerely because he holds certain political views. The position works down to that. There is no logical escape from it . The Attorney-General, I feel certain, knows perfectly well that there is no escape from it , and that is where I agree with him. I am not attributing to him something which he does not say, but this must be in his mind when he says, "" I would wipe away all preference."" MrW . H . IRVINE -cible preferences, certainly. away altogether; but his colleagues are favorable to the retention of legallyenforced preference under certainconditions. on that side. cerned only with the opinion of the Government. If men are entitled to preference for any of the reasons which I have put before the House-reason s which apI wish honourable members peal overwhelmingly to those on this side, I do not say that the and with sufficient force to ouropponents -ho w can the Liberal party, standingfor Democracy and equal rights, in the name of freedom, say, ' * You shall not use union funds for advancing opinions which are distasteful to us; if you do you shall be robbed of the preference to which you are entitled."" If a political opinion is a legal one, it does not matter how extravagant it may be. The Minister of Trade and Customs said the other night, "" I have heard of unionists who talk about making war on capitalism, who talk about the eternal war that must go on between capital and labour.""' He seemed to think that it would be an enormity to give such men preference. A war on capital might be a good thing or a bad thing, but every free man is entitled to hold what political opinion he likes, so longas he respects tbe rights of his fellows. If a union thinks that a war on capital is a proper thing to attempt, why should it not nse its funds to propagate that opinion ? dangerous. ting myself to any opinion on the subject. My point is that it is illogical in the extreme for gentlemen who talk about liberty and equal rights for all to t r y to rob a section of the community of its rights because of political opinions that are distasteful to them. It is they who are drawing distinctions between class and class, and who are penalizing one section as against others. It is they who are creating class antagonism. Can there be any doubt in the minds of those who have heard this discussion that the antipathy to preference to unionists is based, not on the application of union funds for political purposes, but on the application of those funds for political purposes antagonistic to All legally enforthe Liberal party?

Owing to the lateness the Leave granted; debate adjourned. Motion posedThat the House do now adjourn. I desire to ventilate a matter whicli is of sufficient importance to justify my claiming the attention of the House at this hour. I have to-day received a wire from Fremantle, which states that twelv-3 men were dismissed on Friday at the Henderson Naval Base; that there are now no survey hands employed there, and only one gang working on tlie water. The wire also says that it is reported that the naval men are to act as watchmen, and that the work will be closing in a week or two, there being now only forty men engaged in this particular work. wire ? of the TradesH a l l , Fremantle, who happens to be also secretary to the union with which those men are associated. question of the construction of a navai base at Jervoise Bay has been before this House different times, and we have been trying to secure from the Government some definite statement in regard to their future action. We have found out some rather peculiar things. On the 19th of last month, the Prime Minister stated that there would be four or five years' delay while waiting to see whether the dredging operations were a success. On the same day, there was an admission from the Prime Minister that the Henderson Baso should be established at Jervoise Bay, Admiral Henderson having recommended this particular site. as far back as the 13th of last month, we had the statement that it was intended to cease all work except surveying. On the 27th of last month I pointed out, and to-day I point out, that the surveyors themselves are being put off; and now we have this wire saying that no surveyors are engaged. I think there is some ground for alarm on the part of the people in the Fremantle area respecting the intentions of the Government. The Minister of Defence, in another place, has stated that the Government are acting on the advice of the first naval member of the Naval Board, and that the advice given by Admiral [32] Creswell was to employ an expert. I deBASE. sire to draw the attention of the House to the fact that Admira l Creswell's letter is we assembled-and that on that day there was a copy of the Government's intentions already in print. It seems to me an extraordinary thing that the letter should be of the same date as that on which we had a statement of policy from the Government laid on the table of the House. We can, I think, reasonably ask whether this is, not a question for the Naval Board, but a question of Government policy, and whether the Cabinet are not directly responsible for the cessation of work at Cockburn Sound? I go so far as to say that one member of the Cabineti n particular appears to be standing in the way; and I regret to have to make this statement. On reference to Hansard of the 21st and 22nd of last month, we find that the Treasurer, by interjection, has repeatedly stated that Mangel's Bay, or F r o m the secretary Rockingham, is infinitely better than Jervoise Bay.

360,Sir John Forrest,"Admira l Hendermiral Henderson had been over this particular sheet of water from one end to another; and, after obtaining all the local information in possession of the Government, he made that very significant remark. I should like to know exactly the position. On the 2nd September, we had the Treasurer, according to a statement in the Argus, wiring to the Mayor of Fremantle a long telegram in which he stated, amongst other things, that there was nothing in the least to be alarmed about, and that, from a Western Australian and an Australian point of view, there was reason for satisfaction, and that dredges were under order to dredge the channel. Seeing that the Fisher Administration also had a direct recommendation from the members of the Naval Board that Jervoise Bay was the better site, I cannot for the life of me understand why there is need for this cessation of work to-day. fore, it appears to me to be a case of A d miral Henderson supported by the Naval Board versus my right honourable friend the Treasurer. the members of this House want to know -exactly what the intentions of the Government are. down the works ? honest and open, and say so ? Why should Ministers shelter themselves behind statements to the effect that they are waiting, for further data, when, as a matter of fact, they are destroying the means whereby that data can be secured ? Prime Minister) [11.6] I should like to say, in reply to my honourable friend who has just sat down, that it is not a good way to get this work hurried on to hurl such charges about the chamber. so will not lead to the employment of another man, or to any more work being done than is being done now. sinister allegations about action on the part of the Treasurer are quite unworthy of ""my honourable friend, and unworthy of those who are prompting him from the other end. orable friend that this Government, as long as it occupies its present position, will not have its policy dictated by any outside body whatever. tinctly understood. perts ? has come because of the policy of the party He d i d ; but A d of which my honourable friend is a member-becaus e of their failure to get expert advice as recommended by Admiral Henderson. Honourable members opposite have had their politics out of this thing. We have to bear the brunt of it all now. They put their men on for the elections, and have had all the benefit. Now they are abusing us, who have to "" carry the baby."" I dare say we shall be able to put up with it , but it is not fair that these charges should be made without a tittle of justification. If there is one man in this country who is anxious to get that work hurried forward, it is the Treasurer. the site. He has proved that to-night. trouble in regard to the site is this-and it is the trouble of every responsible man in such a situation-that it is of no use to Thereput works down in a place with a prospect of having to shift them afterwards. That is the point to be considered. The people of Fremantle and Government are not going to consider the advice of the experts of the Department. Are they going to close the advice of the experts of the DepartI f so, why not be ment, and the Naval Board is recommending what is being done. It was the last Government that set up this Board. Honourable members opposite supported it for three years, and never once raised their voices against it . able member's party were here, and did not raise their voices. All these things which they are now condemning are done on the advice of a body of their own To do creation. All these gentleman allege that there is anything wrong with the Naval Board? able member's followers are doing that. Nothing has been right with the BoardI should like to tell my honsince they left office. Everything was right when they were in office; everything is wrong now.
