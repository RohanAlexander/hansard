Judging hy the notice-paper, there is not very much business to be transacted during the next week or two. The Development and Migration Bill and the Judiciary Bill are the only two measures of importance to be disposed of, and it is conceivable that both can be dealt with in two weeks. The Treasurer will be fortunate if be has his budget ready for delivery by the second week in July. Of course, if the States Grants Bill is to be proceeded with it will take some little time; but tbe Government would be well advised to leave in abeyance the proposal to deprive the States of the -per capita grant. An attempt to give effect to it would endanger the chance of having the referendum proposals carried, t t would certainly bring about a conflict between the States and the Commonwealth. I venture to say that very few people would stand behind the Commonwealth if it endeavoured to force the States to accept the proposal without affording tihem ample time to consider it. cannot discuss that matter under cover of this motion. that, but the honourable member does not happen to be now in the chair.

I should take no exception to the Prime Minister's proposal if I thought it was necessary to meet on Tuesdays, hut I see no reason at the moment for doing so. It will he three weeks before the budget is delivered, and the Government will not be able to proceed with the debate on its financial proposals until honourable memhers have had a reasonable opportunity of considering them. Therefore, we shall have at least a month in which to discuss the small amount of business now on the notice paper. offer no opposition to the motion, because I realize that the Government is the best judge of the measures to be submitted to Parliament, and of the time their discussion will take; I rise merely to ask the Prime Ministeri f he is in a position to indicate how long it will be before the House rises?

One consideration lhat affects my judgment is that, although people may desire this article for its appearance-the sheen and beauty of its surface-it clearly competes, to the extent of its success in trade, with some of the commodities in which Australia is vitally and basically interested. I refer particularly to wool. There cannot be a wool man in Australia who. does not witness, with some degree of apprehension, the invasion by this trade, particularly in respect to women's garments. newspaper recently I read a statement by one of the principal British manufacturers of male and 'female clothing regarding the changes that have taken place in recent years in the habiliments of men and women. That manufacturer said that it takes two able bodied sheep to clothe a man, but that one enterprising and vigorous silkworm can clothe a woman. .

Some information was given in the Senate about Courtaulds Limited, the British company which was established to make artificial silk by a secret process; but I should like to give honourable members some more explicit information on the subject. This monopolistic concern was in f u l l operation during the last year prior to the war, and the first year for which I have been able to obtain figures is 1914. The profit of the firm in that year was Â£520,000. I do not know what the capital of the company was then, but it is now in the neighbourhood of Â£20,000,000. I have not been able to obtain the profits for 1915, but in the following years it was: 1916, Â£1,083,000; 1917, Â£1,170,000; 1918, Â£1,184,000; 1919, Â£2,280,000; 1920, Â£1,804,000; 1921, Â£1,684,000; 1922, Â£3,018,000; 1923, Â£2,916,000; 1924, Â£3,880,000 ; and 1925, Â£5,112,000. As a result of those gigantic profits it has been able to appropriate in the last three years the following sums to reserves: 1922, Â£1,250,000; 1923, Â£1,400,000; 1924, Â£1,650,000. The total amount appropriated to reserves fro m 1914 to 1924 was Â£7,349,000. In a closed or the actual reserves? were made from profits. I know nothing of what the English law compels the company to disclose. I have worked out the procedure adopted by the company with respect to its share interests. The figures read like a fairy tale. I know of no commercial undertaking in this or any other country that is comparable with it . The As artificial silk comrichest gold mines that ever broke out in Australia, A f r i c a , or anywhere else have not given anything like the result of this company's trading operations. The shares have been watered on many The subject is occasions, and some of the figures I shall give. My calculations boil down to this at Â£ 1 each in 1914, and held them u n t i l manufacturers to-day, they would now be worth Â£4,905 to him. The rates of declared and paid dividends per annum, apart from watered stock and reservations, have been-1914 , 12J per oent.; 1915, 20 per cent.; 1916, 30 per cent.; 1917, 30 per cent.; 1918, 32J per cent.; 1919, 40 per cent.; 1920, 35 per cent.; 1921, 37Â£ ner cent.; 1922, T h a t pamphlet, by the 674 per cent.; 1923, 90 per cent.; 1924, 120 per cent. In the year 1919 the company doubled its ordinary stock by giving bonus shares on the basis of one to one, and in 1920 it trebled its stock, so that 100 shares in 1914 became 200 in 1919 and 600 in 1920. In 1924 it issued 400 preference shares for each original 100, therefore 100 shares in 1914 by that year became 600 ordinary and 400 preference shares. The valuation, according to the last English quotations, is Â£ 6 10s. each for ordinary shares, so that 600 of such shares are worth Â£3,900. The 400 preference shares at par, are worth Â£400, and the dividends received on the 100 shares amounted to Â£605. Thus the total return from the original Â£100 would be the",18,Customs Tariffbill

When we are considering. the fixing of duties and the influence of this business on our trade, we should not fail to remember that the benefit accrues to a gigantic world monopoly, the richest and most lucrative investment that this or any other country has ever seen. Mr G. call up additional capital when it watered its stock? is no record of it . A t the rate of profit disclosed, it did not need extra capital. It would not need even a premium on shares; it could just split them, and issue the necessary scrip. Sof a r as my calculation of the present value of Â£100 in vested in 1914 is concerned, it does not matter whether capital was called up or not. British industries, we must be careful, in cases in which huge profits go to a small group of men, not to let our sympathy run away with our judgment. I think the duties suggested by the Senate are unduly low. I have heard from the Minister for the first time to-day that' there is a prospect of establishing this industry in Australia. I do not know how that can be, unless the right to manufacture under this secret process has been bought from Courtauld and Company by an Australian enterprise. pany may be opening up here. ness were a branch of the oversea company, I should be the better pleased. One eifect of the 1921 tariff and subsequent amendments of it has been to induce a number of British manufacturers to establish enterprises in this country, thus providing work and wages for Australian workmen. To that extent the tariff has been of benefit; but if all the profits go to England at the rate of Â£5,000,000 or Â£6,000,000. a year, and to one group of enterprising and successful investors, I feel less inclined to give a preference to Great Britain than when the conditions of manufacture are competitive. We should not accept in its entirety the sugAs one gestion of the Senate. The Senate's amendment fixes for artificial silk the three rates of duty which formerly operated against silk. Those rates are not splitting, I say that not unnaturally high. I doubt whether we modern commercial history has should have lowered the duty for anything except British silk, in the hope that Great Britain might obtain a larger share of the trade in silk articles. If you would permit me, sir, I would move for an increase in the duties from 15 per cent., 15 per cent., and 20 per cent, to 20 per cent., 20 per cent., and 25 per cent, respectively. Asi t would not be in order for me to move such an amendment, I Customs should do so. Such an alteration would effect a desirable check on I do not think so; there this trade, and, to some extent, encourage the use of our Australian woollens for human underwear and overwear. It would also indicate that, no matter how satisfied the people who wear, these goods may be, we do not intend to allow trade, which is based on deception, to go unchecked in this country. A f t e r listening to the remarks of the right honourable member for Balaclava. ( MrW a t t ) on this matter, one is forced to the conclusion that the Senate has rendered good service in seeking to distinguish between artificial and real silk. It is enlightening to learn that the authorities w ill not permit artificial silk to be imported into the United States of Americai n any for m that may deceive the people; and I submit that we should take similar action. I hold, of course, that we should do all we can to foster Australian industries; but we have no evidence that this is one; all we have If the Australian busii n that regard is the statement of the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr. Pratten), that it is likely to be established. It would appear from the remarks of the right honourable member for Balaclava, however, that it cannot be established here unless certain patent rights are acquired. secret process. not follow that because we cannot manufacture artificial silk we should permit",19,Customs Tariffbill

41,Mr Charlton,"It certainly doesthose who can to make fabulous profits in selling it to our people. The profits of this company are staggering, and I , for one, am totally opposed to permitting such a monopoly to extract from the public more than a fair thing. At least, if artificial silk is to be permitted to come here, we should take some of the plunder for the benefit of our people. There can be no doubt that it is plunder, if the statement of the right honourable member for Balaclava is correct, and I have no doubt that it is. A move is on foot to establish the wood-pulp industry in Tasmania, and, as wood pulp is an essential ingredient in the manufacture of artificial silk, the company concerned in that enterprise may be able to acquire the right to manufacture artificial silk here; but, as things are, I support the suggestion of the right honourable member for Balaclava that the duties should be increased. Generally speaking, I am not favorable to imposing high duties on goods that are not manufactured or likely to be manufactured in Australia; but we are entitled to do so on the goods, of a company like this. The balance sheet that has been referred to shows that a profit of from 100 per cent, to 120 per cent, was made by the company in one year. I regret that honourable members were not given sufficient information on this matter when it was before them previously; but, even though I may appear to be somewhat inconsistent, I intend to support the suggestion that has been made, and I trust that the Minister for Trade and Customs will accept it. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) would not be in order in moving an amendment to increase the duties, but I shall treat his proposal as a suggestion to the Minister, who would be in order in moving in that direction. would be in order in moving for an increase in tbe duty, so I merely suggested it ; but I trust that the Minister for TradeI also urge the Minister to accept the sugand Customs will earnestly consider the representations that have been made, and himself move as I have suggested. am glad that the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) does not intend to importune the Minister, but I trust that his suggestion will be accepted. I take a wider view of the matter than the right honourable member, for I realize the effect that this trade is likely to have upon our great woollen industry. It would be against the best interests of Australia for this wool-out-of-wood industry to be established here at the expense of the real wool industry. I do .not know whether we can by legislation affect the fashion for wearing this seductive apparel. member know it is seductive? member's illustration and arguments satisfied me on that score, but I shall not pursue that aspect of the matter further. It would be a serious thing for us to encourage anything that would adversely affect either wool production or manufacture in Australia. We produce in Australia wool in abundance that is not excelled in quality in any part of the world, and we ought to do everything possible to stimulate its manufacture here! We have established woollen mills in practically every State to manufacture the requirements of our own people; and I hope that honourable members will do all they possibly can to increase these manufacturing operations. If , having first class raw material here, the adaptability of our people is not sufficient, with the aid of modern science, to enable them to manufacture it to such a degree that we shall be able to export as well as supply our own requirements in manufactured goods, we should give up all claim to being a first class nation. Any attempt to stimulate a temporary fashionable trade at the expense of our great woollen industry would be madness. I welcome the suggestion of the right honourable member for Balaclava; and, in the interests of our great foundational industry, which so successfully tided the nation I doubted whether I over its serious crisis a few years ago, I trust that the Minister will adopt it . gestion of the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), but on different grounds from those of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers).

It is a pleasure for me to walk along the streets of Sydney and Melbourne and see from 75 per cent, to 80 per cent, of our women and girls wearing beautiful silk or artificial silk stockings. Even girls who are earning only the basic wage can afford to buy artifi'cial silk stockings, for they may be purchased at 4s. l i d . , 5s. l i d . , and 6s. l i d . a pair. How many of us would like to go back to the fashion of, say, ten years ago, when even the small length of stocking that the prevailing fashion permitted us to see was of heavy texture, coloured black or navy blue. The figures quoted by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) give the surest indication that artificial silk has come to stay. that the fortunate proprietors of the -formula for its manufacture made in one year a profit of Â£4,500,000. They have exploited the whole of the world. Ladies of every nation use this material in stockings and other garments, and it is also used in the manufacture of articles of clothing worn by men. Its manufacture will be continued, and the question is, whether we should allow it to be confined to England or should encourage or compel it to be carried on in Australia. By the proposed increase in the duty, we might impress upon the holders of the formula the desirability of establishing factories in Australia for the manufacture of artificial silk. manufacture is a simple process. It would not be affected by our climatic conditions, and, while it requires no great labour, it is an industry that is eminently suited to Australia. question may be considered from two points of view-that of those who believe that a high tariff is of advantage to the -woollen industry of Australia, and also that of those who believe that the increased duty would lead to the establishment of a-n industry here to meet the requirements of the women folk of this country. Artificial silk is regarded by our women folk as necessary, and there can be no question that the articles made from it are beautiful. I have some ladies' garments here, which are turned out by the Lustre Hose Company, of Sydney, at a price of 7s. 6d. each. Honourable members will notice the sheen aud lustre of these beautiful garments. They are manufactured in Australia by Australian workers, under Australian conditions, hours, and wages. I have a sample, also of artificial silk, of tubular material piece goods, with a figured design, knitted in Sydney by the same firm. yarn is imported. goods are manufactured in Australia, and will compete successfully with the. imported article. If the Minister accepts the suggestion to increase the duty, the effect will probably be that the whole of the artificial silk goods used in Australia will be manufactured here. I am not very much concerned about the effect upon the woollen industry, because manufacturers of these goods frequently It is asserted combine a little wool or cotton with the artificial silk, and the increased use of artificial silk for the manufacture of garments will very probably lead to an increase in the use of wool. In any case, artificial silk has come to stay, aud it will be used in Australia. scribed. right honourable gentleman. The Customs Department should take action 'against unscrupulous traders who, after importing artificial silk goods, properly marked, mutilate the description, and sell them as silk. The average purchaser knows as well as the manufacturer what I believe that its are silk goods and what goods are made of artificial silk, but traders who attempt to mislead the public should be penalized for their misrepresentation. The heard some very startling figures as to the profits made by manufacturers of artificial silk. British company,I think, were chiefly referred to. These staggering profits have rather carried honourable members away. I remind them that the profits made in the manufacture of artificial silk have no connection with the item under discussion.

54,Mr Mann,"The profits made by amanufacture of artificial silk, because the item deals with made-up articles of clothing. If , as suggested by the honourable inemiber for Darling( Mr Blakeley), the duty should be increased merely to encourage the making up of artificial silk in the garments here, then the profits made by manufacturers of the material have nothing to do with the case. The honourable member for Darling pointed out that artificial silk is being imported into Australia, and is being made up into garments by Australian workers. Apparently the existing duties are sufficient for this purpose. for Darling seems content that Australian hands should remain idle. argument of the honourable member for ""Wannon( Mr Rodgers) directly. Apparently, under the existing duties our work-people can be profitably engaged in making up these articles of clothing. An increase in the duty on artificial silk would only make the carrying on of the industry referred to by the honourable member for Darling more difficult. goods that the increased duty would be levied. sideration deals with made-up articles of clothing, not including piece goods, and, therefore, an increase in duty on the item would only render more difficult the carrying on of the industry referred to by the honourable member for Darling. I do not defend the extraordinary profits made by the British company manufacturing artificial silk. It is obvious that that company is selling at a price very much higher than it could afford to take, and yet give the public proper service. It is fallacious to suppose that the proposed increase of duty would reduce the profits of the British company. The right honourable member for Balaclava argues on the assumption that the manufacturer of the raw material always pays the duty. duty would make the manufacturers sell at a lower price, or, paying the increased duty, ""they would make less profit. MrM ' ANN price, the consumption of their goods might be greatly increased, and there might be no decrease in their profits. The argument of high protectionists, that the foreign manufacturer pays the duty, has over and over again been proved to be fallacious. My objection to the proposed increase of duty is that it must impose an extra burden, not upon the manufacturer of artificial silk in Great Britain, but on users of the material in Australia. Instead of being carried away in an outburst of indignation because of has the high profits made by a manufacturing company in Great Britain, we should consider the effect of the proposed increase of duty upon our own people. The honourable member for Darling rightly expatiated upon the tremendous extent to which articles made of artificial silk are now used in Australia. He explained that under the existing economic conI shall come to the ditions women and girls are able to buy these goods at very low rates, and are thus able to dress in a fashion that is both becoming and desirable. Buti f we increase the duty, we shall make it more difficult for our' women and girls to dress themselves in this material. Honourable members may say what they like about the desirableness of adopting certain fashions, and the honourable member for Wannon may rage against the displaceN o . It is only on piece ment of wool by artificial silk, but those who t r y to stand in the way of fashions remind one of Canute reproving and tryT h e item under coning to restrain the advance of the sea. The increase of the duty would impose an additional burden on every woman in this community, and, I think, would lead to a very severe protest. would be on piece goods. have pointed out that the basis of the argument in support of an increased duty is the profits made by the manufacturer' of the raw material. member think that a great wool-producing country should do anything to facilitate the entry of such goods as artificial silk ? No ; but the increased is very candid. candid and, I think, consistent in my attitude on these matters. The honorI f they sold at a lower able member for Wannon, in my opinion, takes a short-sighted view in supposing that the introduction of this material will have a serious eifect upon the wool industry.

My contention is that our whole high protective policy, so f a r from protecting the woollen industry, has the effect of handicapping it . Instead of affording protection to our woollen industry, as the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Eodgers) suggests it will, this duty will prevent and hinder the sale of our wool in exchange for those articles we purchase abroad. hinder our wool going out. anything is done to prevent our purchase of goods in return for the wool We can only sell our wool by purchasing goods abroad. should not open up a discussion on the economic aspect of the question. honourable member and other protectionists desire is to discuss the economic aspect of the question. They would rather make an appeal to sentiment which has no foundation behind it . One effect of high protection on our woollen industry is the inducement it offers to nations abroad to grow wool in opposition to us. As a matter of fact, our' woollen industry is already meeting with serious competition abroad, and only a few days ago our newspapers were alluding to the increased export of our well-bred sheep to South Africa, which is growing wool in opposition to Australia. If the Minister adopts the suggestion to further increase the duty on artificial silk, it will impose an extraburden on every one in the community, when already the cost of living is exceedingly high. Like the flowers that bloom in the spring, the argument about the high profits made by certain people in GreatB r it a in has nothing to do with the case. I propose to vote against the Senate's request, and against any proposal to further increase the duty on artificial silk. honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) is under a misapprehension in thinking that the rates ofduty under discussion apply to made-up clothing, and, therefore, could have no effect on the company referred to by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) . As a matter of fact, the duties apply to piece goods, the importation of which does affect the profits of that company. The duties on artificial silk piece goods have no relation to yarn or the raw material used by Australian manufacturers. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Perth is opposed to any effort to build up or protect Australian industries, primary or secondary; but the points so forcibly put by the right honourable member for Balaclava should appeal to h i m . We are not likely to be influenced by the high profits made by the manufacturers of artificial silk, but they certainly give us some idea of the profitable nature of the industry. I agree w it h the right honourable member for Balaclava that this article is wrongly described. It has no more right to be called silk than it has to be called steel or iron. The right honourable member for Balaclava has made out a strong case for an increased duty, but I The last thing that the do not think the increase he has suggested is sufficient. A duty of 20 per cent, on an article of this description would have very little effect. I think there ought to be a flat rate per yard in addition to an ad valorem duty of 20 per cent. We are entitled to give due weight to the arguments submitted by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr. Rodgers). Our woollen industry is one of our staple industries. We depend upon it to keep our country solvent, and we ought to encourage the wearing of woollen goods by discouraging the use of artificial silk. Fashion may demand thÂ© wearing of artificial silk, b u t when we are considering an economic policy for Australia it is well for us to consider the needs of one of our own staple industries as well as the health of our own people. It cannot bo good for the health of our community to wear so much wood and t in made up into a form described as artificial silk, instead of those finer wools produced in Australia which can be made up into the most beautiful garments one could wish to wear. member ask our ladies to wear woollen stockings ? not been carried away by the enthusiasm of the honourable member for Darling and his references to the beauty of artificial silk stockings.

I hope that the Minister w ill accept the suggestion of the right honourable member for Balaclava and impose an additional ad valorem duty, and I trust that on top of that he will impose a flat rate. Many of the piece goods classed as artificial silk contain considerable quantities of cotton. A duty of 20 per cent, on such goods would amount to not more than a few pence per yard. the duty effective we shall have to deal with these articles in the satisfactory way in which we dealt with cotton tweedsby the imposition, of a flat rate. In the tariff as -it left this House the duty on artificial silk was the same as the duty on real silk. That was unfair, because a 20 per cent, duty on silk goods would be very much higher than a 40 per cent, duty on artificial silk. In order to prevent this country from beingflooded with these better conductor of heat than wool or articles, I suggest the imposition of a flat rate as well as a 20 per cent, ad valorem duty. I cannot suggest what the flat rate should be, because one would need to eo into the invoice values of these goods to ascertain what would be an effective rate to impose.

The Government proposed, in September last, a reduction of the general duty on carpets and rugs. At that time, there appeared to be no possibility of developing Australian manufacture, but since then I have been informed that the suggested reduction of duty has discouraged two schemes to establish local factories for the production of carpets. As the Government has no desire to stifle a prospective Australian industry, I intend to propose a modificar tion of the request by restoring the duties imposed under the 1921 tariff. The bill, as it left this committee, had reduced the duties, but the Senate has proposed an increase in respect of portion of the item. Since the tariff left this committee, the representative of a very big English firm has urgently requested that the existing the possibility of establishing carpet factories in Australia.

79,Mr Pratten (Martin,"Minister .forThat the requested amendment be made. -This item provides, inter alia, for the imposition of a duty on wristlet watch cases. In the old tariff there were certain anomalies which pressed very heavily upon those engaged in the watch trade, and although they were removed by the alterations proposed in this tariff, the representative of the Government in the Senate moved a request, the effect of which is not only to restore them, but even to make them worse. Apparently it was represented to the Minister that watch cases were being manufactured in this country. As to that I think he was misinformed. It is evident that in altering this at an industry that could manufacture a substantial number of watch cases. It clearly did not contemplate the making of individual cases by hand, but the stamping of them out by machinery, as is the practice in other countries where they are made. Eor the industry to have a reasonable chance'of success in a market of 6,000,000 people, it must manufacture the cases in considerable numbers. If it can make only six or eight cases a month or a year, its operations w ill not be very profitable, because the machinery required is expensive. I went into a jeweller's shop the other day, and was shown 58 varieties of wristlet watches, and I was informed, and believe, that there are hundreds of varieties. Honourable members who wear wristlet watches may see for themselves, by comparing their own watches w i th those of their fellow memhers, that there is a very great variety of them. While that is true of men's watches, the variety of ladies watches is even greater. octagonal and oval watches, and watches of many different sizes and shapes. Members of the trade assure me that no industry for the manufacture of these watch cases is established in this country, and that there is no possibility of one being established. Imported cases come, for the most part, from Switzerland. Although British firms make some cases, they import most of their requirements, and place English works in them. Sometimes they import both works and cases, and merely fit them together. some figures comparing importations of complete watches w it h importations of watch movements for insertion into Australian-made watch cases:1920-21. 1921-22. 1923-24. 1924-26.

It costs more for a winding stem turned and fitted in this country to a wristlet duty the Government aimed watch than for a good imported watch. encouraging in . this country Therefore, in order that the industry may succeed, it must be standardized, and must produce only one kind of watch case. To do that w i th wristlet watches would be to impose upon the retailer the impossible task, in view of the varying tastes of individuals, of selling wristlet watches of only one pattern. TheM in ister has been led to believe that something is possible which our common sense tells us is impossible. I ask h i m not to accept the requested amendment. Trade and Customs) [12.59] -There has been .much complicated negotiation in connection with this matter. In the first place the Government proposed a reduction of duty on all watches, but later it was discovered that a small industry, which we did not wish to discourage, existed in this country. Protests were lodged by those concerned, and an alteration was made in the item 1 in this chamber. Conferences were held There are between the Comptroller-General of Customs and representatives of the trade, and ultimately all the conflicting in terests were brought into line. right honourable member will notice that power is given to the Minister by departmental regulations, not only to help the local industry, but also to prevent injustice from being done to the retail traders.

WhilstI personally sympathize w it h the reasons which prompted a majority of members of another place to request an increase of the duty, which is a significant gesture of the times and illustrates to a remarkable degree the desire of our public men to enCourage British and Australian f i l m in in the duty on imported films. One can terests, I cannot accede to the requesx. The problems confronting the Government on this subject would still be unsolved, -even if the requested amendment of the item were made. Honourable members w ill see from the proposals I have outlined that the Government realizes the seriousness of the situation, and is giving consideration to it with the keenest possible desire to develop the film-producing industry along the lines desired by the House. England, so far as film production is concerned, must first help herself. The Empire w ill provide a large and profitable market for even the most ambitious productions, and it is surely within the ability of our business men and statesmen to arrange co-operation between the Motherland .and the Dominions which will result in the production of films that will foster and develop the sentiment and traditions of the Empire. I am glad to be able to say in connection with this matter that our Migration Department has turned out a considerable quantity of Australian films. Speaking from memory, I think the production this year will run to about 500,000 feet. The series of films made by the Migration Department and known as the "" Our Own Country Series"" has been exhibited throughout the length and breadth of Australia, and I can say from personal knowledge and from in the people who attend the shows want quiry that it has everywhere been received with considerable approval. one is more anxious than I am to see on our screens evidence of such development; but I do not think that it could be hastened by acceding to the request of another place to increase the duty on i m ported films by l d . per foot, an impost . [138] which would be passed on to the people. Sof a r as censorship is concerned, we are doing our best to carry out what I believe is the unanimous desire of this Parliament, but nothing can be done to increase the exhibition of British and Australian films in the Commonwealth u n t i l sufficient such films are available. When they are available, I shall unhesitatingly use my powers as Ministerf o r Trade and Customs to see that none are frozen out. Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr. Pratten} is to be commended for his decision to refuse the request for an increase conceive that the author of the request was actuated by the highest motives. He, no doubt, discovered that there are approximately 1,300 picture theatres in Australia, in which many million pounds have been invested for buildings, plant, and equipment. If he consulted statistics-he found that last year the picture shows were attended by about 100,000,000 people, and he naturally assumed that the field open to us might provide a rich harvest for a new Australian industry. If , however, he had had the experience of those engaged in the production of pictures in Australia, he would know that they had lef t behind them a record of bankruptcy, failure, and loss, and this would probably have deterred h i m from suggesting the course he has proposed. The apparent paradoxical nature of the position is easy of explanation, though it involves a factor which even the Minister for Trade and Customs has overlooked. The difficulty is not due to the importation of American or other foreign films; the want of a proper sentiment on the part of those who attend picture shows, or the anxiety of exhibitors to exclude from their programmes either English or Australian films. It is due to the fact that something different from what they are No given by Australian producers. ""Under their present contracts, exhibitors have to bear the burden of any increased duty that may be imposed. They are prepared to insert Australian pictures here and there in their programmes; but, if the extra duty were imposed on foreign films, one of their first acts would be",31,Francis Di D The Company Suggest That The Minister F O R Trade And

The argument of the honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley) -could be applied to every manufactured article mentioned in the tariff schedule. Some years ago, when the duty on imported films was imposed, petitions against it were drawn up, and we were told that it had resulted in increased prices being charged to the patrons of picture shows. was reduced but the picture-show proprietors did not reduce their prices. I hope that a committee of this Parliament will make a thoroughinvestigation into the picture business, which is now under the control of a strong combine, to which the imposition of an extra duty of l d . a foot on films would be a mere bagatelle. We must deal with this combine in a more drastic way. An -expert picture producer who arrived in Sydney from America a few weeks ago, with a capital of Â£250,000 behind him, proposes to commence taking pictures in Australia. He says that we have some of the finest scenery in the world. I hope that when he is established this House will be strong enough to conduct an in vestigation into the ramifications of the combine. No one is anxious to exclude pictures that are likely to be an intellectual treat to Australians; but the -majority of the pictures we get from America are representations of cowboys who wear big slouch hats and belts into which revolvers are thrust. shown flying around drinking, or in a saloon. picture we are told w ill elevate us or bring out the best that is in us. Some of the American films only serve to excite children, and are certainly of no benefit to their morals. I am pleased that the Minister, although he has not made any definite statement, intends to do something to check this importation, but in any case we. ought to have a The Minister's suggestion would thorough investigation into theprofits made by the combine. A duty of 2d. a foot on a film is of no consequence to it , because once a film is landed it passes from State to State and town to town, and is screened thousands of times. Pictures can be produced in Australia, where we have some of the finest scenery in the world, and the people in other countries would be only too pleased to see them; but the aim of those who are now in control of the industry is to discourage the production of such films. I hope that the Government will submit drastic proposals for dealing with this great combine, which is levying on those who attend picture shows a toll quite out of proportion to the value of the pictures themselves. I am more concerned about the subject it Subsequently the duty opens up than about the actual proposed increase of duty on films. Australia is, apparently, to be the happy huntingground of a country that closes its doors firmly against anything that Australia could send to it. It is a country that has a one-Way trade with Australia. I have no wish to make anything in the nature of an attack upon the great United States of America, but some of the methods it adopts for the extension of its trade are wonderfully astute; much more so than those adopted by the British Empire. Australia is overwhelmingly in favour of building up first its own industries, secondly the industries -of Great Britain, and thirdly the industries of those countries with which it has reciprocal agreements. The Americans specialize. They generally pick Out special lines for Australia, but they do not do as Australia does; they do not lose all sight of their goods once they are exported. They are too clever to do that. They follow their goods to the countries to which they are sent, and there they establish their own They are organizations for the distribution and on horseback, control of those goods. This is done with dancing with women such commodities as oil, machinery, motor That' is the class of vehicles, and films.

GREEN -The Sunshine harvesters beat American machines Western Australia. that, but America is an object-lesson to the world in the guardianship it exercises over its trade, both internal and external. We can get practically no Australian primary products into the United States of America, because that country protects its primary industries up to the hilt. Even Great Britain is unable to protect its own film industry against American competition, and, that being so, we cannot hope to protect the interests of the British film industry in the Australian market. thing to protect our own film industry other than by the method favoured by the honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley)-the building up of a sentiment in favour of our own films, which are very seldom on view. I hope that something will be done by the Government in a practical way, but exactly what can be done is a matter for the Minister to decide. It is ridiculous to contend that Australian audiences would not enjoy the screening of Australian scenery, or the in tellectual treat of viewing character sketches filmed in their own country. I hope that the Government will exercise a greater control over the importation of films whose object is apparently to let the world know how modern Americans live. I was confronted with the difficulty of censoring films referred to by the Minister. F i l m Censor-Professo r Wallace, whom I appointed-is a splendid man. is not a kill-joy. sense of the intellectual. his powers ought to be enlarged. If an arrangement could be made with the States by which he could act as agent for the States, thus avoiding divided control, great benefit would be obtained, so far as the morals of the community are conIn Western Australia more cerned, and many of the difficulties now confronting the Minister would disappear. However, unless Australia' watches The Western Australian its home market, it will be Americanized, not only in regard to pictures but also i u other respects. If the proposed increase of duty would encourage the Australian picture film industry, I should be strongly in favour of it ; but as the Minister( Mr Pratten) has shown, even in the opinion of the picture producers of Australia it in is unnecessary to impose this extra duty, because they do not need it . I see no reason for penalizing those who attend picture shows by the imposition of a duty which cannot possibly help an Australian industry. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley) has mentioned several producers who have lost money in trying to popularize Australian films Mr. StewartF . Doyle, who lost Â£100,000 in equipping studios, is not in favour of an increase in the duty, nor is Mr. Beaumont Smith, who has produced seventeen Australian films. These gentlemen say that in order to attract people But we can do someto the screening of an Australian picture it is necessary to sandwich it between imported films. Apartf r o m the Commonwealth Government films and "" The Sentimental B l o k e "" no Australian films' have been successful abroad. The rights for "" The Sentimental B l o k e "" were sold for a very small sum, but the purchaser -som e one in London -mad e Â£25,000 out of the picture. That the majority of films shown in GreatB r it a in are of American origin is sufficient answer to those who say that British films should take the place of American films in Australia. I am against the Americanization of this country, but, to a great extent, the sentiment of the people of the United States of America is also the sentiment of the people of Australia. Their films appeal to our sense of right The Commonwealth Chief and our manliness quite as much as do those produced.in Great Britain.

Personally, I do not want these distorted ideas of what loyalty demands of us to be presented to my children. A few years ago, numbers of French films were shown in Australian theatres. Those films may have presented what was regarded as the correct thing in French life, but they did not appeal to Australians. The sentiment expressed in American films is usually better than that of French films. prohibit a number of French films. made of the number of films depicting American"" cow boys."" I should not be surprised if many honourable members, after a strenuous week here in the performance of their duties, sit in easy chairs and peruse Zane Grey's books. The great out-door life of America, presented to his readers by Zane Grey, is better for the youth of Australia than the perverted view of life they gain from many so called society dramas. My only objection to American films is the tendency to deal with divorce cases, and to depict Scenes of domestic infelicity. Such scenes are repugnant to our sense of propriety. Reference has been made to that class of Australian film bearing the title ""Know Your Own Country."" These films are being exhibited in almost every picture theatre in the United States of America by the combines to which reference has been made, and their exhibition does not cost Australia a penny. It is true that those who present the pictures to American audiences pay nothing for the films to the Commonwealth Government, whereas local producers are required to pay a small fee for the privilege of exhibiting them, but the advertisement which Australia receives probably justifies the Government's action in making the films available to American theatre proprietors free of cost. Australian sentiment has been exploited by returned Australians who probably have taken, in the United States of America, the oath of naturalization, but come back here as true-blue Australians. Honourable members will possibly remember a picture entitled "" Jewelled Nights,"" in which Louise Lovely appeared. film exhibited in Australia, but Louise Lovely herself appeared on the stage for a few minutes each night.

That, however, is impossible. The American picture-producing companies, with their tremendous resources, are able to produce films in America which it would be impossible to produce here. Our population is too small. I admit that Australia should make a start in this industry, but I do not think that the imposition of an additional duty of l d . a foot on films imported from America will assist in that direction. The effect of the higher duty would be to raise the price of admission to the picture theatres; it would assist no Australian industry. On the contrary, the workers of Australia would be called upon to pay higher prices for admission to theatres showing American films.

Rather would the increased duty retard the picture-making industry in Australia. Evidence to that effect has been given before the Tariff Board by those engaged in the manufacture of films in Australia. They realize that for many years it will be imland. Our climatic conditions certainly possible for Australian producers to supply Australian audiences with a f u l l probut, compared with the population of the gramme of pictures made in this country. Consequently, Australian films must be shown in company with films produced in the United States of America. Mr our midst is a matter for regret; but we Brunton Smith, who is the largest manufacturer of Australian films, in giving evidence before the Tariff Board, said that any increased tariff on American films would not assist the Australian industry. While we must deplore the fact that Australian audiences prefer American films to those made in their own counorable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. try, we must take things as we find them; we must give the people what they want. Otherwise this industry will lapse. Most of the films manufactured in Australia have plots similar to those of the American films. Producers in Australia have found that, unless they do that, the people will not patronize their productions. Reference has been made to an Australian film entitled ""The Mystery of a Hansom Cab."" That was a good film; but did it convey any Australian sentiment? Most honourable members know the plot, which for the most part is laid in Melbourne, and they will agree that, if it were true, it would be nothing of which Melbourne need be proud. Eor films to be successful they must, to an extent, be sensational. Sensationalism is not Australian sentiment. like to see it a rule that every programme of pictures shown in Australia should contain a certain proportion of Australian-made films. the States. Minister can do no more than exercise a GRAFTON TO SOUTH BRISBANE rigorous censorship over all films. Notwithstanding that American films, imported into Great Britain, are subjected to a tax of 5d. a foot, 95 per cent, of the Works and Railways) [3.33] I movefilms shown there are of American origin. It is, therefore, hopeless for us to smaller tax, British films will take the place of American films in this country. The climatic conditions of Great Britain make the cost of producing films there much greater than it is in the United States of America. An artist in Los Angeles, in California, can frequently do, in one hour, as much work as would take him three or four hours in Engare better than those of Great Britain, United States of America, we are only a handful of people. That this big industry cannot be successfully established in must take things as we find them, and we must admit that it is hopeless for us to expect to compete with American film producers. The effect of increasing the tariff on American films would be to increase the price of admission to picture shows; and, as pointed out by the honGreen) it would be the poorer people who would have to pay. The price of admission to the big city theatres, where the actors appear in person, is almost prohibitive to all but the rich. It has been said, and said truly, that the picture show is the poor man's theatre, that every six weeks the entire population of Australia visits the picture theatres. That being so, the Government should proceed warily, and avoid the increased prices of admission which must inevitably follow the raising of the duties on films. Some months ago the Government won popularity by reducing the entertainment tax, and the picture-show proprietors were enabled to reduce the prices of admission. If the Government now increases the duty on films, the public will suspect I should, however, that it was merely seeking kudos by giving with one hand what it proposed to take hack with the other.

The Commonwealth and the States agreed to abide by the decision of that body, the Commonwealth to bear one-fifth of the total cost of the work and the remaining four-fifths to be borne by the five mainland States concerned, upon a per capita basis. The royal commission was appointed in 1920, and on 22nd September, 1921, presented a report, which was printed as Commonwealth Parliamentary Paper No. 141 of 1921. mended 4 ft . 8^ in. as the standard gauge for the Australian railways; and this recommendation was unanimously accepted by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. The royal commission also recommended, amongst other matters, that a standard 4 f t . 8Â£ in. gauge railway be provided between Brisbane and Fremantle, and that all railway lines of 5 f t . 3 in. gauge now owned by the States of Victoria and South Australia be converted to the standard gauge. Agreement could not be arrived at between the Commonwealth and the five mainland States as to the actual commencement of the work recommended by the royal commission; but, after discussions and conferences, the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Queensland agreed upon works giving a standard gauge connection between Sydney and Brisbane, and providing for the construction of a railway of standard gauge between Kyogle, in New South Wales, and South Brisbane, in Queensland, and the relaying and strengthening of the existing railway between Grafton and Kyogle, so as to bring that railway up to the standard. The agreement was ratified by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales and Queensland in October, 1924. It provided that the Commonwealth, in the first instance, should furnish the money required for the work on the understanding that the States of New South Wales and Queensland would contribute to the At a conference of Ministers of cost in the proportions that the populations of those States bore to the total population of the five mainland States of Australia, the Commonwealth contributing one-fifth of the quota in terms of the resolution of the conference of Ministers in 1920, and also, for the time being, the sums which under that arrangement would have been contributed by the States of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia had they been parties to the agreement. was to contribute those sums in addition to its own proportion. Brisbane Eailway Act 1924 made the necessary financial provision, and, under section 4, the Commonwealth Treasurer The royal commission recomwas authorized to borrow moneys, not exceeding Â£3,500,000, together with such further sum as might be necessary to meet discount and flotation expenses, and, pending the borrowing of the money, to advance to the council out of moneys in the Commonwealth Public Account sums not exceeding Â£3,500,000. That amount was the estimate submitted by the royal commission in 1921 of the cost of providing a standard gauge connection between Sydney and Brisbane. The agreement-ratified by acts of Parliament provides for a council, consisting of the Commonwealth Eailways Commissioner, the Chief Eailways Commissioner for New South Wales, and the Commissioner for Eailways, Queensland, to have entire control of the work. Shortly after the appointment of the council, surveys were put in hand, and all necessary data prepared -to enable a proper estimate to be arrived at. The council now advises that the work estimated by the royal commissioners to cost Â£3,500,000 will cost approximately Â£4,000,000. In justice to the royal commissioners, I must explain that the estimate of Â£3,500,000, upon which the agreement was based, was prepared on data submitted by the States and checked by the royal commissioners; but no proper surveys of the sections had been undertaken, either in New South Wales or Queensland, and the estimate",37,Railway Bill Second Reading

A t ' this conference an agreement was arrived at whereby the ministers would recommend to their respective cabinets that a guarantee be given to the Railway Council that the various works incorporated in the schedule of quantities, on which tenders were called, would be carried out at the rates quoted by the respective chief railway construction engineers in the sealed estimate; or, in other words, that the sealed estimate would be submitted as a f i r m tender, and a contract entered into by the Railway Council, subject to the following: 1. The payment to be on a quantity basis according to measurement, Sc., at tlie rates shown 'in the "" Schedule of quantities and prices "" as submitted by the chief railway construction engineers. 2. Provision to be made for an adjustment for or against the New South Wales and Queensland State authorities respectively in the event during the currency of the contract of an increase or decrease in wages, or a decrease or increase in hours of work as may be fixed by an award of an arbitration court, or industrial tribunal, or in such other manner as may be approved by the council by a unanimous decision. 3. Such other provisos as are usual in railon the table of the House the original way construction contracts also to be included in the contract in regard to carrying out the work, &c, as may be determined by the council. The Railway Council was thereupon advised that this Government had no objection to the work being carried out by the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland under the conditions named, and the council was assured that, on the understanding that the conditions named would be complied with, this Government would take steps to bring before the Parliament a b ill to have the amount of Â£3,500,000, authorized by section 4 of the Grafton to South Brisbane Railway Act of 1924, increased to Â£4,000,000. A meeting of the Railway Council was held in Melbourne on the 3rd February, 1926, and in the course of it the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland officially advised the council that they were prepared to regard the sealed estimates of their chief railway construction engineers as f i r m tenders, and to carry out the work at the prices quoted, subject to the conditions I havo just named as to The conference consisted of the payment on a. quantity basis, adjustment for or against in the event of increase o r decrease in wages, &c.

A few weeks ago I laid on the table of the House copies of all the papers connected w it h those .matters. Let me give the House, some information about the tenders, without disclosing who the tenderers were. Public tender No. 1, in New South Wales, amounted to Â£1,059,868, plus departmental supervision Â£32,000, a total of Â£1,091,868.",39,Railway Bill Second Reading

As tbe New South Wales Government will not seek to make a profit out of the work, and may reasonably be expected to do the work better than a private contractor, the Railway Council decided to accept that tender. There was one public tender from Queensland, of Â£1,293,941, with Â£40,000 for departmental supervision, making a total of Â£1,333,941. The sealed estimate submitted by the construction engineer of the Queensland railways was Â£1,130,142, which included supervision charges. ways' tender was Â£203,799 lower than the public tender in Queensland. .ask the New South Wales Government to reduce its figure, seeing that it was higher than the quotation of the lowest tenderer ? on schedule prices throughout, and those prices must have been, on the whole, similar to those of the public contractor.

That has been reviewed. It was considered a little anomalous that there should be a secretary to the leader of a party, who. is also a Minister of the Crown, and for his salary to appear in the Estimates of another department. The previous arrangement is to be altered. Every Minister is entitled to a private secretary, and such other assistance as he requires, provided that the payment made for that assistance is authorized by the Public Service Board. ance in this case been approved by the Public Service Board1 on the Estimates unless that approval has first been obtained. 1 stress the point that every Minister or leader of a political party should be entitled, within the amount which Parliament agrees should be paid out of the public purse for the purpose, to choose the individual or form of assistance which he considers will best enable h i m to carry out his work.
