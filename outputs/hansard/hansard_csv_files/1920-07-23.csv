WAB SERVICE. Minister, upon notice1. Is the Government taking any steps to issue war medals to members of the mercantile marine of Australia; and, if so, at what time w ill they be issued, and what are the'medals? 2. Are a l l grades in the mercantile marine, on the provincial press through the present who have qualified by service in the war zone, to he duly recognised by the issue of these medals ? 3. Are the returned sailors of the mercantile marine of Australia of all grades eligible for participation in the Government schemes of repatriation, including housing? honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1 and 2. In May, 1919, the Government decided to issue a mercantile marine war-zone badge to masters and seamen of the mercantile marine who had served on a vessel under Australian articles which had traded within the war zone for any period during the war, and 3,500 badges have already been issued. The term "" war zone "" applies to routes followed by such vessels when proceeding to and from a port on the Atlantic side of North America and Africa and/or in the TJnited Kingdom, the Continent of Europe, or on the Mediterranean coast of Africa, and commences or terminates in each case at (a) the eastern end of the Panama Canal; (6) the Cape of Good Hope; (c) Suez. In the case of a deceased seaman who would have been entitled to a badge, it was decided that the badge should be awarded to his next of kin. The distribution of these badges has heen undertaken by the Superintendent, Mercantile Marine Office, Melbourne, and applications may be made to that officer direct, or through the superintendents of marine of the other States, from whom the necessary application forms may be obtained. 3. Members of the mercantile marine are not eligible under the Repatriation Act, but the Government have agreed to include within the provisions of the War Service Homes Act seamen and others who have been awarded the Australian mercantile marine war-zone badge or the British mercantile marine medal.

I should like to outline the methods adopted in those countries to insure that there should be no duplication, overlapping, or friction between the State and Federal Governments, either in administration or in the work itself.

I commend to our Government the lines adopted by the Canadian governmental activities, as shown iii the first annual report of the Commission:Where the scope is almost infinite, the effort should be to choose that which is immediately practical and useful.

73,Dr. Earle Page,"(Cowper) [11.48]"".far as our available information extends. The beginning of all proper investigations is the ascertainment of facts, and there is no country that 1 know of where it is more urgently necessary in the public interest that the natural resources should be tabulated and inventoried than it is in Canada. When the Commission was appointed by the Canadian Government to go to Washington last winter, we set on foot a preliminary movement to tabulate information. The results of that work are now among our records. It is, we may say, of the most fragmentary description. That was what the Canadian Government found regarding State activities, such as we have had, which had been in operation for many yea^gI t was surprising to find how difficult it was to get anything like accurate information. Statistical information of the class which our census officers prepare is abundant and accurate, but it does not assume to deal with the question of natural resources. At the present moment there are but few publications of any Government in Canada which give accurate and comprehensive information upon these subjects. The utility of such an inventory hardly needs discussion. Both for the purposes of development and of conservation it is the first essential to have an accurate and complete statement of the facts, readily available, accessible to all, and couched in language that the average reader can understand. Those were the lines on which the Canadian Government carried out this project, and now, ten years afterwards, they have, I suppose, one of the most complete, far-reaching, and comprehensive tabulations of the natural resources of their territory to be found ih the world. The lines on which they have developed are worth imitating in Australia to-day. Provinces represented 1 presentation practically on the lines of the advisory councils, which I gather were provided for in the previous measure proposed to this Parliament. understand from this morning's press that the Government intend to re-introduce provision for those advisory councils in this Bill. have representation and some share of power ? and the United States of America the Federal Government, in many instances, subsidizes the State or provincial activities. In the case of agriculture, for instance, it does not overlap. It appoints its men in certain departments of work, but it does not "" butt"" into those which the State or Province already fills. In those cases, it simply subsidizes and increases the possibilities for good of the officers already in existence. It does not interfere with their control in any degree. said, evidently the Provinces, have some right of representation and some share of power. been any conflict there, because there has been a continual desire to work in cooperation. The governmental activities are linked up properly, thus resulting in, co-ordination and not in duplication. The Federal activities simply fit into whatever vacant places there are in the existing mechanism. For instance, the Commission went into the question of mineral development. It found that practically the whole of the mining development of Canada had taken place in the central and inhabited _ territories, but that wherever prospecting had been done in uninhabited parts, indications had been found of the presence of valuable minerals, and in some cases great wealth had been uncovered. The Commission was satisfied, and has proved in the last ten years, that continual prospecting and mapping out of the areas has been of great value in indicating the most likely places to search for valuable deposits. Large bodies of ore were at the same time found to be useless because they could be worked only by certain are their special processes. The Government, in their physical laboratories, on a proper and comprehensive scale, investigated, for example, the question of the electric smelting of certain ores. They were able to handle successfully ores containing I sulphur which had previously been absolutely useless, and to produce from certain of such iron ores some of the finest steel in the world. As the honourable member for New England( Mr Hay) says, something similar has taken place in Australia. Tbroneh the application of a process discovered at the Technological Museum, at Sydney, the whole system of the extraction of zinc, lend, and copper has been absolutely revolutionized in the last ten or fifteen years. That alone is an instance of the enormous importance of",24,Industry Bill Second Reading

79,Dr. Earle Page,"There has nevercreating such an institute as is now proposed, and of applying science more extensively than is done at present. It was found in Canada, also, that many industries, such as zinc production, were entirely at the mercy of foreign smelters and refiners, and that enormous waste was taking place because in the ore sent abroad there were certain residues for which practically no value was given. The Canadian authorities set to work on a practical and scientific scale to investiand sera on a commercial scale. In any gyfe processes which would enable those ores to be treated, and the resulting wealth retained, in their own country. That is one direction in which great development has taken place since the efforts of the various Provinces were coordinated in Canada. But in public health, especially, there has been the biggest advance, by reason of the establishment of a body on the lines that we now propose to follow. It -is recognised everywhere nowadays that the physical strength of a people is the source from which all efforts derive their value. ' The extreme and scrupulous regard for the lives and health of the population may be taken as the best criterion of real civilization and refinement to which a country has attained. Any one who thinks at all can appreciate the fact that the care of public health must essentially be a Federal, and not a State, matwithin Australia is in no sense disproporter. I venture to say that if , during the last influenza epidemic, the proposals of the Federal Quarantine authorities had been carried out in their entirety, we might have been saved, to a very large extent, the invasion of the whole of our country districts by influenza, and possibly we might have been saved the invasion of several of the States. Then there is the question of water supply, the polluafforded innumerable opportunities for tion of streams, and so on. Many streams are Inter-State in their catchment, hut at present cannot be nut under uniform control, simply by reason of the fact that the Federal authority is not ariven sufficient rjower. There has been .established in Melbourne already, in connection with the Institute, a very valuable laboratory, in which sera for curative and prophylactic purposes have been manufactured, for use. not only in cases of human sickness-such as diphtheria or tuberculosisbut also in certain animal diseases. The value of that undertaking was never Dr. Earle Page. thoroughly appreciated until the war had practically isolated us from other countries. If that provision had not been in existence at that time, we might have easily had a much bigger loss of human life in this country, simply because we were dependent entirely upon outside sources. We can scarcely expect, in a continent of the size of Australia, sparsely populated as it is, private people to undertake the preparation of these vaccines case, if they are undertaken by private enterprise, there is always the possibility that we shall bp unable to control them sufficiently in the interests of public health. The greatest value which can be gained by the establishment of the Institute will be found, as it has proved in Canada, in the matter of the proper tabulation and indexing of the water resources of the Continent. Australia is continually referred to aa being drought-ridden. But in the eastern half of Australia, from the Gulf of Carpentaria right down to Adelaide, and taking a distance inland of from 300 to 400 miles from the eastern seaboard, the area compares very favourably in the matter of rainfall with any other similar average area of the continents of the world. Indeed, taking a survey of the continents generally, it will be found that the waste country tionate. The greatest industrial development in recent years has come about by the utilization of water for the generation of electric power. From the River Barron, in the north, to the Murray in the south, and along the whole of the eastern coast as well as on the western slopes of the Dividing Range, there are practical scientificinvestigation, development, and exploitation of water power. This is a matter which should be very thoroughly investigated. The whole subject of the utilization of our streams should be placed on such a basis as to permit exploitation either by the Government or from outside sources. Linked up with this subject of water resources there is the great question of irrigation and conservation. In this respect a strange criticism of Australia's position is to be found in the final report of the Dominions Royal Commission, which was issued in 191'7 after the Comgin to grow hopelessly impoverished in mission, had traversed and taken evidence side of 200 years unless extreme care is all over the Empire.

81,Dr. Earle Page,"In New South America there are not only the Statethe organization in America has inaugurated a system of providing market reports to cover the whole of the States. Thus, a farmer knows before he ships his produce, where he is likely to secure the -best return; and he can gain some idea of -his profits then, instead of having to -Wait for a return from his commission agent. A Grain Standards Act has been passed in the United States of America, with the idea of insuring uniform grading, so as to enable the farmer to obtain a far better price for his produce and at the same time diminish the shipment of inferior grain. Thus the standard of the whole of the products of the country is scientifically and commercially increased. A proposition has been put forward for the establishment of bonded warehouses also, which will handle the farmers' produce in a co-operative fashion, and make him to a large extent independent of the market. He will be able to bring his produce to these warehouses and receive scrip, which can be negotiated to enable him to carry on. Thus, a practical effort is made to regulate the flush of a heavy season. Farmers in Australia know only too well that a good season is often less profitable than a comparatively poor one. In a good season the farmer is apt to get a low price for his abundant harvest, whereas in a poor year he can be fairly well assured of receiving an excellent return for whatever crop he reaps. addition, in the United States of America, efforts have been made to inculcate sound ideas regarding the financing of farmers. It has been sought to emphasize the fact that the financing of the rural community should be placed on a slightly differentscale and basis compared with other industries, for the main reason that the elements themselves are never absolutely stable. In regard to another important source of activity great efforts have been made in the United States of America, namely, to improve and perfect the meat supply. By means of scientific research and experiment, wisely co-ordinated throughout the country, the authorities have _ heen able very largely to eliminate the tick. Althoughi t is impossible for an In stitute such as is proposed in the measure before the House to at once launch out on such a scale and undertake such a great scope of activities as I have Dr. Earle Page. indicated in speaking of the United States of America, yet its foundation will permit its gradual working up to some such force in the country; that is to say, if it is founded on lines such as have been suggested by scientists in Australia, and, indeed, by the whole of the practical experience of the world. It is to have only a small beginning,,but it is to be hoped that it will steadily grow and act as a co-ordinating mechanism in relation to present institutions, not despising any .activity of value being carried on at this moment. If it should develop as is hoped for it, the Institute must prove one of the most beneficent influences in Australian public life. There are not in Australia at present sufficient or adequate Departments to deal with out national problems. I will_ quote from the report of the Dominions Royal Commission, where it refers, in two or three specific instances, to what should be done in Australia. Dealing with the question of forestry, for instance, the report states-There is no Federal Forestry Department in the Commonwealth, and though each State has instituted some conservation methods of its own, we are not satisfied that enough has been done. We are glad to observe, however, that there is a movement towards co-operation between the Forest Departments of the various States. Thus an Intcr-State Conference of Forestry was held at Adelaide in May, 1916, In and it is proposed to hold similar conferences annually in future. At the 1916 conference a scheme was approved to provide for the uniform training of a competent staff for the forestry services, and a resolution was passed advocating-the exchange of officers between the different States. Much, however, remains to be done. The total"" number of persons employed, in the Forestry Departments of the various Australian States in 1914 was only 595, and the total expenditure of the year 1914-15 was only £158,000. . Tasmania, which possesses some of the finest forest areas in the Commonwealth, spent only £1,200 on forestry in that year. Then, in the matter of our fisheries, the report points out that a similar condition of affairs exists. It emphasizes that national co-ordination and co-operation would enable the Australian fishing industry to be placed on a far bettor basis, and so do away with the importation of almost £1,000,000 worth of fish every year. There are about 2,000 varieties of edible fish around the Australian coast, and yet each year we import huge consignments. siou statesThe success of the action achieved during Empire. the war suggests that it is expedient that the various Governments of the Empire should take steps, as soon as conditions permit, to The Bill will, I hope, provide the nucleus secure the development and utilization of their of a system of scientific education in Ausnatural wealth on a well-considered scheme, tralia which will supply a long-felt want. directed towards a definite and recognised object.

82,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [12.19],"industrial strife is with us every day. With the application of the principle of shorter hours for labour and higher wages there must be an insistent demand for the more efficient organization of all industrial enterprises, in order to meet the position by preventing the awful waste that is at present going on. This, I take it, will be the particular function of this proposed Institute. I may mention just one achievement, namely, the standardization of structural steel. If that alone stood to the credit of the Institute, it would more than justify its creation, for with the standardization of all structural steel a contractor in any part of the Commonwealth may now place an order for T-pieces, angle-irons, and collars with an assurance that everything will lit, whereas, prioT to standardization, as many as three or four different standards were in general use, and consequently structural work was rendered more complicated. Many other problems will claim the attention of this Institute, notably the prickly-pear pest and' plant life of the Commonwealth generally, in connection with which much valuable information has been already gained, and which, no doubt, will be the basis of further research work. I may mention the waste, representing hundreds of thousands of pounds annually, in our wool-washing and fellmongering establishments. Until recently, at all events, no steps have been taken to utilize these by-products, and the same may be said of by-products resulting from the manufacture of gas. It would, I think, pay the Government to employ a number of scientists to devote their sole attention to this problem; but those who control these private establishments should subsidize investigations into the hy-products of coal gas. The Institute should consider the economic production of gas power and the more economical working of industries generally. The Bill now before us is, I believe, a better proposition than was the first Bill, but it is not as clear, nor does it go so faT, as I should like. It is reported that, owing to representations made to the Government,' an amendment will be made to enable the' formation of Advisory Councils throughout Australia. Mr Blakeley. . It has to be remembered that while men may be eminently fitted for research work, when it comes to work of a practical nature, apart from research, they are probably not so suitable as average business men. Great care will have to be exercised in the administration of this Institute. The Bill has not been received by the people of Australia with that approval which I think is necessary for the successful inauguration of the scheme. I should be sorry to see the Institute in any way hampered because of any public outcry owing to mistakes which have been made or may be made by it. Every possible avenue should be exploited in obtaining information to help in carrying the scheme to a successful issue. We in Australia have done practically nothing with regard to research. There are haphazard investigations by universities, technical .colleges and similar institutions; and private companies and firms, such as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, retain staffs of highly qualified scientific experts. The company I have mentioned has evolved a scheme of treatment, which has reduced the expenditure on the production of sugar, and given many valuable by-products. The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company has also a staff of experts whose special duty it is to watch the manufacture of steel. When I recently visited the works at Newcastle I found that there was not a steel rail produced which was not analyzed. Immediately an error or defect in the structure of the steel is detected a remedy is found before there has been any great waste. As specimen samples of the steel are chipped off automatically from the rails as they are produced, they, are immediately tested by the analysts in order to see that they are quite up to standard. While these private firms and companies devote a certain amount of money to research, and the States, in a haphazard way, without co-ordination or co-operation, are many of them investigating the same problems, the lack of a governing or controlling head makes a good deal of the work, if not valueless, at least nroductive of much overlapping and waste. The sum total of the Australian expenditure in research work is not anything like what it should be in such a country as this; and I propose to show what other countries are doing, confining myself .to the agricultural phase of the question. American States are not left to initiate or carry on the agricultural education of the people by means of scientific research, but are assisted by the Commonwealth Government on all occasions. Federal Legislature of America, in 1864, alienated no less than 11,000,000 acresof land in order to endow agricultural colleges throughout the country. that country there are practically unlimited funds available for the endowment of colleges, for scholarships, for scientific research, and so forth; and between 1862 and 1912 over 600 colleges and other institutions were founded to further the progress of agriculture, at a cost of something like £45,000,000. The Agricultural Department at Washington spends no less than £6,000,000 a year in subsidizing the agricultural colleges of the forty-eight States. As a matter of fact, in 1917 the expenditure was £10,000,000. that the population of the TJnited States of America is 110,000,000. that fact; but if we, in proportion to our population had done as much as America has in the way of research and the exploitation of our natural resources, we should be in a much better position than we are to-day. In Italy, from 1907 to 1917, there were no fewer than 1,100 colleges, schools, and other institutions brought into being for the teaching of agriculture. In Switzerland, there are 1,600 agricultural colleges, subsidized to the extent of £250,000 per annum. In the small country of Belgium, prior to the war, something like £200,000 per annum was spent in this direction. In England, there are eight colleges supported by the County Councils by means of the rates, and subsidized by the Imperial Department of Agriculture. In Canada, owing probably to its close proximity to America, there is a much better system of education and research than in any other British Dominion. In Australia, many men have done good work,and, of these, I mention the late Mr Farrar. The people of Australia generally have not yet realized what that gentleman did for Australia in increasing the productive powers of the country. In New South Wales alone, by the breedThe ing of his "" Federation "" wheat, he added thousands upon thousands of square miles to the wheat belt. and privilege to secure the services of The Mr Farrar for the State Agricultural Department on a definite basis. In able gentleman secured a very good man. Working practically by himself, he evolved a type of wheat from which since that time other types have been obtained; and he laid down a basis of investigation which will, I hope, be followed by the Institute of Science and In dustry. I urge upon the Government and those who will have the control of this scheme that, if this country is to have the benefit of the best brains, those brains will have to be paid for in competition with the older countries of the world. While some honourable members may object to derelict professors being paid large sums of money, if the Institute of Science and Industry is to succeed, we shall be compelled to immediately enter into competition with the whole of the countries of the world, with a view to obtaining the best possible brains. And it is worth our while to do so. Three years ago, I stressed the fact that the niggardly sums paid to the scientific brains of Australia are responsible for driving promising scientists from our midst to other countries where their services .are more adeauately remunerated. Every year men are attracted from the Commonwealth by the better pay which is offered to them elsewhere. We frequently find thenames of men who graduated in the Sydney and Melbourne Universities, and particularly in our Schools of Mines, cropping up in Washington and London. They have practically been compelled to leave the country of their birth, and they will not return to it until we are willing to offer them an adequate recompense for their labours. Of course, if we want cheap scientists, we can get them. There are quite a number of scientific men who undertake investigations without fee or reward, and purely for love of their work. But there are others whose services are offered cheaply, and from whom nothing very much can be expected.",29,Industry Bill Second Reading

He has since declined to return unless he is adequately paid for his services. refusal to come back was that he was abused by a section of the press, which made very uncomplimentary remarks about him. the best talent to undertake scientific research work we must be prepared to pay a fair price for it. It would be worth millions of pounds to Australia if she could get rid of such pests as the p'rickly pear, the blowfly, and nodules in beef. In regard to the blowfly, I have repeatedly urged that it is not only the duty of the Commonwealth Government to offer a large reward for its destruction, but that the pastoralists themselves have a responsibility in this connection, and that they should bear a fair share of the cost of any scientific investigation in that connection. In co-operation with the State Governments, it would pay the Commonwealth to offer a prize of £1,000,000 for a formula the use of which would successfully combat the blow-fly. In one little district with which I am familiar-that of Walgett, in New South ""Walesa loss of not less than £250,000 was sustained in 1916 through the blowfly pest. RecentlyI observed that in Queensland a pastoralist, or the manager of a station there, has been conducting an investigation into the destruction of the blowfly by means of an arsenical jet. By his discovery he claims to have rendered sheep immune from this pest for two months. into the wool upon the skin of the sheep. might very well be taken as a basis for investigation hy the proposed Institute. If we can guarantee that our flocks shall be perfectly immune from the blowfly pest for a period of two months, we shall save Australia many millions of pounds. Having been practically reared in the pastoral industry, nobody realizes more than I do the necessity for taking steps to prevent the terrible mortality which annually occurs in our flocks as the result of this pestThen there is the tick pest. It ought not to be impossible for a successful investigation into that matter to be carried on by the Institute of Science and Industry. I believe that prizes should be offered for the destruction of all the pests which afflict this country-prize s which will attract the best brains in the world. Whilst we should offer a prize of, say, £500,000 for the discovery of some means of destroying the blow-fly, I think that any scientist who undertakes research work of that character, and who desires to carry on his investigations in Australia; should be paid for his services whilst he is here, irrespective of whether or not his efforts are successful. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. learn during the adjournment that the discovery of the formula which renders sheep immune from the blowfly for at least two months is the result of successf ul experiments carried out by the In stitute of Science and Industry. On previous occasions I have spoken of the mighty problem created by the awful ravages of venereal diseases. It was not until 1905 that the Spirochoeta pallida, the organism of syphilis, was discovered, and although eminent scientists have been endeavouring since the beginning of the fifteenth century to discover some formula for the treatment of venereal diseases, it was not until 1878 that the gonococcus, the organism of gonorrhoea, the lesser form of the disease, was discovered. Every year these diseases cause the death of 7,000 people in Australia, and each year the Commonwealth pays at least £150,000 in invalid pensions to persons suffering from them. Ten per cent, of the population are_ affected by the more serious complaint, and it is estimated that 40 per cent, suffer from the effects of the minor form. Dr. J. W. Barrett, who has carried out_ some very interesting tests in connection with an eye clinic in Melbourne, has shown that out of 500 persons who attended the institution for mere errors of refraction, 14 per cent, showed signs of syphilis. There are 500 children admitted to Sydney hospitals every year suffering from a venereal complaint. It is a big question, and I hope that a special committee of the Institute of Science and Industry will be set to work in co-operation with the State, institutions and Universities to endeavour to",32,Industry Bill Second Reading

No matter how good the existing form of treatment may be, those suffering from the graver form of the two diseases cannot be cured under less than twelve months. I hope, also, that when a proper formula is established, laboratories will be set up for its manufacture and distribution. Venereal disease is responsible for the condition of 25 per cent, of the blind in the institudeciding how much it is prepared to tions of Australia, and 22 per cent, of the insane. Seeing that hundreds of thousands of pounds are paid every year in the shape of invalid pensions because of it, and that 7,000 Australians die from it annually, surely it is a Eederal matter more than a State matter, and I hope that if a committee of the Institute is appointed to deal with it, special grants of money will be made available to it to enable research in this direction t'o proceed with expedition. Australia is a young country with boundless resources which we mostly waste. No check is kept upon waste. We allow our water to rush away to the ocean; we allow our fodder to dry and be carried away by the winds; we allow our stock to be killed off by pests which are controllable by science; we have! men carrying where machinery could do the work; we have men shovelling where machinery could do the work; we laboriously excavate, carry, and hew where machinery should be employed. The Institute of Science and Industry will have a vast deal of work to do to bring about the success which can be achieved by wise administration, and a wise selection of the men who will conduct the experiments, but in the end the good which will be caused to this country will be incalculable. Sir [2.24] I am pleased that the Government have yielded to the general activity and interest exhibited throughout the world, since hostilities have ceased, towards the subject of scientific research; because upon increased efforts in that direction depends the volume of production of the world. .It has been, alleged against, this Bill that it means the «reat on of a new spending Department : and handing over to a new Institute the control of large sums of money to be spent as the directors of the Institute see fit, with little or no supervision on the part of Parliament. But that is a . wrong view for honourable members to take, because the directors of the Institute will not have the authority to spend one shilling without the consent of Parliament. On the various annual Estimates Parliament will be called upon to take the responsibility of hand over to the Institute for the purpose of industrial and scientific research. spent ? money must be appropriated by Parliament before it can be spent. Therefore if any complaint is to be lodged in that regard it must be lodged against Parliament itself, which alone greater must accept the responsibility. In view of what is being done in other countries in this direction, the utmost encouragement should be extended to the Institute established here. Of course it must prove itself. Tho Tight men must be appointed to carry out the duties assigned to it. There can be no possibility of success unless we are fortunate in that regard. But as the Institute proves itself Parliament will be more and more liberal to it. I am hopeful that it will justify itself, and that there will be a generous response on the part of Parliament, in 1 full recognition of the vast field of work in which tlie Institute will be obliged to operate. As the honourable member for New England( Mr Hay) has shown, there are two great branches of scientific research, agriculture and technology, as applied to industrial matters, which will serve to occupy the best energies and the pointed to carry out th© work of the In stitute. The honourable member has dealt very fully with the agricultural side, and shown the great field for work in that direction. The few remarks I have to make this afternoon will be directed towards demonstrating what a vast field of work there is on the technological side.

Part of the duties of the Institute should he the custody of standards of measurement, the verification of instruments -and appliances of all kinds used as measures, and to co-operate with the States in the preparation of standards and specifications of quality of materials and merchandise generally.

There is ample scope for technological work of a valuable character, and we are exceedingly fortunate in having in the employment of the Commonwealth service our present principal analyst, Mr Percy Wilkinson, who is a distinguished chemist of wide and varied experience. He is a person who not only enjoys a great reputation in Australia, but one who, by reason of his ability and his great work, has a reputation beyond the shores of Australia. Mr Wilkinson has also the advantage of having devoted special attention to our industries. He has a more extensive knowledge of our industrial undertakings than any other scientific man in Australia, and I hope the whole Federal sphere is to have the benefit of his services as a Principal in this Institute. mits that it is better to have a practical man than one who is a mere theorist?

116,Mr Ryan,"We all agree with thetunity for their furtherance, provided that the right men are appointed. ant one. not confident that the Government would appoint the right men, I would not support the Bill so ardently. As many other honourable members desire to speak, it would not be fair to prolong my remarks at this stage. At the outset I wish to say how very much I appreciate the valuable and eloquent speeches which have been made in support of the Bill; I refer more particularly to those of the honourable member for New England( Mr Hay), t i e honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), and the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best). the Minister? omitted to refer to the great opening speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), also those of several other honourable members. I agree with everything that these speakers have said as to the desirability of encouraging scientific research, because I appreciate as much as it is possible to do the services which scientific men havie rendered to humanity, in Australia as elsewhere. Provided the money is spent efficiently, I would not begrudge any appropriation for scientific research. Buti t seems to m© that none of the speakers to whom I have referred. gave any satisfactory reason for agreeing to the second reading of this Bill, which is in reality a measure to create a new Commonwealth Department. We are not being asked to determine upon the value of scientific research or the desirability of encouraging it ; in regard to those matters we are unanimous, but we are being asked to assent to the establishment of a new Commonwealth Department and to make a fresh attack on the functions of the States. The aim of those who support the Bill may be excellent, but the means by which it is proposed to attain it may fall far short of excellence, and, indeed, be entirely bad. I was very much struck by a headline in this morning's Age"" Air Craft and Quarantine New Federal Measure, Commonwealth to have Paramount Authority."" within the jurisdiction of the Federal authority. kind of the honourable member to anticipate my remarks. I know quite well that under the Constitution those are matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal authority, but I have yet to learn that the matter of education with which this Bill deals is a matter in connection with which the Commonwealth can claim paramount authority. For all practical purposes a portion of the heading which I have quoted from the Age might be applied to this Bill, which deals with the subject of education, and it might be termed, ""New Federal Measure-Commonwealth to have Paramount Authority."" There seems to be a fixed determination on the part of the Commonwealth Government and many members of this Parliament to assume .paramount authority over the State Governments in connection with matters concerning which we are not given paramount authority by the Constitution. The whole question involved in this measure is whether we are to create a fresh Commonwealth Department for the purpose of making a new invasion upon the functions of the State Governments, at the same time imposing totallyunnecessary burdens upon the people, by duplicating Government institutions. There are many instances which might be quoted in which the Commonwealth Parliament has created fresh Departments, and has' undertaken functions already covered by the activities of the. States. In every one of these instances the taxpayers were promised that if the Commonwealth Government undertook the performance of those functions the State Governments would fall in with their proposals and would not clash with them. To quote a comparatively recent instance of the kind honourable members will recollect that the Commonwealth Government decided to establish Savings Banks all over the country. Members of this Parliament were assured that the States would fall in with the proposal; that they would retire into the background, and permit the State Savings Banks to be run by the Commonwealth authorities.",37,Robert Best Kooyong Ability Of The Ablest Men Who Can Be Ap

The question we have to decide is whether, the appointment of a seventh Government Science Department in Australia, w it h a Director at its head, is likely to encourage and stimulate research by scientific men.

If we look to the there are some politicians who do not appreciate the work of scientific mem. Professor Masson continuedDuring that time the Committee has met once a week or oftener, and as an outcome of its labours it has advised the Government regarding various developments. I wish to show to what'extent the Institute, during its existence, seems to have alienated the sympathy and warm-hearted Under these cirsupport of scientific men in Australia, instead of having, so to speak, welcomed their assistance.

Then what follows is of the utmost importance as bearing upon what is likely to happen in the future if the B ill is passed. remember that that is the statement of one man. and is one of the most distinguished scientific investigators in Australia.

Would he vote against it ? say that at the present moment.. I am seeking light and information. Professor Masson saysThe Government proposals mean the crystallization of the Institute under political control. There is to be a single director, but no good man will accept the position, because he will be subject to a departmental chief. I hold, therefore, that it would be better to crush the movement altogether than to set it going on these lines. It is a reversion to a system which has been utterly dscredited in Great Britain, the system of departmental control of scientific endeavour as applied to industry. That is briefly the case I put forward to induce the Government and the House to pause before they finally commit themselves to the creation of a fresh Department, until , at all events, the Government are able to satisfy the House that the creation of a new Commonwealth Department will mean the disappearance of opposing Departments in the six States. of mine, was asked, "" What is science?"" and he said it was common sense.

I propose to ask the Government to delay its tory assurance that there will be real coordination between the States and the Federation in this matter. Such coordination has been taken for granted in the past so often, and we have been so often completely disappointed, that I feel exceedingly doubtful whether we are likely to obtain it in the future. If in the meantime it be desired to give the utmost encouragement to the application of science to industry, and we certainly ought to give it , there are Departments in the six States at present which can be encouraged, and given financial support if required. I urge the Government to I am not prepared to take the matter into f u l l consideration. If they are in a position to give the House an assurance from the various States that the passing of this B ill will not mean the duplication between two rival bodies-the States and the Commonwealth-of those functions now being carried on by the States, the B ill will have my support. I sincerely trust that that assurance will be given at once. [3.23] I shall not pa into the question of the necessity for the application of science to industry, because we all know that it exists, but the position is peculiar. Professor Orme Masson's action in resigning, and the interview with him which we have just heard read, proves how wise the Ministry were not to let him, and those associated with him, do whatever they thought fit, and spend money just as they liked. Unless responsibility in this matter is given to a Minister who is answerable to this House, I shall not support the proposal, because scientists, like military men, would spend monev like water to brine into operation what they thought I am glad to hear that was correct If they cannot assist without wanting to r u n the show, they will be useless so far as this idea is concerned.

157,Mr Mathew S (Melbourne Ports),"because I think the State Departments are doing well. In my opinion they are not doing well, and need stirring up by the Federal Government. While it bodies to deal with those things with which they are immediately concerned, there is no reason why the work cannot be done by the Commonwealth. There is much that concerns the whole of the States rather than any one in particular, and yet each is carrying on independently. This, of course, does not make for economy. My idea is, not that we should attempt to take from the States any of their powers, but that the Commonwealth should propose the conversion of all the various State activities into one Australian Department, thus relieving the taxpayers from having to find money for what is really a 'duplication. At a time when we hear so much outcry aeainst extravagance and for economy, I think honourable members on both sides of the' House will agree that wherever duplication can be done away with there is warrantable opportunity to practise economy. I suggest to the Government that, having gauged the opinions of honourable members which appear to be fairly unanimous it should withdraw this Bill and introduce another that would, be more in conformity with the desires generally expressed during the debate. was introduced with the best intentions,, but difficulties have arisen, not the least of which has relation to Professor Orme Masson. The Government, when introducing a fresh Bill, should make clear to those who may be fearful about the matter that there is no desire to create a new Department, ibut to take over and coordinate the .present scattered activities. -The sovereign rights of the States do not enter at this point at all. Surely the States would agree to the Commonwealth undertaking the work, seeing that it is tbe only way in which it can be done efficiently. The committee of doctors over which, as a member of this Legislature, I had the honour to preside, when drawing up their reoorts on the causes of invalidity and death, suggested that the Commonwealth should allocate certain moneys to the different States to combat those two fell diseases, tha white and the red plague. tude of honourable members who profess' Mr Mathews. Those professional gentlemen associated with me asked whether I thought the Government would be prepared to vote a specific amount. I replied that, in is necessary to have local view of the nature of the proposal, the Government would probably not hesitate to do so. A sum of £10,000 was placed on the Estimates to deal with the red plague. But the. Government of New South Wales, which was attempting to deal with the subject independently, considered that it was doing well enough, and that there was no reason why it should bind itself to the conditions suggested hy the Commonwealth authorities. Our quarantine laws would be much better administered solely by the Commonwealth Government. Last year we witnessed an example of how the States proved careless of the ruin that might have been brought upon Australia as an outcome of their thinking first of their own petty interests. States were abused for preferring human life to trade. authorities went mad on the question, and, after all, did not prevent what they sought to shut out; the whole business was a farce. The River Murray forms a great portion of the border line between New South Wales and Victoria; Of course, the present measure but what occurred at the Border? The Murray made no difference, and we witnessed a conflict between State and Federal authority. The Commonwealth Government was retarded in its desire to do that which it considered best for the people of Australia. Whatever we may think of Germany, we must admit that the Germans showed wisdom in their willingness to spend millions upon scientific research; and if Australia desires to make progress her people must be ready to do the same. I again suggest to the Government that this Bill be withdrawn, and that the States be communicated with in order, if possible, to bring about co-operation and so save expensive duplication.

160,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"to represent country districts, particularly, in the light of the speech delivered by the honourable member for New England( Mr Hay). The ostensible reason for the opposition to the Bill has to do with the matter of duplication. That will continue so long as we work under the Constitution as it stands, but I trust that the forthcoming Convention will rid us of our troubles in this respect. Duplication, no matter where it has existed, involves additional burdens on the taxpayer. to true economy and efficiency. The remarks of the honourable member for New England were highly informative; they were not merely a record of what might be done, but of what has been done. The honourable member himself has given practical proof. He was the owner of the big Berry Estate, in New South Wales, which included some of the richest land in Australia. But, practising the principles which the honourable member -expounded when discussing this Bill, he converted that estate into a number of small holdings. All his former tenants became independent farmers-owner s of their own broad acres and cottages. Some critics said that in so changing their outlook these people were foolish; but the fact is that they are contented in their inmarkets, cut up for closer settlement, dependence to-day. The honourable member for New England has a dozen times endeavoured to demonstrate why men should have the best. He truly says we cannot afford to have anything"" to do with inefficiency, either in respect of labour or in the matter of the expenditure of capital. Last night the honourable member gave us some startling figures. He stated that, in a dairy 'herd test in his district recently, the results showed that one cow in one year produced butter worth £8 4s., while another cow gave a return of £72. We all know that a lot of time and money are spent in the advocacy of these theories, but, unfortunately, they are not put into practice very often. We really want less talk and more, practical application of sound economic theories, and I look for good results from the establishment of this Institute. For a long time we have been preaching decentralization. What have we done up to the present? Honourable members on both sides of. the House are in accord with the policy of breaking up big estates, so that we may be able to place men, women, and children on land at present occupied by sheep, and substitute the school bell for the cattle bell. So far we have not done very much in that direction. I. do not advocate the settlement of our soldiers on land in the "" never-never"" .country. I prefer to see them on estates within the fresh-food zone. These areas will then be converted from sheep runs into smiling homes, and we shall have arrived at the true solution of the probThis measure, however, points lem of utilizing our big estates. It -is idle to advocate a policy that virtually places the settlers at the throats of owners of big estates; though I favour taxation, when properly applied, because I believe, if an owner does not put his property to its. best use, some pressure should be brought to bear upon him. a gentle squeeze ?. Mr AU STIN CHAPMAN -Yes; and I may add that my honourable friend has proved himself to be an expert in that business. It would be as well, perhaps, if we had some of the legislation that he has given us up north. I know the honourable member for West Sydney is with me in my desire to see the big estates, especially those close to our principal because if we drive our soldiers and other settlers out into the ""nevernever "" country, they will not have much chance of success. And, after all, why should we do that? I have in my mind an estate almost adjoining that .owned by the honourable member for New England, who has himself settled about 300 soldiers on the land. It comprises about 1,000 acres, and if made available, I feel satisfied that a soldier could make a good living on 10 acres. This would be much better than offering a man 500 acres away back in a locality from which he is not likely to get transport for his produce. These results, I maintain, will follow the passing of this Bill. We talk about co-operation. What does it mean but recognition of the principle that capital and labour must go hand in hand? Consequently, any scheme that makes that possible, that demonstrates that interests are identical, ought to commend itself to every honourable member. I regret that there appears to be a desire to block the Bill on the ground",42,Foster Yo U Must Passage UN T I L They Can Give Us A Satisfac

178,Mr Lavelle,"Yes , I certainly dodo not regard it as offensive to be accused of delaying the measure until we are given information to justify us in approving of it. I that I am entirely in favour of the principle of science as applied to industry, and I think that every member who has the best interests of the country at heart is also in favour of it . We have heard a good deal of -what has been described as the "" m y t h "" of the duplication, which we assert will result, of State and Federal activities. We know perfectly well that in the case of the Savings Banks there has been dissatisfaction and deplorable duplication. While in favour of the principle of science a3 applied to industry, I maintain that we have not the information at our disposal to enable us to conscientiously vote for the measure. the value and necessity for economy, and it has been said, and rightly, that true economy means & e elimination of waste. That is perfectly true; and I would be recreant to the trust placed in me by the electors if I were to cast my vote in favour of this Bill in the absence of necessary information. We ought to he satisfied that this Institute will, in the future, do work of a more beneficial character than has been done in the past. I have before me a copy of a Melbourne newspaper, dated 13th March, 1920, dealing with this measure. I shall not read the whole of the comment honourable member would not be in order in reading newspaper comments on this Bill. the comments from memory, hut I shall have to refer to the newspaper in order to insure my placing the facts accurately before the House. honourable member will not be in order in doing that; he must Tely on his memory. which I refer saysAlthough the Institute for two ' years has been spending large sums of public money, it has actually no constitutional existence.

As a matter of fact, it is not in order to read extracts from newspapers at all. The practice has been allowed to a certain extent, but it is out of order, according to our Standing Orders and the practice of the British House of Commons. I hope I shall be allowed a little latitude. giving the honourable member considerable latitude. cept my assurance that I am referring, not to the Bill before the House, but to the Institute as it has been carried on for the last two years. The newspaper article proceedsThe funds upon which the Institute has lived have been provided by special appropriations on the Estimates that Parliament was given no opportunity to discuss. Reprehensible and unconstitutional as this course has been, it has had the one advantage of giving the public an opportunity of testing the usefulness of the Institute before Parliament committed itself to any permanent expenditure. Let the Institute be judged by its own record. In the two years of its existence what has it done? It was to have achieved wonders. Under its magic touch no local problem was to remain unsolved. But the prickly pear still grows in Queensland. The blowfly has still to be guarded against by the old methods of sheep dip. The gold mining industry has received not the slightest stimulus. Sparrows still fly west, despite the brilliant idea of stationing sentinels along the railway lines to shoot them. Australian manufacturers still work out their own problems, and if they can find a solution they patent them. ask honourable members to moderate their tone in conversation. plete their disgrace now they have started.",44,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The newspaper comment, goes onFor all the money that has been spent on the investigations hy its innumerable Committees, what discovery has been made that has compensated Australia one penny piece? There has certainly been some valuable, material for humour provided by the Institute, as when, for example, it found a substitute for tin plates that cost more than t in plate itself, and when it made the remarkable discovery of a new method for the treatment of alunite that was no more than 600 years old. It also nearly invented a machine for picking cotton, which would have been useful if cotton had grown in a different way to accommodate itself to the peculiarities of the machine, and it has discovered a process for baking bread rapidly, that takes only a few hours longer than the process already used by the bakers. It might have done many more wonderful things had it not been hampered That the question be now put.
