Wasi t not a fair criticism to say that tlie only inference oue could draw from the Attorney-General's remarks was that those four judges had concurred in the statement quoted by h i m from the judgment of Mr Justice Isaacs! pointed out-and I was amazed to make the discovery-that , so f a r from that being the case, the decision of Mr Justice Isaacs on that point was a minority one, and was overborne by the majority of the court. reversed the effect and force of the Minister's argument, turning it upon himself support his quotation. Unless the honourable gentleman treats memhers of the Opposition with contempt, and wishes the people outside will take it for granted that learned counsel know more than general practitioners and laymen about this matter, one might suppose that thc charge was worthy of refutation, if it could be refuted, and necessitated an explanation and an apology if it could not. however, preferred to take refuge in silence. under certain circumstances; but in the face of a charge of that kind it may easily be understood to be something quite different. The Prime Minister, in speaking at various places, with more enthusiasm than knowledge of this subject, said that, after all, the legal luminaries of the Opposition had not had much to say upon the constitutional aspects of that measure while it was before the House. and he paid me the compliment of specially mentioning my name. ney-General knows well, although, perhaps, the Prime Minister does not know it, that as a rule general practitioners defer upon questions of constitutional law who superior knowledge because they are making matters almost every day of their lives. I confess to have been sufficiently influenced by the traditions of my professionwhich I , probably, should not be in politics -to accept as sound the views expressed by the Attorney-General and by the ex-Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom); but I regret to have to state witih emphasis that the views of both those distinguished gentlemen were found to be. radically wrong and misleading. They, were wrong in proportion to the emphasis and unction with which, these honourable gentlemen declared I themselves to be certain that they were right. And so I have to confess, in the first place, with due contrition, that to a certain extent I was "" bluffed "" and misled by those learned gentlemen. It is a humiliating confession to have to make, That entirely but it is true. Still, independent judgment has come into play, because a little later I enjoyed the privilege instead of allowing it to of speaking on this subject in various places, notably before a large and enthusiastic gathering of university students; Their newspaper, Farrago, of the 11thit to be understood that September, 1925, contains the following, report-of my speech:Mr Brennan went on to say that he pro* posed to criticize on two grounds the Deporta* tion Act, which the Government had placed on the statute-book. There was the political and' human objection to the bill, and there was the legal and constitutional position to consider. The Attorney-General, Taking the latter question first, the point at issue was the legal power of the Commonwealth to permit immigration and to expedite the Silence is said to be a virtue emigration of undesirables-or , in the language of his own electorate, "" to. let 'em in "" and to "" chuck 'em out."" The Government's power tb eject individuals who had been domiciled in Australia was seriously in questiou, and a more exact definition of its authority in this regard might be reached in the course of the proceedings now under way in Sydney. The speaker referred to the case of the Irish envoys, who were deported for sedition in 192a, as bearing on the cases of Messrs. Walsh and Johnson, inasmuch as the opinions of the learned justices of thc High Court on that They were silent, he said, occasion seemed to indicate that the Commonwealth's powers of deportation extended only The Attorto persons who, in returning to Australia) could not be said to be returning "" home.?' It will be understood, of course, that this is an abridged report of my. speech. I do not accept it as being absolutely correct, to the experts and specialists but it is sufficiently accurate for my pucare assumed to have a pose. The report continuesnice refinements on those The Government, hy its new act, hadabolished the three years' probationary periodin force prior to this year, thus making its powers more arbitrary, and resorting to force, instead of discussing the legal issue in a reasonable manner. Mr Justice Starke had'said', in 1022. that deportation was an instrument which sliould be employed only against persona ""who did not belong to the people of Australia."" The law aimed at and hit immigrants, and not members of the Australian community. It will be seen, therefore, that in rny oublio address to those university students I emphasized the effect of what appeared to be the main feature of the High Court's decision so far as it had application to the very men whom we knew perfectly well the Government was endeavouring to deport. As a matter of fact, at that very moment the Deportation Board was sitting. I need only add that it is noted with the utmost veracity that at the conclusion of my address I was loudly cheered. That would naturally be expected. About the same time -to be exact, on the 3rd September, 1925I was honoured with an interview by a representative of the Melbourne Herald. I had forgotten that I had been so famous as to be given this space in the He r a l d ; but my attention was directed to the fact after the Prime Minister's observation. "" Act valid. Real issue-Who is an immigrant? Mr Brennan's view."" That sums up the situation, let me say, in a nutshell. The statement that I then made was published before the H i g h Court gave jits decision, and stated that the real issue was, "" W h o was an immigrant?"" The report of the interview reads as follows:Specifying that iie was neither speaking for tlic Labour party, nor giving a legal opinion, Mr Brennan, M.H.R., said to-day that he believed the validity of the Deportation Act was established, so far as immigrants were concerned. "" But the question here,"" said Mr Brennan, "" is whether the persons concerned in the summonses are immigrants within thc meaning of tin; aet. "" The Commonwealth's powers in this case seem to rest on the meaning of the word immi'rration in the Constitution. '-' Tlie most striking High Court decision on conveyed to the electors that Parliament tlie point was that relating to the two Irish envoys. The point was then discussed as to what constitutes an immigrant, and whether ' once an immigrant, always an immigrant.' "" Mr Justice Higgins seemed to express mild surprise at finding himself to be still an immigrant; but, nevertheless, there are dicta (with persuasive power in future cases) in the decision of the Chief Justice which appear to show that the condition of being an immigrant is affected by duration of residence. The Chief Justice applies, as a test, the question, is the person entering the Commonwealth "" returning home""? and later on suggests that thc three years' limit, during which proceedings, at that time, could be instituted, was a probationary period after which the immigrant became, established as a member of the community. Applying these considerations to the cases now under review, continued Mr to my question. Any government that A'r. I'rrnvnv. Brennan, it would seem to strain the powers of the Commonwealth to their utmost to say that a Britisli subject of 35 years' residence in Australia is still an immigrant within the meaning of the act giving deportation powers. The Commonwealth undoubtedly has very great, if riot unlimited, powers regarding who may come and go. And the best Australian view-point is that the"" greater the powers of the Nationalist Parliament the better for Australia. Certainly the Labour party does not welcome limitations on Commonwealth powers, imposed by judicial decisions, whether in law, right or wrong. I may add that that statement represents the view of the Labour party. We were less concerned w i th the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth under the Immigration Act passed last year than with its political implications and moral aspects. Our particular duty was to examine the act from those view-points rather than from the view-points of the The interview was headed, niceties of constitutional argument. S t i ll I hope that I have made it abundantly clear that honourable members on this side have not been silent upon the' constitutional aspect of the act. AlthoughI have never pretended to set myself up as an exponent of constitutional law, and have never, up to the time that the PrimeM in ister challenged me in this regard, made any claim whatever to have said, "" I told you so "" or anything of that sort so f a r as the legal position was concerned, yet, since the challenge was made, I think that I have shown clearly that honourable members on this side were right, while the legal luminaries of the Government were absolutely and fundamentally wrong. For the life of me, I cannot to this day understand how honourable gentlemen opposite, when on the platform during the election campaign, deliberately had undoubted constitutional power to deport certain persons, knowing, as they must have known, what the position in tliose cases, and in particular the case to which I have referred, imported. During my second-reading speech I challenged the Attorney-General by asking him had he ever known a case in which, acting outside our constitutional powers, we had seized and imprisoned a man in this country. The Attorney-General preferred to make a* personal quip of the matter, and said that though my voice was loud, he did not hear me. I believe that he heard me, but it suited h i m not to reolv proposes to lay hands upon one of the subjects of the K i ng in this country must do it , just as the police force does, at its peril; it must have the lawful righ t to so act. No man should be thrown into prison in this country by an act of lawlessness, to be excused afterwards by the members of the Cabinet saying, "" We did not know that it was an unlawful act u n t i l the H i g h Court decided that we were acting unlawfully."" The ordinary citizen is presumed to know the law.

9,Mr Scullin ( Y A R R A ) [4.39],"W elife of others. The prisoner was born in Holland, and came to Australia before 1914, in which year he was tried for wilful murder and acquitted. Seven years later he was charged witli attempting to kill, and owing to tlie nonappearance of the principal witness the prosecution collapsed, and he was acquitted. Now lie has heen brought up again, and sentenced The newspaper from which I quote the paragraph goes on to ask the question whether this individual deported or not. That is a very pertinent question. thp. existing law of this country, and the Crimes Bill now before us, there is no power, and there will be none when this bill is passed, to deport such a man if he is a naturalized Under this bill, new crimes are to be created, such as the splitting of banknotes for the purpose of fraud; but there is nothing to provide that persons of the type of the man referred to in the paragraph quoted shall be deported, if they are naturalized British subjects, and have been in this country for three years. line of demarcation is drawn clearly and distinctly offences committed by bodies of working men fighting for better conditions, and those criminals who commit the vilest of crimes. the the latter can not. If there is anything which might show the political and industrial bias of the Government sible for the measure now under sideration, it is such a case as I have quoted. under which men can be deported, whether they are criminals or persons who advocate criminal acts; but men cannot be deported under that law if they have resided in Australia for three years, provided British subjects. tion they require to be regarded as citizens of Australia who must be punished in Australia under our laws. No matter what crime has been committed murderous, brutal man of the type referred to in tbe paragraph I have quoted, if he is a naturalized ject, with three years' residence, cannot be deported under any law we have, or under this bill when it becomes law. I could understand ment saying that they would introduce a Mr SiaiHin. law to enable them to punish such persons by deportation, but they do not. do so; they maintain the distinction drawn iu the existing law which says that no matter what crime a man may commit, if he has been three years in the country, and is a British subject, he must be punished to ten years' imprisonment. in this country. That is what the Government stands for in regard to the punishment of criminals of the worse type; is liable to be but when it is a question of dealing with men who commit, not crimes as we understand the term, but offences, in So far as I understand connection w i th industrial affairs, it takes up a different position. A man may get upon a platform, .and urge a body of men to strike for better conditions. The court trying him may decide that his British subject. offence was so trivial as to be met with a fine of a few pounds; but the Attorney-General may under this diabolical law deport him from this country for the term of his natural life. That is what could happen under this bill. It indicates what we have come to in this country when honourable members oppoA site sit calmly behind the Government and say that they will stand for that. by the Government between But, they add, the law will not be put into operation if men do not break it . "" Y o u are champions of rebels,"" said the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr. Under certain conditions, Foster) to the honourable member for former can be deported, and Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton). We are not champions of rebels or of criminals. The offence of stopping work committed responby men in combination fighting for betconter conditions of employment is regarded by the Government as the worse crime ""We have an immigration law, that can be committed. Honourable members opposite say that men should not go on strike, becaues there are tribunals to deal with their grievances. In many cases we have no tribunal to deal with their grievances. In many cases they have become naturalized such tribunals are denied them, not by That is the qualificathe Labour party, but by the party opposed to Labour in this country. There are parts of Victoria where industries are being carried on, and where those emby a ployed in them have not the protection of a wages board or an arbitration court These means of protection have been deliberately denied to workers in these inBritish subdustries by anti-Labour governments he Should these workers go out on strike in their fight for better conditions, they will be liable under legislation of this tbe Governdescription. The other day the Prime Minister addressed a number of employers, and be asked them, """"What are you doing to preserve industrial peace?"" There was hope in an address of that description to employers that the Prime Minister was capable of considering both sides of the industrial question. I want to address the same question to the Prime Minister and his Government. What are they doing to preserve peace in this country ? to disrupt it , aud nothing is more calculated to do so than the bill, the third reading of which we are now considering. what has occurred under a department of the Federal Government. The point I wish to make might be illustrated by a reference to an incident that occurred here recently, but which I shall not traverse now because it has been settled, and I have no wish to raise the question again. But I may refer to an incident in connection with a department of the Federal Government that has not been settled, and in connection with which a strike is impending. cular case a strike occurs, it will be due to the administrative act of an official of the Government; I refer to the complaint of men who are working on the railway between Quorn and Oodnadatta, taken over by the Commonwealth. If those men go on strike, and they talk of doing. so, the Government may put up an industrial political stunt and issue a proclamation under this measure. The men have been working under certain conditions secured by proper constitutional means. whether they are getting more or less than they are entitled to, but whether the Prime Minister and the Attorney General will say that men enjoying certain conditions under a South Australian award, on a railway taken over by the Commonwealth, shall have one of those conditions altered without reference to any industrial tribunal. W ill any honourable member opposite say that that should be done? .chamber about lockouts and strikes. We cannot find a man guilty of :a lockout because employers do not need to lock out their men. take direct action by altering the conditions under which their men called upon to work. them which are objectionable to them, or to go on strike. Under a State award, the men on the railway from Quorn to Oodnadatta worked under certain conditions on Sunday trains, and without consultation or conference with the men, and without submitting the matter to any tribunal, the Commonwealth Commissioner for Railways by simply issuing a by-law, which he has the power to do, has materially altered the They have done many things conditions. The Commissioner suggests that the conditions they have been enjoying are ridiculously generous. That is not for him to say, but for some industrial Let me draw an illustration from tribunal in this country. If he wants to alter the conditions under which the men have been working, why does he not, as a representative of the Government, adopt the constitutional method of asking the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court to vary the conditions? He has not done that, but has taken direct action by the issue of a by-law. His direct action does not lock out the men; but if the men resist it , and say lhat they will not work under the conI f in this partiditions he imposes, their action will amount to a strike, for which they may be liable to punishment under a law such --.s that we have now under consideration. This is the kind of thing that is occurring inside and outside the Public Service of Australia. What does the Railway Commissioner say in reply to the representations of the union in this case ? He says that if the men are not satisfied, let them file a plaint before the Arbitration Court. Is that not a fine state of affairs ? Here are men who have been working The question now is not under the conditions of an award"" of the State, whose conditions have been altered without any consultation with them. As a matter of fact, a request by the men for a conference was point-blank refused. Their recent representations remained unanswered. The first representation made was answered by the Commissioner saying, "" If you are not satisfied with the conditions, file a plaint with the Arbitration Court."" W h y should they We talk in this be forced to file a plaint with the A r b i tration Court to get something which they already have under an award of a board, but which it is proposed to take from They them ? That is not the procedure in arbitration and industrial matters in this are country for which we should stand. The They force procedure should be that p.ijsmg conto work under conditions ditions should stand, no master by what tribunal they were awarded, arc? \ is : for those who desire to alter them to apply to an industrial tribunal for their variation. The Commonwealth for Railways has reversed that procedure. The result is that a resolution been passed by the men that first time a Sunday train is proposed to be run from Quorn to they will refuse to run it under the altered conditions. backed by the Federal Union of Railway Employees of Australia. Government going to do when that stage is reached ? If the men go out on strike they will be just as guilty of breaking this law as any other men who are likely to be brought under it and They will have committed no offence beyond standing by au award under which they have worked for many years. cite this as an illustration of the way in which men may be provoked to strike in this country. which men have been working are altered to their disadvantage tion with them, the only course left when arbitration many cases, is to refuse to work under what they consider objectionable tions. and refuse to work, but if in combination they refuse to work, that be an offence under In practice, men do not fight singlehanded if they can fight in They do not take the weakest way of resisting things which they regard as an encroachment combination every hundred years ago, the iniquitous bination laws of England were repealed and trade unions were legalized, right to combine and organize with it the right to act in in a fight for better conditions. working men have not parted with the right to strike; they have merely given up the desire to strike. they are willing to arbitrate, and I venture to say that 98 per cent, of the men in our organizations to abide loyally by the decisions of an arbitration court. up against a situation such as that which has just been brought Commonwealth ways, and they would have no choice but to say, "" If , without summoning Mr SciiWn. appear before a tribunal and bringing about a change in our working condiCommissioner tions in a legal way, you, by your direct action, alter the rules, regulations, and has conditions under which we work, we the also shall take direct action by declaring that we shall not work your trains under Oodnadatta the altered conditions.""

There are not only the men to whom I have referred, but there are others in the Commonwealth Service who are being most reguunjustly treated, and whose means of redress are being restricted in every possible way. In any industrial unrest conferences, which threatens the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, the interests of the employees are always disregarded, and those of the kings of comI undermerce, who, in the opinion of the Govern""industrial ment, are paramount to the king of the realm, are most closely conserved. My Goindignation at legislation of this descripI suppose that tion cannot be adequately expressed in the language at my command. I have endeavoured to meet the situation in a Mincalm and temperate manner, but, as a representative of the people, I cannot allow matters; such unfair, unjust, and un-British legispersonally lation as the present bill to pass without with the conditions under expressing m y strongest disapproval, and I shall always protest strongly when I consider that the rights and privileges of the people are seriously menaced. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) must be surprised at the somewhat unusual course adopted in further discussing the bill at this stage. The provisions of the measure, however, demand the fullest possible consideration. It is quite likely that when the Attorney-General replies he w ill refer to the statements made by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) concerning the attitude the Minister assumed on another measure which was so ignominiously pitchforked out by the H i g h Court when it considered its constitutional aspect, and the manner in which it was administered. thing about that. measure such as this is necessary in order to remedy some of the ills from which the community is suffering to-day, and that under the present Constitution we have the power to legislate in this way. If we have the power, why is profiteering and the exploitation of the public going on just as it has been for many years? I believe that on a previous occasion when I made a similar statement. I was challenged by the Prime Minister, who said that if the Commonwealth Parliament did legislate on certain specific matters, the legislation would probably be held to member the late Mr Thomas Eyan a legal authority of no mean repute, who successfully upheld legislation before the High Court and the Privy Council-in forming the Prime Minister of the day that he could d r a f t a measure for dealing with such offences which he knew would be held by the High Court to be constitutional. The Attorney-General cannot recall the maritime strike, but as a youngster I can remember that great industrial upheaval, which affected not only the capital cities of the Commonwealth, but also the main provincial centres, and notwithstanding the unsettled industrial conditions which then existed, there was have a bad time. no mention of deportation. mild expression, the workers at that paid by the other side. time were in a state of seething insubordination, and, as a result of that great industrial upheaval, which dispute that? was undoubtedly caused by the action of employers, the political labour movement was established. The site upon which the Melbourne TradesH a l l is situated was practically given to the trade unionist movement by the Victorian Government. Since then many measures affecting industrialists have been passed by the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, and there are only a few which can be regarded as dark blots on the statute-book. There is, for instance, what is known as the Irvine Coercion Act, which was, as I predicted, repealed by a succeeding Government. Similar legislative action was taken in New South Wales, where the result was the same as in Victoria. In stead of encouraging trade unionism and allowing it to develop to its fullest extent, this Government is doing everything to I propose to say someretard it . The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) reW e are told that a ferred to this measure as futile, and I believe it w ill be, because it will be found inoperative when an attempt is made to enforce it . Does the Attorney-General think that ' the trade unionists of Australia are likely to abandon their old system of organized effort? Trade unionists w ill always have their leaders. Reference has been made to the holding of secret ballots. As a member of a union for many years, I . know that certain matters are decided by a secret ballot of the members of the organization.

There are in our community persons who exercise an influence upon some honourable members in this House, and who would hark back to the conditions that prevailed in the days before unionism was established in Australia. They would be delighted to have the opportunity to deal w i th every man individually. It is interesting, at times, to quote the opinions of spiritual leaders. A t au Anglican congress that was held some years ago D r . Gore, then Bishop of Oxford, counselled churchmen to support trade unions, and to encourage agricultural labourers to obtain improved conditions. Dr. Cosmo Gordon Lang, at the same congress, attributed much of the indust r i a l unrest to "" the idle rich, whose selfishness and luxury are more responsible for the bitterness and discontent than are the agitators at whom they sneer."" Those are true words. I remember reading a paper, portion of whicli was published in the daily press, thatr was read by Mrs. Carrington at an Anglican congress held in Melbourne eighteen months ago. Speaking of Australia, she saidThe arrogant methods of tlie rich did more to create bolsheviks in this country than any other influence she knew. That bore out what had been said by D r . Cosmo Gordon Lang. The Attorney-General makes the pretence that employers will be dealt with under word "" lockout "" occurs in it . That suggestion has been ridiculed out of court. Can he name an employer who has been brought before any tribunal in Australia, to answer the charge of having locked out his workmen? I s it likely that any employer w ill be charged under this act? The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Duncan-Hughes), with his legal knowledge, will unhesitatingly answer "" No . "" If that honourable member forsook his present political faith and, as the leader of a union, advised men to go out on strike as the only means of redressing their wrongs, he would stand a good chance of being put in jail . Much has been said regarding the mandate that the Government was given by the people of Australia. What story do the cold figures tell ? Candidates supporting the composite Government polled approximately 1,422,000 votes. The Labour party, despite the opposition with which it was assailed, polled 1,192,000 votes. What is a majority of 230,000 in a poll of 3,000,000. oyer 100,000 votes would reverse the position. That is an easy matter. find that it is not an easy matter. when I was first elected to this House. The Labour party then won sixteen seats.

We are to have a system of deportation in peace time more tyrannic than that of war time, and with far less justification. 'Ihe new deportation is to become part of tlie "" established Government,"" and the very act of calling for its removal is to render the act punishable by deportation or jail. We have little hesitation in asserting that the acceptance of the principle of deportation, as an instrument of strike-breaking, is in itself a "" crime"" upon the country and the Labour movement, and upon tradition and posterity both. Let the workers be sure of this, that when they cannot strike as a last resource-whe n they cannot stop work, however grievous their burden-the y have indeed sold themselves into slavery. I agree with that view. Our protests are unavailing, but it is necessary to place them on record to show that an attempt has been made to prevent this bill from being forced through the House by a brutal majority. I agree with what previous speakers have said about the difficulty of dealing with men in the mass, and during industrial troubles they must, of course, be dealt with in the mass. If an attempt were made to apply the provisions of this bill during industrial trouble it would be found that the ships available would not contain all the people that the Government would want to deport, and that the jails would not hold those that the Government would want to imprison. wait a long time for the redress of grievances, they may be driven to take direct action. Such extreme measures, however, can be avoided if the conditions of the workers are ameliorated with reasonable expedition. Pin-pricking practices by employers are frequently Ihe causes of industrial trouble. It has been proved in America, and I believe it is so here, that industrial troubles are most frequently caused by the managers and owners of businesses. I have tried to the best of my humble ability to carry out my duty as a member of this Parliament. We have heard something about mandates, and I had a mandate, given to me by the electors, to oppose legislation of this character. for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) said you championed the rebels. an angry moment. All the responsibility for this bill rests on the Government and its supporters. It is becoming more and more apparent that not more than two members on the other side understand the industrial position in this country. If they did understand it , legislation of this character would not be passed. Honourable members on this side do not endorse law-breaking, or support law breakers. If I broke the laws of this country I should expect to be subjected, to the penalties provided for lawbreakers. Is this Parliament content to display its incompetence by not punishing offenders in the ordinary way ? When honourable members come to consider the bill in their calmer moments, they will realize that the electors never sanctioned it. The Australians of to-day are the offspring of Britishers, and it is because the blood of our ancestors flows in our veins that we are the better Australians. A person might have been born on the other side of the world and brought to Australia in his infancy. In spirit, in education, and in everything but birth, he might be a true Australian, and perhaps a better Australian than some who are born here. Such a person could be deported under this bill, but Australians by birth must be tried and adjudged guilty or not guilty by the courts of this country. Who can contend that it is right to make such a distinction between British subjects? The right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) can recall the time when a If men are compelled to Victorian Parliament did a similar thing, but a later Parliament wiped out the act as a blot on the fair escutcheon of thisState. This bill will remain a blot on the fair escutcheon of Australia u n t i l a future Parliament wipes it out.

It proposes to validate certain refunds of income tax, and also to validate the non-collection of certain amounts of income tax. In the first place, I should like the Treasurer to state the total sum involved by the bill. .. .. . . 37 I have no doubt that it is a very consider.. .. . . 11 able amount. The Minister admitted in his speech that it was substantial, but 26 when asked by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) to mention the Johnson, Sir Elliot amount, he said that it was impossible Latham, J. G. to give it . AlthoughI admit that it is Lister, J. H. impossible to give the total accurately, Mackay, G. H. the major portion of the amount could Mann, E. A. be stated absolutely. I hope, therefore, Maxwell, G. A. . that before the debate closes, and even Nott, Dr. if the committee stage has been reached, Page, Dr. Earle the Treasurer will let honourable members Parsons, W. L. know what sum is involved. First of all, Paterson, T. I desire to know the actual amount that Prowse, J. H. was refunded. Surely the Treasurer w ill Rodgers, A.

One could not McGrath, D. C. expect that sum to be stated accurately; Scullin, J. H. but it could be given approximately. I Fenton, J. E. maintain that the refunds of tax were Yates, G.

When something illegal and inequitable suspended from 6.S7 to 8 p.m. has been done, and the amount is large, it makes the offence worse. That is what I propose to prove.

97,Mr Scullin,"T h a t is not my arguI propose lo inquire to what extent the measure can be regarded in that light. In 1922 Parliament agreed to exempt from taxation all bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits, ' and it also acquiesced iu a statement by the then Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) that such tax as 1 had been collected should be refunded. That is the basis of the statement by the present Treasurer that this bill gives statutory effect to what was regarded as the will of Parliament, as expressed by the fact that it had exempted bonus shares from taxation in 1922, and by the fact that the then Treasurer made an announcement that from the date of the commencement of the act until that time all money collected as tax on bonus shares issued against accumulated profits would be refunded. Since Parliament took no exception to that announcement, it was interpreted as being the will of Parliament. assertion that effect is sought to be given to the will of Parliament; but I shall show that the ground is very slight in deed, when one examines all the circumstances that led up to that action, and what has been done since. Why was there such an agreement by Parliament? Do honourable members think' that any Parliament, or any government, has the right to refund taxes over a period of six or seven years, if such refund is illegal ? member would agree to that. the reason why Parliament did accept the position was because it believed that the tax collected had been illegally taken, and that the sums refunded should not have been collected by the Government. Subsequent events have proved that Parliament was misled into the belief that the money was illegally collected, and that it was bound to order a refund. From a perusal of the debates in the HouseI can discover only one honourable member who did not believe that. That was the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) . The Treasurer of the day ( Mr Bruce), speaking in the Houso on the 2nd October, 1922, is reported in Hansard, at page 2966, to have saidThe alteration is more apparent than real, because what we are actually proposing to do ds to make .clear, beyond doubt, what apparently is the law to-day. He referred to the decision of the High Court in the Webb case, and interpreted it as meaning that all bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits should be exempt from taxation under the act. He made this very definite statementIn view of the judgment in Webb's case, the Government have come to the conclusion that, although the point has not been absolutely settled by that case, they would be unable, by taking further action in the courts, to establish that bonus shares issued against accumulated profits are liable to tax. . . . During the debate the then honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best), who is a lawyer, supported the view of the Government that the decision in the Webb case exempted such shares from tax. The honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , however, made this statement, which is reported in Hansard of the 6th October, 1922, at page 3328On the subject of bonus shares, I do not agree-althoug h I speak as a layman, and, therefore, with some deference-wit h the honorable member for Kooyong( Sir Eobert Best), There is slight ground for the who said that the exemption of these shares has been settled by a recent decision of the court. I do not think the Treasurer agrees with him. That decision, as I read it, made certain features plain. It laid down certain principles that appeared to be correct, but I think the Treasurer realizes that some phases of the matter are uot covered by the Webb decision, and, therefore, he proposes to boldly face and deal with the situation. It is clear that the honourable member for Balaclava had in mind an alteration of the law; but when the honourable memI am sure that no honourable ber for Kooyong was speaking on the Then same day, at page 3319, he saidThus we may take it that the law is that bonus shares of this class, which have been a source of great anxiety to the members of the commercial and trading community, are exempt from income taxation. that particular judgment. a strong case. . . . this bill referring to them are not necessary. may bo drawn, but in the case I . have mentioned bonus shares, representing the accumulations of profit which had been capitalized, which were openly issued as bonus shares, were declared free of income taxation. When he said that they were declared free of income tax, he was referring to the decision of the High Court in the Webb case. The only honourable member in the House, therefore, who really understood the decision in the Webb case was the honourable member for Balaclava.

But 1 submit, with the humility with which a layman should approach a subject of this nature, that the Webb decision by no means disturbed the position as it then existed. made it clear that in view of the Webb judgment, the Government considered that it would be impossible by taking further action in the courts to establish that these bonus shares were liable to tax. know that, if bonus shares were not exempt, a mere declaration in (his House could not make them so, and the fact that the former Treasurer introduced an amendment of the law showed that he. had a doubt on the matter. to show honourable members that there able member definitely agree with the was room for much doubt, and that the interpretation given by the then TreaGovernment of the day, before exempting surer ? these shares from taxation for a period of six years, should have had no doubt of the Webb case, and I accepted the inat all on the matter. introducing the present bill , endeavoured honoraibue members cannot accept the to bring the whole House behind him by interpretation of a High Court decision saying that the Leader of the Opposiby the Government and its legal adtion ( Mr Charlton) acquiesced in the bill visers it is a bad state of affairs for this introduced in 1922. although the Leader of the Opposition events, it is evident that we must refrain objected to it in the first instance, he from accepting the Government's interagreed to it when the matter was fully pretation of the law.

I was convinced, however, after reading in Hansard the speech of the Treasurer of the day ( Mr. Bruce) that the H i gh Court decision in It more than rethe Webb case rendered it impossible to collect taxation on bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits.

I was, like the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) regarding another measure, bluffed by the then Treasurer's interpretation. I became wise after the event.

I am trying to the necessary steps to put that question beyond all reasonable doubt before making a declaration in this House that large collections of tax, retrospective for or distribution in kind, which, I think, six years, had to be refunded. There are four kinds of bonus shares-first , those issued from capital assets written u p ; and, secondly, from profits on sale of capital assets. being accretions of capital have always been considered to be exempt from taxation. Thirdly, bonus shares are issued from accumulated profits placed in reserve; aud, fourthly, against current profits. of bonus shares issued from accumulated profits was exempt from taxation, and the fact that the Government of the day deemed it necessary, as the honourable member for Balaclava pointed out at the time, to amend the law to exempt those shares from taxation, showed that before refunding large sums of money something more was needed than merely a declaration in this House by the Treasurer of the day. The Government relied upon the ""Webb case in exempting such shares from taxation. Let us briefly look at that case. South Silver Mining Company, with a capital of £200,000, had accumulated profits to the extent of £600,000, so that its assets were worth £800,000. It is true that on these profits the company rate of income tax had been paid, but if they had been distributed as dividends and profits to the shareholderssome of whom were wealthy mena heavy tax of 5s., 6s., or 7s. in the £ 1 would have been levied. The company, therefore, decided to have a reconstruction. A new company was formed, and the shareholders of the old company received 800,000 £ 1 shares in exchange for 200.000 £ 1 shares, which represented the assets of the old company. Those extra shares were then assessed by the Taxation Department as being taxable, and the case was tested by a man named John Webb, who had held 500 shares in the old company, and had received 2,000 shares in the new companv. The assessment was for the year 1919-20. The case eventually went to the High Court, which held that such shares were not "" profits or bonuses credited or paid to a shareholder,"" and, therefore, were not taxable under section 14B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-21. for the Commissioner of Taxation, and he argued that there was no difference between distribution in money was a sound argument. The Chief Justice, Mr Justice Duffy, and Mr Justice Starke said, in reply, that the crux of the question was, whether the shares were I understand that these severed from the capital funds and liberated as profits or income. They held that there was no detachment, no liberation in money or moneys' worth, and that the scheme was reconstruction, not distribution. That was clear and definiteUnder the 1922 act the third form language. Mr Justice Isaacs said that the shares received were capital, not profits, and that in a winding-up surplus assets were not profits. Mr JusticeH i g gins emphasized that point by saying, "" The price received for a house or land is not income . . . . this was a sale . . . . a winding-up . a reconstruction, not a distribution."" Mr. Justice Isaacs, as reported at page 483 of the Commonnoealth Law Reports, vol. 30, summed up the situation as follows:The fact that a going company distributes anything among its shareholders is treated as The BrokenH ill showing that it is a distribution out of the company's income; for the company cannot distribute any of its capital to the shareholders. I u the Webb case it is obvious to the lay mind that there was a distribution of capital, because it was a winding-up and a sale. If the company were a going concern there could not be a distribution of capital to shareholders. There was a clear line of demarcation. To> my mind, the High Court made it clear that there was a distinction between distributing either dividends or bonus shares from a going concern and a distribution of assets by a reconstructed company. The company was not a going concern in this case. It was a reconstruction, a winding-up of the old company, and the formation of a new company. It might have been done to avoid taxation, but that did not affect the decision of the court. It simply considered the facts and decided that there was a reconstruction and not a distribution. Yet on that case all bonus shares from accumulated profits issued by going companies were exempted by the government of the day from past, present, and future taxtion. Mr Latham appeared had already been heavily taxed.",43,Second Beading
110,Mr Watt,"The accumulated profitsquestion of equity only, ancl not that of legality. On the question of equity, the Government w ill simply amend the law retrospectively, hut on a legal interpretation all bonus shares issued from accumulated profits were exempt from taxation. The Treasurer ( D r. Earle Page), after quoting Mr Bruce's announcement in the Housei n 1922 concerning the refund of this money, said"" That statement was explicit and expressed the interpretation of the law as then accepted by the Taxation Department."" He also said that independent counsel supported that interpretation. I contend that the Taxation Department did not accept that interpretation which the Treasurer of the clay ( Mr Bruce) put upon the law. MrM . CAMEBON -Did it not accept the decision in the Webb case? case. those cases in which moneys were refunded. MrM . CAMEKON -Why did the Department accept the decision of the Webb case respecting the BrokenH ill South Company? reconstruction case. given to that was that all bonus shares distributed profits were exempt from taxation, but the judgment actually exempted from taxation, as the honourable member for Balaclava said, only those particular shares that were issued by the new company to the old company. I return now to the statement of the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page), that the interpretation given by the day ( Mr Bruce) expi-essed the interpretation of the law as then accepted by the Taxation Department. That is assumed to be a statement of fact that is not disputed, but I dispute it on the authority of the Eighth Report of the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Ewing, dated the 28th August, 1924. A t page 24 of this report this is what he said, speaking of the decision in the Webb caseThis decision did not deal with bonus shares distributed by a continuing company out of past profits upon which the company had paid income tax. That meets the point submitted by the honourable member for Balaclava; the fact that they had paid tax did not affect the legality of the matter. I ask honourable members to contrast the statement of the then Treasurer, Mr Bruce, that the interpretation put upon the decision in the Webb case by the government of the day was the interpretation of the law as then accepted by the Taxation Department, with the statement of the Commissioner of Taxationi n his Eighth Report, which was published, I think, before the last decision of the High Courti n the James case. There is a direct conflict between the then Treasurer's interpretation of the decision in the Webb case and that of the Taxation Department. ber has quoted the words of the Taxation Commissioner before the decision in the James case, the Government does not appear to be left with much excuse. at the moment whether the TaxationN o t as covering all Commissioner's interpretation was stated before or after the decision in the James case, because I cannot just now remember the date of the James case. However, that does not alter the fact that the interpretation of the Commissioner of Taxationi n his Eighth Report of the decision in the Webb case was that it did not deal with bonus shares distributed by The interpretation a continuing company out of past profits upon which the company had paid income from accumulated tax. clear in my second-reading speech on this bill that independent counsel' had given the opinion that the effect of the judgment in the Webb case would be as in terpreted by the then Treasurer. surer for reminding me of that. The the Treasurer of government of the day did obtain the opinion of an independent counsel, and one would have thought that it would have placed that opinion on the table of this House.

Further on in the Eighth Report of the Commissioner of Taxation he saj sT The law on this question has not yet been settled by the courts. If that were so the Government could not have been satisfied that the decision in the Webb case referred to other by a new company, and that the law on the sub.iect had not been settled. the interpretation of the Government was the same as that of the Taxation Department, then the Government must have knowingly refunded money it both ways. ' We are now asked to validate that illegal action, and to make legal the illegal refund of large sums of money collected in taxation. That is the object of this bill . When we consider the facts it is clear that the Government of the day was slovenly in its action, and did not take the requisite steps to prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that what it proposed to do was legal. proposed was most drastic, because it was undoing the work of six years, and was opposed to the legislation intended by Parliament. passed the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1915, it clearly intended to tax these bonus shares. The Government, after the tax had been collected, refunded it back to the beginning of the operations of the act, and did so upon a most flimsy foundation. tained independent legal advice, what more could it do? could have submitted a test case to the High Court on the general question. A decision in such a test case would alone justify it in refunding public monevs collected over so many years. The Government had a decision of the High Court in a specific case [46] of the reconstruction of a company, but not on the general question of In his Eighth Report the whether taxation could be imposed on bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits. In his Eighth Report, the Commissioner of Taxation continuesThe position has been considerably clarified, though not entirely settled from the technical point of view, by an announcement in Parliament by the Treasurer, the Hon. S. M . Bruce, that the Government would refund the taxation paid in respect of the bonus shares. The statement of the Commissioner of Taxation was that the Government would refund this money. One was under the impression that the Commissioner of Taxation collected and refunded taxation. But the Commissioner would not accept the responsibility, and shares than those issued he made it clear in his report that thc announcement of the Treasurer was that If the Government would refund the money, and the Government, and not the Commissioner, did refund the money. announced in this Chamber that it would illegally.

There is a vast difference, I suggest, in taxation laws, between bonus shares distributed from a windingup, and shares distributed from accumulated profits. Company did not wind up. going all the time. actually, but it did technically, and thus it evaded taxation. It enlarged its capital. it dodged taxation by what it did. The Treasurer has reminded me that the opinion of an independent counsel was sought as to the meaning of the decision of the High Courti n the Webb case. There is a marked conflict between that counsel's opinion of what the decision in the Webb case meant and that of another counsel on a later occasion. When the James case came on for consideration before the High Court, and before the court had heard it at all, counsel for the Commissioner of Taxation, who I think was Mr Owen Dixon, contended that the shares that had been declared to be exempt from taxation by the Government of the day were taxable. Let us see what the James case was. James was a shareholder in the Australian Portland Cement Company. from the Commissioner of Taxation for 1920-21, which included tax on bonus shares issued from current profits. James held that such bonus shares were not taxable, and he appealed against the assessment. The counsel engaged to> appear for the Commissioner of Taxation advised the Commissioner to include all his bonus shares in the assessment, not only those from current profits, but also bonus shares which James had received from accumulated profits of the company. That is to say, counsel for the Commissioner at that stage gave a very different interpretation of the decision of the High Courti n the Webb case from that previously acted upon, and held that shares distributed from accumulated profits before 1922 were taxable in the same way as those issued from current profits. between the two cases ? elapsed between the two cases, but so far as I know there was no judgment bearing on the subject from the court in the meantime to guide counsel in the James case. A t the time judgment was given in the James case I learned from a letter which appeared in the press fro m J . S. Eastwood, that it was by arrangement with the taxpayer, James, that the It kept Taxation Commissioner included those shares in the claim that went before the court on a ]iromise that whatever the decision of the court might be, no claim would be based upon bonus shares from accumulated profits. The assessment in It did what it did openly. cluded shares from current profits and also shares from accumulated profits, and T h a t may be so, but the High Court held that they were all taxable. Thus we arrive at the position that the Commonwealth had illegally refunded money that it had previously collected. sorry that he spoke. duction of this bill he has not very much to be sorry about. it is that a decision of this Parliament should be made clear beyond mistake even to the H i g h Court. have been done in 1922. not done. He received an assessment desired to exempt these shares from taxation back to 1915 it could have submitted a retrospective measure to Parliament. I do not believe that Parliament would pass a retrospective law for the refund of taxation collected over six years. If it would, a dreadf u l state of affairs would be brought about, because one Parliament might i m pose a tax and another Parliament six years later might repeal the tax, and pro-, pose the refund of what had been collected. I venture to think that this Parliament would never have acquiesced in the announcement made by the Treasurer of the day if honourable members had not been convinced that their acquiescence was forced upon them by a decision of the H i g h Court.",46,Second Beading

As the honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) w ill well remember, I told the House plainly on that occasion that I considered that bonus shares from accumulated profits should be taxed. I shall discuss that matter in a moment. On the interpretation of the Webb decision, the two counsel's advice differed diametrically.

I have already quoted a few opinions in the Webb case; I shall now quote one or two in the James case referring to the Webb case. section 14B defining "" income "" as "" dividends, interest, profits, or bonus credited or paid to any member, shareholder,"" & c , Mr Justice Isaacs remarked that, in the Webb case, he had saidTlie employment of all these terms marks the anxiety of the Legislature that in whatever form iprofits of a company are "" credited or paid"" to the members, &c., shall be regarded as the recipient's income for the purpose of taxation. It was Mr Justice Isaacs's opinion that it was the intention of Parliament to tax these shares, and that the use of all the terms in the provision of the act-divi dends, credited or paid to the shareholderswas for the purpose of ensuring that whatever might be the for m in which profits of a company were paid or credited to a shareholder, they should be do not think it was taxed in the hands of the recipient as income. Mr Justice Starke also referred to the Webb case, and saidIn Webb's case the court was of opinion that I think it was there was no dividend or bonus credited or paid to the shareholders. A case more relied on than any other before and since the Webb case was the decision of the House of Lordsi n the Blott case. It influenced the majorit y of the Royal Commission on Taxationi n making their recommendation for the exemption of bonus shares. In the James decision, Mr Justice Isaacs saidSo far from Blott's case supporting the appellant's contention, here it is . . . quite opposed to that contention. He said alsoTlie appellant contends that the case is governed by the decision of the House of Lords in Blott's case. I am very clear that it is not. I leave the legal aspect now in order to deal with the equity of this proposal. The legal aspect is the gravamen of my charge against the Government of the day for having failed in its duty to be thoroughly satisfied that it was acting perfectly It smells like the taxalegally in what it did.

Not only has this remission of taxation on bonus shares been proved to be illegal by the recent decision of the High Court; it is also most inequitable, and it is on that aspect I now desire to dwell. 1 agree that the Treasurer is in a most difficult position. I do not know that this money can be re-collected reasonably. The Treasurer has given a number of in stances to show the enormous difficulties of getting the money back into the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation.

Otherwise, I do not believe any Parliament would have accepted a declaration of that kind. But Parliament, without inflicting any injustice or hardship, can remedy some of the wrongs of the past.

A f t e r a l l, whoever does not come in . That is where this House was again deceived. should not say that the House was deceived. M t . SCULLIN I did not say that it was deliberately deceived, but it was misled by the figures presented. It was advised that a rate of Is. in the £ 1 on all the profits of a company would be practically the same as a rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 on the undistributed portion. It was one of those half truths that mislead people. As some one has said, "" Half bricks thrown at you are worse than whole ones."" The exemption of bonus shares is inequitable. When the honourable ""member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) spoke on this question in 1922 he pointed out very forcibly that the undistributed profits out of which In other bonus shares were paid had already been taxed, in some cases, at the rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 , and in others at the rate of 2s. Sd. in the £ 1 . The income tax law If that were done,, before 1922 was that the profits of a comnanv which were distributed were not taxed u n t i l they got into the hands of the shareholders, but that the undistributed profits-that is to say, those that went into The exemption of bonus reserve-were taxed at the company flat rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 . The right honourable gentleman argued that, because No t if they are paid out these undistributed profits had' already paid tax at the rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 , they should not pay any further tax when the shareholders received them in the form of bonus shares. If that argument is a sound one, I ask"" why dividends distributed from accumulated funds should be taxed in the hands of the recipients, because they have also already paid the It was 2s. 8d. in the £ 1 . company tax at exactly the same rate as A t the time the law bonus shares. cash value, whereas bonus shares have not. one argument at a time. It is contended that bonus shares out of accumulated profits should not be taxed because they have already paid income tax. I meet that argument by saying that if the The remedy for that is reserves of a company are distributed as cash dividends, instead of bonus shares, they will still have paid the same amount of tax, and yet they are again taxed in the hands of the shareholders.

224,Mr Scullin,"I do not wish to distilling the soil to have an opportunity to obtain legal advice as to the advantages to be derived from converting their farming businesses into companies, and thus avoiding taxation. The Treasurer cannot be unaware of the extent to which companies have increased, but I shall give some figures later to show that this low company rate is an incentive to persons to act in the way I have mentioned. The Treasurer said that the law should be amended, and last year introduced a bill to overcome the difficulty, but it is very questionable whether it has had the results desired. When companies pay a rate of Is. in the £ 1 while individuals have to pay 5s. in the £ 1 , it is merely placing a big temptation in the way of certain persons. In the report of the commission dealing with the amendment of the act, it was stated that a company rate of Is. in the £ 1 on all the profits of a company would lead to a simplification was stressed in the House at the time. In Mr Ewing's last report which was tabled a few days ago, he said, "" It has considerably increased the work of assessing the shareholders."" ' Mr Ewing points out that whilst it has simplified the assessing of companies to a small degree, it has considerably increased the difficulties of assessing individual shareholders. From the point of view of the Federal Taxation Department the present system is much less satisfactory and less economical than the former practice of taxing companies only on the undistributed income. opinion of the Taxation Department after its experience since 1923. In section 21 of the act provision was made to deal with holding companies. Concerning this the Taxation Commissioner says, "" It is not yet possible to state whether it has proved satisfactory."" remember that the Treasurer introduced a measure last year to prevent the department the formation of holding companies. The procedure followed is very simple. An investing or holding company, which does not do any business is formed to hold the shares of the trading company. The bulk of the shares of many trading companies are held by holding companies. The representative of a trading company in forms the Commissioner that two-thirds of its profits have been distributed. The Commissioner follows the dividends and finds that they have been paid to holding companies which pay a rate of only Is. in the £ 1 . That was sought to be avoided by an amendment of the act last year. I . pointed out that by the transfer to a number of holding companies the profits of a trading company that would be taxable were diminished. The Prime Minister said at the time that that could not be avoided, and it cannot be while the law remains as it is. The position could be. met by reverting to the old law. because even under it a flat rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 was imposed, although in some cases it was less. duction of 25 per cent, in the general rate since then. not bring it down to is. in the £ 1 . D r . EARLE PAGE -To about Is. 9d. in the £ 1 . of the work. That fact should consider the abnormal increase in the number of companies since the act was passed under which a company rate of Is. in the £ 1 was imposed. For the yeara 1920-1 to 1922-3 the number of companies returning income tax returns was reduced by 219. Between 1922-3 and 1924-5, when the Is. in the £ 1 rate was introduced, the number of taxable companies increased by 1,469. I submit that that is an abnormal growth, and shows how revenue is being lost by the conversion of private trading concerns into companies. It is an easy matter to form That is the considered a company in which 95 per cent, of the shares are held by one person and the other 5 per cent, by the members of his family, and thus the payment of the individual rate is avoided. With this increase in the number of companies, there has been a marked reHonorable members wil l duction in the number of individual taxpayers. I am not u n m in d f u l of the fact that the increase in the exemption is an from being cheated by important factor. A glance at the statistics will show that the number of individual taxpayers has been considerably reduced, whilst the number of taxable companies has considerably increased. This shows that individual taxpayers are formin g themselves into companies in order to evade their share of taxation.

A great deal of the profits that were distributed in the shape of bonus shares was made from war profiteering. The stock was watered, and the capital increased out of the accumulated profits. shares were issued the individuals who received them should have paid income tax at the rate provided for individuals. Acting upon a most doubtful decision the Government made refunds. A list of the persons who received those refunds would make interesting reading, but I do not suppose that we can hope to get it .
