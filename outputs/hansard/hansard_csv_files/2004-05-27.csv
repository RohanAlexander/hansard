We have been working very hard over the last couple of weeks. I have put in a primary draft, which has gone to the relevant ministers: Minister Nelson, Minister McGauran and other ministers who have an interest in this. I was disappointed to see today in a press release from Senator Carr, who had gleaned something in estimates, the suggestion that absolutely nothing had been done and that there was absolutely no consideration whatsoever being given to finding a way through this problem with the CRCs. It concerns me that people like Senator Carr are maybe wishing that these things are going to fail. This also bothers those people who work within the CRCs, because they start to get a bit concerned about their own future. It is important to be able to confirm that there has been a lot of work going on with the CRCs, the universities and industry, working towards a process where we can not only guarantee the long-term future of both of these invaluable institutions but also strengthen them further.

274,The Speaker,"Order! It being after 5Thursday, 27 May 2004 ----Capricornia Electorate: Hearing Impaired Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (9.40 a.m.)-I wish to draw the attention of this House to the plight of the hearing impaired in my electorate of Capricornia. I bring to the House just two examples of the many people who are affected by the failure of this Howard government to assist those people in our community who are hearing impaired. World War II veteran Gordon Ohl of Keppel Sands has had to wait six months for replacement hearing aids through the federal government public health system. This has had a terrible effect on the quality of life of this 83-year-old. He can no longer enjoy watching television, has difficulty following conversations and talking on the telephone and feels endangered every time he crosses the road. Mr Ohl first contacted Australian Hearing Services in January this year but did not get a hearing test until 5 May. He was then told that he would not get a hearing aid until the end of June. Since my intervention, that has been brought forward to 4 June, but that still represents a six-month wait for Mr Ohl. I understand from my inquiries that Australian Hearing Services in our region is understaffed at present, but surely that is a problem for the government to fix. It should not be people like Mr Ohl who pay the price for this government’s neglect of essential health services. Clearly, this situation is unacceptable, but the situation facing another of my constituents is even worse. Gregory McDougall was diagnosed with hearing loss at the age of four. He was supplied with hearing aids through the National Acoustics Laboratory until he turned 21. Gregory is now 33 and his position is that, while he has hearing aids, he is able to study. However, without aids he is unable to either study or find employment. The hearing aids he received just before he turned 21 are now beyond repair. Centrelink has informed him that there are no provisions for anyone on Newstart to be given hearing aids. However, as a recipient of Newstart the cost of purchasing hearing aids is well beyond his capacity. Does this mean that he will have to try to survive without hearing aids until he reaches 65? Will he still be expected to try to study or find employment without the assistance of hearing aids? It would seem that, whatever way he goes, there is no provision under the present guidelines for assistance to people like Gregory with hearing disabilities. Surely we must do whatever we can to support young people like Gregory to actively study or seek employment. For this to occur, Gregory should be provided with hearing aids, while remaining on the Newstart allowance. I am asking the Minister for Health and Ageing to personally review Gregory’s case, as it is obviously one where the system is failing and real assistance is needed to ensure that this man is given every opportunity to lead a fulfilled and worthwhile life in our society and does not spend the next 30 years waiting for a pension at 65 so that he can finally receive the hearing aids he needs to take his place in our society.

276,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.43 A.m.),"A couple of weeks ago I was privileged to visit the Ilcare about each other and parents who are proud of both the children and the staff at their school. Having said that, the reason I speak about them in the House today is that, at the invitation of Dr Rosie Wade, I spoke with the year 6 classes of 6J, 6W, 6F and 5-6K-about 103 students in all. Their topic was state and federal governments. It is not often as a polly that I am lost for words, but these young students blew me away with their questions and knowledge of the role of government, both state and federal. There were many questions. What is a term in government? How do you as a member of a party get a vote or a say in parliament? How do you become a member of a political party? And for 1½ hours the questions came, and all required very personal and honest answers. I am often asked why I chose to become a polly. The visit to Illaroo Road Public School is one such answer. What makes it even more rewarding is that at least 10 per cent of the students wanted to become politicians of the future. Illaroo Road Public School will be visiting Parliament House in the near future. Hopefully, parliament will be sitting so that year 6 will have an opportunity to personally meet some of us on both sides of the House. On a different note, it was of interest to see just how these students work. Dr Wade’s class operates on a system of contractual homework-that is, over a sixto 10-week period, set works are given with various choices, allowing the students to do independent studies with an ability to control their own time management and to explore in-depth their own set pieces of homework. They also make up board games and word games, based on such games as Parliament Unwrapped and Government Galore. Not only is Illaroo Road Public School a school to be proud of but it also happens to be in the street where I live, so you can see that I, too, am very proud of its reputation and, in particular, the students of years 5 and 6. It was a real eyeopener for me to see first-hand how these students work but, what is more, they are actually enjoying the work in politics. Family Services: Child Care private child-care centres, specifically ABC child-care centres. ABC, the chair of which is former Liberal candidate Sallyanne Atkinson, has around 300 centres in Australia, including one in south Melbourne, in my electorate. Last week the BRW showed that the owner of ABC child-care centres, Mr Eddie Groves, is now worth $175 million, up $70 million from last year. In the last sitting week I gave a speech on ABC child care. One of Eddie Groves’s employees wrote to me, thanking me for raising the issue. She wrote: I am ... currently studying my Certificate 3 and earning $12.08 [per hour] on traineeship ... I love my job, the children give me great pleasure and I always give that little bit extra but really I just don’t think I can afford to stay in the industry much longer ... At ABC [we] do all the cleaning in the centre and are expected to tidy the outside areas as well. I believe that if a job includes several roles ie cleaning and childcare then maybe the award wage should reflect this. If ABC had to pay cleaners in each of its centres, it would cost them hundreds of dollars, instead the childcare workers have to perform the role of cleaners to save Eddie more money. Staff are also required to play music at certain times of the day, which is not supplied by ABC and only gets played if staff bring in their own music. I am sure the standard of care at ABC, especially given the devoted work of child-care workers, is generally good, but I would like to congratulate Mr Groves for moving up to 131 on the BRW rich list. ABC centres refuse to hire sufficient cleaners, refuse to pay staff a decent wage MAIN COMMITTEE",120,Statements By Members
277,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.45 A.m.),"TodayI would like to again raise the issue ofand require staff to bring in their own music to play to children. I would suggest that childcare workers who would like to improve the situation should contact the child-care section of the LHMU. Mr Groves donated $10,000 to the Queensland Liberal Party in 2002-03. Last week the Treasurer visited one of his centres in Queensland. Did the Treasurer know that the owner was a significant contributor to the Liberal Party when he decided to visit the centre? Was this the reason he chose this particular centre? In my electorate, in Glen Eira, parents have expressed concern that the Liberal controlled council is considering withdrawing from child-care services and allowing private operators to move in. Fees have increased significantly in Glen Eira this year, from $48 to $53 a day, and in July they will increase to around $62 a day. The withdrawal of councils like Glen Eira from child care is a total disgrace and an abrogation of their responsibility to serve the residents of my area. It is only since the recent council elections that the Glen Eira council has been thinking of withdrawing from child care. The fact that parents and their children have to go on Channel 10 and make protests to keep the Glen Eira child-care centre open is a total disgrace. I urge the councillors of the City of Glen Eira to focus on their main concerns and serve the people of Glen Eira. (Time expired) Casey Electorate: Mountain District Christian School our of attending the official opening of the Primary Learning Centre at Monbulk’s Mountain District Christian School in the heart of the Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges in my electorate. The new centre has been completed and is being used by prep and year 1 and 2 students. The opening was a great occasion to celebrate the school and the local school community’s significant efforts in bringing about the construction of this building. The morning involved the new principal, Mr Jo Harder; the vice-principal, Mr Chris Prior; many of the school’s board members, including Mr Garry Gannon, a former principal; many members of the local community; parents; and, of course, most importantly, all of the young students who will use this new facility. Two of the prep students, Riley Allan and Connor Harlow, along with the principal, had the privilege of cutting the ribbon to officially open the new centre which they and their fellow students will use. I wish to pay tribute to the school community. These facilities, costing half a million dollars, are a magnificent achievement for the school. They were able to build this new centre without a state or federal grant. Not surprisingly, that has involved many years of planning and a great sacrifice by many of the parents who were involved, not just financially but in terms of the time they volunteered to bring the project about. The construction began just last August and proceeded at a rapid pace to ensure that it was ready for opening last Saturday. The closeness and the commitment of the school community at Mountain District was illustrated by the fact that the builder who constructed the facility was himself a former student of the school who returned from travelling around Australia with his family specifically to build the new classrooms. He lives in Monbulk with his wife, and his young child attends the school. Similarly, the electrician who worked on the project, Mick Dillema from Wandin Electrics, put in many hours above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that the project was completed on time. Janet Nyhouse also had a lot to do with the project. These volunteers were acknowledged and thanked by all on the day.

278,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (9.48 A.m.),"Last SaturdayI had the privilege and honwork that they had done. As the parents recognise, by sending their kids to an independent school like Mountain District they make a financial sacrifice. They are to be commended for exercising their choice about the sort of education they want for their kids. It was another example of the rich diversity of our education system. (Time expired) Private Forest Reserve Program in the Advocate newspaper on 18 May 2004 that the Tasmanian government had spent 60 per cent of funds for the Private Forest Reserve Program on administration was incorrect. The senator’s comments show a lack of understanding of this important environmental program. He might learn more about it if he were to consult the speech I made in this parliament on 13 May 2004 to explain it. The last annual report of the program-and I know my colleague the member for Franklin will be interested in this-showed that 60 per cent of all program costs since 1997 had been paid directly to landowners. Only 23 per cent of expenses were for salaries and office costs. The other program costs included 17 per cent spent on legal, valuation, survey and negotiation fees-something that you would expect when you are dealing with the Private Forest Reserve Program. The program provides financial incentives to landowners to protect important areas of native forest on private land in perpetuity, mainly by registering a perpetual conservation covenant on a land title. These protected areas on private land are part of Australia’s Comprehensive, Adequate and Representative Reserve System. The PFRP has now established 149 forest reserves and 21 other reserves covering an area of 27,781 hectares. I know that they have in their sights 62,000 hectares or more for preservation. The cost effectiveness of the program has set a benchmark for conservation programs not just here but worldwide in securing areas of very high conservation value in perpetuity. The once-only cost of securing protection of these important forests on private land in perpetuity is $506 per hectare. That takes into account all program costs. Perhaps Senator Abetz could indicate a conservation program anywhere that secures perpetual conservation of such important areas on private land more cost effectively than the Private Forest Reserve Program in Tasmania. Once again, Senator Abetz has got it wrong. I urge him and his Liberal colleagues to back my call for an extension to this program beyond June 2004-an extension not yet officially agreed to by Minister Kemp, contrary to assurances by his unnamed spokesperson that the program will continue. Chelsea Flower Show some great news from the world-famous Chelsea Flower Show in London. A landscaped garden known as Fleming’s Nurseries Australian Inspiration won a silver gilt prize after competing against 24 other landscaped gardens from around the world. This is a great achievement and all of those involved should be congratulated. The achievement of a second prize is even more significant given the fact that this is the first occasion that an Australian garden exhibition has been entered in the show.

Fleming’s produce, along with the produce of many other horticultural businesses in the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges, is sold all over Victoria and Australia. Fleming’s Nurseries is a family business run by Don and Dawn Fleming, their two sons Wes and Graham and other members of the family. Don, Dawn and Wes are currently in London along with the team from Semken Landscaping, which is based in Melbourne’s outer east, and Jim Fogarty, who is also from Melbourne. I wish to mention some of the other people involved who are currently in London: Martin Semken, Mark Bence, Paul Stammers, Mark Stammers, Brad Peters, David Brown, Anne Semken, Mandy Bence, Brian Sparling, Jay Watson and Glen McGrath. I assume that is not Glen McGrath from the Australian Cricket Team. Since the beginning of May they have been working on this landscape garden and all of their efforts have borne fruit. As Wes Fleming said, taking part in the Chelsea Flower Show will lift the profile of landscaping and horticulture in Australia and communicate the skill, vision and quality of Australian industry to the rest of the world. Just being asked to participate in the Chelsea Flower Show is an achievement in itself, but to win a second prize really puts Australia on the map in an important industry not just in the Yarra Valley but across many of the other outer suburban and rural electorates of Australia. It is a great achievement and it deserves to be recognised. der 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by Mrs De-Anne Kelly: That this bill be now read a second time. Grants Amendment Bill 2004. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme came into operation in 1974. Obviously, it was an initiative of the Whitlam Labor government. The purpose of the scheme is to bring benefits to Australia by encouraging the creation, development and expansion of foreign markets for Australian goods, services, intellectual property and know-how. The EMDG Scheme has played an integral role in encouraging Australian companies to broaden their horizons and expand their customer base overseas via the development of new export markets. The pursuit of new export markets and engagement in international trade has been central to Australia’s economic development. Sustainable growth in exports means more and quite often higher paying jobs for Australians, and it enables Australia to pay for imported products demanded by Australian industry and consumers. Unfortunately, the government has allowed the EMDG Scheme to run down markedly since 1996-97, when a funding cap of $150 million was imposed on the scheme until 2005-06. According to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the real value of the program has now fallen by nearly 20 per cent since the cap was imposed and it is likely to fall by around 27 per cent by 2005-06. This decline in the real value of the EMDG Scheme creates considerable uncertainty for exporters as it impacts on the amount that they are able to access from the scheme at the end of each financial year. Last year 25 per cent of Australian exporters who had provisional grant MAIN COMMITTEE",123,Statements By Members

282,Mr Cox (Kingston) (9.57 A.m.),"I rise to speak on the Export Market Developmententitlements above $60,000 received only 32.84c in the dollar for their second tranche entitlement. Many exporters would have undertaken major marketing exercises and extensive travel to potential new markets overseas on the basis of receiving a larger payout in the second tranche. Last year’s payout of 33c in the dollar for the second tranche short-changed many exporters and may well have a detrimental impact on their plans to continue to pursue new markets overseas. The government’s rundown of the EMDG Scheme completely cuts across another arm of its trade policy to double the number of exporters. The government has set an ambitious target to double the number of exporters by 2006-07. Using a base figure of 25,000 exporters in 2000-01, the government has set itself the task of achieving 50,000 exporters by 2006-07. So far things are not looking so good. According to ABS statistics, the number of exporters increased from 25,000 in 2001-02 to 31,450 in 2001-02-a big jump of over 6,000 exporters. But this was largely attributable to a reclassification exercise. The number of exporters has since fallen to 31,174 in 2002-03. So the government has quite a bit of ground to make up if it is to double the number of exporters by 2006. This is not going to be helped by the continuing decline in the real value of the EMDG Scheme. The amendments put forward in this bill are to introduce a not fit and proper person test to be applied by Austrade when assessing entitlement to payment of an EMDG grant. This bill responds to very valid community concerns about the payment of an EMDG grant of $90,000 to a company associated with a former codirector of the collapsed Pyramid Building Society in Victoria. It is completely inappropriate that a former director of the Pyramid Building Society was able to access taxpayers’ funds from this government for his continuing business activities, particularly when Victorian taxpayers have already paid a petrol levy to bail out deposit holders in Pyramid. It is incumbent upon the government to ensure that EMDG funds are allocated only to recipients who are deemed appropriate and worthy by community standards. This does not include former directors of bankrupt financial institutions. It is in Australia’s interests and the interests of taxpayers that EMDG recipients meet the high standards required to represent Australia professionally overseas and to conduct their international business on a sound basis. Notwithstanding Labor’s concerns about the government’s negligence in allowing the EMDG Scheme to run down and the uncertainty this creates for exporters, Labor supports the amendments in this bill. These amendments are necessary to assure the community that EMDG funds are being used to good effect and that the recipients of such funding are fit and proper persons in accordance with community standards. Bill 2004 amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997, and introduces a not fit and proper person test to be applied by Austrade in accordance with ministerial guidelines when assessing entitlement to payment of an EMDG grant. opment Grants Amendment Bill 2004. I support this bill very strongly because it is a bill that is in the interests of my constituency of Ryan and it is also in the interests of small business men and women throughout the country. Therefore, it follows that it is in the interests of this country’s national economic prosperity. The first point I want to make is that it is interesting to note the speakers who will be making presentations on this bill. We seem to have a majority on our side-only one member of the opposition will speak on this bill. I just wonder if that MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004

284,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (10.03 A.m.),"I am pleased to speak on the Export Market Develsignals to the electorate the respective support of the government and opposition for (1) this bill, (2) small business and (3) the valuable contribution that small business men and women make to the country, particularly in employing people. It is no secret that this government has been very proactive in making great inroads into the unemployment rates that were left by Labor during their time in office, and we now have record levels of employment in the country. I think one of the very strong reasons why this is the case is the success of businesses in Australia that export to the world. I have quite a few businesses in my electorate of Ryan that export to the world. One of the reasons they are able do this is because they have, at the head of those businesses, individuals who are creative, entrepreneurial and very much in favour of business making a contribution to the overall prosperity of our country. The EMDG Scheme is the government’s principal financial assistance program for small and medium sized exporters. It will continue to make a big difference to our small and medium sized businesses who wish to export our fantastic services, skills and products to the world. It provides grants that reimburse up to 50 per cent of the money spent by eligible exporters during the financial year on specified export promotion activities-less, of course, the first $15,000. The scheme has a budget of more than $150 million per annum and it provided some 3,800 grants last year alone. The EMDG Scheme enjoys very strong support in the small business community and, as I have alluded to, in my electorate of Ryan in particular it is a very popular scheme. It is very widely utilised. I know it will continue to have the strong support of small and medium sized businesses in the Ryan electorate. Surveys continue to reflect this, and my interaction with the business community in the Ryan electorate reflects this as well. The scheme has been regularly reviewed and is recognised as a benchmark for effectiveness in government industry support programs in the generation of additional exports. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 contains one measure only, which is designed to ensure that EMDGs do not go to applicants or their associates who are deemed by Austrade as not fit and proper to receive such grants according to ministerial guidelines. Currently, a grant to which an applicant is otherwise entitled is not payable if certain provisions of the EMDG Act apply. For instance, grants are not payable for: export marketing expenses for illegal activities; marketing expenses incurred in the promotion of certain publications, films or computer games that have been classified by the classification board, prohibited or potentially prohibited Internet content, or telephone sex services; and if the applicant is not a resident of Australia, does not have an Australian Business Number, has outstanding disqualifying convictions or is under insolvency administration. The legislation does, however, allow for grants to be paid even though the applicant or an associate of the applicant may be viewed as an inappropriate person to represent or promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade outside of Australia, or for other reasons to receive, directly or indirectly, the benefits and recognition of a government grant. This bill is good for this country. This bill has the wide support of the Ryan electorate and I want to take this opportunity in the parliament to pay tribute to a number of small and medium sized businesses which have profited substantially from the government’s support of their initiative and entrepreneurial skills. They are creating employment opportunities in the Ryan electorate, throughout Brisbane and throughout Queensland as well. I want to pay particular tribute to the following companies. Firstly, there is Blue Ribbon Seed and Pulse Exporters, who are based in PullenMAIN COMMITTEE vale in the Ryan electorate. They are in the business of cereal grain wholesaling. They are very successful indeed, and they are making great strides there. I also want to acknowledge Double Brown and Associates, who are in the business of book and magazine wholesaling. They are in Bellbowrie, which is also in the Ryan electorate. They are very creative at targeting a niche market and showing what can be done with entrepreneurial flair and by having a go. Also in the business of computer software manufacturing is a company called Epitropos Pty Ltd, in Toowong. They are also at the cutting edge of computer software manufacturinganother good example of a local business in the Ryan electorate that is taking advantage of this scheme. The sum of $5,000 that they received is just a small illustration of how a small amount of money, in their case, can have a large impact on their business and its success in terms of potential employment and potential export dollars for our country. In Kenmore, Greenisle Investments Pty Ltd are a consulting engineering services company. They received grants in 2001, 2002 and 2003 of around $40,000. That is a firm that is also doing very well and making the most of this government’s support for small business and for cutting edge skills and technology. I want to also acknowledge a Mr Peter Howes, who is the principal at HRM Consulting Pty Ltd, based in Taringa. I have had the opportunity of visiting their business and seeing the fantastic work that they do. They are also involved in the computer and high-tech industry. They provide consultancy services to the world, which is remarkable for a smallish business. They started off very small, in the Ryan electorate, and they have now created a reputation for excellence and reliability in the broader international market. They have received EMDG support as well, and I know that they will continue to employ people in the Ryan electorate, as they are looking to expand their services. A very interesting business is My Travel Network Pty Ltd, which is engaged in the travel agency business. They are in Toowong. They have received over $100,000. They are another example in my Ryan electorate, of which I am very proud, where there are people who are doing fantastic stuff to employ people and to make a contribution to the Brisbane economy. Another very interesting business is Tina Jeffrey Design Pty Ltd, at Fig Tree Pocket. They have only received around $14,000 to $15,000 over two years, yet they have been able to make every use of the dollars provided by the federal government to create a niche market. I have had the pleasure of meeting Alan and Tina Jeffrey at my Ryan small business networking breakfasts. They are in jewellery and silverware manufacturing, and they continue to make the most of the scheme. Only recently, I bumped into Tina at the airport, and she was saying to me that their business is expanding and they are looking to try and employ more young people, in particular, and give them the opportunity of learning their craft, which is the manufacture of jewellery and silverware. That is just another fantastic example of a husband-and-wife team living in Fig Tree Pocket in Ryan, where they are getting off their backsides and actually making a difference to our community. They are employing people and thinking constantly about how they can value add to their businesses. They are receiving the support of the Howard government through this very successful EMDG Scheme, where they are able to promote the Australian brand name. I just want to conclude by saying that, in the Ryan electorate, small business and medium sized businesses play a very strong part in the community. They are at the forefront of comMAIN COMMITTEE munity work. They are at the forefront of supporting local charities, and they are able to do this because they are flourishing and employing people. They are continuing to make a difference in the local economy, and this gives them the opportunity of also being good business citizens, as it were. I think this has been largely possible because of the climate of good governance and the good policies that the Howard government has been able to implement in its three terms in office. I know that local businesses in my electorate will be very supportive of this scheme, and I have every intention of letting them know that only one member of the opposition spoke on this bill in the parliament today. I just hope that that Labor member is not reflective of the opposition’s views about small business and the important role that it plays in the Australian economy. I am very pleased to say to the people of Ryan that I will continue to lobby very strongly for EMDG support for them. I know that a number of businesses in the Ryan electorate have come to me for support and assistance in how to make the applications to the government to receive the support. I want to reassure them that I will be working very hard to make sure that the EMDG dollars also come our way. In conclusion, I make a comment about the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee in my electorate of Ryan. I thank all those who contributed to that, particularly the previous head of Queensland Austrade, who came to address the gathering of Ryan small businesses last year. He talked about the scheme, about the valuable place of exports in the Australian economy, about the importance of Austrade and what it can do for small businesses and about the assistance that Austrade’s international offices can provide to small and medium sized businesses who want to venture out of their local community and expand into the big, wide world because of the richness of opportunities that other markets provide for us. His presence at that networking breakfast resulted in one of the biggest attendances that I have had over the two years that I have organised the Ryan small business networking breakfast. I thank him again and look forward to the pleasure of working with his successor, who is new to the job of running Austrade in Queensland, and inviting him to address the Ryan small business community. I would like to convey to the Ryan small business community that if there is anything that I am able to do to assist them as their federal number, they have only to pick up the telephone or pop into the office at 31 Station Road and they will have my full support as the federal number for Ryan to assist them. The EMDG Scheme is a fantastic initiative of the federal government. This bill is very good. It provides appropriate support to those who require it and also ensures that it is not a system that is abused and exploited by those who wish to take advantage of the taxpayers of Australia, who are continuing to make small business very important in this country. opment Grants Amendment Bill 2004. I follow up the comments by the member for Ryan and say that it is very interesting to note the dearth of opposition members speaking on issues relating to the economy, taxation, trade and tourism. We have had one speaker from the opposition on this matter and he was out the door faster than Speed Gordon. He hardly spoke. It shows a lack of real focus on the economy and the way in which this economy is built.

285,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.17 A.m.),"I am very pleased to speak on the Export Market Develagement did not come into it. All of the soft options like reading books to your children were there, but where were the hard yards with regard to building the economy? Without trade, this nation is in big trouble. Without incentives to get the Australian manufacturers and small business people out there in the marketplace, we also have significant problems. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been operating under both sides of the parliament. When the other side were previously in government, they had the scheme. Of course, it has been reformed since we have been in government, and the success is there to be seen. The Howard government have had a very strong and effective record in relation to trade and, since we have been in government, trade has increased by over 40 per cent and now reaches $140 billion, which is a great achievement. The areas in which we have been particularly strong include elaborately transformed manufactures, which have gone up by 11 per cent, and processed primary produce, which has gone up by eight per cent. Service sector growth has also been very considerable. Despite the downturns we have seen because of SARS and September 11 and October 12, this year we have seen the benefits of the increased expenditure by the government and a further $235 million being allocated for tourism promotion. It has been well received by the industry. It is this government that expanded the EMDG Scheme to the tourism sector. The education sector has also increased sevenfold since we came to government, which is an amazing achievement. The EMDG Scheme has been in operation for some years. The coalition, in coming to government in 1996, changed its operation to maximise the number of companies that would gain benefits, particularly aiming at smaller companies and medium sized enterprises. Following the continuing success of the scheme, a further round of legislation was introduced in 2001 to ensure the ongoing nature of the program, at a cost of $150 million. Last year alone, the scheme contributed to over 3,700 businesses. Those businesses generated $5.5 billion in export revenue and employed over 122,000 people. The overall development of the scheme has been very impressive. Since we changed the scheme in 2001 the number of grant recipients has increased by over 25 per cent. Last year the scheme provided over $800,000 in grants to 20 organisations in my electorate. Not only is the government providing real incentives in these areas of activity, it is also working on the free trade agreement, which does not get support from the other side of parliament. Benefits of $4½ billion are expected from that agreement. That is a tremendous achievement. We are waiting for the Senate report on the free trade agreement. I think the agreement will be one of the great pluses of the time that this government has been in power. The Australia-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the Australia-Thai Free Trade Agreement are already in place. This bill seeks to add a ‘fit and proper’ test to the selection criteria for potential recipients of the EMDG Scheme. The test will allow the administrators of the scheme to exercise a degree of discretion over the selection of grant recipients to ensure they meet the fit and proper test. Currently a number of guidelines, including criminal convictions and previous insolvency, are assessed. This test adds a further criterion. The test will be subject to further review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The bill also provides secondary power to Austrade to request and obtain information relevant to the assessment of the fit and proper test. This bill should be well received by both sides of the House. It is enthusiastically supported by this side of the House. The EMDG Scheme is integral to the overall success of the AustraMAIN COMMITTEE lian export industry. Australia’s exports continue to grow and expand, having gone up by over 40 per cent since this government has been in power. They are the strength and backbone of this economy. The free trade agreements will add to the vibrancy of our export program. All members of the House should support these changes. This is a technical bill related to the fit and proper criteria. It is part of the ongoing refinement of the EMDG Scheme, which has worked extremely well to assist small and medium sized companies into the marketplace. I commend the bill to the House. Grants Amendment Bill 2004 following my colleagues the members for Cook and for Ryan. The bill contains one substantive measure, which is to ensure that export market development grants do not go to applicants or their associates who are deemed not to be fit and proper to receive such a grant according to the guidelines to be tabled by the Minister for Trade. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is the Australian government’s principal financial assistance program for small and medium sized exporters. It provides grants that reimburse up to 50 per cent of the money spent by eligible exporters during the financial year on specific export promotion activities, minus the first $15,000. The scheme has a budget of $150.4 million per annum and provides around 4,000 grants each year. Currently, a grant to which an applicant is otherwise entitled is not payable if certain provisions of the EMDG Act apply. These include checks for outstanding disqualifying convictions and insolvency administration. The legislation does, however, allow for grants to be paid, even though the applicant or an associate of the applicant may be viewed as an inappropriate person to represent or promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade outside Australia, or for other reasons to receive directly or indirectly the benefits and recognition of a government grant. It is considered that paying grants in such cases may lead to the mistaken perception that the government condones disreputable behaviour and supports the individual that engages in it. The changes proposed in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 will ensure that Austrade, in accordance with ministerial guidelines, can determine whether the applicant or associate of the applicant is or is not fit and proper to receive a grant. The proposed changes are to take effect for the EMDG claims from the 2003-04 grant year onwards. This means applications received and grants paid from 1 July 2004 onwards. The proposed changes will ensure that the export market development grant funding remains focused on cultivating new exporters and is available to those applicants who are most deserving of assistance from this government. I am sure you will agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and I am sure the Australian public will also agree with the federal government, that we do not condone disreputable behaviour and we will not support individuals or companies that engage in it. The scheme is consistently hailed as a benchmark of effectiveness in terms of government industry support programs. In recent years it has become increasingly popular with the export community. Last year some 3,700 small and medium sized businesses received grants under the scheme. These businesses generated $5.5 billion in exports and reportedly employed 122,000 Australians. The government has a continuing focus on assisting smalland medium-sized Australian businesses. This is evidenced nowhere better than through the EMDG Scheme. Last year, 65 per cent of EMDG recipients were employing 20 people or fewer. Equally importantly, some 860, or 23 per cent, of the grants were paid to businesses in rural and regional Australia.

286,Mr Prosser (Forrest) (10.24 A.m.),"I rise to support the Export Market Developmentfact, in my electorate of Forrest in the south west of Western Australia, in the year ending 2003 over 29 companies-comprising small and medium enterprises producing export products such as mining, construction machinery, toys and sporting goods, furniture and wood products, meat processing, vegetable exports and of course wine manufactures, for which the south west of Western Australia is famous with its fantastic Margaret River region-have been rewarded by this government for their export promotion activities and have received more than $740,000 in grants as reimbursement for their 2001-02 export operations. These businesses are the quiet, solid achievers and are most deserving of these grants. They are long standing, well-established businesses operating within my regional electorate. They are the most appropriate businesses to receive benefits and recognition from this government for their continued trade efforts in cultivating export markets. Currently, under the EMDG Act 1997, even if an applicant may otherwise have been eligible for the grant, there are no provisions to determine the circumstances in which a grant will not be paid, such as if the applicant is not a resident of Australia, does not have an Australian business number, has an outstanding disqualifying conviction or is under insolvency administration. The legislation does not presently allow for the non-payment of a grant to an applicant who may be viewed by the Australian community as an inappropriate person to represent and promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade overseas, whether by reference to his or her trading history or otherwise. This government does not condone behaviour considered by the Australian electorate to be inconsistent with acceptable community standards of commercial and personal propriety. We have a duty to taxpayers to ensure that grants paid via government schemes are not paid to recipients other than those who meet these standards. The proposed changes are to take effect for EMDG claims from the 2003-04 EMDG grant year. In other words, this provision will apply to applications received and grants paid from 1 July 2004 on. I commend the bill to the Committee. port Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 in the Main Committee. I would like to thank members from both sides for their contributions. It goes without saying that the EMDG Scheme has been a very successful scheme and continues to be so. It is certainly supported wholeheartedly by the government. We always should be vigilant in looking for new and improved ways of delivering assistance, particularly to new entrants into the export marketing regime. Each year, the federal government commits $150.4 million to help several thousand small and medium sized businesses develop sustainable export markets, through the assistance given under the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. The EMDG Scheme is extremely popular within the exporter community and is consistently hailed as a benchmark of effectiveness in terms of government industry support programs. The coalition government do not believe that EMDG funds should be paid to persons whose behaviour is inconsistent with accepted community standards of commercial and personal propriety. We have a duty to the taxpayers who fund the EMDG Scheme to ensure that grants are not paid to persons who do not meet these standards. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 ensures that we fulfil this obligation by providing that grants are not payable where the applicant or the applicant’s associates are deemed by Austrade to be not fit and proper persons to receive a grant.

Austrade will only be able to make these decisions with reference to ministerial guidelines, and affected applicants will have the right to appeal Austrade’s decision. The consent of an applicant or his or her associates will be required prior to Austrade undertaking criminal or other relevant checks. Austrade will only be able to apply this new provision to applications received from 1 July 2004 onwards. The bill contains important amendments to the EMDG Act 1997. It will ensure that the export market development grants funding is not provided to individuals or businesses that do not merit government recognition or taxpayer support and that it remains focused on cultivating small and emerging exporters-that is, those businesses most deserving of taxpayerfunded support. In conclusion, this is a refinement to the act and we believe it is worthwhile supporting it to make sure we properly target the assistance that is being funded by taxpayers. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. BILL 2004 Debate resumed from 13 May. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. This bill, the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, contains amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes Act 1914. The bill represents the final stage of the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police. It will also enable the Australian Federal Police to access Commonwealth investigative powers when investigating state offences which have a federal aspect. The bill implements the legislative aspect of resolution 16 of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime. The Australian Protective Service was established by the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 and is the Commonwealth’s pre-eminent provider of protective security services. Protective service officers provide a first response security role at airports, diplomatic and consular premises, Defence establishments and other Commonwealth buildings. After the devastating events of 2001, the government determined that the Australian Protective Service should transfer from the Attorney-General’s Department to the Australian Federal Police. Stage1 of that transfer happened on 1 July 2002 when legal and financial responsibility was transferred to the Australian Federal Police. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004
288,Mr Vaile (Lyne,"Minister for Trade) (10.34 a.m.)-I move:The employment framework of the Australian Protective Service was not affected by stage 1 and the Australian Protective Service and Australian Federal Police have continued to operate under separate legislative and employment arrangements. The Australian Federal Police Act 1979 sets out the functions of the Australian Federal Police, and the powers and duties of AFP employees. The Australian Protective Service Act 1987 sets out the functions of the Australian Protective Service, and the powers and duties of protective service officers and special protective service officers. In addition, Australian Protective Service employees are Public Service employees within the meaning of the Public Service Act 1999. The bill will create a new category of employee (that is, protective service officer) in the Australian Federal Police Act and include the protective service function of protective service officers as a function of the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Protective Service Act will be repealed. The transfer of Australian Protective Service employees to the Australian Federal Police will be effected by section 72 of the Public Service Act 1999, which provides that the Public Service Commissioner may determine that Public Service employees cease to be Public Service employees, and become employees of a specified Commonwealth authority. Australian Protective Service employees transferred to the Australian Federal Police will be entitled to remuneration and other conditions of employment no less favourable than those which applied under existing industrial instruments immediately before the transfer. Protective service officers currently carry out functions and exercise powers under a range of other Commonwealth acts. To ensure protective service officers can continue to carry out such functions and exercise such powers, the bill also makes consequential amendments to those acts. The bill also implements the resolution made at the April 2002 leaders summit to legislate and develop administrative arrangements to enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences incidental to multijurisdictional crime. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and Australasian Police Ministers Council Joint Working Group on National Investigative Powers recommended that this resolution be implemented by amending Commonwealth legislation to enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences with a federal aspect. A state offence has a federal aspect if the subject matter of the offence is a subject on which the Australian government has constitutional power to legislate. A state offence also has a federal aspect where the investigation of that state offence is incidental to an investigation of a federal or territory offence. When investigating federal crimes such as terrorism, people-smuggling, drug importation and child sex tourism, it can become apparent that state offences may also have been committed. These measures will allow the Australian Federal Police to investigate the totality of criminal conduct where those state offences have a federal aspect and will address the potential MAIN COMMITTEE duplication of police resources that arises where otherwise the Australian Federal Police and state police services would need to investigate different aspects of the same criminal conduct. The Senate made a number of amendments to the bill. The amendments addressed issues which were raised with the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee during its consideration of the bill. A number of those amendments corrected some minor drafting errors identified in the Bills Digest. The bulk of the amendments were to amendments in schedule 3 of the bill to finetune those amendments to ensure the Australian Federal Police can use all its existing powers to investigate state offences with a federal aspect. The government has also accepted the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its report on this bill. These recommendations were that the bill should be agreed to, that advice be sought on whether there would be any legal obstacles to the conferral of jurisdiction on the AFP Board of Reference to settle disputes over the remuneration and conditions of Australian Protective Service transferees, and that the Australian Federal Police report back to the committee within 12 months on the progress of the integration. After examining this issue, it became clear that the AFP Board of Reference would have no application to Australian Protective Service transferees because the board was provided for under the current AFP certified agreement. However, advice received by the Australian Federal Police following consultation before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has also made it clear that the disputes procedures set out in the Workplace Relations Act will apply in their entirety to Australian Protective Service transferees. The non-government parties made one amendment to the bill in the Senate. The amendment provides that an expression of an ‘honestly held opinion’ by the commissioner or a deputy commissioner does not constitute misbehaviour under the AFP Act ‘if the commissioner or deputy commissioner believes that it is in the public interest to communicate that opinion, whether publicly or privately’. This amendment was opposed by the government because it would create a statutory exemption to the grounds for termination for misbehaviour based on the purely subjective belief of the person expressing the opinion. An exemption such as this could create potentially serious problems, for example, if the commissioner or a deputy commissioner expressed a racist or prejudicial opinion that they honestly held and believed was in the public interest, but would be inappropriate and in some cases unlawful. In such a case, the person might be in breach of state or Commonwealth legislation dealing with racial vilification, and could be prosecuted for an offence under those laws. However, these prosecutions are time consuming, and the ability of the government to dismiss the commissioner or a deputy commissioner for misbehaviour does not depend on whether the misbehaviour has resulted in a conviction. MAIN COMMITTEE The complete integration of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service, and the ability for the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences incidental to multijurisdictional crime, are important steps in the government’s efforts to protect Australians from terrorist attacks and consolidate and enhance national security initiatives. I present the explanatory memorandum. Minister for Trade. The Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 has two aims: firstly, to achieve the legislative integration of the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police and, secondly, as the minister outlined, to enable the AFP to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. The opposition has indicated support for this legislation, both from the point of view of general criminal law enforcement and significantly-and unfortunately in this day and age-in respect of potential terrorist offences. Firstly, we note that the process of the integration of the APS into the AFP began in 2002 when the APS became an operational division of the AFP, as outlined by the minister, and the AFP commissioner replaced the Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department as the head of that agency. The bill will complete the integration process by bringing Protective Service officers under the Australian Federal Police Act and repealing the Australian Protective Service Act. The integration of the AFP and the APS has long had Labor’s support. Indeed, it was part of our commitment prior to the 2001 election. The bill amends the AFP Act to create a new agency of AFP employee protective service officer and to confer the existing functions, powers and duties of the APS on those officers. The Public Service Commissioner will make a determination under section 72 of the Public Service Act that APS officers cease to be Public Service employees and become employees of the AFP. Under that section the transferred employees will be entitled to remuneration and employment conditions no less favourable than they enjoyed before the transfer. We again note, as the minister noted, the valuable work of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. With respect to this matter and a number of other quite controversial and complex pieces of legislation, that committee, in particular in recent years, has done a truly outstanding job on behalf of the parliament overall and ultimately the Australian people. I note that to give effect to the requirement the AFP Commissioner will make determinations under section 24 of the Public Service Act and section 27 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, preserving the remuneration and employment conditions currently in force under the section 170MX award as currently applying to the APS, as the minister outlined. In terms of the Senate committee inquiry to which I have referred, the bill raises fairly complex issues of industrial law. The committee was assisted by evidence from the CPSU, representing APS officers; the Australian Federal Police Association; the Australian Government Solicitor; the Australian Federal Police; and the Attorney-General’s Department. The committee welcomed the fact that employee representatives appear to have been consulted more extensively on the development of this bill than they have been in the past. I think it is fair to say that all sides approached the amalgamation, if you like, of the two bodies from a position of good faith and with a view to preserve continuity of employment conditions. The Senate committee inquiry presented an opportunity for any outstanding concerns to be raised. I will not discuss all of those but will focus on the key issue before the committee, MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Australian Federal Police And Other Legislation Amendment
289,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (10.43 A.m.),"I want to address the issues raised by thewhich was the impact of the bill on the employment, understandably, of those transferring APS officers. As I mentioned, the bill uses the machinery in the Public Service Act and the AFP Act to effect a transfer of the employment conditions currently in force under the section 170MX award under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. The committee recognised the desirability of all AFP staff being employed under an integrated employment framework to provide operational cohesion to the newly integrated agency, and that has to have merit. However, the committee was troubled by the uncertainty faced by APS transferees in the transitional period until a new certified agreement is negotiated to cover the integrated work force. It emerged from evidence given by the CPSU, representing transferring APS officers, that there is still concern on the part of these officers about their capacity to maintain their safety net of remuneration and conditions and to access independent review of AFP decisions that affect employment arrangements during this transition period. There was a strong concern that the AFP would be given a free hand to make unilateral decisions altering the remuneration and conditions and that those affected would not be able to seek review of those decisions by the relevant independent authority, which in the AFP is a board of reference constituted under the Workplace Relations Act. It is not fair to the APS transferees to face such an uncertainty and it is plainly against the national interest for people tasked with such a critical protective security role to experience such a fundamental insecurity in their employment arrangements. On these issues the committee made two relevant recommendations: firstly, that the government clarify that there are no legal obstacles to the conferral of jurisdiction on the board of reference to settle disputes over the remuneration and conditions of APS transferees and, secondly, that in light of these concerns about the employment of APS transferees the AFP report back to the committee within 12 months on the progress of the integration. In response, the Minister for Justice and Customs in the Senate, on the issue of whether there would be any legal obstacle to the conferral of jurisdiction on the board of reference, noted: Upon examination of this issue it became clear that, given the AFP board of reference was provided for under the current AFP certified agreement, it would have no application to APS transferees at the time of transfer. However, advice received by the AFP following consultation before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made it clear that the disputes procedures set out in the Workplace Relations Act will apply in their entirety to APS transferees. I note that, shortly before I rose to speak, the Minister for Trade made a similar point in his speech. We take this-both the quote that I have read out and the minister’s statement in the Main Committee today-to mean that, in the transitional period, APS transferees will retain full access to the Industrial Relations Commission for the full range of disputes that could otherwise be brought before the board of reference if the AFP certified agreement applied to those transferees. I would, however, ask the minister or his representative to clarify in the closing remarks that this is a correct analysis of the situation. I should note that concerns continue to be expressed to us on behalf of APS transferees about the uncertainty of their arrangements in the transitional period. I again make the point that not only is it unfair to these employees to leave them in a state of some anxiety about their future but such a situation inevitably has potential security implications, given the vital counter-terrorism role that Australian Protective Service officers fulfil. They are entitled at the very least to be assured and reassured that the employment security and conditions to which they were previously entitled will continue under the new arrangements. MAIN COMMITTEE Before concluding, I will again record Labor’s support for the second aspect of this bill, which is to enable the AFP to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. This refers to the situation where either the subject matter of the offence is a subject on which the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to legislate or the investigation of the state offence is incidental to the investigation of a federal or territory offence. This measure gives effect to a resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime, as was noted by the minister. It remedies the potential duplication of police resources that presently arises where the AFP and state police services need to investigate different aspects of the same criminal conduct, and it has Labor’s full support. Again, through our support for this legislation in the Main Committee, we will endeavour to expedite its passage. At this point, I will address a point made by the minister in his remarks regarding the government’s acceptance of recommendations suggested by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, supporting amendments that implement those recommendations. I will address the government’s rejection of a minor party amendment affirming the right of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to express an honestly held view. We do so by expressing our disappointment that the government is moving an amendment that will negate or remove that minor party amendment. In so expressing our disappointment, we do, however, recognise that the legislation is otherwise important legislation, and we will not be opposing its passage simply as a result of the government moving its amendment to negate that provision going to the ability of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to express his honestly held view. I will comment on that matter given that it was raised by the minister. I note that Australians will not forget the way in which Commissioner Keelty was harangued and slanderedand I think there are no other words that are appropriate for that-by Howard government ministers simply for expressing an honestly held view about the possible connection between the unfortunate Madrid bombings and the Iraq conflict. The commissioner was certainly entitled to raise in public discussions questions as to what may be a motivation for criminal conduct and indeed to canvass what may be a motivation for terrorist conduct. The public know that the government’s bullying-and again it is not an understatement to use that word-had a devastating effect and led the commissioner to consider his resignation. In circumstances where Commissioner Keelty has truly been a champion on behalf of the Australian public, not only in the fight against organised crime but in particular in the fight against terrorism, that resignation, had it eventuated, would as an outcome have been a major setback for Australia in the fight against terrorism. In seeking to remove the provision that was introduced by an amendment from the Democrats, the government has raised a few eyebrows by expressing concern, as the minister indicated, that the provision might afford protection to racially discriminatory opinions. After all, less than 18 months ago one of the government’s own number, Senator Lightfoot, was found by the Federal Court to have made statements about Indigenous Australians which breached the Racial Discrimination Act. For those wanting to ascertain the facts about that case, I would refer the Main Committee to the judgment of Justice Carr in McGlade v. Lightfoot, which was a decision of the Federal Court issued on 26 November 2002 and which was not appealed. MAIN COMMITTEE At the time, neither the Prime Minister nor the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs showed the slightest concern for Senator Lightfoot’s conduct, which was found to be unlawful. But given the reasons now advanced by the government for opposing these provisions giving freedom of speech, if you like, to the police commissioner-given the minister’s comments that any such racially discriminatory comments by the police commissioner, whomever that may be, would be justification for removal from office-I look forward to Senator Lightfoot’s swift disendorsement by the Liberal Party for his comments. Of course, if the government were genuinely concerned about the Democrat amendment for the reason that they have claimed, it would be a simple matter for them to move a further amendment clarifying that the freedom of speech did not go so far as to endorse or make acceptable comments that were otherwise unlawful. The fact that the government have not done so indicates that they are really only concerned to avoid the embarrassment of having to confront what was unquestionably disgraceful treatment of Commissioner Keelty every time that the parliament is required to consider amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act. We believe the government are wrong to be foreshadowing moving this amendment but again, as I have indicated, in view of the importance of completing the APS-AFP integration and giving the AFP appropriate powers of cross-jurisdictional investigation, we will not be opposing the passage of the bill. have been adequately covered by the Minister for Trade. The Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 is part of the government’s concerted and coordinated campaign against the threat of terrorism and multijurisdictional crime. The bill has two purposes. Firstly, it completes the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police by amending a number of acts and repealing the Australian Protective Service Act 1987. Secondly, it enables the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences with a federal aspect. The Australian Federal Police, the AFP and the Australian Protective Service-the APS-play key roles in keeping Australia safe. They are integral to our ability to fight terrorism, transnational crime and organised crime. Their work in peacekeeping missions in places like the Solomon Islands, East Timor and Cyprus contributes significantly to our regional security. I also acknowledge their work in our external territories. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly recognise and express appreciation for not just the work done by these men and women but also the courtesy and professionalism with which they do it. I believe that, as members of federal parliament, we should be more conscious than most of the efforts of these officers, particularly in our work and travel environments. Although their duties often converge, the AFP and the APS fulfil very different roles. We talk about integrating the two agencies under the one act, but it is important to understand both the different and convergent roles. The APS was established under the Attorney General’s Department by the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 to provide such protective and custodial service for or on behalf of the Commonwealth as the minister directs. More specifically, it supplies protective security services at places like Parliament House, the offices and residences of the Prime Minister and the Governor General, certain foreign embassies and sensitive Defence establishments-all of which are considered key targets for possible terrorist attacks. Very importantly, the APS also MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Australian Federal Police And Other Legislation Amendment
290,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (10.58 A.m.),"I will not speak on the amendments because theyprovides counter-terrorism first response at designated airports around Australia. However, its duties are to guard and protect, not to investigate crime and pursue criminals. The AFP, on the other hand, enforces Commonwealth criminal law and protects our national interests from crime in Australia and overseas. Its priorities are set by ministerial direction and include enforcing laws relating to terrorism, organised and transnational crime, major fraud, illicit drug trafficking and e-crime-electronic crime. However, as well as this criminal work, it also provides some personal protective services. After the September 11 attack, the government reviewed Australia’s security and counter-terrorism arrangements and determined that the APS should be transferred from the Attorney General’s Department to become an operating division of the AFP. Although a distinction is still maintained between traditional policing and investigative functions, on the one hand, and protective services functions, on the other hand, the transfer allows the closest possible coordination between the two agencies. This closer coordination must enhance the effectiveness in fulfilling their counter-terrorism responsibilities. The first stage of the transition occurred on 1 July 2002 when the APS Act was amended to transfer legal and financial responsibility for the APS from the Secretary of the Attorney General’s Department to the AFP commissioner. However, although the legal and financial responsibilities were transferred by this legislation, the two agencies continued to operate under separate legislative and employment arrangements. The functions, powers and duties, as well as the terms and conditions of employment, continued to be set out by a different act for each agency. This bill is the final stage of the transition, transferring the functions, powers, duties and employment terms for APS officers to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. This move is in no way controversial; it has the support of the opposition. Over the last two years, parliament has already passed several pieces of legislation towards the same end, and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee prepared a report on this bill last month recommending that it be agreed to. Schedule1 of the bill contains clauses amending the AFP Act to insert references to the positions of protective service officer and special protective service officer where required and to incorporate into the act, from the APS Act, the existing functions, powers and duties of the protective service officers. Some protective service powers and duties were amended a few months ago when the Australian Protective Service Amendment Act 2003 was passed. But this bill is not amending or extending powers. It is simply transferring them from one act to another. It is transferring existing powers previously individually discussed and passed by this parliament. Sometimes the language may be different, but the substance is not. This bill does, however, add some definitions to the AFP Act for clarity. Some definitions reflect terms or offences already defined under the APS Act. Others, such as the definitions of ‘frisk search’ and ‘ordinary search’, have the same meaning as definitions used in the Crimes Act 1914. This simply provides clarity and uniformity, not change. While schedule 1 of the bill amends the AFP Act to incorporate APS officers, their functions and duties, schedule 2 repeals the APS Act and deals with consequential amendments to 11 other acts. Because Protective Service officers carry out functions under a range of other Commonwealth legislation, these amendments are necessary to ensure the continuation of those existing functions. The powers and duties remain the same, but, when this bill is passed, any reference in other legislation to ‘the APS Act’ must be changed to ‘the AFP Act’. MAIN COMMITTEE The second purpose of this bill is encompassed in schedule 3, which proposes to amend both the AFP Act and the Crimes Act 1914 to enable the AFP to investigate state offences with a federal aspect. These amendments implement a recommendation by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australian Police Ministers Council joint working group-that is, they have been recommended by the states so there is no conflict of interest. They are already reflected in other Commonwealth legislation. The joint working group recommended: The Australian Federal Police (AFP) can best be given the power to investigate state offences incidental to multi-jurisdictional crime by amending the Commonwealth legislation to allow the AFP to utilize Commonwealth investigative powers to investigate State offences with a federal aspect. These amendments will enable the AFP to investigate the totality of the criminal conduct where the state offences have a federal aspect. A federal aspect exists if the subject matter of the offence is a subject on which the Commonwealth has constitutional power to legislate or where the investigation of the state offence is incidental to an investigation of a Commonwealth or territory offence. According to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s report, this proposal has the support of the AFP, state police and the Attorney General’s Department. The Senate committee also supported these amendments. If the AFP have spent considerable time investigating a matter-maybe months-and then find there is a state matter which needs to be dealt with, this amendment enables them to deal with it instead of having to bring in another police force, duplicating work already done in investigating different aspects of the same criminal conduct. It makes sense and allows better management of our law and enforcement resources. This bill is about national security and good management. The fight against potential terrorism and multijurisdictional crime is unrelenting and expensive. We need to organise our resources as effectively as possible. We need coordination and cooperation. We do not need duplication. The amendments to this bill encourage cooperation and coordination, while at the same time discouraging duplication. For instance, bringing the APS under the umbrella of the AFP allows, and indeed encourages, far closer coordination and cooperation between the agencies. Having both agencies report to the same authority also diminishes the likelihood of duplication. Similarly, the schedule 3 amendments encourage cooperation between the AFP and state or territory police forces. Duplication is eliminated by allowing the AFP to deal with certain state matters that might arise during their investigations. This bill is about protecting Australia in the best way we can and about managing our protective resources as effectively as possible. I commend the bill to the House. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (11.09 a.m.)-I rise to speak on the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. This legislation completes the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police. The purpose of this legislation is to enhance the powers of our federal law enforcement agencies to investigate multijurisdictional crime and to enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. The outcome of this legislation, if it is effective, will be better coordination of the activities of our federal law enforcement and protective agencies. That outcome is one we would all hope is achieved to keep our nation secure. The two agencies that are being integrated are the workplaces of approximately 5,000 people. The agencies have had different and overlapping roles and it is important to know that, when they are integrated, the roles will become more defined, better understood and perhaps MAIN COMMITTEE complementary to each other. Perhaps that has been the case, but now we need further assurances. The Australian Protective Service have a major challenge in our new security environment and we expect a great deal more from the protective security services provided here at Parliament House, and for our senior representatives-our Prime Minister and Governor General-as well as at airports used by ordinary Australians every day. There is a need to see a greater presence of protective security services in maritime areas and in ports around Australia as well. In looking at the changed environment and the need to integrate these two agencies, the opposition has been very supportive of this legislation. We do live in a changed global security environment and we are particularly aware of that in Australia. That has occurred since the September 11 tragedy in the United States. Following that terrorist attack, the Commonwealth government reviewed Australia’s security and counter-terrorism arrangements. As a result of that review, as we have heard, the government determined that the Australian Protective Service should transfer from the Attorney-General’s Department and become an operating division of the Australian Federal Police. The stated reason for that should of course be the test for this legislation. That reason was that it would allow the closest possible coordination between two of Australia’s key counter-terrorist agencies. Better coordination between the AFP and the APS, it was proposed, would strengthen both organisations and their ability to fulfil their counter-terrorism responsibilities. There has been a staged process of integration, and many of the members who have spoken already in this debate have outlined that process. The most recent change was in February 2003, when the protection portfolio was established inside the AFP. That is now where we are going to see some major impact with the new involvement of the Protective Service personnel. Since July 2002, joint operations and joint deployments have taken place and they have been experiences that, I hope, have allowed the Australian Federal Police to test that coordination and integration need and therefore make sure the transition process is a meaningful and successful one. The most well known of those was the APS’s involvement as part of Operation Alliance in Bali. I think that is worth revisiting, because the response to the Bali bombings was one of the most significant operations ever undertaken by Australian law enforcement agencies. It was led by the Australian Federal Police. It was a multijurisdictional response by Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement agencies and it was a multinational response as well, which included our agencies working with agencies from as many as 10 countries. So we have had that test. We have to make sure that that response-which I think deserves great praise and acknowledgment as a job well done-is carried on now, not as a response but as a proactive approach that hopefully can prevent such incidents from happening again. There have been other joint operations, which we should remind each other and the public of because there are many unsung heroes in the APS and the Australian Federal Police. For the people of Canberra and the ACT the January 2003 bushfires were a very important example of where the APS and the AFP assisted. Also, the deployment of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands is an ongoing joint operation. It is one that we would hope would reassert and reaffirm Australia’s commitment to its neighbours, not in a paternalistic or custodial way but in a joint partnership. They are major challenges being taken up by all our federal agencies. MAIN COMMITTEE The other major involvement was providing AFP and APS security for the visits of President Bush and President Hu in October last year. The opposition do accept that there is a need to change and to better coordinate our security, protective services and policing. We also assert that getting the balance right between protectionism and freedoms and a Public Service or a Commonwealth sector that works without fear or favour is particularly important. I will visit some of those issues in this speech. But the opposition have supported the legislation although we have taken on several concerns that were reinforced by, and explored very well in, the Senate inquiry. For me, those concerns are training, competencies and the definition of roles. There are internal, administrative and ongoing challenges for management. As an observer I know the standout examples, the big ones that I have just mentioned, but I also know some of the minor areas-I will mention them later in my speech-that I have concerns about. Getting the training, the competencies and the roles defined and making sure we get the best outcomes are concerns that I hold. The other major area of concern has been the industrial area. The concerns of the CPSU were put forward at the Senate inquiry. They were concerned about workers in the Australian Protective Service achieving parity, having defined career paths, having some certainty about potential redundancies and having their entitlements and conditions protected. The APS officers will cease to be Public Service employees; they will become employees of the Australian Federal Police. They need to be assured that when they are transferred all entitlements, remunerations and employment conditions will be no less favourable to them. That has been explored at length by the Senate inquiry. I am sure that the AFP will be mindful of those concerns and the uncertainties that APS personnel face. I hope that they will be aware that those people have served well and need to be given some certainty to motivate them to give their best service to the AFP. The committee noted that the AFP have no intention to make any officer redundant on transfer. Unfortunately, in the industrial environment we always experience that guarantee and it generally lasts for 12 months. We would want to make sure that we did not see change in that area. Very importantly, the committee also recommended that they review the progress of this integration within 12 months and reconvene to examine those concerns that have been raised. They recommended that the report to the committee should include an examination of the commercialisation of the Protective Service function. That has been a particular and major concern. Commercial tendering for services is an established practice by the Australian Protective Service. They have traditionally had a reliance on commercialisation for approximately 70 per cent of their budget. It is important that any tendering processes be separately accounted for-that any commercial transactions and commercial tendering processes be audited in a transparent way and have some independent oversight. It is a concern that I know the Australian Federal Police are very much aware of. It is certainly one that needs to be revisited in a review process. In applying this legislation I think it is important for backbenchers like me to make note of the real-life situations that we come across in our daily lives that affect us as members of parliament and affect the people we represent. Every day at regional airports we see the presence of the Protective Service. In Newcastle AirportI see exemplary and professional approaches every day. MAIN COMMITTEE In the area of maritime security in our ports, I have a particular concern. If we have a new coordinated approach, it has to be a proactive one, and that has to involve communities. It has to involve working with sectors that are affected and are at the front line of security. Port users particularly are one of those sectors, yet I see very little APS or AFP presence in the regional Port of Newcastle. As a matter of fact, in Newcastle we have one Australian Federal Police officer who sits in a Centrelink office looking for fraud, I am told-perhaps by people cheating on their family tax benefits-or overseeing people’s social security entitlements are correct. I am very dissatisfied with that sort of involvement in my own region, a region of half a million people, a region that has a major port that is responsible for over 50 per cent of the economic wealth of the state of New South Wales-a port that also deals with explosives, grains and fertilisers. I particularly think that coordination of a proactive approach is essential, and I would certainly like to see that. We do have a Protective Service presence, but it is limited. Yet we do have a Family Court, we do have 31 Centrelink workplaces in the Hunter region and we do have Customs, Quarantine and AMSA. We also obviously have drug enforcement activities, consideration of illegal fishing activities, Family Court judges, Family Court magistrates and members of parliament and their officers. AndI would have to say, on the public record, that I do not think there is a proactive approach. I would like to see that improved. I would also like to raise other experiences that happen in this House. In Parliament House, as a member of parliament, I am always treated by the Australian Protective Service personnel with professionalism and courtesy. But there have been incidents that have occurred in parliament, in the chamber, that I have some concerns about, so I am raising them to make sure that some response is forthcoming. When we watch people during times of war, we always see division in our communities, and we have seen that. We have seen it in our public gallery. People do have concerns and people are anxious. People are distressed over the decisions sometimes taken by this parliament. We have seen the removal of citizens, and I cite the most recent incident, where a woman was removed from the public gallery. I have concerns that procedures are perhaps not well enough established to be followed instantaneously without unnecessary aggression or undue force. So a person who did rise to express her obvious distress about an issue was instantly removed-touched, physically. I did not see any attempt to engage with that person to calm them, to speak with them, or perhaps to explain to them what the expectation is. The removal from the chamber was, I consider, less than gentle, so much so that personnel did come back to pick up teeth from the floor of the gallery. For the government members who perhaps look at me surprised, the incident was not in their view. It is distressing, and I would like to know that procedures are put into place in this House that mean that security is adhered to, but in a way that is perhaps a best practice model for anywhere in Australia. The other instance-and the member for Hunter, one of my colleagues, has raised this with the Speaker on several occasions-was the bringing into the gallery of a camera during the visit of President Bush. It does seem to us, sitting there, that we rely on the screening. We want the public to be in the galleries, we want them to express themselves, we want them to be part of the process here-it is the public’s house, the people’s house-but we do not want them to ever bring in anything that can cause risk to the people we work with every day. A camera, being a metal object, should not have been allowed into that public gallery, and it MAIN COMMITTEE does pose a risk. I think the members and the staff of this House need a very full explanation of how that was allowed to happen. Finally, I also support the comments of the member for Barton that the amendment put forward in the Senate-by the Democrats-asserting that the freedom of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to make public statements that are founded on the experience and knowledge of the police commissioner should not be fettered or restricted in any way. You would think that it normally would not be necessary to state that. But it was a very regrettable incident when Mick Keelty was publicly harangued and admonished by the Prime Minister. We would like to know that our senior public servants and senior representatives in our federal agencies, particularly in the area of security and policing, do their job without fear or favour, that they do it for the protection of the Australian people and in the best interests of the security of this nation. In conclusion, the opposition does support this legislation. The coordination and integration of these two agencies is essential. It is a case of excellent initiatives being taken by two very different agencies. Without legislation they took the process into their own hands in many ways and moved it forward. The only concern we would have is that the process of integration should be reviewed, as recommended by the Senate inquiry, and that its effectiveness be guaranteed and assured for the Australian people by that review process. port the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. It underlines the government’s commitment to the ongoing upgrade of professionalism and the drive towards efficiency in relation to our law enforcement agencies. At the outset I take the opportunity to offer my congratulations to the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Mick Keelty, for his foresight and for the ability he has brought to the Australian Federal Police in driving reform such as that which is before the House today. The bill before the parliament today came about at least in part because of a review conducted after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States and a general overview undertaken by the federal government in relation to the responses we provided through law enforcement agencies against the evils of terrorism. The bill provides the ability for the Australian Protective Service to enhance not just their skills but their professionalism, the access that they have to intelligence databases, the way in which they respond to any sort of terrorist incident or deal with people committing offences in relation to assets owned by the Commonwealth. The government’s commitment to stamping out terrorism and to providing as much certainty as possible for the Australian people over the coming decades is supported not just by the detail of this bill but by some of the projects that have been undertaken by the Australian Federal Police and law enforcement agencies across this country. I want to take this opportunity to speak about some of those initiatives and about the way in which this government has supported the initiatives of the Australian Federal Police to provide a credible, effective law enforcement response to criminals, to terrorism, to organised crime and to its overall aim of providing a safer community for all Australians to live in. The first example I cite is the Australian Federal Police effort in a joint operation in the Philippines. In April this year we signed a protocol with Philippines law enforcement agencies to launch a $3.65 million project to help build the country’s counter-terrorism capacity. The MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Australian Federal Police And Other Legislation Amendment
291,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (11.26 A.m.),"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to supproject was designed to build the capacity of Philippines law enforcement agencies in intelligence sharing, bomb investigation techniques, forensic capacity and other counter-terrorism areas at both strategic and operational levels. The project underlines the key strategy of the AFP’s Law Enforcement Cooperation Program to strengthen collaboration between Australia’s partners in the Asia-Pacific region and to help develop their counter-terrorism and transnational crime capabilities. This government remain committed to fighting terrorism. We remain committed to supporting the Australian Federal Police in their efforts to counter terrorism throughout the Asia-Pacific region. If we are realistic in our understanding of the way in which terrorist cells operate, we will know that the countries which are our closest neighbours may well be the very places in which these cells decide to operate. It is important that the Australian Federal Police be supported in their ongoing push to try and have an understanding and develop relationships with our closest partners and help them stamp out the evils of terrorism and organised crime as they arise on their own soil. In February this year, the Australian Federal Police International Deployment Group was formed to strengthen Australia’s ability to fight terrorism and transnational organised crime and contribute to regional peacekeeping missions. The IDG will enable the strategic deployment of personnel undertaking peacekeeping operations, restoration of law and order missions and the delivery of capacity-building initiatives in the region. One of the most important aspects of the work of the Australian Federal Police and bodies like the APS and the ACC, and indeed the state law enforcement bodies and many other federal law enforcement bodies, is in relation to drugs and stamping out the evils of drugs as they present themselves in our community. In particular, a focus of this government has been working hard in areas like Dickson with state law enforcement agencies to stamp out drug dealers and people who would prosper from human misery by dealing drugs to children within our local communities. It is a great credit to the Australian Federal Police that in April of this year, following a major investigation, they recorded one of their largest seizures of LSD. Federal agents seized approximately 190 millilitres of suspected liquid LSD and over 212,000 tabs of paper allegedly being prepared for LSD distribution. That had the potential to make almost four million doses of LSD, which would have had a street value of approximately $45 million. Federal agents and Queensland police drug squad detectives arrested five people on the Gold Coast in March after a cooperative investigation prevented what is believed to be the largest ever attempted illegal importation of pseudoephedrine into Australia. The investigation also involved the Australian Customs Service and the Philippines Drug Enforcement Agency and resulted in about 1.5 tonnes of pseudoephedrine being seized in the Philippines, which federal agents will allege was destined for this country. The operation highlights the commitment of the Australian Federal Police to taking the fight against drugs offshore and preventing them from arriving on our own soil. It demonstrates that our law enforcement agencies are working with their international counterparts through the AFP’s overseas liaison officer network, and they are seriously disrupting criminal syndicates. The Federal Police continue to work with Customs. Under the provisions of the Customs Act, the AFP recently arrested and charged two women with importing prohibited imports after 5½ kilos of capsules containing pseudoephedrine were detected in the lining of two suitcases at Cairns international airport. It is important for all Australians, and especially commuMAIN COMMITTEE nities such as the people who live in my electorate of Dickson, to understand that pseudoephedrine, which is a drug which may not mean too much to them, is indeed a precursor to the manufacture of many drugs within this country. It is a precursor to the manufacture of drugs such as amphetamines, which are a major curse on young people within our environment. That and drugs such as heroin and LSD-which is an amphetamine based drug-cause no end of damage to young people in this country. As a government and a people we must continue to fight this scourge, which is one of the greatest problems that our youth of today face. The budget that was delivered recently underscored this government’s commitment to supporting the Australian Federal Police, the old APS and all of these law enforcement bodies in their fight against crime. I was very pleased to see in the government’s budget this year that the Howard government delivered further on its strong response to terrorism by committing an additional $754 million over five years to national security initiatives to protect the Australian community. The budget this year also provided new funding with the commitment of an extra $2.3 billion on national security measures since the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Bali bombings. The Howard government’s budget this year provided over $350 million of additional funding to agencies in the Attorney-General’s portfolio to implement a range of strategic national security measures, which include $127 million to further strengthen the information management and intelligence capacities of ASIO and $36 million to enable the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, to continue to collect, analyse and disseminate financial intelligence to Australia’s law enforcement, revenue and national security agencies. It also included over $6 million to continue the operations of the national security hotline. This year’s budget enhanced regional counter-terrorism capabilities. The government will provide almost $37 million to enhance the offshore response and investigative capacity of the AFP, almost $30 million to establish the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation, a touch over $21 million for the continued presence of the AFP in Melanesia and $10 million to enable AUSTRAC to provide counter-terrorism financing assistance and information technology mentoring to countries in South-East Asia. Importantly, out of this budget the government will provide funds to strengthen the security of our borders by providing $3 million in 200405 to allow the Australian Customs Service, which does tremendous work for this country, to extend the SmartGate trial to a second international airport, for holders of a prototype Australian biometric passport. The government will also provide almost $3 million to enable the Australian Customs Service to board up to 80 per cent of vessels at their first port of arrival in Australia, up from the current rate of 70 per cent. We will provide $3 million to strengthen existing border control measures, and we will provide almost $11 million over two years for the ACS to maintain current rates of container X-ray examination of sea cargo. To further enhance protective security arrangements, the government will provide almost $30 million to the Attorney-General’s Department to implement initiatives with other agencies so as to coordinate a national approach to critical infrastructure protection. The government will also provide almost $20 million for diplomatic guarding and the purchase of armoured vehicles. The government will provide an additional $15.7 million to enhance the air security officer program, and it will consult with the states and territories to establish a shared arrangement to enhance emergency management capabilities. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the most important measures announced in the budget this year by the Howard government was in relation to the National Community Crime Prevention Program. TodayI renew my call to community groups not just within my electorate but right around the country to take note of the National Community Crime Prevention Program and to understand the benefits that it can provide to their local communities-how the program could benefit, for argument’s sake, elderly residents within Dickson by enhancing security in local areas where crime problems exist, and how we could help some of those elderly residents feel more secure within their own homes and within their own local communities and environments. If as a government we are able to provide security enhancements in that way, I think we have gone a long way towards achieving what it is that governments are about in this country. Crime and the fear of crime consistently rate amongst the highest concerns of the Australian public. Crime is estimated to cost the Australian community around $32 billion per year. This budget is providing over $20 million under the National Community Crime Prevention Program, which will focus on how to increase the ability of Australian communities to recognise local crime problems and to pursue effective, locally organised crime prevention initiatives. The centrepiece of the NCCPP is a new community grants program which will provide support to grassroots projects that are designed to enhance community safety and crime prevention at the local level. Under the program, grants will be national and application based, and projects will be classified under the following streams: firstly, a community safety stream, with grants of up to $150,000; secondly, an Indigenous community safety stream, with grants of up to $150,000; and, finally, a community partnership stream, with grants of up to $500,000 to support promising and innovative collaborative community safety and crime prevention demonstration projects in high-need areas. To encourage partnerships across sectors and shared responsibility, the community partnership stream will not fund 100 per cent of project costs, and financial and in-kind contributions would need to be made by other community and government agencies. Grant funding is non-recurrent and is available for projects of up to three years duration. The distribution of funding between these streams is flexible and will be determined during the assessment process, based on the merit of individual applications, eligible organisations and projects, not-for-profit incorporated community based local government organisations, associations or agencies. In commending this bill to the House today, I say once again that this government have demonstrated over the last eight years that we remain committed to providing for a safer community for all Australian people to enjoy and that we, as a government, will continue over the course of the next term, after this year’s election, to provide enhanced services and all sorts of continued and enhanced abilities for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to fight crime and terrorism wherever it is. I say to the people of Dickson today that I remain committed as their member of parliament, representing their interests, and that the government are committed to fighting crime in our local communities. We can do this through supporting good legislation, such as we have before the parliament today. Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, I want to make three principle points. The first is to talk about the role of the AFP, the second is to talk about the role of crime prevention within Australia more generally and the third is to examine the specific provisions within this bill MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Australian Federal Police And Other Legislation Amendment
292,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (11.42 A.m.),"In rising to speak on the Australian Federal Police andwhich assist the AFP and members of the Australian Protective Service to go about their business in a more effective way. In looking at the Australian Federal Police, this country owes an extraordinary debt of gratitude to those men and women. They work in difficult circumstances, they do the difficult jobs, they place themselves at risk and they do so because of a belief in the need to address the threats in our society and the fact that there are external threats. In that situation it is very important to recognise their work. I want to recognise their work externally and internally. In terms of the external work and obligations of the Australian Federal Police we see, perhaps most cogently and potently within the Australian mind, their work following the tragedy in Bali on 12 October 2002. That act of mass murder has seen an amazing amount of successful police work and investigation. It was by no means a given that the perpetrators would be found; it was by no means a given that, even if the perpetrators were found, they would be brought to justice quickly; and it was by no means a given that the results of the court cases would be such as they have been. On all those fronts the AFP established a cooperative arrangement with the Indonesian authorities. That is something which was unprecedented in its scope and reach, and which led to much more effective policing both within Australia’s reach and within Indonesia itself. This was an extraordinary outcome in cooperation and a great response to what was a horrendous and vile act of mass murder. I only hope that any of those who are still at large will be brought to justice through this system. In addition to that, looking at the external work of the AFP, we see in the work which they have been doing in the Solomon Islands an extraordinary role in effectively taking a lead on the ground from the Australian military in helping to bring peace, order and, ultimately, a stronger governance arrangement to the people of the Solomon Islands. It is a difficult task and, as you would see from other interventions around the world, it is often fraught with tragic consequences. But these are consequences which have not eventuated on the Solomon Islands. That is a tribute to the civilian personnel, the military personnel and, in particular, the Australian Federal Police and all those associated with the planning and conduct of Operation Helpem Fren. That is one example of the sort of peace and security work with which the Australian Federal Police have been involved. If you turn to the internal work of the AFP, you find that the priorities of the Australian Federal Police are sixfold-to deal with (1) organised crime, (2) transnational crime, (3) money laundering, (4) major fraud, (5) illicit drug trafficking and (6) electronic crime, an emerging area of crime which is effectively borderless. On all those fronts you see a body which is dealing with difficult and challenging tasks but which is making extraordinary steps forward. The work on drug trafficking has been carried out under the Australian government’s Tough on Drugs strategy, and it has had an impact on the interception of and amount of heavy drugs being brought into the country. There is a significant amount more to do-make no mistake about that-but the work of the AFP has been critical in having a major impact on the importers and distributors of the worse and most potent drugs in our community. That brings me to the second part of this speech, which is about the actions this government is taking in relation to major crime within Australia. There is of course the Tough on Drugs strategy, as was mentioned by and is strongly supported by my friend and predecessor the member for Dickson. One thing that I particularly want to focus on is the National ComMAIN COMMITTEE munity Crime Prevention Program. This is a program devised and produced by the Prime Minister’s office, with the hand of the Prime Minister very strongly at the tiller. In essence, there are three elements. Firstly, there is the community safety program, which will include grants of up to $150,000. They will be available for community groups, under a competitive tendering system, who can pitch to try to have an impact within their own community on community safety and community security. In particular, I think of my own communities of Somerville and Hastings within the electorate of Flinders-two towns where there is a crime problem. I will be launching this program soon in these towns. I strongly urge local community representatives to participate in it and to seek to benefit from it for the building of community programs. Secondly, there is the Indigenous program and, thirdly, there are the large scale community partnerships of up to half-a-million dollars. The National Community Crime Prevention Program is an important step forwards. It gives Australian communities the chance to work in cooperation with police and to work in cooperation with the broader community to have an impact on local security. The third thing I wanted to do was to mention very briefly the essence of this bill. This bill contains amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes Act 1914. Essentially, it completes the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police. The men and women of the Australian Protective Service play an important role in ensuring that some of those who may be high-priority targets for criminals, terrorists or political activists are offered protection. Through my former life I have seen their work close up in action, and I know that the men and women of the Australian Protective Service put themselves at risk. They do so because of a set of beliefs about what we are as a country and beliefs about what is an ethical way to live. I commend them on their work and their efforts. In that situation, the bill creates a new category of employee in the Australian Federal Police-that is, a protective services officer. It designates protective service functions as functions of the Australian Federal Police. It represents a part of the consolidation of the policing and security actions within the Australian federal system which is a corollary of the fact that policing and security are now inseparable and that some of the questions facing Australia in terms of its long-term security can only be dealt with by cooperative work between ASIO, ASIS and the AFP-the greater the consolidation and the greater the cooperation, the better. In those circumstances, bringing the protective service functions under the AFP is a very important step forward. All up, I thank the men and women of the Australian Federal Police for their work in Bali, for their work in the Solomons, for their work overseas, particularly for their work within Australia in relation to major crime, and also now for their work in relation to protective services. I commend the bill to the House, and I urge its speedy passage. Flinders and support his remarks about the Australian Federal Police. His knowledge of these matters is greater than mine. I do commend his remarks in terms of the activities of the Australian Federal Police in regard to the Bali bombings and their excellent cooperation with the Indonesians. As I understand it, that was a very successful cooperative venture between both those police forces. Likewise, I support his comments on the activities of the Australian Federal Police in the Solomon Islands and on the internal policing activities of the Australian Federal Police. Also, I commend the member for Dickson for his comments and obvious understanding of these matters, which is due to his professional background in this area. The MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Australian Federal Police And Other Legislation Amendment
293,Mr Mcarthur (Corangamite) (11.51 A.m.),"I commend my colleague the member forAustralian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 will provide greater security for the personnel of the AFP and the Australian Protective Service in their activities with regard to counter-terrorism and drug trafficking. The member for Dickson has a background in this area. I think he provides probably the best knowledge in this parliament, and his contribution was very worthwhile. My own interest in this bill is from my membership of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I have had an ongoing interest in matters of national security. Obviously, this bill and its policy thrust provide an arm for the government of the day to provide security, particularly at airports-which most members of parliament fully understandaround this parliamentary precinct and in the electorate at large. I have a particular interest in national firearms legislation and its possibilities. We should develop a national program that identifies firearms, their location and the owners of those particular firearms. Whilst that is a debate for another day, this legislation is a forerunner of the government’s general thrust-and, I think, of those members of the opposition-that the Commonwealth is now in a position to take the lead in this whole area of security and firearms legislation. The Howard government took the lead in the firearm buyback in 1996. In my judgment, further progress could be made to ensure that the legal owners of firearms are identified and that they fully understand the law. If we had national legislation, we would be in a better position to deal with those persons in the Australian community who have illegal firearms. This legislation also brings to the fore the difficulty that the Australian Federal Police have in dealing with the state police and state jurisdictions. All of us in this parliament would be aware of the difficulty in the fact that state police forces are run and paid for by state governments and are under their control. In recent times we have seen, particularly in Victoria, some considerable debate about the effectiveness or otherwise of state police forces. That leads on to the difficulty that the Australian Federal Police have with cooperation in handling certain crime matters, and it leads to problems of national security. We do have an interesting fundamental debate before us today. Although this legislation is of a somewhat technical nature, it does indicate that the government and the opposition, supporting this, are moving towards a situation where the Australian Federal Police become the key element in protecting national security-that they provide the wherewithal to investigate crimes including, as other speakers have talked about, drugs crimes which lead to the quite difficult issue of the development of organised crime; so that the Australian Federal Police have that role at the national level as they integrate with the state jurisdiction. This bill, whilst it is of a technical nature, does incorporate the thrust that the Australian Federal Police have a role, the Australian Protective Service have a role and, if they could be combined as the bill is suggesting, the integration of these two services will strengthen the ability of both these groups to provide security in this new and modern age. This change in the security and counter-terrorism argument is now upon us. This parliament and the Australian people, although they are somewhat isolated from the rest of the world, are now in the 21st century of terrorism and counter-terrorism. The government needs to ensure that the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service are well equipped to provide a service activity that will protect Australians, buildings and airports. MAIN COMMITTEE In terms of the details of the bill, this is the final stage of integrating the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police. It unifies both organisations under the same employment framework, reduces doubling-up, streamlines both organisations for greater efficiency, forms an important part of the government’s coordinated approach to reducing red tape in the public sector and strengthens our approach to tackling terrorism. The other significant component of the bill will bring about an important resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime-those matters that I have been referring to. It will enable the Federal Police including the Protective Service to tackle crimes in the states that have a federal aspect. Again, I mentioned that in my earlier remarks. It enables the Federal Police, when investigating a Commonwealth crime, where it becomes apparent that state offences have also been committed, to investigate the crime in its entirety. Many of us in this parliament have come across the difficulty that, because of the jurisdictional problem, there have sometimes been jealousies between the Federal Police and state police forces. The background to this is that the Australian Protective Service was established by the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 and is the Commonwealth’s most senior provider of protective security services. It covers security of persons and places where the Commonwealth has a security responsibility. The aviation industry is illustrative of an environment where we see the APS at work. As I mentioned, most members of the parliament see that activity at the airports around Australia. The Australian Protective Service provides first response security at airports, diplomatic and consular premises, Defence establishments and other Commonwealth buildings. While the Australian Protective Service has a primary responsibility for these activities, they also come within the jurisdiction of the Australian Federal Police. It is important to identify similarities between these two functions. The need to integrate the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police has come about in a government strategy to protect all Australians in light of the heightened terrorist activity in other parts of the world, such as the recent railway bomb blasts in Madrid and previous attacks on Australia’s allied nations. All of us are aware of that attack in Madrid. Whilst the intelligence was reasonable, that attack showed what horrendous possibilities there are to bring about major carnage and damage on civilian installations. In response to heightened threats to Australia’s security, the bill completes the final stages of merging the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police. The bill will ultimately strengthen the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service as one unified outfit to deal with the war against terror. AndI think we would all be very supportive of that. Following the Cornall review in 2001, the government determined that the Australian Protective Service should move from the Attorney-General’s Department to the Australian Federal Police. In turn, this has implications for the employment framework of the Australian Protective Service and its needs, which are addressed by this bill. The Australian Protective Service employees are part of the Public Service. The final stage of the integration with the AFP involves the creation of a new category of employee, which will be known as protective service officer. This will be included in the Australian Federal Police Act. The protective service functions of a protective service officer will fold into the functions of the Australian Federal Police. I have no doubt that there will be some difficulty on the ground but, hopefully, there will be an air of cooperation between those two groups. MAIN COMMITTEE The benefits of one employment framework will include a streamlined employment function containing greater efficiency for employees and the unified approach to the functions of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Services. Given that the Australian Protective Service will integrate into the Australian Federal Police and the powers under the Australian Federal Police Act, the Australian Protective Service Act will be repealed. The current remuneration and other employment conditions before transfer will continue to stand as they were under the previous legislation. The bill also implements a resolution of the April 2002 leaders summit. The leaders agreed to develop key legislative steps towards administrative arrangements that would enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences that contain a federal aspect. Again, I mentioned that in my earlier remarks and I think that is a very good step in the right direction. These matters would include a matter that is incidental to the investigation of a federal or territory offence, such as espionage, sabotage or threats to national security. Relevant in light of the heightened security to Australia is the fact that the important change and ongoing policing activity by this new group allows the Federal Police to investigate crimes in the states that have a federal aspect so that they may be investigated in their totality without having to brief or hand over to other authorities midway through a serious investigation. Again, I think all members would be aware of the difficulties that have been faced by state and federal jurisdictions when the investigation of serious crimes has been held up because of this jurisdictional difficulty and because of the jealousies of certain police forces. Hopefully, there is a movement to greater philosophic understanding that we need to handle terrorism on a national level and that the parochialism of state police forces needs to be channelled into a national asset. The amendments in the bill are replications of the provisions that stand in the Australian Protective Service Act and relate to the functions and powers of the APS and its officers. The thrust of these provisions remains as it was in the APS Act. Most of the other provisions in schedule 1amend the Australian Federal Police Act to further detail the definition and give practical effect to the merger of the APS and the AFP. I leave it at that and say that I think all speakers have agreed that the bill is not overly contentious. It brings into effect the government’s initiative to respond to the heightened terrorist and sophisticated criminal activity in Australia by merging and consolidating the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police so that both groups will have the same conditions and so ensure that there is now a robust and more efficient outfit to handle the extent of this. At the philosophic level, hopefully this merger will provide a national thrust and ensure that, when we come to handle terrorism and some of the newer threats that police forces and protective services have not encountered before, there will be a new approach-a newer philosophic view-and, generally, a cooperative approach by both sides of this parliament, by the state and federal authorities and by those hard-working protective officers who have to do the hard work in maintaining surveillance of these installations hour by hour, day by day, month by month. I think this bill can be a reflection of this parliament that we support them, we understand the good work they do and we hope that they do not have to run into any major difficulty. But, given the evidence, it would be anticipated that some incident would happeneither great or small. Of course, it would be our hope that no great incident would happen here in Australia, but this is a step in the right direction to minimise the damage and ensure MAIN COMMITTEE that those persons who wish to indulge in terrorism will be brought to account by this new organisation. I commend the bill. stration) (12.05 p.m.)-I would initially like to thank the Minister for Trade, who introduced the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 on my behalf, given the fact that I had legislative commitments in the main chamber a little earlier this morning. I would also like to thank all honourable members who have spoken in this debate for their support in principle of this legislation, which is very important legislation with respect to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service. I commend the member for Corangamite, who, as always, delivered a very thought-provoking and erudite speech. anyone could ever accuse the member for Corangamite of being other than someone who researches very carefully every bill on which he speaks. I have to say that in the time he has been in the chamber, since about 1983-over 20 years-he has performed outstanding service for the constituents of the electorate of Corangamite. Corangamite is situated in the Geelong area. The people residing in Corangamite have been singularly fortunate that over so many years they have had the opportunity of choosing the member for Corangamite to be their representative in this place. His speech on the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 verifies the great wisdom of the constituents of Corangamite since 1983 in returning the member for Corangamite as their elected member in the House of Representatives. I would also like to commend the member for Barton, the member for Newcastle, the member for Fairfax, the member for Dickson and the member for Flinders on their contributions to this bill. The amendments in the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 represent the final step in a process that began after the terrorist attacks in 2001 when the whole world changed-nothing will ever be the same again-that is, the integration of the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police. As the member for Corangamite indicated in his speech, they also implement an important resolution of the April 2002 leaders summit to allow the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences incidental to multijurisdictional crime. While many people believe that the federal system of government is the very best system we could have in Australia, I often think that there are incredible levels of duplication and overlapping. When the leaders summit is prepared to come to such a sensible proposal as is included in this bill, I think that tends to reaffirm one’s belief in the way that our federation continues to work. The integration of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service is one part of a much broader government approach to maximising the effectiveness of Commonwealth counter-terrorism and transnational crime resources. The two-stage approach used to complete the integration of these very important organisations has allowed the Australian Protective Service to continue to deliver without disruption the range of services for which it is funded and contracted. It has also allowed for detailed consideration of relevant workplace relations, commercial, financial and organisational issues.

296,Mr Slipper,"He always delivers a thought-provoking and erudite speech. I do not thinkpleased to know that there has been full consultation and negotiation with the employees of both organisations about the integration. The integration is a win-win for both organisations and the Australian public generally. It will allow the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to ensure the closest possible cooperation between Protective Service officers and police officers when conducting joint operations and providing protective security services. The amendments in the bill that implement the resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime will allow the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences with a federal aspect, using the full range of powers in the Crimes Act. Honourable members will be pleased to know that the government has moved swiftly to include these amendments in this bill. We will have a consideration in detail stage with respect to a government amendment, and I will speak on that amendment later. The nongovernment parties made one amendment to the bill in the Senate, and that amendment would permit the commissioner or a deputy commissioner to express an opinion, including a racist or prejudicial opinion, that they honestly held and believed was in the public interest but that was totally inappropriate. The government opposed that particular amendment, which of course will be of no real surprise to anyone. In his speech the member for Barton expressed a concern about APS transferees’ conditions of service and access to the board of reference in the transitional period. He also queried whether the APS officers will have access to the Industrial Relations Commission. I am very pleased to reassure the honourable member for Barton that the APS officers transferred to the AFP will have access to the dispute resolution provisions of the Workplace Relations Act and to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission where there are any concerns about their remuneration and conditions of service. Members of parliament in this place often talk about issues relating to their own electorates. The member for Newcastle expressed her concern about the Australian Federal Police presence in Newcastle. She mentioned that there was only one officer, located in Centrelink. She also expressed some concerns in relation to the port. I am pleased to advise the member for Newcastle, who is no longer in the chamber, that the government has introduced new maritime security legislation which provides additional powers to a variety of agencies to secure Australian ports. Important work has been done to use these powers to improve security. The AFP, including Protective Service officers, will play an important role. The Australian Federal Police resources in Newcastle, as in other centres, are kept under constant review to ensure that threats and criminal activity are addressed. I am very pleased that the member for Newcastle will no doubt be greatly reassured by the remarks I have made in response to her contribution to this debate. In summary, the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 consolidates and enhances Australia’s national security framework. It represents a milestone in the efforts of the government towards protecting all Australians from terrorist attacks and honouring our obligation under international law to protect foreign diplomatic and consular officials and their premises. On that basis, I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. MAIN COMMITTEE Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. stration) (12.13 p.m.)-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 and move government amendment (1) as circulated: (1) Schedule 1, item 27A, page 24 (lines 12 to 19), omit the item. As I indicated in my summing up speech, the non-government parties made one amendment to the bill in the Senate. This amendment would insert a new subsection 22(1)(a) into the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. Section 22(1) of the AFP Act provides for the termination of appointment of the commissioner or a deputy commissioner for misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. The amendment was inserted to clarify that an expression of an honestly held opinion by the commissioner or a deputy commissioner does not constitute misbehaviour for the purposes of section 22(1) if the commissioner or deputy commissioner believes that it is in the public interest to communicate that opinion, whether publicly or privately. However, the government does not support this amendment, because it would create a statutory exemption to the grounds for termination for misbehaviour based on the purely subjective belief of the person expressing the opinion. The government amendment will omit this item from the bill. High standards are expected of people who hold public office. An exemption such as this could create potentially serious problems if the commissioner or a deputy commissioner expressed an opinion which he or she honestly held and believed was in the public interest but which was totally inappropriate. This could include, for example, expressing an honestly held belief that was racist or showed prejudice. The meaning of ‘misbehaviour’ in provisions dealing with the termination of public officials should not be limited in this way. Indeed, other Commonwealth termination-of-appointment provisions do not define or qualify misbehaviour. Mere expression of an opinion would not amount to misbehaviour; it would require morefor example, the commission of an offence by making disclosures that are prohibited by law or the breach of binding standards of conduct. There is no point in permitting something that is not prohibited in the first place. On that basis, I commend the government amendment to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

298,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (12.16 P.m.),"I rise to demand that the Howard government, intorian motorists even angrier with the federal government’s stalling over funding the Calder Highway. In November 2001, when Treasurer Costello falsely promised Bendigo that it would match state funding for the Calder, Bendigo district motorists paid 84.9c a litre for petrol. They paid 45.82c of this in excise and GST. It cost them around $50.94 to fill a 60-litre tank. They paid $27.49 of this to the Commonwealth in taxes. At that time, they paid around $16.15 in taxes and CityLink tolls for a return trip to Melbourne. In May 2004, central Victorian motorists are paying 105.9c a litre at many district outlets. Of this, they pay 47.64c to the federal government in taxes. Today they are paying $63.54 to fill up their tanks-$12.60 more than when Treasurer Costello made his phoney promise. Of this they are paying $28.58 in taxes-$1.09 more than in November 2001. They are now paying around $16.98 in taxes and tolls for a return trip on the same treacherously unfinished road to Melbourne. They have got nothing new on the Calder for their taxes since Mr Costello’s pre-election con job of November 2001. The Bendigo electorate pays around $90 million a year in fuel taxes plus GST and, since the November 2001 election, has paid over $200 million in such taxes. This is more than the amount needed to finish the Calder. Where has it gone? The Howard government has stopped all new funding for the Calder, sabotaged the 2006 completion date promised by the Liberals in that election, and has added millions to the cost of the remaining work. The only work now being done on the Calder is by the Bracks government. Bendigo remains the only major regional centre in Victoria where motorists are taxed on an unfinished road and pay a CityLink entry tax plus GST to get into Melbourne. The Calder is a road potholed with Liberal lies and coalition cop-outs. The Liberal Party promised in 1996 to duplicate the highway. Instead it has duplicated the taxes on the Calder. Treasurer Costello assured Bendigo in November 2001 that the Calder had a ‘much higher priority’ with the government than the Scoresby Freeway, but a fortnight ago he openly listed Scoresby as their top priority. This is the forked tongue of Mr Costello that really infuriates Calder motorists. He said on 12 May: What the Commonwealth does is that it enters into agreements with State Governments for the most important roads in order of priority and … the order of priority is the Scoresby Freeway and then after we do the Scoresby Freeway we move on to the next one. In reality, it had an agreement with the state from 1997-four years before it signed up Scoresby in 2001 as a RONI-to fund the Calder. Since then Mr Costello has ratted on the Calder. The Scoresby is a ‘RONI-come-lately’ compared to the Calder. There is every chance he will dud the Calder yet again in the 7 June AusLink statement by withholding the $193 million he owes us to finish it. He will leave it as a goat track from Bendigo to Kyneton. The Treasurer is a master at pork-barrelling on the Scoresby and a master of pork pies on the Calder. The Treasurer took over six years to deliver his 1996 election promise to provide $2 million for the Bendigo arts facilities, and it is almost three years since he promised to match the state funding for the Calder. Is it any wonder that opinion polls are showing that the Treasurer is extremely unpopular with Australian voters? I refer to yet another Calder pork pie-namely, a recent claim in Bendigo by Senator Ian Campbell that Treasurer Costello had commissioned him as the new roads minister to get ‘that bloody Calder’ fixed. Senator Campbell was Mr Costello’s parliamentary secretary for four MAIN COMMITTEE years. He was the minute taker to the coalition ministers who deserted the Calder at Kyneton. On the day Senator Campbell was appointed Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads-7 October last year-Minister Anderson, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, openly admitted Calder funding was completed. Then, just before Senator Campbell visited Bendigo, Mr Anderson mangled the coalition’s Calder RONI pledge to duplicate all the road from Melbourne to Bendigo so that it only covered fixing up the worse sections. Why then won’t he fix the Kyneton to Ravenswood section? Senator Campbell has not fixed Mr Costello’s ‘bloody Calder’. The main problem with the ‘bloody Calder’ is Mr Costello himself. He is only interested in stalling the Calder and playing smart alec games with the Scoresby. Kokoda Track each ANZAC Day has its own differing memories and brings many friendships and stories. It is a day that forms most of my focus as chair of the government defence and veterans affairs committee. The services held throughout Gilmore-always too numerous for me to attend them all-help to make clear the sacrifices and the debt we owe to those who preceded us. Such thoughts evoke memories of tales that inspire and motivate many, so much so that the experience undergoes an almost spiritual transformation and many are compelled to make the journey of the pilgrim. For Australians, it is either Gallipoli or the Kokoda Track. When they have made that journey, the pilgrim gains a greater sense of understanding of the legend of ANZAC and a personal enlightenment. RecentlyI was privileged to share one such experience. Kevin Camm is a Vietnam veteran. He is also head of the Scout movement in the Shoalhaven. Kevin could be described as a patriot, and this is reflected in a diary on his Kokoda trek, which he left with me recently. Reading it, you can feel the spirit of Kokoda coursing through his veins. The diary was complemented by photographs, so I managed to get a bit of a feel of what it must have been like. I could not feel the intense humidity, the flies or the strain on the chest walking up those terrible slopes, but I could begin to understand what he was feeling. There was one photo with a caption that reads, ‘Absolutely exhausted near the top of Maguli Range’, and the expression on his face told the story-there was no need for a caption, except to say where it was. The photo of the camp site showed tents pitched on a slope in a cleared area surrounded by the gloom of the dark jungle. Later on, there is a photograph of three very old mennatives-sitting on the ground with their walking sticks, their hair grey, their faces wizened and their appearance frail. They were three of the original fuzzy wuzzy angels. Kevin wrote in his diary: Reg was talking to an elderly native resident. He turned out to be an original fuzzy wuzzy angel, Faure Bokoi by name. He took us back to the back of the village where he introduced two more fuzzy wuzzy angels, Guia Karea and Sori Io. Guia was crippled in his left leg and could not walk. Mind you, they had to be in their 90’s. He only had a bush crutch to support him. A fellow native came out of a nearby house and started sounding off in Pidgin and then in perfect English. He was not happy about trekkers taking photo’s of the “Angels” and asking them about their war experiences. I took him aside, informed him that we were Australian and that we did not have to ask them about their war experiences-we knew! All we wanted to do was shake their hands and thank them for looking after our diggers during the War. MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Adjournment
299,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.20 P.m.),"Once again, ANZAC Day has come and gone. To me,He did not realise this and then apologised. We talked on how we could help the angels. We paid 5 Kina (about $2.50 Australian) each to photograph them. At least that gave them some money. I promised that when I got back to Port Moresby or home I would do everything I could to get crutches and a wheelchair for Guia. That is what the spirit of ANZAC is all about. It is about obligation and duty; it is about gratitude and paying our dues. Kevin Camm felt that and he is going to do something about it, and he would like us to do something about paying our dues as well. Over time, I know much has been written and said about these native bearers who helped so many of our diggers, and I am adding my name to the already long list. AlthoughI have not personally trekked Kokoda, I do have a sense of what it must be like for those who do and what they feel. Kevin, in his covering letter said to me: Jo, what is Australia’s position with these “fuzzy wuzzies”? Do we know how many are left? Is anything being done to help these guys? Is there any program to support them? Wouldn’t it be great if we could make their final years comfortable and afford them the recognition that they richly deserve? I know that there has been some recognition of these people and I know how difficult it must be to identify precisely who they are so they can get some of the dues owing to them. SapperH ‘Bert’ Beros NX 6925, 7th Division, Royal Australian Engineers, AIF, wrote a poem celebrating the contribution of these native people. I would like to quote a single stanza: Slow and careful in bad places on the awful mountain track And the look upon their faces makes us think that Christ was black. Not a move to hurt the carried as they treat him like a saint It’s a picture worth recording that an artist’s yet to paint. Many a lad will see his mother and the husbands, weans and wives Just because the Fuzzy Wuzzy carried them to save their lives. I would very much like to support Kevin Camm’s wish, and it is the wish of numerous Australians whose lives have been touched by these kindly, simple peoples. For this is not just about them but also about us and how we see ourselves, both morally and spiritually, as a nation. Dickson Electorate: Red Shield Appeal Shield appeal which was conducted on 22 and 23 May-only last weekend. I want to say to the House that, over the last three years, I have worked hard with many of the 750 community groups in Pine Rivers and it has been a great pleasure to again work this year with Captain Andrew McKeown, who is the Pine Rivers area director. My role as the area chairman for Pine Rivers was made all the easier because of Andrew’s involvement.

The services that the Salvation Army and people like Andrew McKeown provide in our local community of Pine Rivers should never, ever be underestimated. I am very pleased to acknowledge that in Pine Rivers area this year we had a 25 per cent increase on last year’s result. In total, we raised $24,173, with still some moneys to come in. Albany Creek raised $5,889.20, which was an increase of 68 per cent from 2003. In the Arana Hills district, we raised $4,050.05, which was an increase from 2003. There was also an increase at Kallangur, which raised $7,001. At Strathpine, we raised $7,232.75, which is an incredible increase of 47 per cent from 2003. In the local shopping centres, we collected $6,408. I want to thank the managements of those local shopping centres, including at areas like Strathpine and Kallangur, who did a tremendous amount to support the local army officers who went there to collect money for such a great cause. The local schoolchildren at Ferny Grove State School held a free-dress day for the first time this year, and they raised $600. I want to make special mention of the involvement in and commitment to the Red Shield appeal of those schoolchildren and their parents, teachers and principal, because their assistance was invaluable. One of the aims for next year for the Pine Rivers area will be to have many more schools involved. It is the first year that we have had primary school involvement and a free-dress day, and the results are obviously incredible. I want to give particular thanks to the 76 teams, which included over 267 collectors, made up of local people who wanted to support a good cause, local community groups like Apex, Lions, Rotary, Rotaract and other local community groups, as well as students from secondary schools, including a considerable number of students from Northside Christian College and Genesis Christian College who provided great support. I also want to make mention in the parliament today of the zone chairmen. I acknowledge Councillor Mike Charlton from Albany Creek, who again provided tremendous support this year. I also want to acknowledge Andrew Patterson, who was very involved in the local community in Arana Hills. He is a person who puts a countless number of hours into community projects, and his involvement again this year is greatly appreciated in the Arana Hills zone. I also want to make mention of Councillor David Dwyer, who was responsible for the Kallangur area, and Councillor Brian Gelvin, who was responsible for Strathpine. I also acknowledge his wife, Lynne, who provides a great deal of support to Brian in so many areas of his life. Finally, I acknowledge Councillor Graeme Ashworth for his support and, in particular, for his coordination of maps and whatnot on the day. It provided a very professional touch again this year to the Red Shield appeal in Pine Rivers, and the support that he provided by putting together and collating those maps was of great assistance to all of the collectors and to the committee overall. I also wish to make particular mention today in the parliament of the directors: Barry and Pam Nancarrow from Albany Creek, Envoy Lindley Fabre from Arana Hills, Major Ken and Mrs Ella Beer from Kallangur, Major Terry Smith and Major Alan Peterson from Strathpine who did an incredible amount of work again this year. People like Ken Beer, Andrew McKeown and all of those that assisted in this year’s Red Shield appeal need to be thanked 1,000 times over. I look forward to working with them and having their support next year, and I congratulate everybody involved in this year’s process. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Lyons Electorate: Transit of Venus small town in the middle of Tasmania, in my electorate of Lyons, that is commemorating a special event. Campbell Town, Tasmania, was the host, more than 100 years ago, of an interesting historical astronomical event, when Venus crossed the face of the sun on 9 December 1874. It will doing it again on 8 June this year, and again in eight years time, and then not again for another 100 years. The story becomes interesting when one considers that it was a period of intense exploration and, at that time, the timing and position of Venus as it moved across the sun was linked to one of the great unsolved problems in the history of astronomy-the accurate determination of the distance of the sun from the earth, and thus the scale of the solar system. Accurate time and position were well-known specialties of the American Naval Observatory, and, when in 1874 and 1882 many nations of the world dispatched expeditions to observe the transits of Venus, the Naval Observatory naturally became deeply involved in leading the observations in the name of American science. Hobart was one of the suggested sites, along with eight or nine others in the southern oceans. Because there was extreme difficulty in landing a party at the Crozet Islands, which had originally been chosen, two teams from the United States arrived in Tasmania. The rest of the story is a typically Tasmanian one. One of the eminent doctors of the time-who hapliam Valentine happened to be in Hobart when the US teams arrived on their ship, and he convinced them to take the equipment from the aborted attempt on the Crozets and set it up in his backyard in Campbell Town, 100 miles further north. According to the Australian today, for the next two months an early form of space station was built on the land next to Dr Valentine’s property, the Grange, at Campbell Town. In fact, two of the observation site pillars are still being used as gateposts. Dr Valentine’s house is still very much in existence and is being used as very upmarket tourist accommodation. What the Australian did not say is that the Americans had a great time for two months because the local people were thrilled to have such important visitors. I understand they went hunting, were fed banquets and were thoroughly entertained with all the resources that could be mustered in the town. Now Campbell Town is going to do it again. The local people, led by a number of local historians including Geoff Duncombe, assisted by the Northern Midlands Council under the guidance of Mayor Kim Polley, have gone out hunting for relics from that sighting and have been setting up the site for the 8 June 2004 sighting. The last sighting commenced with a huge storm and there were many funny dialogues between some of the scientists trying to get a good look while others, such as Dr Valentine, were getting underfoot. However, the skies cleared and 125 images were captured for research. This time, it being almost midwinter, there may be similar problems, but Tasmania does have some amazingly clear winter days and nights, so we may be lucky in achieving the re-enactment. This is the centrepiece, but there are lots of activities planned around the day, including historical walks-and we have just opened a ‘convict walk’ there, which I did recently-talks and viewing stations for the public to watch the transit of the planet from 3 p.m. to dusk. So, if you are planning a trip to Tasmania, you could be part of making history again. We are hopMAIN COMMITTEE",158,Adjournment

(Time expired) Australian Labor Party: Taxation Policies federal electorate of Parkes, which also encompasses the state seat of Murray-Darling, the Labor Party seems to be finding it hard to relate events and figures as they occur rather than as Labor in the region wants to portray them. It is no coincidence that we have a federal election due and that, certainly in my region, Labor is back to its old tricks of misinformation and scaremongering. I do not know what the Labor Party is providing to its candidates or even its members by way of information, but it is not the facts if the antics of the Labor Party in my electorate are any guide. On ABC Far West radio on 17 May 2004 the Labor candidate for the seat of Parkes, when talking about a federal payroll tax, said: ... this is the first that I’ve heard of it-first that anybody down at our national secretariat’s heard of it and it’s not in our policy anywhere. We all know from Labor’s own publicly released policy, A Better Way of Life for Working Families, that that statement is false. In Labor’s policy it states that under Labor’s approach there would be a national insurance system for employee entitlements. All employers would be expected to contribute 0.1 per cent of payroll. That is a payroll tax announced in Labor’s own policy. Perhaps the Labor candidate in Parkes simply does not know his own party’s platform, or perhaps he just does not care. Whatever the case, there again is a total misrepresentation of the facts-saying one thing in private and another in public. But it gets worse when we have a Labor member of state parliament doing the same within his own branch in Broken Hill. Peter Black, the well-known-I might say infamous-member for Murray-Darling, gave to his local branch in Broken Hill what was reported in the Barrier Daily Truth of 20 May 2004 as probably one of the most disgraceful performances of his chequered career. According to a report by the Labor Party printed in the local paper, Mr Black motivated his party for action by blaming all of New South Wales’s problems-certainly those of the New South Wales government-on our federal government. He is entitled to his opinion, but as an elected member of parliament I would have thought he was also obliged to relate facts as they are and tell the truth. The federal government have not cut $278 million a year from public hospitals, as Peter Black claims. We fund the state public hospitals through the health agreement-an agreement that is negotiated for five years. It is quite clearly impossible for us to cut funding under that sort of scheme. If there is a cut to hospital funding, perhaps he should question the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, and look at his state budget for answers. MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment

It is actually outrageous that Peter Black would make such a false claim, because-as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley-for the record, on education the federal government have increased funding to New South Wales for state government schools by a further six per cent in this year’s budget to a total of $873.1 million on top of the 5.7 per cent increase made last year. Interestingly, the New South Wales government only increased their allocation to schools last year by 0.8 per cent. Overall, we have increased funding to New South Wales schools by 62½ per cent since we were elected to government in 1996. It is little wonder that we see Labor candidates speaking the sort of rubbish that they do when it appears to be quite an acceptable practice for their elected members to behave in that way. This government has learnt from past experience not to accept one word from the Labor Party without checking the facts and demanding proof. It now appears that the media and Labor’s own branch members will have to do the same. It proves that we cannot trust their word. Cunningham Electorate: Community Services sues concerning my electorate of Cunningham, for amidst talk of budgets and elections life goes on back home in Wollongong much as it always has. I took the opportunity during the April parliamentary break to visit a number of organisations and individuals in my electorate, all dealing on a daily basis with the community and looking to the federal government for assistance. I visited, for example, community child-care facilities run by Illawarra child-care services, and came away from those visits with a feeling of great appreciation for their work and of the significant role played by women. I also came away somewhat appalled by the low wages paid-around $12.50 an hour-especially in light of the difficult work conditions and the huge responsibilities of caring for young children and babies. I am also concerned about the future of such facilities as a result of the failure by governments to fund the upgrade of basic infrastructure. In my opinion, increasing privatisation of the sector will put under threat the quality services currently being delivered by community child care, where profits go back into the centres to provide additional staff and to trim the huge waiting lists. I visited childcare facilities at Bulli, Bellambi, Figtree and Wollongong, and I would like to thank the staff for their hospitality and openness and congratulate them on the work done. I also took the opportunity to visit a number of public schools in my electorate, in order to experience first hand some of the issues facing the sector. My impression was one of teachers working extremely hard, providing a high quality, values based educational experience with diminishing resources and decaying infrastructure. Indeed, a door collapsed at one primary school during my visit-luckily, no-one was injured. More financial support from the state and federal governments is urgently needed, with a priority on the public education sector. I was shocked to find out that headmasters are given a budget each year out of which they are meant to account for unforeseen costs such as sick pay and long service leave for teaching staff. This can result in budget shortfalls, teaching resources being withdrawn or diverted and pressure being placed on teachers to limit their use of such entitlements. I was also rather concerned by the lack of site planning evident within many of the schools. School grounds looked like construction sites, with demountables located haphazardly around the place taking up precious space which is needed for things such as playgrounds for the children. Often deMAIN COMMITTEE",161,Adjournment
304,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (12.40 P.m.),"I take this opportunity to raise a number of ismountables are in place for decades and little consideration is given by government to the construction of much-needed buildings. More money is needed for staff, for teaching resources, for buildings and for associated infrastructure. Schools should not have to rely on the hard work, goodwill and limited resources of parents to pay for these necessities. But that is the way things seem to be going. My visits to the schools, preschools and child-care centres reinforced my long-held view that government must put more money into education, for education is an investment in the future and a quality education is a right, not a privilege. On another subject, I recently visited the Illawarra Retirement Trust aged care facility at Towradgi. Once again, the staff and management there are doing a wonderful job. However, they are faced with increasing costs associated with managing our ageing population, with increasing amounts of paperwork and with the failure of government to provide assistance with building and infrastructure maintenance and development. I have covered preschools, primary schools and aged care, and I now turn to health care and our local crisis, which I alluded to in the House on Monday. Issues include concerns about the downgrading of the emergency department at Bulli Hospital and the uncertain future of that facility; concerns about the Illawarra rescue helicopter service; concerns about the imminent installation of an MRI machine at Wollongong Hospital but no Medicare licence or funding for its operation; concerns about a lack of beds at Wollongong Hospital, which recently saw eight ambulances queued up outside the emergency department unable to off-load patients because there was simply nowhere to put them, a situation exacerbated by the fact that ambulances have been directed not to take patients to Bulli Hospital; and concerns about staff morale in the Illawarra Area Health Service, budget blow-outs and problems with management. Amidst all this, staff continue to do a wonderful job on a daily basis under difficult circumstances. Other local issues continue to be of concern. Like most members of this place, the divide between my parliamentary work here in Canberra and local issues and commitments can often grow large. In closing, I would like to make mention of the wonderful work done by Robyn Alderton and her team at the Bellambi community centre. Their preschool breakfast program, for example, serves some 30 to 50 local children every day and is funded by the local community. It is provided to children who would otherwise go to school without breakfast or a packed lunch. The fact that such a program is needed in a regional electorate such as Cunningham is indicative of the real social problems and the poverty crisis facing Australia at the moment. Robyn and her team do a magnificent job and are an inspiration. They deserve our support.

All permanent full-time sites are required to operate as a minimum from 9am to 5pm weekdays (excluding public holidays). Employment: Job Network (Question No. 3222) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 2 March 2004: (1) How many jobs have been advertised on the Australian Job Search (AJS) website since its inception. (2) What is the (a) annual cost, and (b) total cost since the inception of the AJS website. (3) How many people have found employment through the AJS website. (4) What proportion of those who found work through the AJS website were Job Network cardholders. (5) What proportion of jobs advertised on the AJS website are available only to Job Network cardholders. (6) How are jobs that are advertised on the AJS website and available only to Job Network cardholders distinguished from those that are available to all Australians. (1) Over 6.75 million jobs have been advertised on JobSearch since its inception. (2) (a) The annual increase to the department’s asset base from the Australian JobSearch website was $3.74 million for 1999-2000, $5.04 million for 2000-2001, $4.83 million for 2001-2002 and $5.50 million for 2002-2003. (b) Prior to 1999, JobSearch site development occurred in conjunction with other infrastructure project development, including Touch Screen kiosks, and expenses were not differentiated by the department. Since1 July 1999 however, the total increase to the department’s asset base from providing JobSearch (the internet service) is $21.46 million. (3) The JobSearch website is both an enabling service for the Job Network and a free employment site for all Australians, including those who are not Job Network eligible. Since the commencement of Job Network in May 1998, there have been a total of 2.47 million placements of Job Network registered job seekers recorded against vacancies listed on JobSearch. The number of job seekers not registered with Job Network who have obtained employment against vacancies listed on Job Search is not available. (4) The department does not track the placement of job seekers made through the site who are independent of Job Network activity, therefore total placements and the percentage from the Job Network are unavailable. (5) This figure will vary from day to day as Job Network members, Job Placement organisations and employers lodge and fill vacancies. On 28 April 2004 63% of job vacancies on JobSearch were lodged by Job Network members, Job Placement organisations or employers, as seeking applications from Job Network job seekers. (6) These jobs are indicated with a Job Network logo. Roads: Western Sydney Orbital (Question No. 3266) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 March 2004:",166,Questions On Notice
309,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Further to the answer to question No. 2727 concerning the Western Sydney Orbital, of the outstanding contribution by the Commonwealth to the Western Sydney Orbital, what payments will be made in (a) 2003-2004, (b) 2004-2005, and (c) 2005-2006. (2) Is it intended that any further payments be made in the financial years beyond 2005-2006. (3) In respect of the New South Wales Government’s obligation to consult with the Commonwealth on the level of tolling, will the Commonwealth support a tolling system providing for the same toll for non-commercial vehicles, buses, motorbikes, trucks, cars and trailers. (1) (a) The estimate for payments in respect for the Western Sydney Orbital Project in the 2003/04 financial year is $88.2m. This estimate exceeded the 2003/04 budget allocation as the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority has been able to proceed with land acquisitions at a faster rate than originally estimated. (b) $73.0m is the current estimate for payments in 2005/06 (c) $19.98m is the current estimate for payments in 2006/07 (2) No. (3) Under the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth and New South Wales concerning the Western Sydney Orbital, the level of tolling and the toll for the various categories of vehicles are ultimately the responsibility of the New South Wales Government. A maximum toll level of $5 would, however, be consistent with the joint announcement I made with the New South Wales Minister for Roads, Carl Scully, on 4 January 2001, that it was proposed to cap the toll at an expected $4 to $5 (in year 2000 dollars with consumer price index adjustments).

Employment: Job Network (Question No. 3294) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 10 March 2004: (1) Does he recall telling the House on 18 June 2003 “If you compare this to Labor’s failed alternative, the CES, in helping disadvantaged job seekers you find that their failed system helped only 27.4 per cent into work; whereas the Job Network is helping nearly double that number-46.6 per cent. What is the cost? The cost under the CES was a massive $12,800 for each of those outcomes, and today the figure is $3,900. That is $3,900 for an outcome compared to Labor’s alternative, which was $12,800.”",167,Questions On Notice
