M. Hughes to try and find a way out for the miners. Although the statement brought dissent from all parts of the room, the meeting sidestepped the responsibility of deciding whether Mr James should be disciplined. The meeting followed an abortive attempt by the Labour Council cave at Sunday's meeting to have the Federal Government censured and the general strike policy endorsed. Mr J. Beasley (Assistant Minister for Defence) defended the attitude of the Government, while Mr J. Hooke (Labour Council president) spoke in defence of Mr Garden's crusade to the north.

41,,"No instructions were Mr JAMES I rise to make a perI take exception to the attempt there made by the person responsible for giving that article to the press to convey to the public the impression that I had consulted the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), and that he had advised me as to the course I should adopt when I moved the adjournment of the House. That is altogether incorrect, because the right honourable member did not know that I was going to move the adjournment. But I admit this-and I admitted it at the meeting of the Australian Labour Party Executive last night-that I did confer with the right honourable member. At the meeting last evening, I thought that I was talking to men who would keep things to themselves. I admitted that, ten days prior to moving the motion for the adjournment, I saw the right honourable member, knowing that, if anybody could advise me as to the Constitution, he, having been connected with this Parliament since its inception, and Prime Minister for years, and being a KC, was in a position to do sq. I was induced to approach him because he had expressed himself in the House as sympathetic with the miners. Therefore, in the desperate position in which I found myself, I decided to consult him. He gave me certain advice, which I tendered to the Government. In defence of the action I had taken in the House, I had to mention this fact last evening. I asked that my statement be withheld from the press, and the Honorary Minister( Mr Beasley) also requested that something that he had said should not be given to the press. I find that what he said at the meeting was religiously censored from press publication, but my remarks were published. I want the position to be made clear, so that no injustice may be done to the right honourable member for North Sydney. I moved the motion for the adjournment "" off my own bat""; he was no party to it whatever. I hope that the section of the press in which my statement was published will take particular notice of the declaration I now make that, in the course I adopted, I was not acting on the advice of the right honourable member. Mr James. Commonwealth subsidy of £1 for each £1 expended in the search for oil in Australia has been discontinued by the Government ? new oil policy has been adopted. This has been announced in the press. At the outset a certain subsidy will be available with regard to geological surveys and scout drilling on the basis of £1 for every £3 spent. ister inform me whether the Government proposes to take any steps to assist the mining industry other than the goldmining industry? I am particularly concerned about copper-mining? sitions have been submitted to the Government in this regard. As soon as a decision has been reached a statement will be made to the House. have been thrown out of employment and are stranded in North Australia in consequence of the completion of the first section of the North Australia railway.

I am now in a position to inform the honourable member as follows :-Tenders were called and a contract granted in 1922 for the establishment and maintenance of an aerial service between Sydney and Brisbane. The service was not commenced, and the contract lapsed. The service between these two capitals about to be established by Australian Commonwealth Airways Limited is not the result of invitation of tenders by the Defence Department, but is a commercial venture undertaken by that company. 1929, the honourable member for B a r to n addressed to me the f o l l o w in g questions1.

Isi t a fact that of the promotions made in the accounts branch as from November, 1928, all appeals by senior officers in the records sections have been disallowed? 3. Isi t a fact that these appeals have all been disallowed during the present year? 4. Isi t a fact that no special qualifications were possessed by the officers provisionally appointed and who sustained all appeals? 5. Isi t a fact that of the officers promoted one was, when re-organization of the records section took place some years ago, made an excess oflicer and consequently transferred to the branch? fl. Isi t a fact that the officer referred to is now in receipt of a higher salary than that of any clerk in the records, exeept the clerk in charge? 7. Isi t a fact that while the methods of the present Deputy Director are maintained these officers are in a hopeless position? I a m now in a position to in for m the honourable member as f o l l o w s : 1. No; each application is treated on its merits. There have been many recent coses where officers have been promoted from one branch to another. See also answer to 7. 2. and 3. Since November, 1928, appeals have been made by three officers in the records section against the promotion of officers, who are their juniors in the Service, to positions in the Accounts Branch, and, after the necessary investigations had beeu made, the Pub-* lie Service Board disallowed the appeals. 4. Apparently the Public Service Board was satisfied that the officers provisionally promoted held superior qualifications to those who made the appeals, otherwise, under the terms of the Public Service Act, the board could not have disallowed* the appeals. 5. Yes. 0. Yes. 7. The methods of a deputy director cannot control the position as suggested. The Public Service Act lays down specific procedure and provides definite safeguards, and all promotions in New South Wales, as in otlier States, are treated strictly in conformity with the provisions of the act. vember, the honourable member for Swan tionO n the 4 t h December, What has been the amount paid by the Commonwealth in bounties, bonuses, subsidies, or assistance to industries, primary and secondary, in each State, during the post seven years, enumerating the special industry and the financial assistance afforded in each case?",17,Cooking Vessels Riley Asked The Minister For Health

That sounds very well, but we have tried it, and iu practice it is not nearly so good as it sounds. If we prohibit the importation of those goods to the value of £160,000,000, it will cost the country £320,000,000 to make them here, thus increasing the cost of living and of production. We have the highest protective duties in the world to-day. tariff schedule of 1908 contained only eight items with an ad valorem duty of 40 per cent. The last tariff schedule contained no fewer than 259 items with an ad valorem duty of 40 per cent, or over, while on 40 items the rate was over 60 per cent. That represents a tremendous load on the export industries of the country, which are the real salvation of Australia. Thank God that all the people in Australia do not agree with the views held by the Minister for Customs and the Assistant Minister. Dealing with this subject "" Searchlight,"" writing in the Brisbane Telegraph, under the heading of "" Our New Tariff Mongers,"" saidJust before the Great War the good people directly and indirectly 100,000 people are (and other kinds) of Ireland were in a state dependent on the sugar industry. of great agitation over their politics. In the circumstances it is not surprising that enthusiasm sometimes outran reason and facts were overshadowed by fancies. One fire-eater in tbe North made the dramatic announcement that a million men of Ulster were armed to the teeth and ready to fly at the throats of the Southerners at a moment's notice. The scarifying effects of this declaration were however, considerably diluted by the Right Hon. Thomas Lough, who in a letter to The Times quietly mentioned the pertinent and irrefutable fact that there were not a million men in the whole of Ireland! The .new Australian Minister for Customs, Mr Fenton, and his Assistant Minister, Mr unable to discover about 87,000 of them. Those Forde, remind me of the Irishman who threw statistics about with a complete ignorance of their significance and a total disregard for accuracy. Both these men are rabid That is, of course, not necessarily an offence, although it may be a disability. both be steeped in the conviction that every commodity that comes from abroad is mischievous and every person concerned in sending or receiving it is an enemy. They may believe, just as firmly as most people used to believe that the world was flat, that unemployment could be swept away and Australia made happy and prosperous by merely passing an Mr Prowse. Act of Parliament decreeing that ships coming to the shores of the Commonwealth should carry nothing but tourists, ballast, and loans. But the possession of ideas, no matter how honest, is not enough in men who occupy high places of responsibility. They are required to be informed, intelligent, and intelligible. They should have an elementary knowledge of economics at all events; an understanding of the fundamental conditions of industry; and some slight acquaintance with current factB and statistics. Yet both these novitiate statesmen have in the last few days made assertions which bear not the remotest resemblance to accuracy: 1. The Australian sugar industry gives The customs employment to 100,000 people Mr Forde. 2. If 60 per cent, of £20,000,000 worth of metals and machinery now imported annually into the Commonwealth were made here employment would be provided for 50,000 more hands Mr Fenton. I do not wish to be rude, but neither w ill I sacrifice candour for politeness, and I say without hesitation that both of these statements by two Ministers of the Crown are wild exaggerations, ludicrously opposite to the truth, and are statements that eould not have come from men whose intention it was to be instructive. telegraphed summary of what I said. It is quite wrong. My statement was that tinues^Mr Forde may be able to offer the feeble excuse that he merely repeated something that Mr Forgan Smith had said; but even Mr Forde should know better than to accept Mr Smith as a guide in any such practical matters as industry and production, especially ""production for p r of it "" instead of for ""human needs "". I have gone carefully through al l the available data to find Mr Forde's 100,000 persons employed in the sugar industry and have been that I have traced received wages in 1927-28 averaging just on £200. If the missing ones mentioned by the Minister are real, although concealed from me, then it follows that the protectionists. wages cost alone of the production of sugar in Australia comes to about £20,000,000 a year!

But that was not the case. I have the account before me in the Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Fenton was addressing a gathering of manufacturers filled with enthusiasm for higher protection.

So far he has not transgressed the rules of debate, but he will strain the forbearance of the chair if he continues to read throughout his speech. balance of this article in order to complete the basis for the argument I intend however, to found upon itMr Fenton described himself as "" an old protectionist,"" and I should be inclined to think this must be one of the worse kinds. I do not know how old the Minister is in protection, but I do know that he is rather a veteran politician. He has been in the House of Representatives since 1910, so that he should have had ample opportunity to study and improve his mind by reading the blue-books. But if he has endeavoured to educate himself the results are disappointing. Still, there is one thing I w i ll say in Mr Fenton's favour. Ho forgot for the moment, when addressing manufacturers, that he is a Socialist. He allowed to completely disappear from his memory the fact that his main purpose in life is to destroy capitalism and private endeavour and to put Socialism in their place and that he is pledged to the nationalization of banking. In his fiscal fervour the Minister ignored his real faith, for he even "" made a strong appeal to the bankers and financial institutions to help to back up the manufacturers of Australia "" ? He went on to say: No country could possibly progress as it should if it had a large army .of unemployed to metals and machinery as one branch of Australian industrial effort. He said that £20,000,000 worth of these goods was imported annually. If CO per cent, of those goods were manufactured here it would mean the employment of approximately 50,000 more people. To which I say, rubbish! Absolute nonsense 1 A mixture of uncooked economics, inaccurate statistics, rant, rhodomontade, and hyperbole! Mr Fenton may mean well. He may have been baptised a protectionist in his swaddling clothes and have supported that doctrine ever since he left the cradle-bu t he appears to know very little about the value of imports and next to nothing about the number of Australian industrialists required to produce a given quantity of metals and machinery. It is immaterialthat the Minister was far from correct in his estimate of annual imports of metals and machinery. What matters is that his views on the amount of unemployment that might be afforded in the way he suggests is all wrong. Sixty per cent, of £20,000,000 is £12,000,000. If 50,000 artisans I rise to a point of made goods worth £12,000,000 their average value of output would be £240. Out of that value there would have to be paid the cost of raw materials, which would be more than £6,000,000, fuel and light, interest, taxation, numerous other expenses, and-wages . The Commonwealth Statistician shows that in this particular class of industry in Australia the wages amount to not quite 29 per cent, of thetotal value of output. Thusi t is seen that the manufacture of £12,000,000 worth of metals and manufactures by 50,000 employeeswould yield an average wage of less than £70' per annum! Mr Fenton's new army of workers would, not be content to work for £70 a year. Even he will not dispute that. They would demand at least the current rate of pay, and if 50,000 persons were employed at that rate to make £12,000,000 of goods the total cost of manufacture would be in the neighbourhood of £20,000,0000. £ Value of production 12,000,000 Cost of production .. 20,000,000 L °ss ... .. 8,000,000 Lost per employee 160 And now I have said not one single word against reasonable protection for local industry.

In Great Britain unemployment is as serious as it is here, and the following newspaper extract indicates the view of English Labour' politicians regarding the fallacy that protection is a remedy:Labour Members' Meeting. London, 5th DecemberA meeting of a dozen Labour Parliamentarians, representing West Riding constituencies, presided over by Mr wages as high, if not higher, than those Phillip Snowden, passed a resolution that protection was no remedy for the admitted difficulties in the woollen trade, which could only he overcome if the trade adapted itself to changed world conditions. Safeguarding in other industries had not justified itself. The meeting decided unanimously to oppose uncompromisingly any attempt to apply the "" quack remedy of protection "", which, they considered, would he disastrous alike to the industry and its employee. It is worthwhile to ask. ourselves whether the two gentlemen who are controlling the Trade and Customs Department are the final authorities on economics, and whether their fiscal bigotry should prevail against our actual experience. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) said last week that international misunderstandings and profitmongering are the greatest causes of war. The Economic Conference at Geneva reported however that the majority of wars were due to economic causes, particularly prohibitive and retaliatory tariffs. Members of the Commonwealth Ministry profess a desire to extend the right hand of fellowship to other nations, but whilst they expect those other nations to buy our products, they try to prevent them from selling theirs to us. has not experienced many wars. Mr Prowse. Canada and the United States of America, last year, I discovered two fundamentaldifferences between those countries and Australia. In the United States of America, manufacturers pay the highest wages to those employees who show them how to reduce the cost of commodities to the public, but in Australia the best paid employee is he who can show his employer how to fleece the people most. I speak as an Australian, and I wish to Moreover our own experience save this country. .Another difference between us and the United States of America is in the conditions of labour. There the laborite has a strong union, but, if he wants continuous work he goes to his employer, and they listen to one another. The employer says"" I can put so much capital into this business. If I can obtain a certain output, pete with the other fellow."" Therefore, the employees accept piece-work. They receive paid in Australia; but they have to give value for money. The President of the Chicago Meat Works sends me his report annually. One of them stated that the year's turnover had been 750,000,000 lbs., and the profit had amounted to one-eighth of a penny per pound on that turnover. Had the output of the works been sold for one-eighth of a penny per pound less than the price obtained, there would have been no profit at all. That company, and other big works in the United States of America, are anxious to reduce the cost of their commodities to the public; but in Australia the whole idea is to erect a high tariff wall, so that between commercial combines and combines of trade unions the cost of production goes up, and the people are fleeced. The higher the tariff wall is erected, the greater will be the cost of production, and the greater will be the difficulty experienced by Australia in competing in the markets of the world with its primary products. I am sorry that it has been decided by the Government to allow Alsatian dogs to be admitted* to this country, because I foresee the possibility of a serious America menace to the sheep breeding industry.

89,Mr Prowse,"When I was inanimal, but I fear danger of an admixture of Alsatian and dingo blood. Such a decision as this should not be reached without the full concurrence of the House. It may become a menace to our greatest industry. I have endeavoured to show that Australia is going in the wrong direction. Already the more sparsely populated States are claiming consideration from the Commonwealth. There was a feeling of great loyalty when federation was established, but now there are murmurings of secession. If we continue to place burdens on the people, and undermine the financial credit of the country, the consequences will be on the heads of those who take that foolish action in contravenat the minimum rate permissible, they tion of the best advice that the world can furnish. new member, I suggest that a deduction or two by one who has carefully listened to the debate for a week or so might not be out of place. 1 have been amazed at the welter of words in this chamber. Men of seasoned political experience appear to deem it necessary to occupy the full time allotted to them in saying what half a dozen other honourable members have previously said. To my mind this is one of the strangest features of the political life of this country. The other preliminary observation I have to make is that I am pleased to be in a position to reply in this chamber to some of our honourable friends on the other side, who in the recent arbitration campaign mercilessly criticized the trade union movement in the presence of myself and Mr Crofts, General Secretary of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. I assure honourable when the subjects to which I refer are under discussion, we shall be on an equality this time, and, for every knock they give, they can expect one or two from the ranks .of the Government supporters. It must be recognized that the Labour party was returned with a sweeping majority. As to that, there can be no two opinions; but I was amazed to hear the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this chamber telling the House in cold blood that the Labour party won the election on false issues, when they must know, if they are sincere and have any memory at all, what the issues really were. We said, in the first place, that the. Nationalist party, in six and a half years, had brought into Australia an army of 162,000 immigrants, and that its prime reason in doing that was ultimately to break down the trade union movement. We said that that army was composed, after all, of persons just as human, and probably just as good, as tlie best Australians. But when those migrants were brought here, there was no work available for them. Certain standards of wages have been set up, but as there was no work available for them accepted a lower wage. That is one of my reasons for the statement that that action was intended to undermine and break down the trade union movement in this country. Secondly, we said that the late Government had introduced a bill to abolish arbitration. That is not denied. We stated on the hustings that the object was to give the employers the "" open go "" that they had prior to the introduction of compulsory arbitration. We pointed out, also, that the late Government had blundered in administering the finances of Australia. We did not submit our own figures in support of that argument, but we quoted from the balance-sheets of the late Treasurer, the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page). We showed that, when that Government came into office six and a half years ago, there was a surplus of £6,000,000, and, when it left the treasury bench, there was members opposite that, a deficit of that amount, the finances having gone to the bad to the extent of £12,000,000. We declared that that Government had shamefully wasted public money by ineffective expenditure. We drew attention to the fact that, on the white elephant known as the Federal Capital, £12,000,000 had been spent, involving an annual interest charge of £600,000, and that, on the last Estimates, £412,000 was provided for further work in Canberra. foundations of Canberra.",25,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com

91,Mr Bernard Corser,"Who laid theconnected with the Labour party was responsible for that; but I wish to show that the criticism of this party at the recent election was founded on facts. Then, again, it was said that we had swallowed our promises on being returned to office. One charge was that we undertook to settle the dispute in the coalindustry, and had not done so. point out that 98 of every 100 speakers on the Labour side in the recent campaign said that they were opposed to discrimination between employers and employees such as had been shown by the non-prosecution of John Brown and the prosecution of trade union leaders. We stated that, if we were returned to power, we would see by what means we could bring about the re-opening of the mines. Therefore, we have not broken our promise to the coal-miners, even if one member of the Government did say that he would open them within a fortnight. Nor has the Labour party broken its promise to do everything possible to relieve unemployment. I do not suggest that the Opposition is altogether responsible for the awful conditions obtaining in Australia to-day-con ditions that will become worse day by day and year by year. So remarkable is the organization of industry that tens of thousands, and even millions, of men are not required in manufacturing activities to-day. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) referred to the labour conditions in the United States of America, and said that production there was greater than in Australia. I find, from a perusal of American labour statistics, that, from 1918 to 1926, production in the manufacturing industries of the United States of America increased by 40 per cent., and in the whole of its industries by 29 per cent.; but, at the end of those eight years, despite the fact that production had increased so materially, there were 3,000,000 fewer men employed in those industries, while all the time there was an unemployed army of about 5,000,000. Therefore, increased production will not solve the terrible problem of unemployment. The Labour party insists on a recognition hy the people of the right of every man I admit tliat some one to work, provided he is willing and able to do so. In pursuance of that policy, the present Government has adopted the only relief measures that have been taken in the last six or seven years. Thus a determined effort is oeing made to honour all the promises made at the recent election. I remind honourable members opposite I of what happened during the election campaign in 1925. About that time a number of British seamen struck work in Australian ports, not at the instigation of the Australian Labour Party, but as the result of the job control methods of the British Seamens Union. The men resented the attempt that was being made to reduce their wages from £9 to £8 per month. Any body of men would surely be justified in protesting against being asked to work for £2 per week. Only three months before that time the Nationalist party was engaged in collecting money for the purpose of erecting a monument in Sydney Harbour to commemorate the deeds of the Mercantile Marine in the Great War; but as soon as these men struck work, because they were asked among other things, to accept a wage of £2 per week for the support of themselves, their wives and children, there was a tremendous outcry. The present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), the ex-Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and the present Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) stumped this country, and shamefully misled the people on the issue raised by the seamen's strike, and the people were stampeded into returning the Composite Government to oflice. Something has been said during this debate about the use of hoardings for election advertising. Very little use was made of them by the Labour party in my electorate. During the 1925 election campaign the Ministerial parties obtained almost an absolute monopoly of the advertising hoardings in the Melbourne metropolitan area. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lewis) can endorse my statements in this connection. The efforts that were being made in this regard would have led to such an exclusive monopoly of the hoardings space, that the Secretary of the Billposters Union conferred with myself and the present honourable member for Corio upon the subject. Notwithstanding",26,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com
92,Mr Keane,"all that we were able to do, Labour had very little space made available to it iu tliat campaign. During the same campaign the Ministerial parties broadcasted throughout Australia 1,750,000 cards on which was a picture representing Mr Tom. Walsh jumping upon the Union Jack. These cards, with an almost similar number of envelopes and stamps were most unfairly used to defeat the Labour party. In addition to that, the services of thousands .of public school children were employed in the campaign. In all these circumstances it ill-becomes honourable members opposite to criticize the policy adopted by the Labour party in the recent election. The Ministerial parties were prepared to go to any lengths in 1925 to discredit Labour. But they have their reward! I wish to supplement what I have already said in regard to providing work for the unemployed. I believe that money could be raised without great difficulty to put public works in hand to absorb the thousands of unfortunate people in the community who are at present without any means of earning a living. Honourable members opposite are fond of crying "" stinking fish"" in relation to Australia. That sort of thing should be dropped. If a determined effort were made, I have no doubt we could obtain all the money necessary to put into operation a vigorous public works policy. Seeing that tourists who leave Australia spend, according to reliable figures, £30,000,000 abroad annually, and that during the war the Government was able to raise £323,000,000 on the local market, it should be possible to raise a substantial loan locally to provide employment for needy people in the community who are asking not for charity but for employment. I trust that honourable members opposite will co-operate with us in seeking to obtain the money necessary for this purpose. In such a time as this political opinions should be placed on one side. I shall take another opportunity of dealing witb other aspects of the budget, but I wish to direct attention, for a few moments, to the position on the Australian waterfront. The Leader of the Opposition made the amazing statement earlier in this debate that, as the result of certain legislation passed by the previous Parliament, peace prevailed on the waterfront for the first time for seventeen years. If it is peace, it is the peace of starvation. Six thousand men have been brutally victimized by the legislation for which the Bruce-Page Government was responsible. We have had other serious industrial disputes_ in Australia, but they have not been followed by the widespread victimization of the employees. The men have laid down their tools and fought for better conditions on different occasions. If they have failed to gain their objective.they have gone back to work regretfully, and if they have succeeded they have gone back gladly, but on this occasion thousands of them have been denied employment and have been treated with callous brutality. Eveni f the men were badly beaten they should not be robbed of their means of livelihood. Many of them are unfitted for other than waterside work. The strike occurred partly because of serious anomalies in some of the awards of the Federal Arbitration Court. The. waterside industry provides only casual employment at the best of times, and the men surely were justified in trying to improve their position. They were compelled to attend at certain pick-up places twice a day. When not picked up they were left loafing around for hours on end. Some of them gambled and some of them drank more perhaps than was good for them; but, frankly, I cannot blame them because of the deplorable conditions undeu which they have to live. I believe that this Government will do something to improve the lot of these men, but we expect some assistance from honourable members opposite. Surely the Nationalist party and Country party will , admit that fair wages and conditions should be provided for men who have to do casual work. I trust that Parliament will develop a sound industrial policy. Certain references have been made in this chamber by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) to the position on the coal-fields. The Parliamentary Labour party stands solidly behind the Government in the steps that it has so far taken to try to restore peace in this industry, and I trust that honourable members opposite will cease asking misleading questions on the subject. They must bear a large share of responsibility for the present tragic position, and should not, by innuendo or otherwise, seek to widen the breach which we are hopeful of healing within the next week or two. We have good blood in us; we are capable of clear thinking, and we are solidly built, mentally and physically. I suggest therefore that we should endeavour to look at the situation on the coal-fields without party bias. If the coal-owners had disclosed publicly the profits they have secured from this industry, our ""case against them might have been weakened. But I trust that with the approach of the holy season we shall be able, with the co-operation of honourable members opposite, to settle this unfortunate dispute. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), whose membership of this Parliament is very little longer than my own, has been engaged in a wordy duel with the Minister for Defence( Mr A. Green) about the abolition of compulsory military training. I wish to remind the honourable member that during the war Australia, without conscription or compulsion, sent more men to the various theatres of war than Canada, which had a population two millions in excess of ours, or Belgium, which had a much-vaunted war history behind her. When the call comes to defend Australia the arms of the nation will be borne, and her ships, forts, and aircraft will be manned by the supporters of the Labour party, who, as a matter of fact, comprised 95 per cent, of the Australian Imperial Porce. -Whil e I admit that the Treasurer ( Mr member believed that many years would Theodore) was placed in a difficulty through having to introduce his budget so soon after the present administration assumed office, I must confess that I was sadly disappointed in the statement that he placed before us. gentleman turned his back completely upon the objective of the last Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), who, for years, endeavoured to bring about a progressive reduction in federal taxation. Tbe Minister for .Markets and Transport ( Mr but he did not explain in what Parker Moloney) may smile at that statement, but it is, nevertheless, true. The 6,000,000 people of Australia are carrying an annual burden of approximately £90,000,000 in direct and indirect Commonwealth and State taxation, and they must regard with alarm the added load that they are now being asked to carry. Honourable members opposite have had a good deal to say of late about our unemployment problem. I fail to see how the productivity of, and therefore the employment in, Australia can be increased by adding to our taxation burdens. On the contrary the adoption of that policy must further depress our primary and secondary industries. I hope to have an opportunity to deal further with this subject when we are discussing the Income Tax Rates Bill. My main object in rising was to support tbe amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) -that Item No. 1 be reduced by £1 "" as an indication of the opinion of this House that the Government has acted wrongly in abolishing compulsory citizen military training without parliamentary authority and without having organized any alternative system of national defence."" The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin),-in an interesting and able speech last week, objected to this amendment, being moved upon item No. 1. He said that we should have waited and moved it, if we wished, when the Defence items were under discussion. The honourable member has been a member of this Parliament long.enough to know that we shall probably consider the actual items of defence in the small hours of the morning some time this week, when only one or two members will have an opportunity to refer to them. The honourable pass before the nations of the world would be engaged in another war. I sincerely trust that he is correct. He also said that we should take a greater interest in the activities of that great world organizaThe honourable tion at Geneva, which was designed to bring about lasting peace. The honourable member maintains that we should be prepared to spend as much money upon influencing the nations for peace as we spend upon defence; way the money should be .expended. Repeated efforts have been made, during the last few years, to find some way of settling international disputes",27,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com
93,Mr D. Cameron (Brisbane) [4.33].,"without resort to arms, and, by bringing about a definite renunciation of war, to enable a general limitation of armaments to take place. So far those efforts have not met with success. The Hague Peace Conferences of 1S89 aud 1907 were called with the object of arriving at a scheme for limiting the great increase in armaments, which even then was recognized as a menace to the peace of the world. But at that time most of the nations of the world had not had their lesson, and Were not keen or interested about disarmament. of the Great War, partial disarmament was imposed on Germany, and the victorious nations realized the necessity for a general voluntary limitation of armaments to new scales. 1920 a financial conference met at Brussels, and it was there declared that 20 per cent., on the average, of national expenditure was still being devoted to the maintenance of armaments and preparation for war. It was clearly indicated that that expenditure, if a reducthey were helpful in bringing about tion of armaments could be brought about, could be devoted to the improvement of the conditions of the people and generally to the advancement of humanity. still a definite atmosphere of suspicion following the war, particularly among the smaller nations of Europe, which are not situated as we are. Some Of them had not known for hundreds of years what it was to be at peace with their neighbours. nations which had been engaged in the war met at Versailles, shattered and weary of the great conflict, which had resulted in the death of 8,543,000 men.. In addition to that, there were' over twenty-one millions wounded, and nearly eight millions made prisoner, or missing. Versailles, and as a result of their deliberations the League of Nations was established. Its founders hoped that it would be world-wide in its membership. Unfortunately to-day there are still outside of it the United States of America and the Soviet Republic, and as one who, like the honourable member for Fremantle, has been to Geneva, I cannot help considering that that omission is the one great disability under which the organization is labouring to-day. In 1920 the first meeting of the assembly of the League of Nations took place, and in 1923-the year in which I was privileged to be one of the members of the Australian delegationa Treaty of Mutual Assistance was drawn up and recommended to the members of the League. That treaty really linked disarmament with security. Unfortunately, most of the members of the League of Nations believed that there could not be security without disarmament, or disAt the conclusion armament without security, and therefore that treaty was rejected. The next move was the protocol of 1924, and that protocol was rejected. It provided for the compulsory settlement of all disputes, In and made willingness to arbitrate the test of aggression. If a nation was unwilling to arbitrate, that would be taken as an act of aggression, and at that conference aggressive warfare was condemned by the members of the league. The Locarno Treaties were agreed to, and security in Europe. Their scope did not extend further. Then, in 1925, the first Preparataory Disarmament Committee was appointed by the league at Unfortunately, there was Geneva. In 1921 a conference had met at Washington to consider sea armaments, and an agreement was reached between the British Empire, the United States of America, and Japan, limiting the strength of their navies in certain important categories. That conference has been the The representatives of the one successful voluntary effort towards disarmament. In 1927, a further naval conference was called by President Coolidge. It met at Geneva, to complete the work of the Washington conference, but nothing came of it, the difficulty being to reconcile the British requirements for security in view of the need for maintainThese representatives met at ing communications throughout the wideflung Empire, the demand of the United States of America for parity with Great Britain, and Japan's need for economy. In 1928, the Kellogg Pact for the renunciation of war was practically accepted by all the members of the league, and now we have the forthcoming Five-power Naval Conference, which will be held in London next month. Personally, I have a great belief in the League of Nations, and I give place to no man in my desire for lasting peace, realizing as I do, what war, with all its misery, suffering, and horror means, and also the economic loss and set-back which it brings to the nations engaged in it. The following table, taken from the Report on Foreign Affairs published by the Empire Parliamentary Association, sets out the naval and military and air force expenditure of the four leading nations for the years 1927-28 and 1928-29, and their estimated expenditure for 1929-30United States of America102728 . . 127,991,803 102820 1920-30 (estimated) United Kingdom192728 192829 . . 113,703,959 .1929-30 (estimated) France192829 . . 192930 (estimated) Japan192728 . . 192829 . . 192930 (estimated) The expenditure of the United States of America shows an increase in three years of £25,000,000. The United 'Kingdom alone, of these four powers, made a reduction, France having an increase of £20,000,000, and Japan an increase of £5,000,000. these countries for the years before the war and the present years is as follows:United Kingdom£ 1913-14 . . 1924-25 . . 55,093,787 1929-30 . .

Taking into consideration the purchasing power of the £1 sterling, the British naval expenditure during the last postwar year was less than in the pre-war years. In the United States of America and Japan-the two nations whose terriMr D. Cameron. tory, like°our own, borders the Pacificthere has been an increase in the naval expenditure. The President of the United States of America, a great advocate of peace, and one who strongly urges disarmament, says in effect that the United States of America will disarm only when an agreement has been reached, and that, in the meantime, that country would increase its armaments. Should we, a lonely outpost, thousands of miles from those who in trouble would be our friends, say, as 141,175,258 a peace gesture, that we will suspend com152,783,505 pulsory training? To do so would be a gesture of foolishness. Therefore, the 110,958,088 obligation remains with us to-day to 112,840,124 provide adequate means of defence. This obligation is just as strong as it was in 84,100,180 1903, when the original Defence Act 107,884,742 was passed. The defence of the Com43,790,309 monwealth will suffer a serious blow 40,258,144 if the compulsory training system 48,525,979 be abolished. That is not a wild statement, because the matter is one to which I have given the fullest thought. I further maintain that the Government did not receive a mandate from the people of Australia to take the course it proposes.

The honorahle member cannot have it both ways. election campaigns defence was definitely included in the platforms submitted to the people. I maintain that the people never realized that the subject of military training was an issue during the last election campaign. I deplore, not so much the abolition of compulsory military training, as the effect that that action will have upon our defence arrangements generally. The resentment felt by the people ou this matter is really occasioned by the manner in which the Government acted. It took this step by executive action without according to this Parliament, elected by the people, an opportunity to sanction the proposal or condemn it. The Minister for Defence( Mr in a voluntary capacity. There is no A. Green) admitted, in the course of his speech last week, that the Government had acted without consulting those who should be its advisers. He said that the first thing which moved the Government to abolish compulsory military training was the consideration of finance. When he assumed office as Minister he made a statement which appealed to me very much when I read it in the Argus of the 26th October. This is what he said. . . No alteration in routine or policy would be made without careful consideration, and the advice of every responsible officer would be welcome. A definite defence 'policy has not yet been evolved by the Ministry. For the present, the existing conditions in the department would not be disturbed. The Ministry has not discussed the abolition of military training, and it will be months before this question becomes a matter for discussion. When the more pressing problems have been dealt with, we will make a comprehensive review of the defence policy. There immediately followed another stateinhabitants of the Commonwealth bement which was reported as follows in tween the ages of eighteen and 60 was to the Argus of the 29th Octoberment by the new -Minister for Defence, that tain that it was the knowledge that fedtho Ministry has not yet given consideration eration would pave the way for the into its policy concerning compulsory military should know well that the abolition of comfence co-ordinating the defence systems pulsory training had always been a fundaof the then existing colonies which, more mental plank in the Labour party's platform, than anything else, influenced the people and his statement therefore was certainly ill advised.

The Minister added that the Government had acted on advice to the effect that there was no risk of our citizens being called upon to defend Australia for many years to come, and that a reduction of defence expenditure would be a helpful gesture in view of the disarmament conference which was meeting shortly in London. He added that the Government's action would do away with what he described as "" a rotten militaristic system."" He expressed the opinion that advice received from the heads of the branches of the Service must be biased, as they naturally were anxious to maintain their jobs. This is surely a very low level upon which to place the principles which influence men who are giving their services to the defence of this country, many of them doubt that the"" Government's real objection to the system of military training which was in vogue when it assumed office was because of the element of compulsion. It is not contended that there should be no naval or military training, but the members of the Government object to compulsion. I have here a motion which the Attorney-General had on the notice paper before the last election, though it was never discussedThat this House, being of opinion that compulsory naval and military training is wrong in „principle, and from the point of view of expediency, wasteful and ineffective, declares that the system should be abolished forthwith.

The subject is a big one, orable member to greater advantage. With such a subject, and with such a speaker, I have no doubt that when the time comes for the people of this country to defend themthe Prime Minister my congratulations upon defence policy of the Government. Mr Fisher maintained that it was one of the finest speeches that he had heard. committed himself to support compulsory military training, however. outlined his proposal, and said that a measure would be brought before Parliament in due course. In 190S, at a conference of the Labour party held in Brisbane when Mr As I say, it is just as well to face the fact Watson was at the head of the movement, the principle of compulsory military service was incorporated in the party's platform. A party led by Mr In my opinion compulsory training will afterwards Sir George, Reid-it was then the third party in the Housesupported military training, but limited the compulsory provisions to the training of cadets. It did not stand for compulsory citizen training. In 190S the Ministhose honourable members who vote against ter for Defence in the Deakin Government (Hon. Sir Thomas Ewing) introduced a defence bill, providing for compulsory training for citizen forces, in addition to compulsory cadet training. Before the bill was passed, however, the Government was defeated, and Mr Fisher became Prime Minister, with Mr Hughes as his Attorney-General. It was a short-lived government, and was defeated in 1909, but before going out of office Mr Fisher definitely accepted the defence policy imposing compulsory military training. There were many changes of government in those days. coalition Ministry was formed, representing the parties led by Mr Deakin and Mr Reid. In that Government Mr afterwards Sir. Joseph, Cook, was Minister for Defence. Government introduced a proposal for compulsory training which was accepted. It was not quite so strong as Mr and we wish to minimise this inconvenience. Deakin's been weakened no doubt as tbe result of the influence wielded by the party headed by Mr Reid. In that year Lord Kitchener was invited to visit Australia to advise upon the system of military training. He arrived in 1910, but before he reached Australia there was another change of Government, and Mr Foundations of Reform, published in Fisher became Prime Minister again. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was Attorney General, and Senator Sir George Pearce, Minister for Defence. The new Ministry gave effect to Lord Kitchener's proposals, and took a step further by increasing the periods of training'for the citizen forces. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch), who then represented Corio, speaking in this House in 1908, said :. . . Tlie compulsions of youth become the pleasures of later years. that what is proposed is a form of compulsory training, and I shall endeavour to show that compulsion is advisable and necessary for tlie need of Australia. not kill enthusiasm. And again on the 13th October he concluded his speech thus:There was a man-Samson-wh o in order to injure his enemies, pulled down a temple, but in doing so destroyed himself. . . To this measure, and who thereby attempt to prevent the initiation of a national system of defence, the people of Australia will have much to say. At that time the honourable member strongly supported compulsory military training, and I hope that he will not allow'this debate to conclude before rising in his place to say that he still believes that system to be sound, and essential for the defence of Australia. The present Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), in his maiden speech in this Parliament on the 1st July, 1910, said :The defence policy that will be brought In . May of that year a down by the Minister for Defence will be not only a policy in name, hut will be effective. Unless we are prepared to pay for effective defence it is better to have none at all.

105,Mr D. Cameron,"Mr DeakinThere are three courses open to Australia. rTirst, to lean on support from home; secondly, to improve the existing militia and to raise its numbers; and thirdly, to create an armed Australia by means of universal training. The first course alters nothing. It leaves Australia dependent upon the blind god Chance. What Australia desires is a large and well defined organization in which the manhood of tlie country can take its place in time of danger. The British Navy is 11,257 miles fro m Sydney by Suez Canal route, 12,500 miles by Cape route, and 12,250 by tlie Panama route. Lord Roberts in Fallacies and Facts published in 1911, saidThe voluntary system of military training throws upon a self-sacrificing fraction of the people a duty that should be common to all. That was written when the defence system of Australia was under review. I remind the Committee that whilst the Government has abandoned compulsory training very suddenly, the scheme was not adopted until after prolonged consideration by various governments and experts, and until all parties were agreed regarding the wisdom of it. good, at least it taught us something. show later exactly what we did learn honourable gentleman gave notice last from the war.

109,Mr D. Cameron,"That interjecunsatisfactory in many ways. For instance, there was no really systematic training. Although the period of enlistment was three years, not more than 50 per cent, served for more than eighteen months. The most important defect was that the voluntary system gave no regular turnover of men who could be regarded as a reserve. Whilst the enthusiasts remained in their units for long periods and gave splendid service, many other volunteers became ineffective after the first camp, when the novelty had worn off. Financially, the voluntary system proved most wasteful. As to the allegation that the compulsory system was ineffective, I submit that, so far as the Navy was concerned, it proved the reverse. In 1914, after only three years of experience of the system, Australia was able to mobilize the ful l numbers required for the navy, within 24 hours of the declaration of war. The successful organization and training of the Australian Imperial Force were due in a great measure to the large number of trained officers, non-commissioned officers and men, who had been made available by the system of universal compulsory training. establishment of officers was 3,449 in 1914-15, as compared with only 1,696 in 1908-9, and there was a corresponding increase in non-commissioned officers. A very large proportion of the Australian Imperial Force recruits in the early years of the war had also served in the senior cadets or the citizen forces. Naturally the success of any system of military training must depend in great measure upon the amount of money available, and the shortcomings of the -compulsory system were due not to defects inherent in it, hut to the fact that during recent years there has been a constant reduction in the annual votes for military purposes. Notwithstanding this great difficulty, the results achieved were yearly becoming more satisfactory. I quote from the last annual report of Sir Harry Chauvel, Inspector-General of the Australian Military ForcesThe present position of the Australian Army to be faced, has to a great extent been suc-can be viewed in proper perspective only from cessfully performed. This fact has become the stand-point of a knowledge of the exhausabundantly clear during the last two years. tion, apathy and stagnation which were the A ll ranks are working together cheerfully and inevitable aftermath of the immense labours well in an atmosphere of mutual confidence of the Great War, and of its history during which renders very intensive training possible the six years which have elapsed since the during the short period in camp and augurs retrenchment of 1922-23. I w ill not labour the point as regards the aftermath of the war. The material obstacles to general national reconstruction which characterized it are well known. It is sufficient to say that, from the point of view of the Army, two very serious and special obstacles to reconstruction had to be overcome. The older men, who had borne the burden during the war, naturally desired to lay down their military responsibilities and to devote the whole of their energies to the recovery of the ground lost in their civil avocations, and the younger generation, called up for their all too short period of training, had yet to realize their responsibilities. Before reconstruction could begin it was necessary to overcome these obstacles. The first and most important task of the Military Board, therefore, was to revive and stimulate the spirit of the Army. In the year 1922-23, Army funds were reduced, with the result that a drastic retrenchment took place in the military forces. The net result of this retrenchment was a reduction of the strength of the approved Army organization from 3,250 officers and 86,568 other ranks to 2,332 officers and 35,228 other ranks, and of the period of training in the Citizen Forces from five to two years. This reduction was made in accordance with the general financial re-adjustment undertaken by the Government, and was influenced to a great extent by tlie conclusion of the WashingThe ton Conference, which it was hoped' marked the beginning of the first stage of a period of stabilization and of general disarmament throughout the world. Its effects upon the reviving morale and spirit of the Army were almost disastrous, and immensely increased the already existing difficulties in the path of recovery. The second task of the Military Board was to adapt the organization and methods of administration, training, & c , to the new conditions and still provide the nucleus of an effective Army An army is not to be made in a few months, or even years, but is the product of a long period of sustained development, moral and material, which gives to it its traditional spirit. Our Army is now an Army with a history. It has its own peculiarly self-reliant character, its own traditions, and its own records of war service. All of these are of inestimable value in forwarding the purpose for which the Army exists, which is the insurance, in common with the other forces, of the security and prosperity of Australia. It is now possible to say that the resuscitation of the spirit and traditions of the Army, which I have indicated above as the first task well for the f u t u r e I am of opinion that the present strength of the nucleus is the minimum possible for the ing compulsory training by an executive approved organization, and, therefore, for security. The nucleus is the foundation of the system, and the minimum of 50,000 mentioned by the Inspector-General will not be available under the voluntary system. The great question is not whether we should have a compulsory system or a voluntary system, but whether the organization required can be maintained by any system other than compulsion. Undoubtedly the success of any system depends greatly upon the voluntary efforts of the officers, non-commissioned officers and trainees. The compulsory system so far from being a failure proved a success and its cost was comparatively small. Under a system of voluntary enlistment the necessary nucleus cannot be maintained unless the Government is prepared to spend a much larger sum annually upon defence, than has been expended in recent years. That is a fact which cannot be over-emphasized. It has been laid down that a definite number of men are required as a nucleus for an army organization. system, we wrere able to provide that number at a comparatively small cost, but I am convinced that under the voluntary system it will be very difficult to do so. I do not wish to say anything that might prejudice the success of the proposed system, but I consider that, in order to maintain that nucleus, the Government must be prepared to spend a larger sum on defence than has been allotted in the past. There are other matters, particularly that of repatriation, to which I intended to refer, but I shall not detain the committee further at this stage. Like the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr ment could not give authority for the use Curtin), I hope to have an opportunity to discuss them when particular items of expenditure relating to them are under consideration. Again, I say that I regret, more than I can possibly express, the action of the Government in breaking down a really fundamental part of our national policy, that of compulsory military training. This policy was certainly not introduced by an executive act. The wording of the amendment exactly conveys my feelings. I think that the Goilr. D. Cameron. vernment was entirely wrong in abolishact, and it certainly made a mistake in not first consulting its advisers, or taking steps to introduce some alternative system before smashing down the existing one. Lord Kitchener, in his report to the Government, pointed out that it was very unwise and dangerous to adopt a system for a number of years aud then to drop it, and that it was also a great waste of public money. Without qualification, I support the amendment submitted by my leadf -. think that it was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) who made the suggestion, and repeated it, that deliberate falsehoods had been uttered by representative members of the Labour party at the recent election. Personally, I can give the lie direct to that statement. I have in my possession a circular letter addressed to the electors of Herbert, and bearing the signature of Mr Bruce, who was recently referred to by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) as a statesman. This letter contains two Under the compulsory deliberate falsehoods. It is written on official Commonwealth paper bearing the Australian coat of arms, and was sent out from the Nationalist headquarters in Sydney by a man named Shaw. It enclosed a "" how-to-vote "" card. I do not complain about that, because the Labour party issued such cards, but note paper paid for by the taxpayers should not be used by the Prime Minister of the day for the purpose of disseminating deliberate falsehoods among the electors. government paper. of official note paper for election purposes; but this paper was used by Mr Bruce, and the impression that the public would gather was that it was official Commonwealth note paper. sent out circulars with paper having the parliamentary crest printed on it. tion to the paper that was used than to the misrepresentations that were made.

116,Mr Marten's,"But, at the suggesdrastic action on the part of the late Government was necessary was that the workers not only refused to do the job they were. paid for, but wished to prevent others from doing it. The secretary of the Bowen Eree Workers Union told a number of men in Bowen that if they did not become financial memwaterfront until the shipping companies bers of his organization by a certain date they would not be allowed to work on the wharf.

I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to deny that, except for a very short period, peace was maintained at the port of Brisbane for a very long time before the Transport Workers Act was passed. the Eree Workers Union. There was no justification for enforcing of propaganda was the act there. I said in the first speech that I made in this House that, in my opinion, the act was enforced in certain Queensland ports for political reasons. It was done, as a matter of fact,' to assist the National candidates during the election campaign.

I propose to read these with the object of informing honourable members exactly what has occurred there.

A number of commercial men at Innisfail also took out licences, because they desired to get certain goods from the holds of the ships.

124,Mr Riordan,"Did not the honorabledeputation from the Waterside Workers Federation waited upon my opponent, and that he made certain promises to them. Apparently the influence of the shipping companies, or some one behind them, was sufficiently great to prevent this promise from being fulfilled. I have said on several occasions that it is not peace, but pieces, that we have on the waterfront. I make that statement without fear of successful or truthful contradiction. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) has accused the Labour party of constructive and deliberate lying during the recent election campaign. If the people wish to know what real lying is I refer them to the propaganda of the Nationalist Federation of Australia. I do not suggest that the individual members of that Federation lied, but the propaganda of the party was full of falsehoods. It would be amusing to me, if it were not so serious, to hear honourable members opposite talk about the misleading propaganda of the Labour party, and expect to be taken seriously. My opponent was one of the cleanest fighters that I have the privilege to know, and I regard him as a good personal friend; but some of his supporters adopted despicable tactics during the campaign. For instance, in many places, they pasted Nationalist ""How-to-vote"" placards over those that we had displayed, and in other ways acted unfairly and dishonorably. Some of the men employed by the Nationalist party were paid from £.10 to £15 a week to whisper lies to women; yet the representatives of that party have the effrontery to talk about clean campaigning. falsehoods disseminated by the Nationalist Federation about the Labour party was extraordinary. After adopting such despicable tactics it is almost humorous to hear some honourable members opposite criticize the quality of our propaganda. More money was spent in one electorate by the Nationalist party than was spent by the Labour party throughout Australia. nonsense. honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. for his labour, and to the consumer the Cameron.) had a good deal to say about commodity at a fair price. That policy the desirableness of establishing peace in industry, but he has for years supported a party which has done a very great deal to dislocate industry. He supported his party in Queensland in its efforts to smash the most perfect piece of industrial machinery the world has known; I refer to the Queensland Arbitration Act. At the behest of the shipowners, the waterside workers of Queensland were brought under the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court, and that has caused the state of affairs that now exists -there. With the exception of a few small ports, continuous work was maintained on the Queensland waterfront for many years. One honourable member has referred this afternoon to certain statements which emanated from a particular district in Chicago, but I remind him that the Commomuealth Year-Booh, from whicli he quoted, shows that, taking £100 as the unit, Queensland produces that amount of wealth at less cost than any other State in Australia, and Australia produces it at less cost than any other part of the world. member want more protection ? against the importation from foreign countries of goods that can be manufactured in Australia. The aim of the honourable member is to buy in the. cheapest market and to sell in the dearest. He is a little Australian, like the other members of his party who cry stinking fish about Australia every day in the week. The honourable member is loyal to the throne of England, but he decries the The number of country to which he belongs. He sings the praises of America and other foreign countries. Our object should be to do as much as we can for Australia. I admit that a protective system may be abused, but the abuses that have taken place during recent years were winked at by the late Government. The protective policy that the Labour party stands for, is not to rob the people of Australia, but to encourage Australian industries to produce our own requirements under Australian margin of profit in return for capital",40,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com

129,Mr Martens,"We want protectionis largely being carried out to-day. The much maligned State of Queensland has done a great deal towards furthering the interests of the Commonwealth. This afternoon one honourable member suggested that we might have a reduction in the price of sugar. aware of the interests that influenced him in making that suggestion. jam manufacturers of this country have nothing to complain of. They are obtaining sugar at a low price, which to them is a mere bagatelle. The workers of this country made no request -for the lifting of the embargo upon imported sugar. I challenge honourable members opposite to produce any resolution carried by any section of workers against the embargo. Honourable members opposite have read from a rigmarole written under the name of ""Searchlight."" We know all about the author of that article and the interests behind him. Honourable members opposite have alleged that the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs said that there were 100,000 people engaged in the sugar industry. The Minister made no such statement. said that from 20,000 to 25,000 persons were employed in the industry and that something like 100,000 people were indirectly employed. The value of the sugar industry from the point of view of labour is greater than that of any other industry opinion. I am just as capable as is in the State. for Darling Downs( Mr Morgan) spoke of the wool industry. I appreciate the value of that industry to this country, but it does not give to our own people the employment that the sugar industry gives. The sugar industry has been responsible for the placing on the coast of Queensland of a virile and industrious community, which, in any other circumstances could not be maintained there. From the point of view of the Commonwealth the sugar embargo is absolutely warranted. The late Government placed upon the statute-book of this country stupid aud malicious legislation, designed allegedly to promote peace in industry, but in reality to lower the wages and conditions of the workers. It set out to remedy industrial unrest, but all it accomplished was seething discontent among the workers, which' is 4ikely to break, out again at any time. Honourable ' members opposite have suggested that the workers have taken an unreasonable attitude. It takes two unreasonable parties to bring about a dispute. But the ""We are fully shipping interests are responsible for most of the industrial trouble. It The was their influence which caused the late Government to pass the Transport Workers Act, to launch a malicious prosecution against trade unionists, and to withdraw the prosecution against John Brown. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has suggested that most of us on this side were elected to this Parliament because of the coal trouble. All that I said on that subject during the recent election campaign was that the late Prime Minister, having launched a prosecution against John Brown, was not justified in withdrawing it, and that the late Attorney-General, as a prominent member of the legal profession, would have taken care to find out, before the prosecution was launched, that there were good and sufficient grounds He for it: That was all I said about the coal trouble on the hustings. ber's statement about the Prime Minister was quite wrong.

It contains not the faintest evidence that the Government realizes the serious economic position of this country, nor does it give the slightest suggestion of the way in which this country is to be lifted from the slough of depression in which it is in to-day, and for which it is alleged by the Labour party its predecessors are responsible.

The constant cry of the Labour party at the recent election was, "" Give us a chance and you will see what we can do."" The Labour party was given that chance, aud there is nothing, either in the Governor General's Speech or in this budget, designed to give effect to the promises that the Labour candidates made on the hustings. The most flagitious cry during that election was that the coal mines would be open two weeks after the Labour party had assumed oflice. This Government has done nothing to bring the coal dispute to an end. Never has a government shown such utter ineptitude. While the taking of £1,000 from the starving workers in the coal industry, maintained as they are by doles from the Government and their fellow unionists, is the greatest instance of political turpitude ever perpetrated in this country. To cure Australia's ills the late Government proposed a constructive and somewhat drastic remedy, but the people declined to accept it. The present Government should at least accept the decision of the people to continue the federal arbitration system as an indication that some amendments of the Constitution are necessary. But the Government has declined to follow that course, and, instead, it proposes to make some further amendments to the Arbitration Act, well knowing the constitutional limitations imposed upon federal arbitration. I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Holloway) blame the late Government for not making the awards of the Federal Arbitration Court a common rule. Surely, with his knowledge of industrial matters, he must know that it is impossible under the Constitution for a federal award to be made a common rule. ber for Flinders( Mr Holloway) did not the Government will provide substansay that. He said that it was unfortunate tial «benefits for large corporations Mr Archdale Parkhill that the Federal Court was not able to said nothing of the kind, because if his reference had any point at all it was to blame the late Government for not making federal awards a common rule, and furthermore he did not suggest, as he would have suggested if the contention of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens) is correct, that there should be an alteration of the Constitution to enable a common rule to be made. The late Government has been blamed by this Government for obtaining its advice and * guidance from various commissions. This Government apparently is content to obtain its information from conferences of the two contending parties, irrespective of a third party comprising the general public, which does not seem to receive any consideration at all. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) suggested that our constitutional difficulties should be overcome by mutual concession and arrangement between the Governments of the States and the Federal Government. Surely he must know from past experience that both Federal and State Governments are excessively jealous of their powers, and are reluctant to part with any of them. On the other hand, they are always anxious if they can, to obtain additional powers. He must see that to follow the course he suggests would be an utter waste of time. This Government has signally failed to indicate to the people what constitutional changes are essential to the nation's growth. Meanwhile political charlatans and kindergarten politicians are going around, declaring that State Parliaments should be abolished. When asked for details as to demarcation of powers they fail to make any satisfactory reply. They say that they are not unificationists, but the upshot of all their talking is to leave the question more involved than it was before. Some clear thinking is needed on this subject, but apparently it is not to be had from the members of the present Government. I have no hesitation in saying that",42,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com

134,Mr Archdale Parkhill,"H eand wealthy interests viduals, while falling with the utmost severity on members of the middle and working classes; particularly in industrial areas, because they will add to the cost of living, and tend to increase the volume of unemployment. All this talk about the number of men who will be absorbed as a result of this tariff is nothing but guess-work. It is true that an immediate impetus has been given to some industries by the tariff, and double and treble shifts are being worked here and there. supply the Christmas demand, and in a very short while the supply will overtake the demand, employees will be dismissed wholesale, and their last state will be worse than their first. The most skilful pickpockets could not rifle the pockets of the middle and working classes of the community more thoroughly than will the Government's present tariff proposal. The Government has departed from the sound and safe policy of taxing luxuries, and of taking toll of the millions that leave this country to swell the coffers of usurious America, but it has reduced the tax on beer, and heaped the most amazing duties on the necessaries of life. It is on the broad back of the family man, the most useful unit of the community, that the. burden of the Government's new tariff will be borne. A population of some 6,250,000 people will pay this year £44,500,000 in taxation on the food they eat, the clothes they wear and the implements and commodities they use to earn their living. It is not the wealthy classes who will pay this enormous impost, but the working man with six and seven or eight children. Upon him the merciless taxation embodied in this budget will inevitably fall. Tariff taxation was begun wrongly during the war.. I admit that it has been carried on wrongly, but an effort was made to effect a reform, an effort which this Government declined absolutely to continue. Obviously this tariff is revenue-producing rather than protective in its incidence. It is unfair to the general public in its harshness, and equally unfair to industry because it is non-protective. It is an unscientific tariff. It has never been properly considered, but was thrown on the table with its 221 items without any and indithought, and without waiting for a report from the Tariff Board. Some industries have been given more protection than they want; others have been given protection they did not even seek. Unless a big alteration is made in this tariff schedule it will work tremendous harm throughout Australia. I yield to no one in my anxiety to help Australian industry, hut the Government's tariff proposals will not produce the desired effect. Compare the record of this Government with that of the MacDonald That, however, is merely to Labour Government in Great Britain. That Government, through its chancellor, Mr Phillip Snowden, is frantically endeavouring to avoid taxing the people's food and clothing. To such lengths is it prepared to go that it even threatened to withdraw the preferences extended by Great Britain to Australian produce. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. MacDonald Government in Great Britain is desperately endeavouring to remove from the masses the burden of indirect taxation caused by the prevailing high prices for food and clothing. In this Way it is showing its concern for and interest in those struggling and despairing persons. This Government has adopted the opposite view, and is asking the great mass of the people of Australia, upon whom the burden of the high cost of living inevitably falls, to find out of their miserable pittance the sum of £44,500,000 annually. There is no radical or socialistic government in any country which extorts from its own class such excrutiatingly severe taxation, or adopts such loose and unprincipled methods of raising its revenue. Yet the Treasurer has had the hardihood to state that his budget is based on the principle of ability to pay I What are the thoughts of the man on the basic wage who has six, seven or eight children to keep, regarding his ability to pay the amount that this Government expects him to pay? What is the ability to pay of the man on a fixed salary, who has increasingly heavy responsibilities to shoulder? There can be only one answer. The people are beginning to realize that they have been deceived; they are now being disillusioned. Their interests are not the first consideration of",43,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com
135,Mr Aechdale Parkhill,"Th ethis party which they have placed in power. The wealthy corporations, the foreign film interests, and the liquor interests are its first consideration. Those interests have had their taxation either reduced or entirely removed; and in many cases they are being permitted to continue without hindrance to plunder the people of this country. During the election campaign the cry went up to heaven from every Labour candidate that the patrimony of the people of this country was being squandered by a profligate and extravagant government. It was contended that if the Labour party were given the right to govern it would speedily demonstrate its fitness to do so, and re-adjust the burden of taxation so that it would fall on the shoulders of those who were best able to bear it. The promise was made that expensive commissions would be abolished and ornate positions wiped out. .The finances of this country were to be prudently husbanded, and the masses were to be relieved from the taxation that they are paying to-day. Will any one who is not a partisan contend that those are the lines that the Government has followed? What commission has been abolished; what ornate position has been dispensed with ? None. Every item upon which the present Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) when Leader of the Opposition divided this chamber stills find a place in the budget. Therefore I say that the people have been grossly deceived. The honourable member for Premantle ( Mr Curtin), in the course of ful speech the other day, said that the Government was compelled to impose additional taxation to meet its commitments. He did not mention the additional commitments for which his party is responsible. Surely he does not expect a surplus to be produced so long as the present Treasurer is in control of the finances of Australia. I should feel more confident of the safety of a baby placed in the charge of the most notorious baby farmer than I am of the prudent management of the finances of this country by the present Treasurer. I have said that this Government undertook to reduce taxation. There is not an honourable member on either side of this Sir. Archdale Parkhill. chamber who will deny that that statement was made from practically every platform during the last election campaign. The national expenditure has been increased by something like £2,000,000. Therefore, there has been no gesture in the direction of a prudent management of the finances, but rather the reverse. This country is faced with a very difficult economic position. The national income has been reduced. Businesses in all the capital cities are having an excessively hard struggle. Yet the Government has expressed its intention to keep in employment every -person who is at present .employed in the Public Service, irrespective of whether or not there is work for him to do. That promise was made on the hustings. A further promise made by the Campaign Director in New South Wales( Mr Theodore) was that work would, be found in the Public Service for every disabled returned soldier. That was a shockingly irresponsible statement for him to make; it has since been repudiated by the Prime Minister. It was also said that wages and salaries would be maintained at their present level, notwithstanding our economic conditions. I well remember members of the present Government, when in o-""Osition, making the definite statement that they were able to defy immutable laws. They now have the opportunity. Let them try to keep wages and salaries at their present level irrespective of economic conditions, and we shall see what success they will have. They have been unable to do it in the coal industry, and have advised an excellent and thoughtthe workers to accept the proposal of their leaders. They have expressed their preparedness to maintain the existing conditions of postal employees and other public servants, irrespective of whether those conditions are fair or unfair to the people of this country. They are obliged to give concessions to divisional returning officers, and to make a rebate of the petrol tax to users of petrol for other than road purposes. Any Government which bases its nolicy on political expediency with the object of winning votes, is doomed to failure, and will only make the lot of the workers much harder. During the period that the Conservative Government was in power in Great Britain, the National party was in power in Australia, the endeavour was made to draw closer together the component parts of the Empire. It was felt that the future of the Empire lay within the Empire itself, and that by the organization of its resources it could defy the competition of outside countries. In the brief period that the MacDonald Government has been in power in Great Britain and the present Government has been in power in Australia, those principles have been discarded. Immediately this Government came into power it told the people of Great Britain that no further migration of Britishers to Australia was desired. It was quite unnecessary to take that, stand, because at the time the departures from Australia exceededthe arrivals, and it would have been an easy matter .to regulate the limited amount of migration to make it conform to our industrial circumstances. It was practically confined to domestic servants and the relatives of persons who were already settled here, and the approval of the State Governments had to be obtained before even such migrants were permitted to come here. Such a gesture might have been necessary for political purposes, but it certainly was not justified by the existWhilst the Government claims that it has ing conditions. The result has been to make it appear that Australia is unable to absorb a greater population than that which she now has. Writers in various journals are beginning to regard Canada and South Africa as more important dominions than this, because of the pessimistic tone adopted by the Government in regard to our trade and general prosperity. Australian trade should not be sacrificed even for the benefit of Great Britain. But many of the productions of the Old Country do not interfere with those of Australia, and in regard to them some concession might have been made by this Government. If a preferential duty of 60 or 70 per cent, is prohibitive, the British manufacturers will derive .little advantage from the fact that the duties against the foreigner are even higher. The attitude of the Government towards Great Britain may.be summarized in this way"" The Australian market for the Australian people; British goods and British migrants are not wanted. We are not prepared to defend ourselves by a system [30] of universal military service, but if we are attacked, because of the White Australia policy or for any other reason, we shall expect the British workers, against whom we raise fiscal and migration barriers, to come to our assistance."" That is an unworthy and unpatriotic attitude. suggestion. a fair interpretation of the policy of the Government; if the honourable member feels qualified to answer it, I hope he will attempt something more effective than a mere interjection. For many years three prominent planks of the Labour platform were the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, the maintenance of an Australian Navy, and compulsory military training; but these articles of faith are being repudiated by the present Government. It has abandoned the democratic system of compulsory and universal military service, and it has threatened to lay vandal hands on the bank established by the great Andrew Fisher. So far no hostile action has been taken against the Australian Navy, but doubtless that will follow. not had sufficient time to put into operation many of the planks of its platform, the precipitancy with which it has destroyed our system of defence has astounded the people. Of course we .are told that the Government will take adequate steps for the defence of Australia; apparently honourable members opposite are content to defend Australia with their lips, for of any practical or tangible substitute for the system which it has wrecked no evidence is forthcoming to date. No special intelligence is required to realize that the country cannot be defended in that way, and the people are entitled to view with the utmost apprehension the reckless policy of the Government. Possibly the compulsory system was capable of improvement and extension, but before destroying it entirely the Government should have been ready with something to put in its place. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Cusack) made some reference to me, which I did not understand.

151,Mr Long,"That question is easilywords used by the then opposition, in criticizing the Labour Ministry that dared to vote a certain sum of money for the establishment of that navy? Sir Joseph Cook said that it was the first step towards revolution. Sir Elliot Johnson, whose place I have taken in this chamber, declared that it was the first step towards severing the ties that bound Australia to the dear old Motherland. Honourable members opposite, like their predecessors, still indulge in the parrot-like cries repeatedly raised against the Labour party. It was said then that, if a navy"" were formed in Australia, it would turn its guns on England, and that that aotion would lead to Australia "" cutting the painter."" That navy enabled Australia to protect its coastline during the late war. Reference was also made by the honourable member for Warringah to what he regarded as the democratic aspect of compulsory military training. I suggest that nothing that savours of compulsion should be regarded as democratic. No honourable member opposite has suggested that a form of compulsion should be applied to the wealthy section in this country, so that the youths whom honourable members opposite are so ready to compel to shoulder a rifle might be suitably equipped. During the hectic period of the conscription campaign, when an attempt was made to conscript human beings, the section represented hy honourable members opposite gambled on the lives of the men sent to the front, and on the destiny of the country, by asking the large banking combines to put their money into war loans at 4^ per cent., while the lads who went to the war received 6s. a day. Labour does not want that sort of democracy. If ever compulsory military service is talked of again-and I hope it never will belet us first conscript the wealth of this country. Isi t surprising that the people are asking what is the use of governments? Can we wonder that there is industrial unrest, when the people realize the nature of the banking swindle that is being practised ?

The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) declared in his speech this afternoon that he was an Australian, but he showed shortly afterwards that he was an out-and-out free trader. He had a lot to say about the excessive cost of production in Australia, but conveniently forgot to mention any other aspect of the subject. The wages paid in this country are from 87 per cent, to 279 per cent, higher than those paid in the other coun. tries of the world, including America. Yet some honourable members opposite supported a government which for thirteen years permitted manufactured products from other countries to pour into Australia while many of our own workmen were starving. When we talk about the cost of production here, we should also remember that our people receive high wages. I believe that we should give every person in the community an opportunity to enjoy, to some extent at least, the good things of life. Some of the articles mentioned by the honourable member for Forrest this afternoon are produced by girl labour, for which 5d. au hour is paid. Others are produced by women labour for which 4d. an hour for 12 hours a day and six days a week is paid. "" That occurs in Brussels. such a lot of unemployment in Australia ? vernment which the honourable member supported allowed £180,000,000 worth of imports to come into Australia in 1928. The tariff schedule introduced by this Government has already had the effect of relieving the unemployment difficulty.

The policy of this Government in abolishing compulsory military training will tend to abolish war. more about the coal strike?dustrial upheavals, has its origin in our ill-founded economic system. I have no quarrel with honourable members opposite personally, but I have a quarrel with every political party which fails to protect the interests of our people, and favours the unrestricted admission into Australia of goods manufactured in cheap-labour countries. I trust that the Government will continue the good work that it has begun, and that in the not distant future it will re-establish the Commonwealth Bank, and allow it to be what it was intended to be, a people's bank and not a bankers' bank. A remarkable change has occurred in this Parliament since I last. exercised my privilege of addressing the committee. Honourable members who, a few short weeks ago, maintained vigorously that the Government could do no wrong are now sitting on this side of the chamber, and, as shown by the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, vigorously arguing that the Government can do nothing right, and therefore must be strenuously opposed. On the other hand honourable members who, quite recently, sat on this side of the chamber and opposed the Government with all their might, are now just as vociferously upholding it. Not only has a change occurred in the personnel of the Government, but there has also been a change of political policy. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that our fiscal Honourable members opposite policy has not been changed but accelerated. During a long period of years the Composite Government steadily increased our tariff duties. As the hontin) said last week, our receipts from customs and excise duties rose from £32,000,000 in 1923 to a little over £40,000,000 in 1928. He went on to point out that the last Treasurer budgetted on receiving from this source this financial year, £43,750,000, the highest amount on record. Notwithstanding, this fact, this Government, having been in office for only a few weeks, introduced a tariff 'schedule covering over 200 items which provided for drastic increases in duties. There was some justification for the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition that that schedule must have been too hastily prepared to warrant us in accepting it without a great deal of criticism. One might well ask what was the determining factor in determining these duties ? few specific questions on this subject. Who asked for the increase of some of these duties to the extent of 65 per cent, and more? Was the Tariff Board approached in regard to them? ber admits, then, that some of the duties were imposed without reference to the Tariff Board. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Fenton) has threatened that action will be taken by the Government if any attempt is made to exploit the public by increasing prices.

167,Mr Stewart,"The honourable memworld's prices of many articles are steadily falling, and what guarantee has the Government that local manufacturers will lower their prices correspondingly? The local manufacturers may logically give the assurance that there will be no increase in prices, and yet still be in a position to exploit the people so far as the relation of their prices to overseas prices is concerned. I have no doubt that the imposition of these duties will provide employment temporarily, and that factories will be established, but sooner or strangling our primary industries, and later a reaction will set in, as it always has done. The whole history of tariff legislation in this Parliament has been the imposition of increased duties. Rosy pictures have been painted of the prosperity that the new duties will bring in their train. We all recollect the famous Massy Greene tariff of 1921, and that very able speech of the Minister in charge, in which he predicted that if the tariff were passed it would usher in an era of prosperity and industrial development, the like of which this country had never seen. That tariff was passed, and in the process of passing it, duties higher than those originally tabled were imposed. To-day, in 1929, eight years afterwards, we have the same old prediction. This schedule, if passed, will usher in an era of prosperity and bring employment to this country. Sooner or later a repercussion will be felt. The increased duties are imposed at the expense of the consumers, and particularly of the primary producers of this country. getting it in the neck. of the worker. This Parliament must take into consideration the fact that our secondary industries, with some minor exceptions, make no attempt to compete in the world's market. They openly and unashamedly exploit the local market, and when the supply exceeds the demand, production ceases or is restricted merely to meet that demand. We have, too, the policy enunciated by the last speaker ( Mr Long) who seemed to think that it was impossible for a person to be a free trader and an Australian. I am not a free trader, but one particular feature of the criticism of those whose fiscal policy is the same as mine is the fact that whenever we raise our voices in protest against increased duties, our patriotism is challenged. We are called unpleasant names. as foreign traders. Indeed, the inference is that we are actually traitors to our country. I was born an Australian; I live an Australian, and I shall die an Australian. This tariff is is rendering it harder and harder for them to compete in the world's markets. In addition, it is throwing upon the pioneers of this country the burden of carrying the secondary industries while,' at the same time, competing in the world's markets. The charge of lack of patriotism should rest at the doors of those who have placed our pioneers iu such a position. If it were possible to put a wall round this country to exclude all imports, and if we had no obligations overseas, one could perhaps visualize a state of affairs under which we could live unto ourselves; but this Government, whose dictum it is that we shall not buy from or trade with other countries, is not too proud to borrow from a country with whom we are not to trade. The Loan Council, according to press reports yesterday, has decided that the'present time is not propitious for raising a loan in London, not because it considers that it is hardly decent to attempt to borrow money while imposing increased duties, but because it cannot get money overseas. We are too proud to trade, but not too proud to borrow. We must send overseas each year from £28,000,000 to £30,000,000 worth of goods to meet the interest on our indebtedness abroad. If we imported nothing we should still have to send overseas goods to that value. It is obviously impossible for us to be totally self-contained, because of our large imports of oils, tea and many other commodities which we cannot produce, and therefore goods to the value of such commodities, plus goods valued at from £28,000,000 to £30,000,000, must be sent overseas. Those exports consist to from 95 per cent, to 96 per cent, of primary products.",50,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com

172,Mr Gregory,"More than that.the figures and still make out an arresting case. One is tempted to ask when are the secondary industries of Australia going to take their share of this burden. Let me give one concrete illustration to show the extraordinary position that exists to-day. We produce the finest wool in the world, and buyers flock here from other countries to purchase it. Why do we not send our wool overseas in the form of blankets, rugs, singlets, underclothing and the like? Our friends opposite proudly proclaim, and I should be the last to deny it, that we have the best workmen in the world. We have the finest and cheapest raw material in the world, and yet not .only are we unable to compete in the markets of the world with our woollen manufacturers, but we cannot even hold our own local markets without imposing exorbitant duties on imported goods. Surely that one instance alone must indicate that there is "" something rotten in the state of Denmark!"" We pay the highest wages in the world, and our workmen work the shortest hours. Trade and Customs has stated that it is imperative that we should purchase less from Great Britain, yet he has left for that country with the object of persuading it to purchase more goods from us. Mr E. to represent Australia at a naval conference. than that. He has announced through the press, that he intends while overseas to raise the question whether Great Britain should not purchase more of our primary products. He expressed the hope that it might be possible for the two Governments-the British Labour Government and the Australian Labour Government-to enter into a trade agreement for the purchase of Australian primary products in bulk. honourable member. I raise that point to show that the objective of the Minister is to increase trade between Australia and Great Britain. If , as a result of the Minister's representations, a proposal is placed before us for the purchase in bulk of our primary products by Great Britain, to the mutual advantage of British consumers and Australian primary producers, I shall certainly support it. I come to one other matter. Not only does this policy of excessively high duties make the position of the primary producers and the consumers more and more difficult, but it fosters in the overseas markets an antagonism that may eventually bring about reprisals. Only the other day we read of a new trade agreement between Great Britain .and the Argentine. My authority is the cabled reports in the daily press, and I assume that they are correct. In return for either lower duties or a suspension of duties upon British manufactured goods, the British Government has arranged to purchase large quantities of Argentine primary products. always made agreements with foreign countries to the detriment of Australia. am making is that our tariff policy will affect adversely, not the secondary industries, which this schedule is designed to protect, but the exports of primary industries. Take, for instance, the preference on dried fruits. The preference granted by Great Britain to Australia is the one thing standing between the dried fruit growers and ruin. ber will not deny that we give Great Britain greater preference than it gives hibitive duties on British goods hibitive so far as business is concerned. If we place prohibitive duties on British goods, and then camouflage that action by putting still more higher duties upon foreign goods, it seems to me that this alleged preference will become null and void. Britain enjoyed the advantage of a preference from us of £8,000,000, as against a preference of £800,000 given to us. gentleman has enunciated something which we have heard again and again",51,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com

198,Mr Stewart,"No, and no otherAustralia has bestowed upon its pioneers. In fairness I must say, however, that the conditions which exist in the primary industries of Australia to-day are in a large measure due to the lack of organizaganize various sections of primary protion among the farmers themselves. This lack of organization has been attributed to the fact that the farmer is a miserable, whole movement should be placed upon a grasping person,' who is too selfish to organize. As one who has tried to teach the gospel of organization to farmers, I maintain that the reason for their lack of organization and collective action is to be found elsewhere. First of all the farmer is, by temperament and habit, essentially an individualist. It is the possession of that spirit which impels him to turn his back on the crowded capital cities, and to seek his home in the wilderness. It urges him to leave the maddening crowd, select a block of bushland and make a home there for himself and his family. The farmer is also affected by his environment in such a way that his spirit of individualism becomes more and more developed. It was suggested to me once at a public meeting that while it was true that the farmers were scattered far and wide, so were the shearers, and yet they organized successfully. The answer is that the shearers work together. They work in communities. The farmers work alone in isolated districts, so that they not unnaturally fail to develop the herd instinct. If the farmers worked together in bands of 80 or 100, if they met daily and had their lunch together, and discussed their common problems and interests it would not be long before they would do what the workers and manufacturers have done They would get together in a body, and assert themselves industrially and politically. There is a change coming, however, hastened by such factors as improved transport and radio broadcasting. There is a new spirit among the primary producers, and the time is upon us when we shall have among the farmers active organizations, both industrial and political. When that day comes it will be better for the farmer and, I think, better for Australia also. party once, but they left the honourable and commerce to permit of the federal member, I believe. sue that subject now. I have already voiced my opinion about what happened then. Attempts have been made to orducers. The history of such attempts has shown that it is essential that the federal basis. The limitation of powers under the Constitution, which prevents this Parliament from creating marketing organizations for primary produce within Australia, has been the greatest drawback to the proper organization of the farmers of Australia. Wheat is a case in point. Attempts have been made by farmers in various States to create wheat pools. Under our constitutional limitations such attempts have not extended beyond State borders, a fact which invariably led to their failure. failure in the west. tablish a pool in Western Australia has been reasonably successful, but that is because Western Australia is more or less isolated, and it is nearest to the markets of the world. The experience in other States has been that when a ballot of the farmers is taken as to whether a compulsory pool should be established, the argument used by opponents of the measureusually interstate wheat merchants, agents and other middlemen-wa s that a State pool would not be successful because cheap wheat would come from other States, particularly New South Wales, and break the pool. That was the principal argument against the establishment of the pool in Victoria. Immediately afterwards the New South Wales wheat growers took a ballot to decide whether there should be a wheat pool in that State. These same interested individuals then transferred their activities and propaganda in New South Wales, and persuaded the growers that such a pool would be ineffective, because wheat would be brought into New South Wales from Victoria. Thus they have played off one State against another.

202,Mr Stewart,"The attempt to esorganization and marketing of our primary products. The growers of dried fruits also attempted to organize to have legislation passed, not only in the Federal Parliament, but also in four State Parliaments, to make effective the marketing of their product. It should not have been necessary to have other than federal legislation. I regret that when the late Government brought forward proposals designed to secure an amendment of the Constitution in relation to industrial matters, it declined to accede to my request to include in them a reference to extended powers over trade and commerce. We have what can be described as anarchy not only in connection with marketing within Australia, but also in regard to production. The Governments of the States proceed with schemes of agricultural development without paying any heed to the marketing problem. The canned fruits industry, for example, was largely developed in the Goulburn Valley district of Victoria as a consequence of the migration policy of the Government of that State. The result of the settlement of a large number of migrants in that area was that over-production occurred. ment was induced to intervene, and the canned fruit pools, that were set up during the war, cost the Commonwealth Treasury hundreds of thousands of pounds.. A similar state of affairs exists to-day in the dried fruits industry. Last Saturday the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker), and I introduced to the Prime Minister( Mr scheme in New South Wales, under Scullin) a deputation from the Australian Dried Fruits Association, which urged that the Government should take action to assist the industry to solve its marketing and production problems. It was frankly stated that the real reason for the trouble in which the industry now finds itself is the over-production which was caused by the repatriation policy of the various State Governments, under which soldier settlers were rushed into the industry. Formerly 80 per cent, of the total production was consumed locally. To-day the reverse is the case; less than 20 per cent, of the total pack is consumed locally, and over 80 per cent, is sent overpracticability of these schemes and the seas. Yet, despite the fact that there is ilr. Stewart. over-production the New South Wales Government is gaily going ahead with the settlement of new areas. The burden of the interest bill of from £28,000,000 to £30,000,000 is being carried by our primary industries. per cent. If the honourable gentleman will study the Commonwealth Year-Booh he will find that manufactured goods are sent overseas to only a very slight extent. I shall now say a word about the Development and Migration Commission. The commission has hardly a friend. AlthoughI was opposed to the manner in which it was created, and do not necessarily endorse its personnel or the salaries which its members are receiving, I admit that for the first time in the history of this country developmental schemes are now being investigated in a practical way. The deciding point is whether a scheme is sound and the conditions are such that the settlers are likely to succeed. Until now, land settlement has gone on haphazardly under the Governments of the States, which have paid no regard The Commonwealth Governto the necessity for having markets and conditions which will give the men a reasonable chance of making a success of their holdings. Men have been settled in some wheat-growing districts of Victoria upon land on which I , as a practical farmer, know it is humanly impossible for them to succeed. At the present time, there is under consideration the Lake Wiangala water conservation which it is proposed to water 800,000 acres of mallee land. The other evening I was waited upon by Mr Clayton, the senior wheat experimentalist of the Department of Agriculture of New South Wales. He sought information respecting our experience in the Victorian Mallee and gave me some indication of the data that they were trying to collect before they settled persons on the land. It is necessary to take into account not only the average and the total rainfall, but also the months in which the rainfall occurs, the temperature, the size of the holding, and many other subjects, all of which have a bearing upon the",54,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com

204,Mr Stewart,"To the extent of 95likelihood of the settlers having a reasonable chance to produce profitably, and then find a market for their products. If the commission had done no more than this, it would have justified its existnecessary to permit the Parliament to ence. Still, I do not think that it should be continued in its present form, but it has caused us to regard developmental schemes from an entirely different angle, and in that direction has been of very great service to Australia. It has been of very great value also to many of our pioneers, and as a result of its work the pioneers of the schemes investigated hy it will take up land with a reasonahle chance of succeeding. I wish now to refer to the subject of industrial powers. The indication has been given that the Government; proposes to introduce industrial legislation to grapple with the serious and important problem of industrial unrest. I hold very strongly the view that it would be a mistake for the Government to attempt to dabble in industrial legislation with our present limited powers. It should take a referendum of the people while the subject is still fresh in their minds. The late Government was right in the view which it held that the present state of affairs is intolerable; but it made a mistake in the action which it took to effect a cure. I believe that in the present temper of the people of Australia, if the Government were to ask for increased powers they would be granted by an overwhelming majority. It would be a woeful mistake to attempt to meddle with the position while we are hamstrung by limited powers. If a small measure of success were achieved the result would be to minimise the irritation and lessen the prospect of obtaining additional powers. I cannot urge too strongly my belief that it would be a fatal mistake to attempt to patch up the present system. The Government should ask the people to enlarge our powers. . If further powers are granted, this Parliament is capable of tackling the problem; but if they are refused there will be no alternative but to make the best of the situation. There are two subjects upon which I am particularly keen, and that I desire to stress. One is increased industrial powers, which I urge will be given if the Government will go to the people; and the other is an extension of the trade and commerce powers to permit of the more effective organization of our primary industries. Not only are constitutional changes function as it should, but an alteration of the procedure of Parliament also is essential. I do not propose to discuss to-night the subject of elective ministries, concerning which I have a notice of motion on the business paper, but I take this opportunity to refer briefly to a reform I have urged for many years, namely, the alteration of the Standing Orders to provide for the creation of standing committees which would give to private members greater power and status and curtail the powers at present exercised by the Cabinet. In this Parliament the executive has too much power and private members too little. The Cabinet takes upon itself too much responsibility, and whilst that is bad for the Parliament and the country, it is not good for the Cabinet. Cabinet Ministers are overloaded with work and responsibility, in consequence of which they have not sufficient time for the efficient administration of departments. Necessarily, under the present system the Cabinet arrogates to itself the right to make far-reaching decisions which rightly should be made by Parliament. Let me mention two recent illustrations. The first was the decision of the last Government to abolish the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. That decision, affecting the working conditions of hundreds of thousands of citizens, was made not in Parliament, or even in the party room, but in Cabinet at a time when this House was not. in session. one man or two men? reason to believe that it was; but as I am not sure of that I merely make the general statement that it was made by Cabinet when Parliament was not sitting and without the knowledge of the rank and file on either side. The second illustration was the decision of the present Government to abolish the system of compulsory military training. Such a resolve by Cabinet before the new Parliament had met was fundamentally wrong.",55,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com

Such a committee could take evidence from the heads of the naval, military and air forces, inspect bases, ships and fortificapersonnel, is not the best qualified body to tions, and submit a report upon which the Government could act.

Similar procedure could be adopted makes a constructive suggestion in this in this Parliament. A standing committee Parliament he is assailed by miserable on agriculture would relieve the Cabinet of a great deal of work and responsibility. Cabinet to shuffle out of a great deal of its responsibility. applicable to the system I am advocating. Another concrete instance is the request of those engaged in the dried f r u it industries for Commonwealth assistance. The Prime Minister, after hearing the views of a deputation, said that a prima facie case was established which was worthy of consideration. If a standing committee on agriculture were in existence the Government would refer to it for inquiry and report any such application. The claims of the cotton, wool and wheat industries also might be investigated by the committee. Under the present system Cabinet is kept busy with a multitude of duties and has not time to investigate details. Ministers are dependent upon departmental officers, most of whom are without practical knowledge of the conditions in primary industries. Or the Government refers a matter to the Tariff Board, which is already overloaded with other duties, and, by reason of its report upon problems relating to primary production. But in every party in this House are honourable members who would constitute a'committee that would be competent to inquire into the industries and report to the Government. the money for these various forms of assistance ? be well worthwhile. sumed that every inquiry would necessarily mean increased assistance to a parduced assistance, for on occasions financial aid has beengiven which has not proved to be in the best interests of either the industry concerned or the finances of the Commonwealth.",56,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com

Is there one honourable member in this Parliament who thinks that our present procedure is incapable of improveBritish Labour Ministry, and according ment? All other institutions in the world are changing and advancing. Must Parliament alone remain stationary? Must it for ever cling to hoary traditions and obsolete rules and procedure? I have indicated a reform that I believe would be of benefit to the Parliament and, indirectly, to the country. In regard to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, I consider the manner in which the decision of the Government to discontinue compulsory military training was reached was wrong, but the decision itself was right. We have not had universal military training; the system has only been partially operative, because it has been' confined to the more populous centres. Besides, the principle of compulsory military training is wrong. No man should be compelled to go overseas to fight, provocative laws, the people should be and from what I know of the manhood of Australia, compulsion will not be needed if our country is ever threatened with invasion. I listened with pleasure to the speech of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr certainly consider that compulsory miliStewart), who occupies a unique position in this chamber in that he belongs to no party. Although he sits on the Opposition side, and the Government may not agree with all the opinions expressed -by him, I am sure that he is not inspired by party motives, and his opinions, therefore should receive close attention. Referring to the subject of bulk marketbeen seen that he did not then advocate ing throughout the Empire, I may say that when I was in England in 1924, I met Mr Lansbury, who was then interesting himself in the subject of preference to overseas products, which he was disinclined to give. As a member of a free trade party, he was completely against it ; but he said that he had proposed Empire bulk marketing to the Labour Government of the time so that the British worker could be supplied with cheap commodities. He said that, during the late war he had been in charge of a department that purchased in bulk for the troops, quantities of foodstuffs such as bread and meat, and he thought that a similar system of co-operative buying could be applied advantageously to the Empire. He is now a member of the to the cable news, he proposes to see whether some such system can be adopted. The discussion has been limited by the amendment to one subject, because the Leader of the Opposition has moved that the proposed vote be reduced by £1, as a protest against the abolition of compulsory military training. Eor eleven years this has been a plank of the Labour party's platform, and every elector has known that steps would be taken to put it into operation so soon as that could be conveniently done. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron) this afternoon quoted from two speeches made by me when I was previously a member of this chamber. He showed that I was then in favour of compulsory military training; but the argument that I used then was that when a nation passed in a position, in the last resort, to defend those laws and themselves. I venture to say that a good deal of water has run under bridges since that time. The remarks that I made at that time may be regarded as antediluvian; I tary training is antediluvian; 1914-1918 is the flood and the chasm which divides the two periods. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron) quoted a statement made by the then honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Hughes) in 1903, but if the whole of his remarks had been quoted it would have universal military training. The right honourable member did not agree with it, as I thought it should be carried out.

Such Do we need to defend Australian terriWhenever a Russian warship was anyThat went on until the time we established an entente with France, and were a little wiser for a time. Then Germany became the bogy. I believe that the war with Germany was due to economic rivalry, and not because of any military system. Germany has been defeated; but the warmongers, not to be beaten, now tell us that we must look out for japan. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) hinted the other day that our White Australia policy was provocative, and might be the means of causing an Oriental power to attack us. But Japan is in financial difficulties. Moreover, she is, like Australia, a signatory to the Washington Treaty, which remains effective until 1932, and has indicated that she is prepared to renew the treaty. The Sydney Bulletin, which never misses an opportunity of traducing the United States of America, now persistently and wickedly tells us that that great English-speaking republic will be our next enemy. Most of us would rather cut off our hands than fight against our American cousins. It is absurd for the advocates of compulsory military training to suggest that Germany will ever be able to attack us again, for she can only raise an army by voluntary means. Within the last few weeks we have been informed of how these war-mongers and armanent profiteers do their work. I quote the following press cablegram in this connection:Mr Shearer tells how he was a private observer at the Geneva Naval Conference, and the data which he used against naval limitations there were supplied by naval officers. He mentioned that four admirals had implored.' him in 1024 to spread information against the reduction of naval armaments. building corporations, Mr Shearer added, were enthusiastic over my work. A few days later, the following cablegram was published:To-day's developments in the naval propaganda incident included a further statement by President Hoover, in which he said, ""Disclosures of interference with and propaganda against the efforts of the United States of America's Government in negotiations for' an international agreement on the reduction of naval armaments are already so evident as to require that these matters should be gone into to the very bottom."" Those messages indicate how war scares If the League is effective there is no place for are manufactured in these days. We have been told by those who advocate compulsory military training, that it is not conscription. I assert that it is nothing more nor less than boy-conscription. To support my argument, I remind honourable members that, when we were asked during the war years to vote upon a proposal for enforcing in Australia conscription for overseas service, the question put before us readAre you in favour of the Government, in this grave emergency,""having the same compulsory power over citizens in regard to compulsory military service for the protection of the country outside the Commonwealth, as it has in regard to military service within the Commonwealth 1 The Government of the day took it for granted that the system of training then in vogue provided for conscription for home defence. The Treasurer will doubtless be interested to hear how our expenditure on defence has grown. In 1901, when federation was achieved, the defence expenditure of all the States totalled £600,000. In 1911, the Commonwealth's expenditure for defence purposes was £2,128,000; in 1928, the vote for this purpose totalled £8,880,000. I submit that we can save the whole of that amount, and I shall show how it can be done. Under Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, we are completely protected against aggression by a foreign foe. The article provides thatThe members of the league undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression, the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of** the league. * The shipI t is provided in Article 22, that to Australia and her adjacent islands there shall be applied the principle that their well being and development shall form a sacred trust of civilization, and securities for this trust are embodied in the covenant. Seeing that compulsory military training has been abolished in Germany and other ex-enemy countries, there should be no need for us to retain the system. In Jhis connection Lord Birkenhead observed recentlyI find it hard to reconcile the League of Nations with the principle of national service. universal national service. member think that the Covenant of the League could be enforced in this connection ? every other member of the League would have to come to the assistance of a member of it that was attacked. America is not a member of the League. member suggest that the United States of America might be an aggressor ? that has been mentioned as a possible enemy of Australia is a member of the League and, so far from attacking us, would be obliged to defend us if we were assailed. The honourable member may ask whether Australia should not do something to prepare herself to defend other members of the League, who may be attacked ; but I suggest that if all the memr slightest use against this gas. It easily bers of it would cease preparing for war there would be little likelihood of an outbreak occurring, and no need to then protect each other. I have said that the voluntary training system must be useless. My reason for making that statement is that the day has passed for the effective use of infantry forces. Any honourable member who has read the literature available on the subject must realize that that is so. veloped into a .stalemate, because of the adoption of trench warfare. In the days gone by infantry forces were effective, because there was a good deal of personal combat. The infantry remained effective so long as the bayonet was a decisive weapon. But in later times when the rifle was the main arm, it became useless except at the shortest ranges. Who that has gone through the perils of air bombing would say that that is a fair kind of warfare? Bravery, training, rifles, bayonets are all useless against the overhead offensive. But it cannot be doubted that it will be the method of fighting adopted in the future. The modern fight is not between man and"" man. power and military training have largely become obsolete. Machinery and chemistry are displacing them, and will control future warfare. Chemical murder at long range by means of poisonous gas has always been one of the dreams of militarism. The very latest thing in the way of wiping human life off this planet is America's new. poison-gas factory. This is a"" gigantic concern, with many subsidiary organizations. Its total cost is about equal to that of the construction of the Panama Canal, and it forms the most striking feature in the American campaign of preparedness.

It is claimed that no mask can be of the penetrates the thickest clothing, and inflicts upon tender skin surfaces frightful burns, which rapidly develop into rodent ulcers, which eat into the very bones of its victims. An employee engaged in the production of this liquid carelessly laid his hand on the back of a chair before divesting himself of his rubber armour. Some one sat in that chair, leaned back, and died in frightful agony, as if his spine had been seared with white-hot metal. It was found impossible to secure ordinary civilian artisans to operate this poison plant at any rate of wages. Therefore, it was manned by 6,000 conscripts, drafted from the ranks of the army for that purpose, and kept under the strictest military discipline. The casualties among these wretched conscripts were greater than those in the average American regiments in the actual firing line. that statement? of. the writer before me, but I shall give it to the honourable member later.

Mr ""WHITE -There is no doubt about that. to that end by abolishing compulsory military training? About two and a half years ago the Danish Labour Government brought in a bill to abolish all naval armaments and permanent forces, and also its system of military training. The military forces of Denmark of that time consisted of 10,928 men. The bill was passed by the lower house, but rejected by the upper house. The Danish Ministry went to the country on that issue. It was returned to office about four months ago with a majority almost as overwhelming as the Labour majority in this House. House re-introduced the bill, and passed it. A publication called Headway, which I read recently, contains a statement by Dr. Bunsch, Foreign Secretary for Denmark, to the effect that the Danish Ministry expects the bill to be carried by the upper house. M.r. WHITE -Denmark lost SchleswigHolstein to Germany through being unprepared. vaded Schleswig-Holstein the Danish forces fought for only nine days. It was a great mistake for Denmark to fight at all against the overwhelming might of Prussia.

I understand that the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore), when introducing the budget, said that he required an additional revenue of The lower £2,000,000. I suggest that he could save that amount immediately by re-organizing the Defence Department. That would be a better method of obtaining money than the increasing of taxation, because taxation eventually leads to unemployment. I was sorry to hear the Minister for Defence( Mr A. Green) say on Friday last that no oflicer of the Defence Department would be dismissed in consequence of the institution of voluntary military training. About five years ago there was great retrenchment and reorganization in the Defence Department, and a large number of officers retired on very good allowances. One of the pro; posals put forward at the time was to amalgamate the positions of assistant adjutant-general and quartermaster general. They were amalgamated and that continued for about a year, but in the present estimates I find again provision for an adjutant-general at £1,150 a year, and a quartermaster-general at £1,200 a year, and it is apparent there has been no actual retrenchment in this respect whatever. The two positions are still filled by two officers and their predecessors were paid thousands of pounds on retirement. The people In spite of the intention of the previous Government to retrench there has been I am an increase of salaries amounting to £1,250 on the Australian staff corps. The quartermaster-general's salary has been increased from £1,100 to £1,200.

The Australian Navy is merely a refuge for a large number of English pensioned naval officers, while our own men are deprived of their opportunities. Our own men, who have passed as lieutenants, are made sub-lieutenants only, so as to provide the pensioners with billets. Of commissioned gunners fourteen have been brought from England. The last commissioned boatswains appointed in June, 1927, came from England. The only commissioned signalman is an Englishman, while the only commissioned telegraphist is also English. There is also an English commissioned shipwright. Apparently we know nothing about such matters here. Surely Australia should be able to supply paymaster lieutenant-commanders, yet when the last appointment was made on 16th October, 1.928, the appointee was an Englishman. What does this mean? Ours is called a Royal Australian Navy, but instead of Australian men filling the positions, the only thing that Australia has to do with tbe Navy is to pay for it, while in time of war we have to hand it over to the English authorities. When some sailors on the Australia-an Australian ship in Australian waters-were tried on Australian shores for an offence and punished, the Minister for Defence said he could not reconsider the severe sentences, and had to make his representations to the British Admiralty. When the matter was brought up again in. the Federal Parliament, Sir Joseph Cook repliedAll tlie statements made in this House will but in answer to my question, i not influence the Navy one hair's breadth. member seriously suggest that there ought to be an appeal to Parliament from the decision of the Naval authorities? Navy should be manned by Australians. The honourable member says I am suggesting that political influence should be introduced into naval control. orable member's point? Lieutenant-Commander of the Navy, who knows all about these things, I say that the Australian sailor should be under the control of Australian officers, and ha should, if necessary, be tried by an Australian court martial. the personnel reaches seniority. Every man trained is being utilized. they are used only in positions inferior to their passed rank. It ought not to be necessary to refer matters to the Admiralty office in Whitehall when there is an Australian Navy office in the Melbourne barracks. Moreover, our own Government should have the last word in matters pertaining to the Australian Navy. Quite close to Canberra there is a military establishment known as Duntroon. I believe that the cost of maintaining that school is very large in proportion to the number of students, but I do not propose to stress that just now Attached to the school, however, are five fully qualified civil professors-professor s of mathematics, physics, chemistry, English and modern languages. These gentlemen add greatly to the expense of the military college, but I do not think that their time is fully occupied. There has been a good deal of agitation for a university at Canberra, and I should like to see the services of these professors used to impart university training to local students. It is a waste of money to have these men here when their time is not fully occupied, and when they might be employed as I suggest. Some time ago I asked for a copy of the addresses being given in the State capitals by Brigadier-General Dodd, on the new military scheme. I know that addresses were prepared, was told that no official report was in the honourable existence, and that the best copy published was to be found in The Age of the 19th November. I looked up the Age and. read there a most serious statement credited to Brigadier-General Dodd. The statement was accepted officially, and had behind it the authority of a Minister of the Crown. General Dodds was reported to have saidOur best experts have gone carefully intothis matter, and have come to the conclusionthat in certain possible, and most likely circumstances, Australia was liable to a larcescale invasion.",63,Woollens I Can Pay Certain Wages And I Do Not Care Opposed How High Those Wages Are I F I Can Com

252,Mr Crouch,"Even when they passWhenI asked what were the most likely circumstances, I was told that they were so serious that it was not. considered desirable to elaborate the statement. That statement is either true or untrue. If it is true I direct the attention to the definition in the Defence Act of a "" time of w a r "" ""Time of war"" means any time during which -a. state of war actually exists, and includes the time between the issue of a proclamation -of the existence of war or of danger thereof, and the issue of a proclamation declaring that the war or danger thereof, declared in a prior proclamation, no longer exists. We are told that Australia is most likely in danger of a large scale invasion. Then a time of war exists under the Defence Act definition. however, that these statements are made to j u s t if y the gross extravagance and the overstaffing of the military machine? I can only liken the position in Australia, threatened by this alarmist officer, to that described in the 24th, 25th, 27th and 28th verses of the 19th chapter of the Acts of the ApostlesFor a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsman; Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. And when they heard these sayings they were full of wrath and cried out saying, "" Great is Diana of Ephcsians."" Does any one think that Brigadier General Doods believes that Australia is immediately likely to have a large scale invasion ? If this danger confronts the Commonwealth, the Ministry should be told about it . But we are entitled to assume that military leaders act the part of scaremongers in order that the voluntary system of enlistment may go on unimpeded, and that we should continue our heavy expenditure on the training of a few men for defence. When I asked the Ministerf o r Defence( MrA . Green) if he knew anything of the likelihood of a large scale invasion, he informed me that to the best of his knowledge, there 't was no chance of a. major war for ten Mr Crouch. years. The whole military organization is like a pyramid standing on its apex a l l staff and officers to a tiny military force. I turn now to the proposal to erect a War Memoriali n the Pederal Capital Territory. It is unnecessary, because every town has its memorial to its honoured dead. We have no need for a national monument of the kind contemplated, because we have these memorials in every part of the Commonwealth, though they are not necessarily memorials in stone and brick. I could take honourable members to a war memorial at Mont Park, near Melbourne. If they visit that institution they will May we not assume, find a number of lunatics spending the remainder of the lives in horrible confinement as a result of the war There is another memorial at Macleod, also in the Melbourne, suburban area. There honourable members w ill find a considerable number of our tubercular returned soldiers coughing their lungs out-agai n the consequences of the war. Still another memorial exists at the Caulfield M i l it a r y Hospital, where so many of our returned soldiers, w i th their spines in plaster, must remain on their backs for the remainder of their lives. War memorials may be seen on every hand. And for whom is it proposed to erect this memorial? Isi t to the victor in war? Who was the victor? We were told that the Kaiser was to be hanged. He has not been hanged. Hindenburg still lives. The Austrian and Bulgarian leaders remain unpunished. The only record of anything being done to those who were responsible for the war was the shooting of a German prince. Isi t suggested that we should erect a memorial to commemorate our victory over the people of Germanyj Austria., Bulgaria and the other European countries who were arrayed against us i u the last war ? Those people are animated by the same feelings as we are. All they desire is to be able to establish their own little homes and to live in peace and quietness with their wives and families. I have been in these countries and they have no enmity to our workers. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr. White) has had experience of war. I ihave read his great epic, Quests of the Unmothers, sisters or near relatives of loved speakable, and I found it a very sad and terrible story indeed; so sad that I should <aot advise honourable members to read it. I now ask him, should we erect a memorial to commemorate our victory? erect a memorial to our dead. have memorials where they lie. Since tbe war I have seen memorials to our dead on the shores of Gallipoli, where thousands of Australians lie buried. I have also seen memorials to our dead behind the French lines. How can we erect a memorial to the victors when it is impossible to distinguish between victors and vanquished! Actually there were no victors and no vanquished in the late war, since countless millions of people of all nations are to-day suffering untold privations and misery. In our own country we have, in addition tp all the sorrow caused through bereavement, an enormous load of debt for which our people must pay. Those who actually won in the war are the moneyed classes. There is a permanent world war debt of £17,000,000,000 upon which interest must be paid by the people of all nations. happened if we had not fought in the war? honourable member not to address a question of that nature to me. Does he realize that every working man in Australia has to work the whole of every Monday and two hours of every Tuesday to pay his share of the Australian war debt? Does he realize, further, that the cost of the war to Australia was so great, that, had the money been available for other purposes, .it would have been possible to build a house worth £600 for every working man in Australia? To whom, then, was victory given in the last war? If those who favour the erection of this memorial are looking for ideas, I suggest that we should have a war memorial in colours. The first 62,000 bricks should be red, representing Australia's 62,000 dead. The next layer of 300,000 bricks might be in black, to commemorate the 300,000 or 400,000 138] ones who fell in the war; and the next layer might be composed bf yellow bricks to represent our blind, our lunatie, our unemployed and our pensionless men, the whole structure to be surmounted by a dome of gold to represent the people who really won the war, the great financiers and moneyed powers. I do not favour the erection of any memorial that will perpetuate the horrors of war. If a national memorial is erected, will those who are responsible for it have the audacity to inscribe on it, "" Blessed are the peacemakers, . for they shall be called the children of God""? I hope that the Government will have the courage to say that it believes in peace, and is opposed to monumental buildings that can serve only to act as reminders of the hell of war. Let Canberra's War Memorial be conspicuous by its absence. Bather than raise a monument commemorating one of the most dreadful periods in the history of civilization, let us dedicate the site to the cause of peace. Its emptiness will be more eloquent than storied marble. Progress reported. WINE GRAPES CHARGES BIL L (No. 3) 1929. Bill returned from the Senate without amendment.
