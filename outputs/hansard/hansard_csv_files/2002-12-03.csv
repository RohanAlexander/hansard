(2) Did the Lithuanian authorities give any indication of the crimes the 22 suspects were alleged to have committed and did they involve the killing mainly of Jews.

(5) The Lithuanian authorities have indicated that there is insufficient evidence to lay charges against any persons on the list, but they are continuing to examine information provided to them. They have not requested the extradition of suspects. (6) The Attorney-General’s Department and the AFP will respond to any further requests that the Lithuanian authorities make.
