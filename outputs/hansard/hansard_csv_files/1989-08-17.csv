These are: (I) to negotiate group training and recruitment packages; (2) to. ensure -hat training placements are only made when the prospects for recruitment after the training period are high; (3) to abolish standard on-thejob training subsidies under TAP and make all placements on a Negotiated Fee Basis; (4) to link the numbers of placements made to the target already identified as that required to achieve equity in Aboriginal employment in the public sector.
