0,"G|Ouse Of Iieyresentatibes. Thursday, 16 July, 1915. P.m., And Read Prayers. That The House Committee Met Tbis Morn","ing, I ask you, Mr Speaker, if the closing of the bar in Uie refreshment room at 9.30 p.m. was considered, and, if BO, what decision was arrived at? ing of the House Committee this morning, though I understand that there is to be a meeting about 5 o'clock this afternoon. of Home Affairs if his attention has been drawn to a complaint of the Building Trades Federation about the favouring of the contract system instead of the day labour system ? Isi t a fact that the Department of Home Affairs is ignoring the day-labour system, and has let a contract to an Adelaide firm for work to be done in Melbourne, although there are in this city, unemployed carpenters and joiners who. are looking for work I favour the day-labour system, but it must ha obvious that there must be some work which should be done fay contract. The Commonwealth could not carry out all its own joinery work unless it had a joinery factory, and there is not sufficient joinery work to justify the establishment of a factory. The particular contract referred to was let to the lowest tenderer. The Departmental Board examined the tenders submitted, which were then placed before rae in the usual manner, and I endorsed the recommendation that the lowest fender.should be accepted. That is the only way in which I think tenders can be dealt with. Fortunately or unfortunately for me, the' 'tender accepted' was made by Messrs. Pengelley, of Adelaide. I should like to add that Melbourne tenderers have been successful in getting many Commonwealth contracts for work to be done outside this State. . Victoria has had a remarkably good deal in these matters, and has little cause to grumble at the treatment which she has received. I wish to make the following statement: -On the 9 th July, the Government made to the Imperial authorities the following alternative proposals(a) To double the October and November reinforcements, making in all 10,S26 each month instead of 5,263, and to ;;end ono infantry brigade, with brigade signal section; brigade train, and field ambulance, leaving in Novemberj or (b) Three infantry brigades with three brigade trains, three field ambulances, and one divisional Bignal company, to leave in November. I am pleased to be able to announce that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has now advised us that the Army Council gratefully accepts the first alternative offer, and appreciates highly this further generous assistance on the part of the Government of the Commonwealth the Navy if any check is kept on men who are medically examined' in the country, and are given railway passes to .enable them to travel to Melbourne to enlist f The rumour has reached me that a number of such men have used t'heir passes merely to get a holiday on the cheap. Will the Minister have the matter inquired into, and if an .improper use has been made of railway passes, will he see that punishment is meted out to the offenders? inquire into the matter: WAR COMMITTEE. to the projected . War Committee to consist of ""an equal number of members ' of both parties in Parliament,. I ask the Prime Minister if the House is to formally appoint this Committee after its members have been chosen ? It seems to me that the Committee might : very properly be set up on a formal motion moved in the House. Mr J. H . CATTS -What would be the use of. a formal' motion appointing the Committee if its members had already been chosen? tee cannot be said to be a Committee of the House unless the. House appoints it .",5,Setup

10,Mr Joseph Cook,"The Committhe Committee must report to the House? much concerned about that, but I think that the Committee should be formally constituted by Parliament. the Committee shall be a Committee of the House. It is to be a Committee consisting of an equal number of representatives from each political party, and, therefore, non-partisan, to deal with questions referred to it by tlie Executive. If it . were appointed by Parliament we should have two Executives. this"" side, have selected our representatives i u the expectation that the Opposition would do the same. I thought it advisable, of course, to require an equal representation from each State, but now I am of opinion that it will be better to remove any limitation as to State representation, -leaving each party to make ah unhampered choice. number, of Ministerial members largely exceeds the number of Opposition members, .we have agreed to the equal representation of parties on the Committee. to. understand from the reply of the Prime Minister? Is the House to appoint the Committee, or is it not? I do not see what status the Committee will have unless the House appoints it . An additional reason for the formal constitution of the Committee by the House is that the Committee is not to be a party one. I think that we might very well allow the House to set up the Committee on an absolutelv non-party basis. the intention of the Government that the Committee shall be non-partisan, but there cannot be two Executives. Committee, to be of any use, must be an advisory body, consisting of an equal number of representatives from each party and chosen by the parties respectively. It will be announced to Parliament that the Committee has been formed, and the Committee will act without direction from ' Parliament, as the circumstances require. If the Committee were appointed by Parliament there would be two Executives, and the last stage would be worse than the first.

DoI understand that honourable members on this side of the House; in selecting their representatives, are restricted to the choice of two senators and four members of the House of Representatives, each representing a difierent State, or shall we be entitled to select any six members of the party ? that selections should be made on the I basis of State representation, but seeing there is hardly any doubt that this is a War Committee I think that for practical purposes it should be lef t to decide its own policy in this either party to select representatives as the party thinks best.

The Committee cannot be permitted to roam all the world over. They can only deal with matters that are directly concerned with the protection of the realm.

Red Cross funds are used' mainly in three ways-(1) ' By establishing and workin'g hospitals and other institutions for in valided soldiers. There are several on the Continent entirely controlled' by Red -CrossAssociations. A home for invalided .Australian nursesis established near Alexandria by the Red Cross Associations '(2) By supplying goods (clothes, extra foods; delicacies', and equipment), for use at hospitals. The difference between arti-cles supplied by military, authorities and the. Red Gross Association is that military equipment and storesare on charge, and'cannot be given away, but must be accounted for.. Oh-the other hand, Red Cross stores are given away in large quantities. according to a regular scale. Red Cross Associations supply anything required'. (3) Providing'money to purchase, or purchasing at' request of hospital authorities, -extras which cannot be 'provided by the military authorities. Twenty thousand pounds or"" more has been spent for' Australian hospitals in Egvtst. and large' -donations arranged f b r other Australian units.

Indeed, there were financial disturbances in every land, including Australia, of immediate and far-reaching consequences.

Other mines The speeches closed were-North Farrell Silver Lead, and Moonta copper mines, Brown's and the The prospect before the workers of Australia was gloomy indeed, and tlie opportunities of betterment in this connection under the respective Federal political parties were thoroughly canvassed. Food Supplies and the Necessaries of Life. During the month of August the prices of wheat, flour, . cheese, butter, meat, and other foodstuffs increased by leaps and bounds. The Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland announced that urgent action was necessary to prevent a rapid inflation of prices. In this respect the utmost concern was experienced by the householders of the Commonwealth. In pressing their claims to election, Federal members urged their desire to relieve the situation. War Measures. During this month preceding the election the problem of meeting the defence necessities in Australia and abroad was exercising the mind of every thoughtful citizen. In his extremity he pondered on the constructiveness and purposefulness of Labour control of Commonwealth affairs in 1910-13, when naval and military schemes, with their accessories in munitions and equipment factories, were established, and when the Commonwealth Bank and the note-issue were inaugurated; and he reflected upon the oft-repeated statement that Labour had special qualifications for, and a special interest in, dealing with the questions of unemployment and food supplies. These considerations turned the party scales in the election. In the hour of peril, faced with dangers from within and without, unknown in their extent and effect, the electors returned this spring of thought and action of Parliament. Those are the outstanding; facts and circumstances as they existed. This Parliament-was elected specifically to deal with the war problems enumerated. Ministers have since been elected. But no member can shift or evade his responsibility. He must satisfy himself and face his constituents and his country-yes , and his children and his children's children-wit h the consciousness that everything possible has been done to promote the national efficiency and security. Coalition Government. Before offering respectfully certain constructive suggestions it is advisable to clear away probable misapprehension or confusion of thought. In what is about to be submitted no such thing as coalition is involved. A coalition was practicable in Mr J. B. Catts. England, because there no vital or basic principle divided the two dominant parties. For the opposite reason a coalition Government is impossible in Australia. Here .we have two distinct schools of political thought-legislativ e and administrative acts are based upon two opposing and Warring principles. coalition Government ? Mr J. H . CATTS -The daily press have been clamouring for it. parties in Great Britain as warring against one another? Mr J. H . CATTS -No. They are not divided by any vital or basic principle. Here, on the other hand, the political parties are divided into two distinct parties, the collectivist group and the individualistic group. There are wide variations of principle or type within these two groups of political economists. On the collectivist side there are those who would go further than others in giving effect to collectivist ideals. On the individualistic side, while there are extremists who would go to the utmost extremity of individualism, there are those who hold much more modified views in that respect. Whether the collectivist group is called Labour or Socialistic, or the individualistic group is called Liberal or anti-Socialistic, or whe^ ther they are branded with other names from our multitudinous political nomenclature, the distinctive differences and basic principles between these two parties still remain; the fundamental maineach is diametrically opposed. There can be' no assimilation of these two fundamental opposites, any more than there can be assimilation of sucK fundamental opposites as Christianity and paganism, light and darkness, or oil and water. They are instinctively and fundamentally opposed. Consultation, conference, discussion, and the correction of weaknesses and defects by publicspirited criticism and investigations of methods and means of either party by the other are invaluable. But a division of authority between these two opposites in a Government would do nothing but engender dissension. It is, however, both possible and desirable to maintain our party 'systems and prim'ciplesintact, and at the same time arrange our-",11,Pensions Bill No 2 Of Our National Perils Require That We

The plain fact is that, without readjustment, our up-to-date party systems and the ancient customs and practices of parliamentary procedure are mutually destructive. The ancient fetish of Responsible Government. When the war broke out, Messrs. Pisher, Hughes, and Pearce journeyed to Melbourne, and placed their services, their ability, and their experience in a consultative capacity at the disposal of the Cook-Irvine Government. Their offer was met with indifference. That of Senator Pearce was ignored. orable member mean? Allow me to say that they came here at my invitation. MrJ . H . CATTS Pearcei n consultation w it h the right honourable gentleman? MrJ . H . CATTS I was consulted and was a party in regard to bringing Senator Pearce, the previous Minister of Defence, from Western Australia, so that his services and his experience might be available in a consultative capacity to the Cook-Irvine Government, but he was left to strut about the streets of Melbourne. For the past eleven mouths the position has been reversed, b u t the forms and ceremonies and dignities common to all governments have operated in such a way that the Leaders of the Opposition in t u r n have not been sought in consultation in the inner counsels of the nation. Responsible government, which means sole responsibility in the few and irresponsibility in the many, has developed into a fetish, both nauseating and harmful. It is undignified, and, indeed, almost i m proper, for Ministers in all Governments to accept, openly and above-board, suggestions for the public weal. To do so is regarded as tantamount to a confession of incapacity, whereas the highest form of capacity is the ability to extract and utilize the best from all sources in order to accomplish a great purpose. The rule referred to is time-honoured, though it has its exceptions. It is a custom crystallized into law. ancient machinery of Parliament, with all its ceremonies, precedents, practices, and prejudices, operating under the newer party system, serves to suppress in dividuality, to k ill initiative, and to prevent the united intelligence of the representatives of the people from being f u l l y devoted to the public service. RecentlyI said that there were some men in Parliament who had no ideas. I have, on reconsideration, corrected that judgment. There are some members in Parliament who offer no ideas, not because they have none, but because the parliamentary machine creates the minimum of responsibility-bearers, and the maximum of irresponsibility. the honourable member does not offer ideas ? now, and doing very well, I think. MrJ . H . CATTS -No suggestion for the betterment of the conditions of the W as Senator great toiling masses can be offered in this Parliament without meeting with the sneers and jeers of the honourable member for Barrier. It is becoming a commonplace. In Parliament there are many things that one may not do, and very few that one may do. One may speak interminably; b u t move a specific resolution, seek to translate thought into action, and one finds oneself up against an insurmountable barrier which makes progress impossible. I have acted perfectly within my rights as a member ol this House. I have acted within the rules and practices of Parliament, and within the limitations of my party plat-' form, and yet it has been difficult in the ; utmost to submit my ideas to the House in the form of a resolution. The public outside do not realize these obstacles and disadvantages. On the 3rd JuneI offered constructive proposals for dealing with the foodstuffs difficulty. All the w it and ingenuity of Parliament was arrayed in opposition to this laudable effort. The Ministeri n charge of the House at the time said that it was impossible to do anything like what was proposed, yet within a fortnight the Government decided to carry out the proposal. ber effected his purpose. It is the u n happy fate of all reformers to see the credit taken by some one else. The present MrJ . H .

Th© Britisli Conservatives, Sir Henry Dalzieli n the Commons and Baron St. Davidsi n the Lords, were groaning only last week under the ineptitude of the nation's representatives in the face of this mass of parliamentary practice and procedure. Lord Crewe, President of the Council, announced that every effort was being made to introduce business methods and scientific knowledge into the conduct of public affairs. We have long since discarded the political economy which finds favour in Great Britain, but we continue to slavishly follow the precedents, practices, customs, aud ceremonies associated with the parliamentary machine of that country. An honourable member sets out to effect some reform, and is immediately confronted with text-books based on the practice of the British House of Commons, which confuse and confound him at every turn. The fate of the Government should be open to challenge only upon party ""principles and party measures. This would free the representatives of tlie people to act over a large extent of really neutral ground, and much good would result. We propose to clothe the people with the initiative and referendum, the power to initiate and veto legislation upon all subjects. Surely we should grant to the representatives of tlie people in Parliament assembled the initiative and ' referendum over a more restricted area, namely, that outside of their respective party principles and platforms.

Russian territory is in German hands, and Warsaw, the capital of Eussian Poland, is threatened. immense forces are being hurled at the Russians by the Germans, the Allies have been able to make no headway against the Germans on the western front, where British, French, and Belgian forces are combined. Germany has consolidated her position in the Westi n such a way that its line is now one great, long fortification. No doubt the same purpose will be effected upon the eastern and other fronts. On the Gallipoli Peninsula no progress is being made commensurate w it h the aw fu l casualties incurred by our own brave soldiers. Hide the truth as we may, and however much our sympathies may predispose us to minimize enemy successes and to take comfort from the victories of Allied Arms, the plain and incontrovertible fact remains that Germany and Austria are still in the ascendant upon the battlefields of Europe. The financial position of the Allies has also shown symptoms of late which cause some anxiety, dependent as we are upon such countries as Japan and Americaf o r large supplies of war munitions. The war to date has cost the British Government £.1,000,000,000. A t the commencement of the war America was debtor to GreatB r it a in to £80,000,000; to-day GreatB r it a in is debtor to America to the amount of nearly £300,000,000. The fact that the Morgan Banking Syndicate is raising in America a paltry £25,000,000 for Great Britain, and a paltry £10,000,000 for France, are two very grave features. The fact that GreatB r it a in and France are both asking the working men and women of their country to lend to their respective Governments the few shillings that .they have hoarded up in their stockings is significant. We notice that in America another great banking syndicate almost equal in its financial power to the Morgan Syndicate-the headed by Schiff-is buying up the raw material necessary for the making of munitions, and cornering it , w i th a view to raising the price to an almost of preventing its purchase altogether.

But above and beyond all is the distress signal sent out by Lord Kitchener, the British Minister of War, in the GuildH a l l , Loudon, last Friday. Of tliat meeting the London Times, in its report, says that the Lord Mayor introduced Lord Kitchener to the meeting, ""whose hands were shaking slightly, and who was breathing heavily with excitement. He put on his spectacles, and drew a thick sheaf of manuscript from an inside pocket."" . . . He said, ""that in regard to men, we are in au immeasurably better situation now than ten months ago, but the position is at least as serious as it was then. There was,"" he continued, "" in every man's life a supreme hour towards which all his earlier experiences move, and from which all future results are reckoned. Thab solemn hour is striking now for every B r it o n .

H . CATTS -No thinking man can read these terrible utterances with anunderstanding heart, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, without feelings of the gravest apprehension. The report in the Times goes on to say that Lord Kitchener's speech was read from a typewritten document, showing great deliberation. Some of us have had the pleasure of meeting Lord Kitchener. His dispassionate temperament is a commonplace throughout the British Empire. He is a man of mature years-the warrior of a hundred battles. That is not the type of man whose hands tremble with emotion, and whose breast heaves with banking corporation excitement, for nothing. These circumstances, this typewritten document, and the emotion of Lord Kitchenertaken in conjunction with the terrible statements lie made, are such as to powerimpossible figure, if not . f u l l y arrest our attention.

The honourable member, I think, hardly realizes what a drag on mere administrative routine a Parliament is, and how essential to the well-oiled and well-conditioned working of a Department is prompt attention to tliat administrative routine. The mere answering of questions-the mere preparation cf .an answer to an argument suddenly sprung on a Minister in Parliament-means that somebody has to cast down 'the work on which he is engaged, and deal with the other until the Minister's difficulties are got over.

Take, for instance, the work of the Defence Department itself. There are numerous matters upon which M in isters might come to members of Parliament, knowing their disinterestedness, and knowing that they are ready to do any work that is placed in their hands, and ask them, as one friend to another, to investigate. I might mention the unrest regarding the non-delivery of letters in Egypt, which has been responsible, not for so much waste of time-that is, perhaps, hardly the correct phrase-bu t which has caused such a great consumption of the time, both of the Postmaster-General's Department and of the Department of Defence.

120,Mr Higgs (Capricornia) [ 4 . 5 ],"Ime, arises from the fact that we have changed our political methods. There was a time in the early history of Australia when the party was created hy the leader-whe n Sir Henry Parkes, for example, found himself formulating what, in his opinion, was a policy for New South ""Wales, and called for politicians to follow him. Political questions in those days were not submitted to the electors as part of a programme. Eather were thc electors invited to say whether they were prepared to support Sir Henry Parkes or Sir John Eobertson, or Sir George Dibbs. a long way afterwards. after the others, of course; but the same system prevailed in the time of Sir George Dibbs. In the Old Countryi t was the same. Gladstone was such a leader; so were Disraeli and Pitt, and others who might be named. They were men of outstanding eloquence and ability, and political support was extended to them chiefly on personal grounds. I believe members followed Mr Gladstone's lead in the House of Commons when they did not know anything about the question that was before the House. When I have looked at one'' of the old Acts of the British Parliament I have been interested to observe the very long preamblea preamble that was in the nature of a brief speech-explainin g what the measure was intended to do, and I am inclined to think that that system arose so that members of the House of Commons might be the more speedily informed as to what the particular Bill was about. Members in those days followed their leader. It is now evident that such a system of government had to find its limit. There arose in Australia, just as there arose in other parts of the world, a public opinion whioh objected to it. Out o£ that public opinion arose the Australian Labour party. This party and its supporters are not prepared to follow any one man. It is not the leader, it is the light, as an honourable member suggests, that the members of the Labour party follow, no matter who the leader may be. There are political associations by the thousand throughout Australia, and these associations furnish the ideas that eventually find a place on the platform of the Labour party-afte r the Inter-State Conference, so far as the Federal party is concerned, and after the State Conference so far as the State parties are concerned. To a certain extent, the same observations apply to the Liberal party. They have their political associations. I suppose there are a score of political parties, all bearing different names, in Australia, all of which are, generally speaking, massed under the Liberal banner. That party is not so highly organized as the Labour party. It has not the same ideals. Our ideal is to take a man in the manner described by Booker Washington. If he is down we try to raise him to something like what his Creator intended him to be. I am afraid that amongst the political associations to which our friends on the opposite side are attached there are people who fight the Labour 'party believing that if a man is down he was so created by his Maker, in order to do the labouring work for the people who are at the top of the tree. quite irrelevant. The honourable member for Cook finds himself in this position. He is a man of very strong individuality. I know no more persevering man, I know no man more methodical, and I know no man who more resents what he would describe as the tyranny of rulers than the honourable member for Cook. An Honorable MEMBER -What about the tyranny of the majority? objects to the tyranny of the majority. Mr J. H .

The other day, when the honourable member submitted a motion that he thought ought to be carriedI think it was a motion referring to stocktaking and sugar-hi s proposal was tantamount to a suggestion that the business should be taken out of the hands of the Government. The Leader of the Government could not permit a private member to do that.

On an occasion such as this, there is always an opportunity for honourable members to air their grievances, and to make what suggestions they please; but I admit that the honourable member for Cook is right in saying that he will be deprived of any opportunity to put forward a suggestion if the House is adjourned over -a considerable period. .In that respect, the honourable member has raised a question worthy of consideration -the question of the wisdom or otherwise of closing this Parliament for a month or more. have considerable sympathy with the Prime Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet, who are engaged at present in conducting the government of the country, and in endeavouring to meet important situations as they arise. As has been admitted by the honourable member for Wentworth, the Government at times find themselves very much embarrassed by questions that are raised in Parliament. During the last three months, the Leader of the Opposition, and others of his party, have reiterated the desire of the Oppositionto help the Government in every possible way; but they have spent most of their time in raising questions that embarrass the Ministry. stance ? fort y questions appeared on the notice paper. the questions asked come from the honourable member's side of the House. refer, there were forty-eight questions on notice, and of these fort y came from the Opposition. These questions mostly concerned the Department of Defence. They sought to elicit information, amongst other things, as to the capacity of certain State works to manufacture muniI f , for instance, tions. They suggested incapacity, and sought to bring out information which would be of service to the enemy if there were in Australia people who could send information abroad by way of cypher or other messages. That is the class of helr> which the Opposition have been extendThat shows that it has ing to the Government. It has, no doubt, occurred to honourable members that it would be well to close the mouths of the Opposition for a few weeks, so that M in isters might be able to push along with their ordinary administrative work. The honourable member for Cook has mentioned several important matters, such as the questions' of finance, defence, the supply of foodstuffs, and provision for the unemployed. When the honourable member referred to these, I interjected in no unfriendly, way, although at the time he appeared to think the interjection was unfriendly, that he appeared to be overlooking the existence of the State Labour Governments.

148,Mr King ' O ' Malley,"Then theparliamentary system, owing to the fact that we have an antiquated, fossilized system of government that one would think was founded centuries before the Flood. An effort is being made to-day to conduct the business of the country on this antiquated basis. It cannot be done. Take, for instance, the position of the country which we are fighting. It is an organized machine, and an unorganized machine is trying to fight it. In 1910, when I held office as Minister of Home Affairs, I desired that a census should be taken of the wealth, the gold, and the industrial resources of Australia. But could I secure it? Isi t not a fact that the little I did succeed in getting was objected to in the Senate by Senator St. Ledger as an attempt to get into the pockets and the homes of the people ? He described it as a mere Yankee idea, and asked why it should be persisted in. It is useless to fight this great battle with, slipshod .methods. ""What is wanted is initiative. ""We hear a great deal of talk about the initiative and referendum, but the average man in the street has no more idea of what it means than has a child. Initiative means imagination in action, but show me where any imagination is displayed here. Some people cannot see two hours ahead of them. What provision has been made in Australia for the future ? In Melto-day? The bank would have been such bourne, for instance, we find the General Post Office built on a small piece of ground, purchased by or reserved to the Crown many years ago, without any regard for future necessities; so that when we wish to extend our national and public activities in this connection we shall have to pay an enormous price for the land required for any additional buildings. That is an example of genius-of genius on the part of the fellow who has property to sell. No one thought of providing for the future in this regard. Then, again, when I desired the Governthe future in this Commonwealth ? Thirment of which I was a member to acquire for necessary public purposes a block of ground in Sydney, which could have been purchased at the time for about £800,000, but for which we should now have to pay over £2,000,000, the Attorney-General said, "" If ever an Arabian Nights should be written in Australia, King O'Malley will write it."" And this was said simply JIfr. King O'Malley. because I wanted to look ahead in the interests of AustraUa. Again, when I acquired a site for post office purposes in Pertha site from which we are now drawing a revenue of £10,000 or £12,000 a year-the Opposition said that we had not the power to acquire it. If we do not look ahead we shall never do anything. I believe in doing things, and fighting out later any question relating to them. Let us perfect our organization. Our present methods are slipshod and indifferent. The greatest animals of. ancient times have all passed away. Why? Because, whilst they developed their bulk, they did not develop their teeth, and the rats came along and gnawed their legs .off. That is the position the Empire is in. All those animals have passed away, but, in the British Empire, we are still living in the age of the theosaurus and the mastodon. Thirteen or fourteen years ago I moved in this House for the establishment of a national hank, and I leave it to leading bankers to say whether, if that bank had been established on the lines I drafted, with the States as partners, with a board of directors on which all the Governments interested should have equal voting powers, and the Governor should exercise a casting vote, there would be any necessity to float a loan in Australia a powerful institution that the Commonwealth's monetary requirements could have been financed through it . But we had the Australian idea, the little idea, and the result is a Commonwealth Bank, which is an appendage to the Private Banking Association, a sort of dog's tail. For fourteen years I never lost an opportunity of discussing tlie National Bank in this House; but what sort of a bank is that which we have to-day? I shall die without living to see it become a National Bank. Isi t possible to do anything for teen years ago I told the people that if we must fight Germany, the time to fight was then. That argument was laughed at. When I proposed that there should be a Commonwealth building in London there was much ridicule hurled at the suggestion by honourable members opposite, and "" Billy"" Wilks desired to know if I proposed fco pufc Sir George Eeid on top of tbe building as a weathercock. the bottom. admiration for "" Brother Cook."" Eor fourteen years I have seen him standing up in this House fighting for what he considers right. Let me quote another instance of foresight. I went to Lithgow and arranged to purchase a big piece of land, on which the Commonwealth would build houses for the working men associated w i th the Small Arms Factory. ahead, and I secured that land at a low price, because I am a business man, and the owner knew that he had to sell at a low price, or not at all. A t my instance plans were prepared for nice littl e homes for the workmen, and I desire honourable members to realize tliat we shall never build up great industries in Australia unless good homes are provided for the workmen. But what happened to this scheme? Unfortunately, I inserted in the purchase contract the words "" subject to Cabinet's approval,"" and Cabinet gave the deal the royal order of the boot. Often a Minister is prepared to do things, but lie has to satisfy a majority of ten. The time is coming when we shall require a benevolent despotism in Australia, and when the Commonwealth shall be put under control of a Commissioner. Our trouble in Australia is that we are not organized. Yesterday the Prime Minister had to call a conference of all the bankers to discuss with him his projected loan. I do not object to that course, but if the Commonwealth Bank occupied the big position it ought to occupy, and had been organized on a solid Australian basis with the States as partners, and with balances totalling £5,000,008 or £6,000,000 passing over the counter every week, the Bank could lend Australia £50,000,000 or £60,000,000. To-day its capacity is limited, and we have reached a time when we must stop and think seriously. The British Empire cannot lend us any more money. Lately the Argentine Republic sent to the London and New York markets §50,000,000 worth of bonds, but, with tlie exception of £300,000 London's half of that stock had to be taken up by the underwriters. The Argentine Republic was then notified that no more money could ,go out of Great Britainu n t i l the Empire had financed itself. A t the outbreak of fche war American people travelY o u ought to put Cook at ling in Europe had cashed their letters of credit, bills of exchange, and other instruI have great ments of financial transfer, but those bills had not been returned, and America had nofc paid them. The American bankers consulted together, and sent £40,000,000 to Canada, and the American debt was liquidated. The editor of the London Statist, one of the great financial journals of the world, was sent by Mr Lloyd George to Canada and tlie United States of America to arrange a system of exI could look change with which to carry on the great commerce of those nations. Not only has that American debt been liquidated, not only has millions of pounds' worth of securities passed back to the United States of America and been paid off, but to-day the balance of trade between America and Great Britain is against the latter fco the extent of over §1,000,000,000, and J . P. Morgan, the head of the great banking firm in Wall-street, has been financing the Allies. Gold is an international medium of exchange, and people in foreign countries may refuse to accept any other medium of liquidation. We must not forget that fact. A Yankee who passed through Australia recently told me that the moment he landed in Germany he was compelled to hand over what gold he had. The authorities in Germany have made it apenal offence for an individual to carry gold; they have gatheredtlie whole of tlie gold into the Reichsbank, and have created a gold reserve of £100,000,000. The whole of ""the gold in the Bank of England at the outbreak of the war was £92,000,000. There may be another £90,000,000 worth of gold in the United Kingdom, making a total of £182,000,000. If the whole of that gold were sent to the United States of Americai t would not liquidate Britain's debt to the American people. That instances the need for banking credits. If Australia were properly organized financially, and had a great national banking system, such as I have endeavoured for twenty years to estabor £400,000, lish, and every man in the Commonwealth had an account in that bank, we could carry on the whole commerce of Australia. The greatest currency the world knows is the cheque. To my mind the note-issue is a tin-pot currency. The",22,Pensions Bill No 2 Of Our National Perils Require That We

Mr J. H . CATTS -The Commonwealth Bank has assisted. Mi-. KING O'MALLEY I will admit that the Commonwealth Bank has kept down the interest rate, but my idea of a National Bank is one that carries its operations into the back-blocks, aud helps to put the little man on the land, and to keep him there. Of what use is it to bring immigrants to Australia if thirty or forty of tliem have to wait for one of my houses ? Will any one say that a private business could be carried on with the red-tape, overlapping, duplication, confusion, and conflict of. functions which are characteristic of Government management when incompetent Ministers are in charge ? I have the greatest respect for the officials, but they are men who went straight from their cradles into the service. They started their working life in a Government Department, and they have become official machines. How could they develop initiative ? We ought to consider a reconstruction of tlie Departments from the top down-wards. I would have the courage to go outside and put a business man of the capacity of Mr Knox, the manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, in charge of the Post Office. I would pay him £5,000 a year. I am. not afraid to pay salaries. Napoleon said, ""Man is everything;men are nothing,"" and tlie Kaiser evidently thinks the same, if we are to judge by the way he is having them killed. In regard to party, no doubt, when a man is appointed a Minister, he becomes inflated in his ideas, but day. It is reported that one of our best why cannot private members make suggestions? Why should we pay honourable memhers JE600 a year and bring them here day after day, and yet give them nothing to do ? Why should we not divide this House into Committees on difierent matters as suggested by the honourable member for Cook, and give honourable members some power, and something to do, and then, if some one brings in a Bill containing good ideas, it could be handed over to the Committee of Finance, or to the Committee of Unemployment, or to the Committee, of Foodstuffs, or the Committee of something else. Mr J. H . CATTS -We have a majority here. Ave had not we Avould be more ticklish. Mr J. H . CATTS I mean that these Committees would not endanger party principles. not. What we require is business progress. We. ought to be able to get ideas. When I was in control of the Department of Home Affairs Ai'e had a suggestion box, and offered a reAvard for new ideas as to systematizing or carrying on that great Department in the most expeditious and efficient method, but we got no ideas from that source. The honourable member for Moreton asked me how this came about, and I soon ascertained what the trouble was. If an under fellow makes a suggestion, the big fellow regards it as an insult, and is in fear of being made an excess oflicer, or of not getting an increment or promotion. We must do away with all that. In the saw-mills of America, if two or three men show genius, the manager gives them a separate room, and ' puts others to help them. In the same way, Edison, at his great works, where he ha* 12,000 or 14,000 people employed, picks out any Avho show genius, and puts others to help them, and if they succeed they are eventually made partners. Mr Ford, the great manufacturer of motor cars, pursues the same system; but there are no such opportunities in a Government department.

The only means we have of liquidating our obligations is gold, the international medium of exchange, and the Government may issue a million prohibitions against gold leaving Australia, yet the gold must leave the country if we want to get the things the Austi'alian people require from overseas. My idea is that the States should join setting aside 1,000,000, or 2,000,000, acres of ground, which can be cultivated by the people who are out of employment, and as fast as these people became competent and trained in scientific, chemical farming applied to the raising of big crops, as is done in Germany and France, they could be given the land and settled upon it. This should be done year after year. There should not be any continuance of the waste of the, people's money in ordinary make-shift works started with the idea of giving temporary employment. Temporary employment on make-shift works is a wasting of the wealth of the people of Australia; it is not creating reproductive works. WhatI suggest will put grain into our elevators, and find employment every year for thousands of young men who are now idle; and the sooner we carry out the idea the better.

' main unemployed there only for a day. If a man remains unemployed for three days a constable wants to know why he is unemployed. I do not say that I should like to see that system introduced here. In Germany, if a man is a loafer, he is sent to a place where, for about six months, he is made to work, his earnings being given to his wife. The withdrawal of young men from reproductive works injures the community, because it reduces production to a much greater degree than it diminishes consumption, and, consequently, supplies America, that men withdrawn from reproductive work for military service, and 33,000 unemployed, things naturally increase in price. What is the Government doing to reduce the cost of living? As the honourable member for Cook put it, we cannot do anything without organization, without proper scientific efficiency, and without the mobilization of the instruments of credit and exchange.

169,Mr King O'malley,"Men reParliament can talk, but that will never change anything. Why? Becausei t is not the leading business men nor the thinking men who are given a chance to "" run the show""; it is the expediency men, those who never tread on any one's corns, and never say an unkind word, tlie praying men, who are chosen. How are we going to get efficiency? It seems to me almost impossible. Why should a Minister of State have to ring a bell to summon the Secretary of his Department to tell him what is being done ? Knowledge is power, and power is freedom, and that man in the Department who has knowledge is the boss of the Department. When Napoleon was organizing for his great campaign in Bussia he called Talleyrand to him, and said, "" I do not want you to tell me things; I want to know things for myself."" The digest system and the costing system of the Home Affairs Department will tell what is being done in that Department, if they are kept up. How can you tell the difference between day labour and contract unless you have columns comparing prices of materials, labour, and management, and can strike a balance? Unless you organize your finance you must continue in a slip-shod fashion. Australia will have the highest taxation in the world if she does not systematize-her busiBank has other assets besides the nation's ness and finance, and does not utilize the collective power of the nation for the benefit of the individual.

They are ence to the public demands, to outstanding facts, and to the necessities of a great people. I had hopes that by this time we should have a great Commonwealth Bank to meet any trouble that might arise. We have got part of the banking scheme. The Bank we have is all Tight. I have faith in her. She is Bock of Ages so far as she goes, but she has not gone any distance. She has not spread her wings over this great continent of Australia. the Bank of England to grow. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY -The Bank of England is a private shareholders' bank. It has only a guarantee from the British Government for its note circulation. It is the bank of reserve for the British Government, and for other British banks. The gold of England, Ireland, and Scotland goes into the Bank of England. If any man in the United Kingdom wants gold, he gets it from that bank, and after the gold has been used it drifts back to the bank. The Bank of England controls the exchange of the Empire. ' wealth Bank control the exchange of Australia. great experience of banking business, and I assure the Minister that the Commonwealth Bank, as she is now organized, has not a hope of doing that. She has got to have the capital of the States. You might as well expect a horse to win a race with only three shoes on. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Commonwealth Bank must be a bank of issue, of deposit, of exchange, and of reserve. the Brisbane Conference laid down. If the note issue were connected with the Bank, its position would be different. The credit. It has the nation's credit equally with the Treasury, but, in addition, it has several millions of deposits which gives it another credit. If the Bank had the business of Ausbralia, the business of the Metropolitan Board of Works, of the State Governments, and of other authoWe grieve, rities, the position would be very different. I rose to again urge the Gor vernment not to allow the great opportunity which' now presents itself for improving the position of the Bank to pass unused. The States would be only too the foundation of the Commonwealth, which in itself is nothing. The Commonwealth arose out of the States surrendering certain specified political powers, and now stands over the States. Why should not the Commonwealth and the States try to create a financial system that would be beneficial to all? A great many persons think that the Treasurer of a State ought to go to the banker. If there were a Board on which a representative of each State had a seat, it is natural to suppose that the State representatives would be",27,Pensions Bill No 2 Of Our National Perils Require That We

I regretfchafcthe Commonwealth Bank was not established on lines such as he laid down, because, had it been, it would be stronger and better for the people than it is. I have always favoured a Commonwealth Bank. I congratulate the honourable member for Cook on his plain speaking. thing if we had a little more plain speaking occasionally from honourable members on both sides. I rose to ask the Postmaster-General to tell ma why he is cutting down the allowances of postmasters and postmistresses 1 Last night he fenced m.y questions by saying that the payments of £ 1 4 and £ 1 0 that are made to these persons do not constitute salaries, but are merely allowances. It is only juggling w it h words to make such an excuse. pected to take this money as an allowance, and to engage in some occupation other fchan conducting the post-offices of which they have charge, in order to earn a living. the Post Office at one time; and, if my memory serves me aright, even when the revenue fell, it was laid down as a golden rule that these allowances should not be reduced until a new postmaster or postmistress was necessary, and the smaller amount was then offered. In my opinion it is despicable, in the case of an old and -tried-servant sometimes of thirty-or forty years' standing, who has to handle a dozen or .two dozen, mail bags a week, and to attend fche office from 9 in the morning fco 6 afc night, and often later, to reduce the allowance by a few shillings. or a few pouuds a year. I trust that the Postmaster-General wil l look into this business, and refuse to be bound by red tape. The honourable gentleman has told us tliat he knows that the mail contractors, owing to fche increased price of fodder and the increased cost of living, have had a very bad time, and that he finds it necessary to come to the assistance of some of them. By the way, there does not appear to be much tangible proof of any snch assistance being handed out to contractors; and if it is not speedily forthcoming, we shall find that many of the contractors' horses are dead, and their bondsmen bankrupt. I do not blame the Postmaster-General for the present state of affairs; I can only.think that he is not aware of the facts. I ask him, however, whether he considers it fair, to make all calculations of the kind on the basis of the revenue earned. If there are a few less letters in the mail bag, that does not make the work any the less; and my opinion is that the allowance should be according to the work done, and not according to the revenue derived from the work. I do not wish to cavil or_ find It would be a good fault, but there is something radically wrong, and it ought to be probed to the bottom; otherwise it would be better to have a Commission to r u n the Post Office on business lines. for the country districts! not.

180,Mr Austin Chapman,"The honPostmaster-General has a thorough knowledge of country conditions, and I believe that he does his best, and that it is the system that is to blame. It is certainly not right to "" rob Peter to pay Paul ""to take money from theseallowance-office people and give it to the mail contractors. This matter has been d r if t in g on for about six months; and now notices have been sent out to those who run these post offices, informing them that their allowance of from £ 1 0 to £ 2 0 , or so, is to be reduced. stances in Eden-Monaro, and I cannot suppose that that district has been singled out for this kind of treatment. The Postmaster-General ought to find out all about this regulation. In every case these people have to provide office, light, and so forth , for a paltry pittance of, in many cases, from 5s. to 10s. a week, although they have long hours and plenty of work. The honourable member for Gippsland will doubtless receive some communications on this subject, because, I suppose, similar reductions must have been made in his electorate. does not take action after what has been said to-day, he must take the blame. Some of the officers of the Department require "" shaking u p , "" for a change is urgently necessary in postal matters and administration. I see it is proposed to meet any loss by increasing the telephone rates. Of course, it is. . easy, monopoly, to do that sort of t h in g ; but . it will not make the Postmaster-General's Socialistic ideas any more palatable to the people. If the Department were run on proper business lines, it would not be necessary to increase the telephone or any other rates, because, under private management, the business would be made to pay handsomely. I ask the Postmaster General to. remind the Treasurer that twelve months ago I had a motion before the House to increase old-age and in valid pensions by half-a-crown a week. A t the subsequent elections, the' Government and their supporters told the electors that the pensions would be in creased; but, although the proposal found a place in the Governor General's Speech, nothing more has been done. The Government must know that, owing to the increased cost of living, .many of the pensioners are practically half-starved; and, as a result of my repeated efforts to effect a reform, I am told that the matter will be dealt with in a financial statement to be made. I appeal to the PrimeM in ister to give the pensioners a f a i r deal, because they cannot keep .body and soul together on 10s. a week. I think it inopportune on the part of the houorable member for Cook to cast blame upon the Government. Our mission at this time should be to help the Government; and I do not criticise M in isters, because I know the difficulties that they are facing. I can say, personally, I could give forty or fifty in that I am not tied in any way, and, in anything they do for the benefit of the country, they w ill have my generous support. As to the allowance post-offices, I can only say that if any private individual did to his employees what is done in the Department, he would be hounded out of the country with shame. I have been told of men being pinned down to mistakes they have made, and so treated that they have absolutely committed suicide. I do not wish to mention any particular oflicials, but I shall be obliged to do so unless there is some change in the adI f the Postmaster-General ministration. It is regarded as unfair to mention officers here, where they cannot speak for themselves, but, unless there be an alteration, in my district, at any rate, I shall give the Postmaster General names, so that he may be prepared to defend the officers when I refer to the matter in the House. There is too much false delicacy here; and offiin the case of a cers, not only in this, but in other Departments, are inclined to shelter themselves behind the parliamentary custom to which I have referred. I ask the Postmaster-General to display some strength, and "" p l a y the game"" fairly-to give the same consideration to postal officials that he would to men in his private employ. I am sure that, as Postmaster General, he is paying allowance men and women as.he would not dream of paying them as an individual. not intended to speak, but I do not wish my vie^ws to be misrepresented. After hearing the honourable member f b r Eden Monaro, and also various Postmasters General, I can only wish that honourable members would hold the same opinion in office tliat they do when in Opposition.

AmI not to be protected against such statements? honourable member is so old a member of Parliament that he knows the rules of debate must be obeyed, and he has broken one of those rules. to you, sir, I withdraw the words, but I must ask that the lionorable member for Gippsland be compelled to withdraw his statement, which does not represent the facts. the honourable member for Gippsland said anything offensive? Does the honourable member for Eden-Monaro say that what the honourable member for Gippsland said was offensive? honourable member stated that the same conditions.that are now complaine'd about were existent when I was Postmaster General. I say that that was not so; and I ask him to accept my assurance. lionorable member's assurance, that is all; but I shall tell him presently of something that was worse when he was in office than it is at the present time, so far as the representatives of country districts are concerned. As I was saying, these allowance offices have always been a difficulty. Long before the present Postmaster-General was in office I heard it stated that these allowances are not intended to .be living salaries, but merely as a return for some little extra work post-offices supposed to be attached to some private business. The trouble is fallen into thc hands of women who have nothing else to do, and to whom the allowance has really become their only means of subsistence. Looked at from that point of view, the allowances are altogether inadequate. In country districts tached to stores, and prove a great draw to the business; and, as I say, the allowances are based on the idea that they are a small remuneration for some extra trouble. Over and over again I have heard Postmasters-General say that the allowances are not intended, and do not profess, to be living salaries. At the same time, I cordially agree with the denunciations of the reductions that are made from time to time. Some of them are exceedingly petty. I know of one case where, because the business had fallen off as compared with that of the preceding year, the allowance of £5 a year was reduced by £1. It is a pettifogging thing for a great Commonwealth to insist upon a reduction of £1 per annum in any individual's alloAvance, and I think that alltliese matters might very well be looked into, so that some general rule might be adopted upon the subject. Another matter of objection relates to country premises token by persons who believed the post-office allowances are fixed. These offices may have other businesses attached to them, and in many cases they change hands on the understanding that the old allowance will continue. When the busidenly find that their allowance is reduced by £6 or £7 below the amount that they expected to get, for no apparent reason. Only a day or two ago I sent a complaint to the Department on behalf of such a person, whose allowance had been reduced £3 or £4 below what his predecessor got. I think the Postmaster-General ought, in the first place, to lay down a definite rule that no reduction' shall be made in the",30,Pensions Bill No 2 Of Our National Perils Require That We

192,Mr Wise,"I shall have to accept the.allowances to any office unless there has heen such a reduction in the amount of husiness as to raise the question of whether the office shall be discontinued altogether or not. With regard to the suggestion, that the Post Oflice ought to be managed by a Board of Commissioners, I join issue completely with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, as I do with every other honourable member of this House who attempts to argue in favour of the appomtment of Commissioners. If Commissioners are appointed they will be told to run the Post Office"" on business lines""-to make the post offices pay. We hear that demand made continually in the metropolitan newspapers, and that demand, if acceded to, means that the metropolis will receive ali sorts of additional conveniences, whilst people living in country districts will be deprived of many of their conveniences. As a resident in a country district in Victoria which knows something of the methods of Railway Commissioners, I say emphatically that I Post Office being handed over to Commissioners acting independently of Parliament, in order that it may be run on what are known as business lines. We have seen enough of that sort of management in Victoriai n connection with the railways. Country people cannot get anything like an adequate train service, yet the lines are duplicated and other conveniences are provided for the people out at Caulfield. Whereas all sorts of accommodation is provided in Melbourne, we in country districts are denied an efficient railway service because, we are told, "" it will not pay."" That is why I oppose the idea of the Post Office being handed over to Commissioners. As long as Parliament has as one of its members a responsible Postmaster-General we shall have some hold over the Postal Department, and have some means of having attention paid to complaints from country districts. A few moments ago I said I would mention one matter that, from the point of view of the country districts, is infinitely better now than it was when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was in oflice. I refer to the telephone system. Previous to the second Eisher Government coming into office, country applicants for telephone , lines were told that their applications would be granted provided that they would guarantee to refund the whole of any deficiency. The second Eisher Government reduced that guarantee required to one of 50 per cent, of the deficiency, which was a very great consideration, and I have never failed to give credit to this Government for having made that reduction. I think, however, tliat no guarantee ought to be required at all. I ouly rose for the purpose of clearing up what would have been a misrepresentation of my views as they would, appear from the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, as they may be read in Hansard. I desire that it shall be clearly understood that, in my opinion, the Postal Department is not a Department that ought to be run for the purpose of being made to pay. The Department was established for the purpose of furthering the social and commercial intercourse of the people, and the places where the services of the Post Office are mostly required, and are of most value to the individual, are in those country diswill always protest against the tricts where the post-office does not pay, and where it probably will not pay for very many years. The large surpluses made in the cities could not be better expended than in giving better postal communication to country districts, and I hope that we shall soon reach the time when, wherever there is a reasonable settlement, the people there will not only have a decent mail service, but decent telephonic communication as well, without their being called upon to contribute anything by way of a guarantee. I quite recognise that people who reside in the back-blocks do not go there from motives of philanthropy. They go there, just as other people reside in towns, to make a living for themselves, but we ought not to forget that, whatever the motive that takes these people, into the back-blocks, they are doing a great work in developing the country for the benefit of the Commonwealth as a whole. I think, therefore, that such people deserve the very greatest sympathy and support both from State and Federal Governments-fro m the State Government in the way of good roads and good railway communication, and from the Federal Government in the provision of reasonable mail and telephonic communication. [5.37] I desire to say a word or two on the subject of the Post Office, and I want to endorse all that has been said upon the subject by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I li?iv*» brought this matter before the Postmaster-General on several occasions by way of questions, and I can only express my regret that the Minister does not show more practical sympathy with certain Post Office employees who, in my judgment, have been treated by the Government in a very off-hand and arbitrary fashion. The amount paid to the postal agents in! the country is very small, and the services they render cannot be calculated by the number of letters which pass through their offices. To apply such a test to them is not f a i r at all. Under the present system of payment, no account is taken of the rooms provided or of the constant attention necessary if the work is to be properly and adequately done. It is quite possible that in some country districts the number of letters is not large, but will the Miuister say that the Governmeut should be entirely guided by that in fixing the remuneration ? all. D r. CAR TY SALMON diflereut matters that have to be taken into consideration. D r . CARTY SALMON -Then I w ill leave letters out. I think I am safe in saying that the number of telephone messages is taken into account in any calculation made in regard to payment. agaiu, suoh a test cannot be a fair one, because these people have to be at their offices from 9 o'clock in the morning t ill 6 o'clock at night. Whether they receive a message or not, they must be on the spot to take any message that may come, and, in my view, they should be paid as any other workman is paid. I would like the Minister to say whether he thinks it right that any workman should be paid, not for the time that is spent in attending to his work, but for the actual exertion which he puts for t h in order that his work may be accomplished. engaged. D r . CARTY SALMON -The Mimster forgets that where there is a telephone these people must be there ready to answer the telephone. own premises, going about their own business. D r .

Business management does not mean that we ought to grind the last ounce out of our people in order that the Department may show a profit; it means that we should provide, at the least possible cost to the State, the greatest convenience to the people.

It was he who had the courage to run country telephone lines along wayside fences, and to suspend them from trees, and but for his action we should not have been able in many country districts to secure the modern convenience of the telephone.

White the -guarantee is no longer required, the people to be served by a proposed line are called upon to bear tlie whole cost of constructing it on the understanding that they will be recouped upon its completion, and they have to wait months for their money. Within my own experience, during the present year, people have been kept waiting for their money six months after the completion and passing of a line. This is not business management. It does not show a proper realization of the obligations that are part of every contract. I wish now to refer to the question of casual employment. I mentioned in the House to-day the case of a man who had been working as a casual letter carrier in the town of Maryborough until a week or two ago, when the term for which he could be temporarilyemployed under the Act came to a close. He then lefC, and in his place a strapping, stalwart young fellow, unmarried, and, so far as I am aware, without any dependant, or any obligation, was appointed. The man whom he succeeded has a wife and eight children to support. The Minister should, at this time, give sympathetic consideration to cases of this character. People1 are suffering because of the increased cost of living. Act which governs the position. there are ways of getting over the difficulty. similar cases. the difficulty in this case might, at least, have been minimized. The postmaster at Maryborough should have been advised by the Department that preference must be given to a man who has a number dependent upon him. Had that been done, although the married man to whom I have referred would not have been able to continue in the employment of the service, I think that another, with something like the same responsibility, would have been appointed in his stead. Asi t is, there are two casual employees in the Maryborough Post-office, both of whom are single, andj so far as I know, have no obligations. I recognise that questions of this kind are dealt with, not by the Postmaster-General, or the officers at the head of his Department, but by -the 'local postmasters. They are left to make a selection, but a direction from the Postmaster General that special consideration should be given at this juncture to cases of the kind I have mentioned would meet with a very ready response, and do a great deal of good. During the last few weeks applications for casual employment have been more numerous than in normal circumstances, and I ask the Government whether they intend to continue the rule that every applicant for casual employment in the Public Service shall be a member of a recognised or registered union. I recognise that the Government and their party are pledged to the principle, but I would put it to them that their duty to the country as a whole is even above such a pledge. . pointment of doctors?

I have not risen for the purpose of directing unfair criticism at the PostmasterGeueral and his staff, because I think that, under existing conditions, we have set them an unduly heavy task; but I do think that remedial steps in regard to the country services could be taken even under the present system. If it is true that the loss on the operations of the Postal Department is mainly due to unprofitable city services, that trouble could surely be overcome. My conviction is that a great mistake was made in instituting penny postage. This huge Department is doing a pioneering work throughout Australia by assisting to bring about conditions which make life in the country more tolerable. Its work is reflected in property values and unimproved values, and some subsidy from the State or the shire councils might be given if the system of penny postage is fco be He is too truly sympathetic to retained.

I understand The man was driven from the Postmaster-General that the actual quantity of mail matter carried is the basis upon which payment to the In railway authorities is made. The same quantity of mail matter is being delivered at Grenfell, and presumably, at other towns similarly situated, as heretofore, and surely the onus of making arrangements for a daily delivery should have been placed on the State Government, 1 which receives money for carrying the mails. The Department; runs stock and freight trains on days when there is no passenger service, and if the onus of delivering the mails daily were pufc on the State Government, they would provide a means of carriage. In any case, a duty is cast upon the Postmaster-General of providing some sort of makeshift mail on fche off days. of contract between the Commonwealth and the State Government? State Government carries the same quantity of mail matter in three days as it carried in six, and receives the same payment.

264,Mr Lynch,"I understand that tbeof. the service has been so great, that, the residents of Grenfell are offering to subsiput my own saddle horse in its place. dize a motor service from Cowra in order tp. secure a, daily delivery. I know that the problem of finance is at the back of allthese troubles. One suggestion that appeals to me, and which might be cf assistance to the Postmaster-General, is that the Department should be; a little less, liberal in regard to the parcel post system, by which the whole of the country districts throughout. Australia are deluged. Everybody who-can do so sends to Sydney for hisi goods, and the life, of a country mail contractor has become scarcely tolerable. Contractors' vehicles are loaded up like ships, of the desert with parcels from the city stores, and the people who avail themselves mest of this service are those who are for ever preaching decentralization. With the remarks which have been made by the honourable member for Grampians on the subject of the inadequateallowances to: country storekeepersand others who. attend to postal duties I am in full sympathy, but one of the chief grievances of these people in bush offices is that, under the regulation, they are not allowed to have on; hand postal notes above a certain total; value, I think £10, at any time. Consequently, on account of the huge parcel-nost business, they do not have sufficient postal notes with which to meet the local demand pending the arrival of a second supply. The parcel-post system, not only injures the country storekeeper, but also effectively retards development of country interests, because, our practice being so different from our professions, farmers who profess willingness to deal „ a death-blow to the ascendency of the city subscribe to that ascendency on. every occasion on which they can save a penny by using the parcels post. Those people who run country mails in sulkies or twohorse coaches through most inaccessible parts, where traffic .is almost impossible in a bad winter, are entitled to our greatest sympathy, and I am glad that they have been promised some financial assistance. I hope that something will be done soon to give them relief. A few months ago, while riding along a country road, I encountered a mail contractor who had been striving to get along in the diffition and criticism levelledagainst it. I culties that I have just described. His horse was dead in the sulky shafts, and in order that His Majesty'smails might Mr Lynch. reach their destination, I had, perforce, to The principle on which these contracts for conveying bush mails are let is rotten. It allows indiscriminate sweating. In a good season a man who is a bit of a horse dealer will tender for half-a-dozen small mail services, and he can carry on so long as feed is plentiful and there is plenty of cheap, what I may term, second hand labour available, especially when he undertakes the business as an adjunct to horsetrading ; but in times of extreme difficulty such as we now have his position is. pitiable. Many of these men have been absolutely ruined. As people in outlying districts are entitled to something in the shape of an effective mail service, I suggest that the Postmaster-General should get his capable officers to make an. estimate of the actual cost of running each mail, and the amount of revenue derived, and that tenders should be called on fixed prices for each contract, with specifications which, it should be intimated, are to be rigidly enforced. In any case, I should not allot more than one mail service to any particular individual in a town or village, because one mail service under such circumstances is one man's job-. We have a greater feeling of confidence in the effectiveness of the service where the contractor is running it than we can have when the work is done by a man who is receiving 15s. a week, and carries it out in an ineffective way until such time as he gets into disgrace. Day after day mails are not delivered; coaches break down, and things happen that should not happen. All these things militate against the country districts, and make life there less endurable. I recognise that these reforms can only be effected if we provide the sinews of war, but if it is true that the loss sustained by the Postal Department is in the city service, a re-arrangement of rates ought to insure something like a fair opportunity being afforded to this huge Department to carry out its legitimate and all-necessary functions for the country people. The Postal Department, being one with which every individual in the Commonwealth has dealings, has the fiercest denunciado not think that it should be placed under a Commission. Notwithstanding that much can be said of the disabilities imposed' upon people in country districts , in*s my. opinion their positionwould' be in finitely worse if the> Post Office were placedunder the business managementof a> set of Commissioners, because w© recognise in some degree that, in thedevelopment of a huge continent, the tentacles 1 of advancedcivilization must precede settlement in order to render it possible-, and, therefore, theremusb be loss-, for However, if it be true that this loss is< greater in the city than in the country, a state of affairs-is'revealed that doesnocredit to' the system at present in operation. I hope that the Post"" master-General will stay his hand in the matter ofcurtailing allowances to keepers of little country post-offices. To measure the amount of work done by these people who place their homes at the disposal of the Department for the convenienceof the people by that done by experts who are specialistsat the work in city offices', isi u n f a i r ; that work furnishes a very poor standard' on which to pay these peoplewho are doing such essential' work for countrypeople. If the Department errsat all in regard to the treatment of these people it should err on the side ofliberality. Finally-, I hope that something w ill be done in the matter of giving important towns on railway lines, such as Grenfell, f a r better services than have been possible under a system which is all to the advantage of the State, and' not to tlie advantage of the Postal Department's revenue. not-the slightest ideaof speaking until the with unionism. honourable member for Grampians raised again the question of preferenceto it is an association. unionists, and said something which we had often heard before in this Mouse.

Dr. Axham was a gentleman seventy years of age and of irreproachable character, who had practised as a doctor for f if t y years, and had served his oountry in various ways. He was brought before the executive of the British Medical Association because of his connection with a Mr Barker, a man who, although without medical diplomas, was a most wonderful bone-setter. Mr Barker's practice was not confined to the ignorant and illiterate; he had, among his patients, a number of well-known persons, such as Lord William Cecil, Lady Exeter, and Count Gleichen. Barker invited medical men to attend and witness his operations, and Dr. Axham, amongst others, availed himself of the privilege, and was so impressed by what he saw that he devoted forty-five afternoons to attending further demonstrations. anaesthetic, a good deal of pain was attendant upon his operations, and Dr. Axham, noticing this, suggested that anaesthetics should be administered. Mr Barker was only too glad to comply with the suggestion, and at his invitation D r . Axham gave anaesthetics. For this he was brought to book by the British Medical Association. When he was summoned into the judgment-hall, the proceedings were these-He was asked, "" Have you anything to say? "" and replied, "" I have nothing to add to the statement that I have already made in w r it in g . "" was not prepared to dissociate himself from Mr Barker, he was asked to leave the room while the General Medical Council considered its decision, and a little later was recalled, when the president of the council saidMr Axham, I have to inform you that the Council have judged you to have been guilty of infamous conduct in a professional respect, and have directed the Registrar to erase from the Medical Eegister the. name of Frederick William Axham. The removal of his name from the register made it impossible for the doctor to continue in the employment of the Government, although he still possessed his medical qualifications and his career for fifty years had been a most one. On one occasion he had received an honorarium of £700 from the Government for work done among the troops. Mr Thomas. But, as he had given anaesthetics to patients of Mr Barker, the General Medical Council erased his name from the register of the British Medical Association, and thus forced h i m to resign all his Government appointments. In view of the statements of. the honourable member for Grampians, I thought it would be interesting to draw attention to what the medical fraternity is prepared to do in support of unionism. I hope we shall not again hear it stated that the Government, in giving preference to unionists in regard to public employment, are dealing unfairly with the money of the taxpayers. I have merely to add that the British Parhament has passed an Act Mr which makes it impossible for any person to obtain or retain a Government medical appointment unless he has the qualifications of a doctor and his name is on the register of the British Medical Association. As Mr Barker employed no While the honourable member for Grampians was speaking, the honourable member for Werriwa made an interjection in regard to the attitude of the British Medical Association towards. friendly societies which the honourable member for Grampians said was not t r u e ; but I am in a position to show that the statement of the honourable member for Werriwa was absolutely correct. I had the honour to be the first president of the Australian Natives' Association in New South Wales, whose motto is Pro patria semper. A leading medical man, a native of AusAs he tralia, joined the association, being rippointed medical officer of the No. 1 branch in Sydney, and shortly afterwards he was informed by the British Medical Association that if he did not resign that position he would not be recognised by other doctors, and they would not appear in consultation with him. The members of the British Medical Association were prepared, no matter how serious the case, to decline to consult with this doctor should a consultation be necessary in the interest of a patient. The dispute continued for some time, and the matter became so grave that, had I not entered the Federal arena, I should have introduced into the New South Wales Parliament a Bil l to compel the British Medical Assohonorable ciation to withdraw from its position. The association has come into conflict, not only with the Australian Natives' Association, but also with the'Foresters, the ,t",40,Moloney Generally I F To Be Prepared To Say That We W I L L Intro
271,Mr Chanter (Riverina) [7.53],"Oddfellows, and kindred organizations, and has adopted the same attitude towards them. If the honourable member for Grampians will allow his memory to travel back to the period to which I have referred, he will know that the facts are absolutely as I have stated them. As president of the Australian Natives' Association, I took part in innumerable conferences with members of the British Medical Association in the endeavour to bring about a reasonable state of affairs. I regret that the Postmaster-General is not present, because I wish to say-something about the allowance given to those in charge of what are known as allowance -post-offices. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro and others have dealt with the subject, but the impression has been left in the minds' of many honourable members that the persons to whom the allowance is paid have means of. living other than their connection with the Postal Department. I am aware that many of them are not dependent for their livelihood on their connection with the Postal Department, and I do not speak for those; but the Postmaster-General should do .something for persons who are wholly dependent for their living on what they receive from the Department. Let me mention a case which has been brought under notice on several occasions. There is in the Barrier division-it was formerly in the Riverina divisiona place at the junction of three, or four important mail routes, such as those to Hay, Balranald, and other places, where there is no township, but only a couple of houses. The post-office used to be in charge of the local hotel keeper and storekeeper. But this combined store and hotel was situated some 12 miles from Deniliquin, and honourable members know that in country hotels scenes sometimes occur which parents would not like young children to witness, and the people living round about were in the habit of sending their children, sometimes young girls, to the hotel for their mails. I brought the matter under the notice of the then Post-. master-General, and it was decided that a widow lady living in the place should be allowed to look after the postal business, which she undertook to do. She'has been doing so ever since. In the first place, she got what might be termed a living allowance, though, in my opimon, it was not sufficient, and since then it has been very seriously reduced. She is on duty from 4 o'clock in the morning u n t i l half-past 9 o'clock at n i g h t; and, very often, in the winter, until 10 or 11 o'clock she has to be on duty to receive and despatch mails amounting to something like fifteen or sixteen bags every day. Then from half-past 9 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening she has to be there to answer telephone calls. She provides her own dwellinghouse, office, and all necessary appliances; and, as it is necessary, in view of her early rising, that she should have some rest, she has to pay a boy 2s. 6d. a week to give her some relief from the last-mentioned duty. She has no store, and. cannot add to her income in any way. I may add that there has never been the slightest complaint about the work or attention at tlie office; and all this unfortunate woman is allowed is 16s. a week. A case like this-ari d there are others-is not creditable to any Department, no matter what the laws or regulations may be. this office? statement is made that the revenue does not warrant any increase; but, in my opinion, it is not a question of whether the revenue will warrant any increase, because the residents in these isolated districts should have as much consideration from the Department as have those who are more favourably situated in the large cities. If this woman, to-morrow, were to refuse to continue her duties any longer, there would be a great outcry in the district, and the Department would be compelled to provide a postmaster and post office at two or three times the present' expenditure. Formerly this lady did not feel her position so much because she had some sons, but these have since died, and all she has to rely on is what she receives from the Department. I have previously asked the Postmaster-General, and I ask him again, to put aside the regulations altogether in cases such as I have described. This person is doing the country's work, and we ought, at least, to give her an allowance to enable her to live decently. Such a state of affairs would' not be creditable to any Government, and it certainly is discreditable to the present Ministers, who have always claimed to look after the interests of those who cannot look after themselves. I hope I shall not be again called upon to allude to this matter, but, if I am, and there is any",41,Moloney Generally I F To Be Prepared To Say That We W I L L Intro

273,Mr Chanter,"I do not know. Theundue delay in dealing with it , I shall have to take a course which I should' not like to take, not only on behalf of this particular person, but on behalf of many others similarly situated'. the suggestion that the keepers of these country offices' should be treated more generously. In my own district, we find very great difficulty-thoug h our . trouble is somewhat different from that which has been disclosed this evening. We find that we do not get from some railway offices that attention we have the right to expect. Preference is given to railway business; and, in one instance, that of a newly-opened line, the people are so disgusted that they threaten to give up the use of the office. I have received a letter, the writer of which tells me that he had to ride 8 miles to another office in order to get through a message of importance. I am sorry to say that there is not that cooperation there ought to be between the State and the Federal authorities. I came to this Parliament under the belief that the blame' was more with the Commonwealth, but I have had reason to alter that view. In my own State, at any rate, it would seem' that the Railway Department is benton making as much money as possible out of the Commonwealth, in stead' of co-operating to give the people in sparsely settled districts proper telephonic and: postal facilities. I hold that the telephones, the telegraph, the Post Office; and the; railways should all be combined to make life bearable in undeveloped districts, because, u n t i l something like that is done, we cannot expect settlement to progress. It is a mistake, I think, to in troduce a spirit of commercialism, which can be altogether overdone. The proper point of view is that, if we facilitate settlement in the country, the Treasury, through the Customs House, will be recouped for whatever loss may occur; at any rate, if we do not make life tolerable in the bush, we cannot expect the country to be developed as it should be. I hope the Postmaster-General will not look at this matter too closely from the poundsshillings-and-pence point of view, b u t w ill strive to give the people those facilities for communication to which they are entitled, and look f b r his reward in extended settlement. to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the conditions obtaining attheallowanceoffice at WestEnd', in my electorate. Thepostmistress there is in receipt of £ 8 0 per annum, outof which shehas to pay 18s. a week as rents 1 She has been ill for some months; and I support the Departmentat first refused to pay either rent or allowance during that period. Tliis is a thickly populated district, and considerable business is* done at this post-office. It is t r u e that' the Postmaster-General has practically agreed to pay the rental during the period of the illness, but he has refused to' make any allowance whatever. the premises? ductionsi are made, the salary, of this woman amounts to only 13s. l ^ d . per week, so that, even if it werepaid for the f u l l period of the sickness, I do not think it could be described as any great generosity. The Department has. to-night been severely criticised, but I think that, son, we may find some recommendation to increase, the charges* in certain directions, so as to permit of larger allowances being made. There are, unfortunately, many similar cases throughout the country. I am not altogether surprisedto learn that the Department is. not. in a position to pay larger salaries, or allowances u n t i l some change has been made im regard to thg» charges levied for services it renders. I hope, that the Postmaster-General w ill , in. the near future, consider some reformsi n thisdirection.

Perth, to Geraldton, there is a privately owned railway, and a Government railway from Geraldton to the Murchison, where the people are responsible for a very large quantity of mail matter. Some few years ago the Western^ Australian Government authorized the construction of this railway of 198 miles, running parallel with the Midland railway, and nowthis State railway connects with the Murchison railway. way was constructed that the Commonwealth Government would assist in every 1 possible way instead of patronizing privately-owned railways. If the Postal Department would only have the mails to the 1 1 Murchison field' carried by this railway ; there would, I think, be a sufficient amount of mail matter to justify even the nrice for carriage that the Railway Commissioners are charging at the present time. But the Department prefer to carry the mails, not only for the Murchison, but for the large area which has been opened, up by the new railway, by other means-. In the first instance, the mails are carried toa place called Moora by the Midland railway; then they are taken east' adistance of 30 miles by motor, which also runs alongside the railway a distance of 40 miles more in a northerly direction. Further north, at Three Springs, motors are? similarly sent out and. connected with the railway to the east. We are all agreed that the States should own the railways, and-surely it-is a most unbusinesslike thing to. have four or five trains running weekly over thislarge area, none of them carrying any mail"" matter, while the Postal Department is willing to'pay £90 0 or £1,10 0 a year for motor cars. I admit this price is cheaper than the price that would have to be paid 1 according to the railway contractof £ 7 10s. per mile entered into somesix or seven years ago; but if the Western Australian Government and the present postal administration had any desire to help those who are trying to develop the back country of Western Australia, some arrangement could very easily be come to between the Railway Commissioners and the Postmaster-General. arrangement apply to the whole of the should be an agreement between the Postmaster-General and the States that wherErom Midland Junction, near ever railway trains r u n they should carry mail matter. It seems absurd to have trains running, over large distances, as they do in Western Australia--and I believe the observation applies also to Queensland-whils t at the same time the postal authorities pay for motor cars to carry the mail matter over practically, the same route. I feel quite satisfied, that the Postmaster-General has only to ask in order to secure an alteration in the terms of the old agreement.

I do not desire to reflect upon members of the Commonwealth Parliament, but State members had a better knowledge of the requirements of the people in the various States than members of this Parliament can, in a general way, possibly have. Nevertheless, I think the Prime Minister will agree with me that it is absurd for a State Government to be running trains into the back country whilst the Postmaster-General at tlie same time has a fleet of motor cars chasing them. I am quite sure that if proper representations were made the difficulty could be got over, and that the State Government of Western Austraha would be only too happy to come to some terms with the Postal Department so that this grievance, which affects many parts of Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, could be got over. ister for Lands in Western will be in Melbourne in the course of a day or two. If the Postmaster-General will only see him, and show some interest in this subject. I think he will he able to do something. Honourable members know the difficulties which people living in the back country have to contend with. Yet the position is such that, whilst the State has spent half-a-million of money in opening out this particular district in Western Australia, the Commonwealth is so mean that it will not spend even £5,000 in constructing a telephone line along the railway. Such treatment to people who are trying to develop the country is not fair. In case of sickness or accident, two or three days is now occupied in sending a message for the doctor. Ten or eleven days, or even a fortnight, has often to elapse before a reply can be received to a letter sent to Perth. During the past two years these people have had a most disastrous time. Nearly every one has had to appeal to the Government for food and seedwheat to enable them to carry on, and if anything can be done to give relief in this particular matter, it ought to be done. The question is not altogether one of finance, though I believe if an agreement were entered into with the State Government, money would be saved. The trains have to run whether they carry mail matter or not, and, as I said before, surely some arrangement can be arrived at under which the expense of running both trains and motor Mr Gregory. cars through the same districts can be obviated. This is the second or third time that I have ventilated this anomaly, and I hope, in the interests of the people who are doing so much to build up this portion of the Commonwealth, more attention will now be given to it . am sorry the Postmaster-General is not in the House, but perhaps the Prime Minister will be good enough to give some attention to the matter I desire to bring under the notice of his colleague. The case I have in mind is a pretty' hard one. A constituent of mine, whilst temporarily employed by the Post Office, had his leg broken by a telephone post falling upon him. He went to the hospital, where he contracted pleurisy and pneumonia. When he was discharged from the hospital he worked for some time as a casual half-time employee, reMr Johnson, Minceiving 27s. 6d. per week-that , whilst Australia, the Labour Government was in power! Again and again appeals were made that he should be given full time. Four oi five officials at Ballarat stated they could find full time for him. It did not matter, however, what the officials said, the request could not get past somebody in the Department, and the man, who has six children to keep, was kept on half time. full time on account of ill-health ? worked full time on the class of employment they were giving him. He was injured before the Compensation Act came into'force, and up to that time was treated fairly well. He was paid wliile in the hospital, and afterwards wais employed on full time, but subsequently he was given halftime employment. During the last few months his illness has developed considerably, mainly on account of the cold he contracted in the hospital, and he is now lying in a tent, receiving nothing. He had 27s. 6d. per week for about twelve months, and during the last few months has been unable to earn anything at all. I have appealed to the Postmaster-General for special consideration to be given to this case. No private employer would have treated his employee as the Postal Department has treated this man, for where a private employer is fairly well off he does not allow any employee who meets with an accident to lie in a tent without having a single penny piece, and I appeal to the Prime Minister to give",44,Moloney Generally I F To Be Prepared To Say That We W I L L Intro

Appeals are being made for volunteers, and it is stated i u this notification that pensions to soldiei s who are killed w ill be, in the case of lieutenants, £91 a year.

There is one set of cases not covered by these regulations. I refer to the position of a gir l whose parents have died, leaving her to act as the guardian of a young family of brothers and sisters. I know of one case where a lad has gone to the front , and his sister, who is in the position of guardian to the rest of the family, cannot obtain the separation allowance. When I brought this matter forward the M in ister for the Navy suggested that I should raise it when we were dealing with the amending PensionsB ill . As a matter of fact, it has nothing to do with pensions, or with the War Pensions Act. The separation allowance was fixed by regulation, and all that is necessary is to so alter that regulation as to meet the case of guardians, situated as this young woman is. Surely a girl, who is in charge of a small family of brothers and sisters, without mother or father to care for them, should be entitled to the separation allowance where her brother, who has been acting as the breadwinner of the family, goes to the front. I trust that the Prime Minister will give his attention to these matters. Question resolved in the negative. WAR CENSUS BILL . .

I do not wish to compare the honourable member for Brisbane to a toothless cattledog, but the way in which he approached this question last night reminded me very much of such an incident as I have described. He approached again and again what he seemed to regard as a proposal most dangerous to the people of Australia, yet he never once closed with the subject. It appears to me that those who really do believe in liberty-thos e who stand for freedom-mus t accept this measure. It is strange that I should be found supporting something which the present Attorney-General has proposed. relent. may relent, and the Attorney-Generali n this case has certainly relented. An y man having at heart the interests of, not only Australia, but the Empire as a whole, would' feel constrained to support this, measure, no matter by what party it was introduced. We are not fighting for liberty in the ordinary sense of the term, individual freedom as it exists under the ordinary processes of government. We are fighting, in reality, against greatest menace with which modern civilization has been confronted, and even those who raise their cries of liberty ought surely to wake up to the fact that Australia to-day is.being menaced in a way that cannot be overstated. Things at the fron t may or may not be progressing well for us. It is very difficult for us at this distance from ' the scene of operations to ascertain the truth . But, whether all is well or not, the position is so serious that we must be prepared to put aside the things which under ordinary circumstances would count, and brace ourselves to meet tlie actual position that confronts us to-day. It seems to me to be positively childish for any honourable members to say, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong and the honourable member for Brisbane did yesterday, that we must beware of this measure and deal with it cautiously. When we have ringing in our ears the shrieks of outraged Belgium and broken France, and when the blood of our own boys is being spilled on the hills of Gallipoli-ar e we to discuss this measure in -academic terms, as if the position that it is designed to meet were something altogether remote? If we' approach the consideration of this question from the lowest possible planefrom the stand-point of 'the safety of Australia alone, and not from considerations .for the -safety of civilization as a whole has made a great mistake in his reference to me. I gave the BiU my wholehearted support, saying that I would support it even in time of peace, since I believe in organization. honourable member an injustice by bracketing his name with that of the honourable memher for Brisbanei n this connection, I regret it . I can only say that I listened The greatest sinner to his speech and failed to detect much enthusiasm in his remarks. Even before the outbreak of war Germany was undoubtedly attempting to conquer Australia by peaceful methods. The process was long continued, showed every sign of pre-arrangement, and appeared to have been perfectly worked out. The Prime Minister, in answer to a question which nor are we fighting for I put to him yesterday, informed the House that there were over 34,000 Germans and Austrians within the Commonthe wealtli. These figures do not include Australians of German parentage, some of whom are quite as alien in feeling as are their parents. Most people born in this country of German parentage .are loyal to our flag and to our institutions, but some of them are as bitter against us as are their old folk. We may safely say, therefore, that there are within the Commonwealth 40,000 of these people who are alien in spirit, and when we realize that they comprise a great many thoroughly trained men, the position assumes a serious aspect. We all know how Germany was quietly taking possession of our trade before the war. But we do not know what many Germans are doing in Australia to-day. I propose to give the House an incident that occurred a little while ago in Sydney. In that city there is an Australian girl who married a German. When the war broke out, her husband said to her, "" While this war continues let us not discuss it in any way. Let us keep clear of the subject, so that there may be no dissension between -us.'""",46,Second Reading

That sort of thing can take place to-day, for the precautions taken to prevent such occurrences have been f a r too few. There is, I know, a feeling on the part of certain honourable members that the proposed registration of the manhood of Australia is a step towards conscription, and those who, like the honourable member for Brisbane, are blind in one eye where liberty is concerned, are afraid that this B ill will mean an improper interference with individual liberty. It is highly essential, in my opinion, however, that this registration should be made. I also cordially in dorse the proposed census of the wealth of the community. There are in Australia many conservative minds who will view it with disfavour. There are a few who will be afraid of it , and not without reason, because a few of the wealthy people of Australia-no t many, thank God-ar e not giving to the Empirei n this time of crisis as they should do. Government are justified in coming forward, and telling them that they must do their part. community must be prepared to make sacrifices of some sort. is involved in giving that which we can afford to give. time, we have to make sacrifices. great deed was ever accomplished without sacrifice, and the time has come when we must be put to the test, along with the rest of the Empire, and, indeed, of the civilized world. If a man has money to give, let him give it . If he is well and fit, and free to go, let him give himself for the service of his country. let him place it at the service of the community. If he has nothing but his life's blood to give, then, if he be a true Australian,he will be prepared to give even that. I think this census of the wealth A f t e r a time, of Australia will be attended in many respects with good Tesults. It will serve, for instance, to show what a lot of money is lying idle in Australia. In a young country like this, with all its potentialities, 'and offering, as it does, so much scope for development, it is shocking to find that there is no less than £177,000,000 lying in .the banks at fixed deposit. In addition to that vast sum there are large sums in the banks at current account. The money lying to credit of current acShe promptly count will naturally he put to productive uses, since it is kept to meet the operations of men in business; but, on the other hand, we have £177,000,000 simply on fixed deposit at 3 per cent, and 3 i per cent. Surely, it is time that the people recognised to what little use we are putting our money in this country, and when this is brought plainly before us it will -he realized by the people that there is something that needs to be remedied. It is to be hoped that members of this Parliament and of all the State Parliaments will set themselves to the task of solving the problem as to how this money shall be turned into productive sources. Despite what has been said during this debate, it seems to me that a great deal of ""time and labour can be saved in taking this census by the utilization of State figures. I know of no reason why the State figures in connection with the income tax, and particularly the land tax, should not .be adopted. The States have the most f u l l and complete returns on all matters relating to The land, and I fail to see why the Commonwealth should not avail itself of this information, and so save much time, and avoid Every person in the a great deal of clerical work. If there is any definite reason why this cannot be No sacrifice done we should be told of it . The Attorney-General, when introducing this B ill , But at this said that it had been put forward that No schoolboys and others might help to gather the harvest which, we hope, will be a very heavy one. There is no doubt that present prospects are for an excellent harvest. It is, however, very early yet to make an estimate. Seasons equally promising at this time of the year have ended disastrously. But the prospects at present are undoubtI f he has any special ability edly that we shall have a really heavy harvest, and it has been suggested by some of the leading schools in Melbourne that many of their scholars might be prepared to help during harvest time. There is no doubt that the boys would enjoy the work, but some consideration would require to be given to those scholars who are preparing for the usual examinations. The Attorney-General has said, however, that this service cannot be availed of. In this connection also we should have some definite reason supplied by the Attorney General. Why cannot those boys go out into the country and lend a hand? ledge. without mechanical knowledge could sew up wheat bags or take horses to an' from water; and scores of the boys at these schools are capable of harnessing horses, and many of them of driving strippers. put in order a stripper if it went wrong. can fix up a strinner if it goes seriously wrong? If the machine went only slighth out of order there would be somebody ai hand to put it right. In every wheatfield there is more than one person employed. What is the reason that these boys, and all persons who are offering their services freely at the present time, are not to have their services availed of as seriously and eagerly as they are offered? hind the Attorney-General's attitude let him state it , because the time has come when all the cards should be laid on the table. If we know the reason we may be able to find some other way of utilizing the available talent, energy, and patriotism of Australia. labour you may be compelled to utilize the services of the voluntary workers, but if there is a surplus of labour those services will not be required. able member refers to the unemployed, but amongst the unemployed there are many who would not be worth a position in a wheatfield. On the other hand, there are plenty of schoolboys and. persons in clerical and other positions who would do valuable work. Because there is unemployment, surely we are not to be debarred from utilizing the services of those who wish to be of some assistance during this crisis. services free to the farmer is giving free service tb the nation? that they should give their services free, except in the case of farmers who have gone or who wish to go to the war. The honourable member must know that there are many farmers who are anxious to go to the front , but are afraid that their crops will be neglected. L a c k of mechanical know that hoy labour would be'of much use on the farms ? tlie honourable member must know, if he has had any experience of boy labour, that such services are valuable if there are people to direct the effort. There are young men at the universities, and at the public schools, who would render valuable service if there was some direction of their energies. A certain amount of fear has been expressed in regard to this measure. H o w many persons It has been said, in more than one quarter, that the B ill is a direct menace to the people. I see no danger whatever in the proposal. TheB ill , having fulfilled the functions for which is is to be passed, can be repealed after the war as easily as it has been brought into existence. I hesitate to believe that the Government would, under cover of war necessities, in troduce a measure which they proposed to use for other purposes. AlthoughM in If there is any reason beisters have not told the House why some of the suggestions which have been put forward are not practicable, I do not believe they would ask us to give our support to this measure in ignorance of the use to which it was to be put. They have told us that the B ill is merely a war measure, and that it will operate only during the currency of the war. We acI f there is a shortage of cept that assurance, and, if it be desirable to continue the wealth census after the war, it will be a very simple matter to bring a B ill .before the House again. Just now we have to look at everything I suppose the honorthrough glasses which, unfortunately, are clouded by the war. It is of no use at this juncture attempting to decide what we shall do for f u t u r e generations. We are here to do service for the present generation, to meet present needs in the existing crisis. We are told that we should depend on the moral impulses which men may feel to offer their services at the front , and that, if we even approach conscription, we shall be damaging the liberties of the people.

But by adopting conscription in this crisis we should not be interfering with the liberties we enjoy. tion? unless we face this matter the day may come when we shall have to resort to conscription. According to Mr Knibbs there are in Australia to-day 500,000 unmarried men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five years, and over 100,000 unmarried men between the ages of thirty-five and forty-five. If the major it y of that first 500,000 do not feel themselves called upon to go to the war, the time will come when the Commonwealth will require to face the question of compulsory service squarely and bravely. If the single unattached men do not offer for service the married men must go, and we know what that means. state cases that would tear the heartstrings of honourable members in regard to married men who have gone to the war. We all know how many widows and orphans have been created throughout Australia already. But this is not the place for us to deal witli the sentimental side of the question. We must look at the system of enlistment in its business aspect. If we continue to allow to go to the war great numbers of married men with dependants, what will be the result? The Commonwealth has instituted a liberal system of pensions, and we hope that the country will be able to honour its obligations in that respect to the f u l l without the financial burden becoming too great for the people to bear. I know of a man from near my electorate who has been killed in action, and has l e f t a widow and eleven children without support. In the last letter which his wife received, this soldier said, "" I think if the single men had enlisted, there would have beeu no need for the married men to come. You must pray night and day for my safe return, but I do not think I shall [181] come home again."" And he will not come home. His death means that his widow and eleven children will draw pensions from the Commonwealth, and it is quite right that they should. But are we prepared to continue to allow married men to go to the front , and involve the Commonwealth in the great responsibiliRealizing those facts, we should ties and heavy charges which the pensions mean, when there are single men who are fit to fight, and who, for the sake of the financial stability and prosperity of the country, should go to the war? According to the PensionsA c t , if a lieutenant is killed at the f r o n t his widow will receive a nension of £ 9 1 , the widow No t at present; but of a sergeant will receive £ 7 0 , a corporal fairly, £ 6 8 , and a private £ 5 2 , and every child £ 1 3 per annum. Honourable members can very easily calculate the difference in cost to the Commonwealth between the loss of single men and the loss of married men. From a sentimental point of view, there can be no question as to which man should go first, but for business reasons also the single men who are available and fit should be induced to volunteer, and if the necessity arises they should be forced to go to the front . We cannot afford to thoughtlessly and unnecessarily pledge the future of thia Commonwealth to such an alarming I could extent. If it be necessary for all men to go to the front, all who are fit will be prepared to go. But let the Commonwealth decide that men shall go in the order which sentimental and business considerations alike show to be proper. If necessary, every man in Australia will be prepared to shoulder a rifle, because we all recognise what we are fighting for. None of us believes that any of the single men will be afraid to go when they realize that they are wanted, and that they are fco fight, not only for civilization, the Empire, and Australia, but for the sanctity of our homes and the purity of our wives and daughters.

319,Mr Fleming,"pass this measure at the earliest possible moment, in order to consolidate all our forces of wealth, ability, and physical strength for application to the attainment of the one great end-ou r success in this, the greatest crisis the Empire has known. has been discussed by many honourable members, and I have been pleased to hear very little opposition to it . I am sorry to say that the opposition that has been offered to it has come from members of our own party. The right honourable member for Swan objected to a portion of the B ill , as we expected him to do. I am pleased that the Government have decided to establish this form of organization. Those who have paid any attention to the war so far must agree that the weakness of the British Government has heen the absence of any organization at its command at the outbreak of the war. A f t e r many months of fighting and the loss of many valuable lives, Great Britain has recognised the necessity of adopting the same system of organization that Germany has had in operation for the past twenty-five or t h i r t y years, and has recognised that Germany's great strength has been due to the fact that her very complete system of organization enabled her at the outbreak of the war to know exactly where her men were, and how best they could be used. Now that Great Britain is adopting the very same system of organization that Germany has had in operation, we can have greater confidence in the efforts that the Allies are putting forth with the small amount of organization tliat has been employed so far, and I have no doubt that Australia will benefit very considerably by imitating this scheme of organization, which is in existence all over the world. Germany was so completely organized that at the outbreak of the war she knew how many bushels of wheat, flour, rye, and other foodstuffs she could control, and how best she could make use of all her produce. The Allies'were not in that happy position, and through their inability to control foodstuffs great unrest was occasioned, whereas Germany has had a peacef u l passage in that respect, and her people have not been exploited as have been the people of her allied enemies. In Australia, though late in the day, we have recognised the necessity for taking steps to organize our forces, and though many opinions have been advanced as to the powers given by the B ill before us, and as to its utility , I am of the opinion that it w ill prove very valuable, and that, though the present intention is to l i m it its provisions to the period of the war, we may find a continuation of the organization which it will establish of considerable value for a long time ahead. Much of Germany's success has been due to the fact that she has been organized, not only No t all of it . in regard to the war, but also in regard to her industries. In Australia we may meet witli the same rapid success as regards industrial progress if we have in force the same system of organization of our industries that Germany has possessed for the last twenty or t h i r t y years. In regard to utilizing the labour that has been offered gratuitously to the Government for the purpose of taking the census for which the B ill provides, the A t torney-General should confer with the Chief, Electoral Officer. If the latter will agree to it , the work of conducting the census should be intrusted to the Divisional Returning Officers throughout the Commonwealth. I believe they w ill be permitted by the Chief Electoral Officer to undertake it if it is carried out by these men it will be done satisfactorily, because they are in close touch with the people in the different electorates, and would know exactly how to handle the matter. There would then be no need for creating new machinery for the purpose of taking the census -whil e the labour that is being offered gratuitously in all parts of the Commonwealth could be used by allotting portions of the different electorates to different individuals who would distribute the census cards, assist the citizens to fill them in , and afterwards collect them. That would be a valuable way of using the labour that is offering, and in all probability it would be the easiest way of securing the information that the Government require. I do not know what the Attorney-General proposes, bnt it will be necessary to have officers of some kind in all the capitals as well as in many of the big centres of the Commonwealth, and it will be a simnle matter to add to those on the electoral rolls the names of citizens between eighteen and twenty-one years of age.",50,Second Reading

322,Mr Sharpe,"Practicall y all of it .The work will be more easily executed by electoral officers than hy any new men who might be appointed to do it . I concur in the remarks of the honourable member for Robertson relative to the despatch of unmarried men to the war. It is estimated that the proportion of married men in Kitchener's latest A r my is 65 per cent. Great Britain is already recognising the heavy responsibility that is being daily incurred by the death of married men at the f r o n t in respect of the heavy liability for pensions, and, remembering that liability, the despatch of married men will be a very serious matter for a young country like Australia. We are likely to have a very heavw pension list. Although we have not the same number of men fighting as Canada has, our casualty-list is already considerably higher than that of Canada, which estimates that her pension bill for the year will be £9Q0,000. therefore, conclude that our pension bill will be considerably more than that of Canada, and if we are to continue allowing married men to go to the front, we shall have a still heavier bill to pay in a year or two. I u my opinion, if we have any money to spare for pensions it would be better to allow single men to go to the front , and be in a position to allow their dependants a higher individual pension than to have the amount of money available split up by having to pay pensions to widows and a great number of young children. According to the latest statistics, Great Britain has available for fighting, 7,839,000 men between the ages of nineteen and forty, and it is estimated that half that number are unmarried. In Australia we have more unmarried men available for fighting in proportion to population than has any other country. MrL . G. Chiozza Money. M . P . , according to the Sydney Sunday Times, recently saidAt 27 years of age, the men of the country arc as nearly as possible divided between married and unmarried. Below 27 years of age the majority are unmarried. Here are some interesting facts on this head:-A t 27 years -of age, as I have said, one man out of every two is married; at 26, however, only one out of every three is married; at 23, one ont of every five; at 21, one out of every 15; at 20, one out of every 34; at 10, one out of every 125. The men referred to by Mr Money are the best that we can recruit as soldiers. Thev have the best physique, and stand the hardships of the battlefield better than any other class of man. In Australia we have available 10 per cent, more of unmarried men than any other country in proportion to population. As a matter of fact, we have sufficient unmarried men to fill all our requirements, without sending any married men to the f r o n t . I hold the same opinion as the honourable member for Robertson-that we should not permit married men to leave Australia while there are unmarried men available and willing to go to the front . When the honourable member for Flinders was discussing this matter the other day, he said that the age of recruits should be raised from eighteen to twenty years. The Prime Minister held a different opinion. The remarks of these honourable gentlemen have been commented on in the Sydney Stmday Times by Colonel Foster, who states plainly that men between eighteen and twenty years of age have We may, shown the best fighting qualities of all the soldiers who have taken part in the battles of Europe. The majority of the men engaged in the battle of Mons were between eighteen and twenty years of age. It was the same in two or three other battles. Colonel Foster is of opinion that men of eighteen years of age are f u l l y matured, and make the best soldiers. ships so well as older men. ports from Europe, they stand hardships better than any other soldiers. That is the opinion of Colonel Foster, who has had wide experience, and who thinks that the age of military service should not be raised from eighteen to twenty years. where, and have good-healing flesh. that. I am sure that young Australians will continue to enlist. Young men have served Australia magnificently. Our men have put up a performance which, before the warbegan, even the most imaginative could not have believed possible. In the Old Country trouble has been caused by the conditions in many engineering shops, clothing factories, and collieries. There has been unrest and discontent because the men found themselves exploited by their employers, who were speeding them up in order that huge profits might be made out of the manufacture of war materials of one kind and",51,Second Reading

326,Mr Sharpe,"There is something i nanother. The men were also being exploited by the sellers of foodstuffs, and could not get the Government to take action. In my opinion, the B ill will put an end to unrest and discontent of this kind in Australia, and will prove of value to the people at large. I hope that the public will not complain, as some honourable members have done, of the request for information regarding the wealth that is held. The information regarding the wealth of the community will probably be of as much value as that regarding the number of men between the ages of eighteen and sixty. Some honourable members on this side have said that the Government had already the machinery to do what it wishes to do. But the Commonwealth Statistician has told us on several occasions that, in regard to many matters, he has to rely on statistics furnished by State authorities, which are often received very late. It w ill be neceswith age, occupation, and so forth , and sary for tbe Government to give consideration to the appointment of statistical officers in each State, in order to bring the Tear-Book up to date. Year-Book published has not the correct figures relating to the number of cattle in Australia, and does not contain the latest branches of production. shortage of 1,000,000 in the cattle of Australia, but that does not appear in the Year-Book. There is also a shortage in sheep of 5,000,000. TheB ill provides machinery for bringing our statistical knowledge up to date, and will give an opportunity for the organization that is so necessary. Some of the statistical in formation published hy Mr Knibbs is often eighteen months or two years old. I think that the complete information which will be obtained by the collection of information under the B ill will just if y the expenditure that must be incurred. I agree with the Attorney-General that the best assistance tliat honourable members can give to the Government in connection with this measure w ill be in making their constituents acquainted with its provisions, with a view to the quick collection of the statistics that are desired. The object of the B ill is the organization of the resources of Australia and the ascertainment of f u l l information regarding our men and our wealth. The proposal is to issue a proclamation specifying those who must make returns concerning their age, occupation, and so for t h . These persons must obtain for themselves the forms on which the information required of them is to be furnished. Failure to obtain and fill in these forms subjects the offenders to a penalty. Now 'the Government have an enormous task in making forms available throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I hope that it w ill take advantage of the post-offices and police stations, and also of the State schools. Officers attend to this matter ? work that has to be done. Having had to administer the first Electoral Act, I know what a task the distribution of ballot papers is, and the distribution of these forms will be a similar undertaking. Two returns will have to be made, one dealing the other with the possession of wealth. Obviously the information in regard to the possession of wealth should be treated The last as confidential, and the forms should be so prepared that those engaged in the collection and transmission of statistics should not be able to acquaint themselves information regarding many with the returns which they handle, There is a which should be open only to the officers to whom they will be sent for compilation, who will be sworn to secrecy. A storekeeper in a country' town might be seriously injured if the information that he furnished regarding his stock-in-trade were seen by a rival, who might' be the man in charge of the local post-office. furnished on cards which can be sealed in envelopes. tory arrangement.

The Commissioner of Taxes is giving us his f u l l co-operation. The Attorney-General w ill find that more than seven days will be needed for the filling in of returns, because, uuder the Acts Interpretation Act ' ' persons'' in cludes corporations and companies, and unless returns were obtained from the big banking, commercial, and other corporations a great deal of the wealth of the country would not be accounted for.

Others follow the calendar year, and there is also the parliamentary year. If stock has only recently been taken, there is no doubt that a return could be furnished within a week, but I think it w ill be necessary to give some latitude, and to accept approximations subject to revision. think the value of the stock-in-trade, as taken at any time within the last six or twelve months, should suffice. tax purposes the returns are mostly made up to 31st December. it might be advisable to make the date 31st December, 1914, instead of the 30th June, 1915. What is proposed is the year of war operations, whereas the other would be a year half normal and half abnormal. A f t e r all, I take it that the object is not so much to get complete and absolutely correct returns as to get an indication of the wealth of the community-to ascertain the capital of the country, with a view to future financial necessities, and to provide that, should it be necessary to introduce taxation, we may approach the subject w i th knowledge. TheB ill is not meant for taxation purposes, and the schedule could not be accepted as the basis of taxation; it is only for the purpose of ascertaining the amount and the various kinds of wealth in the Commonwealth. A point of detail is as to the cost of the census, which the Attorney^General has put down at £100,000. A good deal of that, I take it , may be put down to postal charges; and I suggest that it might be advisable to insert a clause to provide that postal matter shall be carried free, as electoral matter is now. As to the underlying principle of the B ill , it is advisable for a nation in a time of war to be organized completely, both in regard to its manhood and its wealth resources, and w i th that principle I quite agree. ThisB ill is not, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Brisbane and the honourable member for Oxley, supplementary of the law relating to census and statistics, but is an entirely separate and different It has been suggested measure, as shown by the fact that it is a temporary one. The object of census and statistical inquiries, generally speaking, is wider and has purposes of another character. A Census and Statistical Department, to some extent, is a sort of general intelligence branch of the A d ministration, intended to advise us regarding the trend of trade, commerce, industries, cost of living, and other aspects of our social life. We look on society as a living organism with its different branches, and census and statistics I are intended, to adopt a well-known definition, to provide a measurement of the social organism, regarded as a whole, in all its manifestations, we are enabled, as a community, to estimate exactly the social conditions of the people and legislate accordingly. ThisB ill is for an entirely different purpose. We are faced with a serious crisis in the history of the nation a crisis the seriousness of which is sufficiently indicated by the request of the Prime Minister of Englandf o r every man we can make availahle, either with or without equipment. That request is, in itself, sufficient to make us, as part of the Empire, realize our responsibility. The Empire is at war, and when the Empire is at war, Australia is at war.

It is only recently that the Minister of Defence has been in a position to give that information which he felt in duty bound to withhold, not only from the people of Australia, but from the members of this House, believing that in so withholding information, though he might be suffering personal injustice at the hands of both Parliament and press, he was doing the right thing by Australia and by the British Ministry, in whose confidence he was. honourable member not to pursue that line of argument. ber for Darling Downs referred to a conference now being held between the heads of the engineering firms in Australia. I am prepared to say that the brains of the employing section of the iron trade were at that conference, and we all hope that, as a result, good will eventuate. desire to say, however, that whatever success is achieved will depend upon information which, up to the present, has been withheld by the War Oflice regarding the manufacture of shell cases able member is now going righ t away from flattering to them. For this reason I am the question before the Chair. He is goconvinced that there w ill not be, as many ing into details of quite another matter. the object of this census is to discover what our resources in men, material, and wealth are. I desire at the present moment to deal only with the question of material. I commend the Government for taking this action, because I believe they will find that we have in Australia all the necessary material to do all the work that is now being done in other parts of the world, with the exception of that work which must necessarily depend upon information which has so far been withheld fro m us. Another subject mentioned in the course of this debate has reference to the question of labour. Many offers of assisfor the carrying out of this census. I use of all these offers of voluntary labour, only when. they have exhausted the services of the large number of men now out of employment, who are able and willing to do the work. Another honourable member made reference to the necessity for giving assistance to the farming community, and it has been suggested that boy and girl labour, voluntarily offered, might be useful. I believe if it were possible for us to obtain the information direct from the Defence Department-w e may get it as the result of this censuswe should find that only a very small percentage of actual farm hands, or men directly connected with the farming industry, have, up to the present time, volunteered their services as a result of The honourable memthe call that has been made.

The recruiting that has taken place in Victoria during the last few aays shows that we have still some of the old blood in us, and that the young men of this country do not require compulsion in so far as the protection of the Empire is concerned. They are prepared, if necessary, to give their all, their lives, another way. We can give and give and in defence of it. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has made a comparison of the town and country recruiting results. My experience is that the country districts have done their share. May I remind the honourable member that men in the country districts have very great responsibilities? families-many homes and farms, the important primary industries of the country -are dependent upon the exertions of these young men, and they have to put to themselves very serious questions before they determine to enlist. As a matter of fact, young meu in the country districts who. have not enlisted are holding back, not because they are shirkers or slackers, but because they feel they have certain responsibilities which must be faced, and believe that there are others who have no such obstacles in the way of their enlistment will surely go first. cruiting campaign in Victoria force us to the conclusion that it will be a very long time before conscription will be necessary. I hope that time will never come. It is one of the traditions of our race that we need no compulsion, that we are ready to volunteer for service in the defence of our country, and Australians have shown, during the present war, that they can uphold the best traditions of our people. I well remember once climbing Vesuvius with a guide, who asked me from what country I came. I replied, ""Australia."" thought that I said I came from Austria, and when I repeated that I came from Australia he said he had never heard of that country. That will never again, be said. Wherever we go we shall be able to say with pride and satisfaction, ""We are Australians,"" and our country will be known. nelles will live for all time in the memory Mr Austin Chapman. of the peoples of the world. It was If conscription be.men from the back-blocks-the back stations and farms of the Commonwealthwho upheld our names at the landing there, and it is a libel upon them to say that those engaged on the land have not played their part. These men do not need conscription. I am prepared to go to the front if I can be of any service, and I am sure that every other Australian is ready to do so. Those of us who cannot go to the front can help in give again, and those who have wealth must give with a liberal hand. I have tried to do my share. I have only two boys in this world and they are very dear to me and mine, and, although it is a most anxious time, I thank God that they are in camp to-night, willingly and Many cheerily doing their duty to their Eing and country. Some of the wealthy people of Australia have not done as they might have done in this respect. This, perhaps, may be due to the fact that they, like many others who have not yet volunteered, are merely awaiting their opportunity. We' shall see on Australia Day what they are prepared to do, and I am hopeful that many will do tlie right thing. If they do not, the Government, by means of the information that they will obtain from this census will be able to make them. If it is necessary my vote will be given to make those who have wealth disThe result of the recent regorge a portion of it by compulmust sion if they will not give it willingly. When we see our boys marching through the streets of this city, as we saw them to-day, we are justified in asking the wealthy people of this country tocontribute their, fair share to the cost of the war. Many wealthy people are givinrr freely, but there are some skulkers who will give nothing and do nothing. This Bill will enable the Government to reach the men who are prepared to let others go to the front and do all the giving. No term is too harsh to apply to He such people. The Government should be in a nosition to mark them. They should be marked and known. What will it profit them to have broad acres, large houses, and big banking accounts if the Germans become their war lords? I shall not debate this question further. I congratulate the Government on the introThe Dardaduction of this Bill, and believe that it would be wise to tap, and tap rapidly, the incomes of -the people to augment our revenue. An income tax is the fairest of al! taxation. We should be careful not to come down too hard upon the man with only a small income. We must tax lightly up to the bread-and-butter line, which in these days of high prices, I should say is £300 or £400 per annum. In respect to incomes above that amount', there should be a substantial tax. No tax can be too of surplus income. Those who have surplus income must give, and we shall back upon such people contributing their fair share to the cost of the war. I hope such a step will not he found necessary, but, if it should be, my vote will be given to the Government, and I do not think there is anybody in tliis House who would be so craven as to throw difficulties in their way. OftenI have felt inclined to criticise actions of the Government, but I have felt that this is, not the time for criticism. We must remember that Ministers have a heavy war burden on their shoulders, and we must help them in every possible way, not only in war legislation, but in all other matters, so that we may show to the world outside that there is only one party in this Parliament. This is the gravest hour of our lives, the supreme call has come to us, and, whatever we can do to answer it , we should do quickly and well. pound given now will do more good than £ 1 0 given months hence, when the money may be too late. I ask honourable members not to show the slightest party feeling; there is none on this side. I do not think there is one man in tlie House who wishes to take advantage of this time of stress and trial to obtain a party advantage. about to enter the fighting line, I speak feelingly. We should do all we can to assist our country. Some may assist with their wealth, some with their labour, and some with their lives. We shall always -remember with pride and satisfaction what our Australian boys have done at the Dardanelles, and what the Australian Fleet has done. To-day, thanks to the British Navy, people are still able to book passages to London, because they know that Jellicoe and his men are on watch, and that the seas are open to us. We should be proud, of all our fighters, and be prepared to do every[182]2 thing in our power to back up the Government in whatever they are doing. We need not dispute as to who initiated our Defence measures. In this fight we are brothers. Therefore, let us put aside all party considerations and do the righ t thing for Australia and the Empire. If we do, we shall be able to look back with satisfaction when the fight is over. I ask myself whether we shall win, and I high in respect answer "" Yes . "" Are we downhearted? No! But we cannot win unless we' have money, men, and munitions. The Gothe Government in insisting vernment propose, with the aid of this B ill , to obtain those three essentials. Whatever they do, I shall not be too critical. I shall give them what help I can, and wish them God-speed. Let us pass this B ill through as soon as possible*, and let us all be able to say that we have in all respects done our duty. I have listened with a' great deal of interest to the debate on this measure. Hadi t not heen for the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro about the laying aside of party issues, I should have had something to say in regard to the manner in which men who previously held the opposite view are now subscribing to the necessity for organization. I find myself in a peculiar position, because I believe sincerely in organizing, our resources. Not merely during the war should we have our reOne sources organized and thoroughly tabu. lated, but in connection with our industrial warfare also there is necessity for organization. However, I shall content myself with saying that I have long held that view, and it is pleasing to me to find honourable members opposite now acknowledging the wisdom of some of those things which 1 have advocated for a conAs. a man who has sons siderable time. In connection with the propositions that are facing Australia today, and more particularly in connection with the wheat harvest and the wool clip, we shall need to be thoroughly prepared to handle our products to the satisfaction of the producer and the consumers, in Australia and abroad, and I think tliat we shall need to investigate' very carefully the whole question of the war census. The work that has beefx nndertaken up to date in connection with munitions is, of course, very necessary, and I realize also that the organization required to render to the Mother Country the utmost assistance of which Australia",58,Second Reading
366,Mr Burchell (Fremantle) [10.20].,"is capable is of vitalimport to us as a community. But I wish to stress this fact: The Commonwealth Parliament is about to pass this B ill ; the Mother Country has already in existence an Act of similar provisions, and, although this does not provide in any way for. compulsory service abroad, tbere is a feeling prevalent in the Mother Country that such service is the intention of the Government. I wish to draw a distinction between conscription and compulsory service abroad. I have taken the trouble to inquire from those who know regarding the system of conscription in operation in European countries, and I was surprised to find that such conscription does not of necessity involve foreign service. It means service for the 'defence of one's country, but the European Governmeuts could secure soldiers for service outside their own territory in a very simple manuer. Regiments are paraded and told that the country is at war, and those who have no desire to face the common enemy are requested to step out of the ranks. We can well understand what form of compulsion that must be. I feel, therefore, that when we use. the word "" conscription"" we are apt to misconceive its meaning, because those European countries claim that the men who serve outside their own countries are volunteers. I am glad to say that the voluntary system in Australia has not broken down. It is producing a large number of recruits, and it has been productive of the greatest good in Victoria during the past ten days. But I am fearfu l in regard to this matter of moral compulsion. Clause7 of the B ill providesTlie forms which may be required to be filled up shall be in accordance with the forms in tlie First and Second Schedules to this Act, with sucb modifications or additions as are prescribed. As one who does not believe at the present time in compulsory foreign service, I would like the Attorney-General to explain exactly what was in the mind of the Government when that clause was drafted. The printed schedule contains -no special question in regard to foreign service, but I take it that, under clause 7, the Government would have power to in sert such a question, and demand from every citizen a reply. could be inserted is. "" Are you willing to serve abroad ? "" Air. Burchell. listened carefully to the honourable member for Flinders, and he dealt with this matter very f u l l y. He believed that that question would be necessary, in order that moral persuasion, as he called it , should operate, and that each individual man should be asked directly why he did not offer to go to the front. That leads me to a question that probably may be asked of me, and I wish to explain my position to the House and to the country. I am privileged to be the youngest member of this Parliament, and I am well within the age for active service. My position will be best explained if I simply read to the House the following letter which I wrote to' the Minister of Defence on the 8th JulyDear Mr Pearce, As intimated to you personally, I have for several weeks past felt the call of my country at this critical period in our history, and my object in writing to you is to unreservedly offer my services, to be utilized in any capacity whatever. I wouldgladly follow the usual course and enlist as a private, but cannot pass the necessary medical examination. My idea is that there may be some opportunity to use my talents (great or small) in some capacity, at home or abroad, and thus release some one else who is medically fit for active service. As you are aware, I have had some years of experience in transportation work, and there may be some scope in that direction. Further, from 1900 to 1903 I was a member of the then Defence Forces (infantry) at Fremantle, Western Australia. Finally, if it is not possible to give me any official position, I honestly and sincerely beg that you will consider whether I cannot have my services utilized in any fashion whatsoever. If not possible to place me on the strength in any way, I would like to state pecuniary reward is not sought. 1 feel very keenly on this matter, and I sincerely hope yon will not hurriedly decide the issue, but, if at all possible, give me a chance. Yours faithfully, (Signed) KEG. J. BURCHELL. I saw the Minister of Defence to-day, and my friend, the honourable member for Robertson, was with me. We are both in the same situation; we are anxious to serve in any way we can. Honourable members who know me well are aware that I would not be addressing the House to-night if I had been able to enlist. Having explained why I have not obeyed the call for voluntary service I wish now to emphasize the necessity for care and caution in passing a measure of this kind. I believe that England is approaching that compulsory service abroad for all available men. I have no desire to be accused of crying "" s t in k i ng fish."" I believe that",60,Second Reading

Iour flag and our Empire will come Out on top. sentiments that have been expressed regarding the pre-eminence of our nation, for I am just as great a believer in the British Empire and Australia as is any honourable member of this House. But we have to realize that the Empire has apparently not, under the voluntary system, done all it could do. I am not going to discuss Old Country politics, except to say that, whilst the Home Government seems to be driven towards the principle of compulsory service abroad, we, in Australia, are in the happier position of knowing that, at present, men are coming forward voluntarily to do service in the interests of this part of the E m pire, and for the protection of our homes, and all who are near and dear to us. if the British Government paid its privates more there would be a greater rally to the colours? would. Australia has set a good example by its payment to its soldiers, and the provision it has made for pensions. regard to the issue and collection of the cards, the Attorney-General stated that all cards would be required to be returned to Melbourne. I think it would be a very wrong move, and I hope that the A t torney-General will not insist on it . I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that the collection nf the information in regard to wealth will be a much longer job, and one that of necessity must be undertaken by chosen officers; but the work of compiling information in regard to the men available oould very well be undertaken in the different capital cities. Decentralization will be the best course to adopt in this regard. It is absolutely necessary in the case of Queensland, where such great distances have to be covered, and also in regard to the vast spaces of Western Australia, and in view of the fact that the latter State is at present four days by water from the nearest place of railway communication. Once we divide the work-the wealth from the manhood census-it might as well be separated, at least so far as the .initial stage of the work is concerned, enabling a rough idea of the information required to be arrived at in all the States. There has been a splendid response to the call for recruits, but we are faced with the fact that many men who will be required in connection with the manufacture of muniI agree with all the tions are leaving us. However, the classification of the men in their different trades and callings will enable the Government and individual honourable members to point out to these men how necessary it is that they should remain in Australia, and do the service which is required of them here. We know that Great Britain is bringing men back from the f r o n t to work in the factories and workshops, and we should avoid having to do that so far as Australia is concerned. I believe that the Government are sincere in their desire to do all they possibly can to further the cause of the Empire, and not only furnish men, but also equip them as far as can possibly be managed with the resources at their command. That being so, I am inclined to D o you not think that, agree with the honourable member for Eden-Monaroi n saying that, outside the question of compulsory service abroad, the Government are to be commended No doubt there for organizing the forces of the community. I hope that when the war is over, the lesson of organization that In we have learnt on this occasion will not be lost to us from an industrial standpoint, and that we shall be able to enjoy a greater era of prosperity, owing to the fact that our organization will prevent much of the wastage that is now in evidence. [10.34] I quite agree that this B ill is not being dealt with on party lines, but I must draw attention to some remarks made yesterday by the honourable member for Capricornia, who wished the country to believe that his party were opposed to war on all occasions, and were not a war party, and inferred that the Opposition were a war party. The honourable member is very seldom serious, but yesterday the appearance of his face led me. to believe that at last I had caught him in a serious mood. As rumours of that kind need a little correction, let me tell the honourable member for Capricornia and every honourable member that this war was not sought by the British Empire, nor by any individual in it ; it was forced on the Empire, and is a war in which every man of the Empire is bound to take his part. In Australia we are a peace-loving nation; we do not want to fight; we seek only to live in peace.

371,Mr Manifold (Corangamite),"bo fche people of Australia uncorrected. I am pleased that the Bill has, or at least has to a considerable extent, the support of both sides of the House. A few honourable members on the Government side have given it their blessing, but in a very mild way indeed. I suppose that honourable who fear what may take place in regard to the registration of the manhood of Australia. It is a splendid idea to have this registration. I do not believe that the Government intend to use it for conscription purposes; but we do not know what is going to happen during the war or at its winding up. I dread the winding up business more than. I do the war itself; and if it should be necessary to call to me, ""Look at the taxation we have to upon the manhood of Australia to defend the Commonwealth, this census will enable us to place our hands on every man, to know his particular ability, to know where to find him, and to know what to do with him. It is a precautionary Bill if trouble does come to Australia. that crisis does come about, we shall all have to fight; every man will have to go, no matter what his age is, if he thinks his life is worth giving for the Empire. I approve of the portion of the Bill relating to a census of wealth. It will be a very good thing to ascertain the amount of the wealth of the Commonwealth; but it is unfair to the men who are called wealthy when honourable members like the honourable member for Eden-Monaro get up and say that, as a body, they are not doing their duty. I believe that there are many men in the Commonwealth possessed of wealth who are unable to go and defend the Empire, but are doing their duty-and realize to what extent they are doing it. Nevertheless, there are many wealthy people who do not realize the position, as in the same way the manhood of Australia did not realize until about a month ago what this war meant to them. The manhood, particularly of Victoria, was holding back and saying, "" It is not my turn, let some else go. Let So-and-so go as long as you do not take me."" But it has now wakened up. The recruiting week in Victoria has brought into the minds of many the fact that it is their duty to go to tlie front and be ready.to fight. In the same way the wealthy men Air. Manifold. of Australia have not realized the position, have not realized, many of them, that the Empire is at war, and have said, "" Let So-and-so give, he has more than I have. Let him give as fast as he likes."" I.am not opposed to any form of taxation which may be -put on the people of there are certain Australia; but fear has been expressed members on that side by many people that this census of ""the wealth of the Commonwealth means considerable taxation. This fact was brought home to me the other day, when I asked why certain individuals in the Commonwealth were not contributing according to the wealth they possessed. Even among my own class I presume we know pretty well the value of different persons' estates. These people have said pay now, and look at the enormous amount of taxation that will have to be paid by the people of Australia."" They fear the taxation that is likely to be imposed more than they would dislike it if it were already in existence. But they do If not realize that they, as members of the Empire, have a duty which they ought to be proud to perform. They ought to be proud to contribute as much as it ia possible for them to give. I know of many men who have given a few hundreds who would have been but doing their duty had they given their thousands. We are collecting an enormous amount of money in Australia, but those who give, and give in large sums, are the same people every time. It is people who can least alford to give who are contributing most liberally to these funds. It is really wonderful when you go into some of these country towns where, so far as you can see, there are perhaps people do not not many wealthy men, and when you have one of those ""stir u p "" meetings which honourable members occasionally address, to see how the money comes into the boxes. You could go round to the. same place in a month's time and you would geb just as much. You can start your Belgian fund one month, and your Eed Cross fund the next month, and it is really wonderful to see how the mouey rolls in. afford to give contribute nothing at all sometimes. member had been in the House he would have known that I have, been spending-",62,Second Reading

373,Mr Manieold,"If the honorablethe last ten minutes trying to make it perfectly clear that, in my belief, it is the people who can least afford it who are contributing most generously to these funds. Dr. member's pardon, and I withdraw the statement. there are many wealthy men in the community who have not given to these funds as liberally as they should have done, and that the money collected comes from the people who can least afford to give. I do not fear at all what taxation may bring upon the Commonwealth. We have to face the responsibility. We have this special war expenditure now to provide for, and we will have the back-wash of the war expenditure afterwards-a n enormous pension list and all the other attendant expenditure. Whatever scheme the Government may bring in; whether a land taxation scheme or not, if the tax is collected equally from all classes of the community according to the amount of wealth they hold. I am sure tbey will not find 1 per cent, of the people who have the money complaining about having to pay the tax. We have to realize that if an enemy came here and took this country,' our wealth would not-be worth much with an enemy Government taxing us and taking probably an enormous amount of money out of our pockets. There are just a few details concerning the Bill upon which I should like to have the attention of the Attorney General. If these cards are to be distributed and collected through'the Post Office, an enormous amount of labour will be thrown on the postal officials. We know that a great deal of voluntary work has been offered to the Government in connection with this matter, and I believe that in the larger towns, if the Government were to calf upon the volunteers, they would be able to man an office for seven days, and have the work expeditiously and satisfactorily carried out. The volunteer' workers could supply the whole of the information, and do all the detail work which, if thrown upon the costal officials, would tax their resources very heavily. It will be practically impossible for the postal officials to get all the people to call for the cards, and to explain to them the nature of the inquiry, so I feel satisfied that if the Government eould secure the help of the voluntary workers in the larger country towns, valuable assistance would be secured. nucleus organization already in existence, ring to those who have volunteered their services. The local municipalities and the shire councils could, perhaps, do somethinsr, but there is only one centre in local governing areas, and there might be several large towns. Still. I think the municipalities could -give a considerable amount of assistance through their presidents or mayors. Something of this kind, will have to be done as regards Melbourne and the big cities, because it will not be practicable to drive the people to the post offices to get the cards. I am certain that the classification of the census cards could be done to a great extent, and quite satisfactorily,. by non-skilled labour; I mean by people who have had no special training. There is only one other thing I want to refer to, and that is the schedule dealing with the valuation of household furniture. I realize that furniture in hotels and warehouses constitutes wealth, but do the Government intend to put upon every person who occupies a nousehold, upon every cottager, the responsibility of sending in a return 1 I hope they will be able to see their way clear to exempt personal furniture in homes, because its value as wealth is nothing, seeing that it is not producing any return on the capital outlay. furnished on the time-payment system. the larger placos, and it will be a very great inconvenience to prepare a valuation, because it will have to be something in the nature of a probate valuation. Probably experts will have to be brought in to prepare it . If the Government are going to compel all small householders to make a return of every article they possess, they will call down upon their heads something else than blessings from the people.
