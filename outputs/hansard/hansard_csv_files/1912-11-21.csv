Cases of the kind have arisen by the operation of the check valuation undertaken at the instance of the Commissioner, which, although it means a little expense, is absolutely necessary. Tb^ discrepancies generally are not so patent as in the instance referred to. Treasurer whether it is not a fact that the whole of the valuations submitted by landowners under the Land Tax Act have to be reviewed within two years by independent assessors on behalf of the Commonwealth; and, if so, whether that is being done? but, in addition to that, there is a check, going on at the present time. of the Prime Minister been directed to the following remark by the Treasurer of Queensland, the Honourable W. H . Barnes, in the Legislative Assembly, on the 13th inst As soon as the Commonwealth Government were ready the State Government was prepared to go on. Further, he assured the House that vernment declining to go on with the ereca'l the machinery was ready for the carrying tion of the mills in the north. Regarding, on of the work. the erection of certain sugar mills which had aware that the uncertainty, owing to thebeen approved of by the Government. Can the Prime Minister tell the House to what extent the Commonwealth Government may be held responsible for the delay? the statement made by Mr Barnes until the honourable member drew my attention to it. The Commonwealth Government have taken no action that precludes, or prevents, or , limits the action of the Queensland Government in any way in carrying out the promise, or the pledge, if any, made by the State Premier. Any attempt on the part of the State Government to shelter themselves behind the Commonwealth Government is, in my opinion, disingenuous, and has no foundation in fact. A few months ago the Commonwealth Government very readily afforded the Queensland Government accommodation to the amount of £1,000,000. introduce a measure repealing the sugar bounty and Excise, so as to enable the Premier of Queensland to carry out his expressed intention, as communicated in a letter to the Prime Minister, that if the bounty and the Excise were repealed he would take steps to pass consequent legislation ? the honourable member has made certain, statements which are not facts. presently, when the House considers Supply. of course, believes the statements to befacts. Prior to the question of the repeal of the Excise and bounty in this Parliament being raised the Treasurer and Attorney-General of Queensland saw me and wanted a guarantee. It was my own suggestion, carried back after a subsequent visit by Mr Barnes, that that would Be a good way out of the difficulty, and would settle the whole trouble. But that was all subsequent to the action of the Queensland Gothe question of policy I have seen no reason to alter the opinion I expressed then. state of legislation in connection with the. sugar industry, makes it impossible for persons to invest any money in that industry with any degree of certainty? fact, and, if it is so, it arises from no actionof this Parliament, and certainly from noaction of this Government.

Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, and that the House' resolve itself into Committee of Supplyproposed. Two or three weeks ago I intimated to the Honorary Minister who represents the Minister of Defence, that I intended to move the adjournment of the House in order to draw attention to the present position of the Australian Garrison Artillery in New South Wales; but, instead of taking that step, I shall avail myself of the opportunity presented by the motion now before the House. Honourable Members will have noticed from the press that, in consequence of the action taken by the Minister of Defence and the military authorities, the officer commanding the Australian Garrison Artillery has been placed on the unattached list, with the further result that the greater portion of the members of this fine regiment have resigned. The present position, from the point of view of the manning of the forts at Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong, and Port Kembla, presents a serious menace to the coast defences of the State. We all agree that defence matters should not be regarded from a party stand-point, and I am calling attention to this matter simply because I think an injustice has been done to one of the most capable officers in the Commonwealth, and that there has been brought (Formal). about the destruction of one of thefinest, if not the finest, of our regiments. My object is to ascertain! whether"" something cannot be done in> order to remedy the present state of affairs. The lesson of experience in connection with, this matter appears to be forgotten. Thehistory of. the regiment in New South Wales is one to which I shall have to draw the attention of honourable members. Theregiment was in existence long before the Military Forces were taken over by the Commonwealth. The Minister some time ago decided to do away with the commanding officer, with the view of placing theregiment absolutely under the command of a permanent officer of the Royal AustralianGarrison Artillery. Prior to the advent of lery was under the command of a member of the Royal Australian Garrison*RIVER whole of the time that the regiment wasunder that command the position was very unsatisfactory. No progress was made. Dissatisfaction was expressed on all hands at the treatment received. The result was that, instead of the regiment being in a> position which the people of New South Wales wished it to occupy, it occupied only a second-rate position. However, in 1903: Colonel Lister took command. The result was that the regiment, which had been 12c strong-the total establishment being 374-wa s raised to such a state of efficiency as to shoot into the first class, and became, if not absolutely the best regiment in the Commonwealth, certainly one of the best. The step taken by the Minister of Defence has, however, resulted in doingaway with the commanding officer and theregimental staff, with the consequence that, the men belonging to the regiment have handed in their resignations wholesale. It has been said, in justification for thispolicy, that the same was done in Victoria,, where the step taken was successful. But honourable members who have followed this matter closely must have come to the same conclusion as I have done, that the positionin Victoria is different. Here the companies are spread over the wide district of"" Port Phillip, whilst in New South Wales,, with the exception of certain half companies, the whole are centred at headquarters. Shortly before the resignationsfrom the regiment, the establishment was-increased_ from 374 to 573, with a citizen commanding officer and the regimental staff. I venture the opinion that what has",18,Natives Publicatio N Of 5 Is It A Fact That The Above Officer Had Prior
57,Mr Fuller (Illawarra) [10.57],"happened is the result of jealousy on the part of the Permanent Forces towards the citizen soldiers. It is only in the artillery the defences of Wollongong and Port that the militiamencome into direct competition with the Permanent Forces. In no other branch of the service does that apply. -engineers. artillery. distinct corps. not like the light-horse or the infantry. The engineers constitute a technical branch of the service just as the artillery do; and my point is that it is only in the technical branch of the service that a comparison can be made between the militia and the permanent men. members will have noticed that in this branch of the service the militia compares more than favourably with the permanent force. that statement is to be found in the shooting which took place under the command of -an officer who has been put on the unattached list, and who was formerly in command of the Australian Garrison Artillery. The regiment shot into a first-class position in competition with the permanent men under the command of a permanent -officer. no comparison, all the same. if the Minister and the military authorities are to take action such as they have done in this case, they are not going to -popularize soldiering. We shall keep the best men out of the service-me n who, in the past, have willingly devoted their time .and ability to qualify themselves by examination and experience to occupy important positions in connection with our -coast defences. That will have an undesirable effect as far as the popularity of soldiering is concerned. In the position in which Australia is placed, as an outpost of the Empire, it is essential that nothing should be done to discourage the citizen -soldier. everything to encourage him. There is no doubt that the step taken by the Minister in this case has injured the regiment very much. the position that he occupied. I have had an opportunity of seeing a good many of the men belonging to the regiment, because a portion of it is located in my own constituency in connection with Kembla. I know that it is in consequence of the treatment meted out to the officer who had command of the regiment that the resignations have taken place. The position in regard to the results of the battle practice is this: The Garrison Artillery shot themselves into an equal position with the members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery. A position arose in connection with the supply of a second relief. When the second relief was asked for, it was apparently determined that a fire commander was not required. The position then arose: if the important post of fire commander was not to be filled, what was to be done with the officer commanding the Australian Garrison Artillery? It was determined to sweep him out. If the Probably, honourable officer commanding had to go, the staff also had to go. And that is what the Military authorities did'. They swept away both the officer commanding the regiment and the regimental staff. But although the authorities said that the position of fire commander was not one it was necessary to fill they showed a short time afterwards that it was necessary to fill the position by the appointment of an officer belonging to the Permanent Artillery in the person of Major Warren. The Minister has stated that he understood that some dissatisfaction has been caused by officers of the regimental staff who objected to the change, and who managed"" to get support from' the men belonging to their companies. The insinuation made in that statement was that the officer who has been placed on the unattached list has been round amongst the men endeavouring to get their sympathy and support with a view of being retained in his position, ' or that he had, at least, been encouraging the men to leave the regiment to which they had belonged for many years. It is only because of their enthusiasm and love of the work that these men have continued so long in the regiment, notwithstanding the difficulties with which they have been confronted. The statement has been made that, at what has been described as "" A dying^ dinner,"" held at Wollongong, Major Chaseling and other officers, by tbeir On the contrary, we should do speeches, sought to induce the men to resign, with a view of helping, more particularly the officer commanding, to retain",19,South Australia Seamen S Artillery A Permanent Force During The

I was at the dinner, to which the Minister of Defence was also invited, but owing to the pressure of Ministerial duties, he was unable to attend it. have a good time there ? with the matter. I wish to treat this question seriously. The coastal defence of New South Wales is all-important, and this action on the part of the Defence authorities is calculated to seriously interfere with it. At the dinner to which I have referred, the Officer Commanding the Australian Garrison Artillery, and other officers, including Major Wiseman, who has been in the regiment for a number of years, instead of endeavouring by speech or action to persuade the men to leave the regiment, did their utmost to induce the men to remain there. The Officer Commanding and Major Wiseman were particularly vigorous in advising the men to stand by the regiment to which they had belonged for so many years; the Major advising the men, to use his own words, to "" hang "" on as long as they could. Notwithstanding that advice, the men resented so strongly the treatment of the Officer Commanding that wholesale resignations have been received, and by the action of the Minister the regiment has been reduced to a condition which we must all deplore. The first intimation sent to the Officer Commanding was dated May, 1912. In it he was told by the Military Board that he and his staff, or rather their positions, were to be. done away with. In a subsequent communication he was told to report what was to be done with himself and his staff. In obedience to that instruction, he recommended that he should take charge of a company, but, later on, he withdrew that proposal, and suggested that he should be placed on the unattached list. wholesale defections from the regiment took place. The Minister then ordered the company commanders to meet and report as to the causes of the defection. They did so, and set out the causes in the following order:(a) Abolition of regimental staff and status. addressing the president, Colonel Wallack, C.B., (£) Regulations for smoking and canteen in camp. (c) Long camp for seventeen days. I draw special attention to the fact that the abolition of the regimental staff and status was set down as the first of the causes leading to these defections, whereas, Major Osborne, Staff Officer for Artillery, in presenting the matter to the Minister, inverted the order, and placed the abolition of regimental staff and status at the foot instead of at the head of the list. On 17th September a conference of militia officers was held in New South Wales to deal with a variety of matters, and when the question of the Australian Garrison Artillery was brought up by the Officer Commanding and Major Warren, the President of the Conference, Colonel Wallack, absolutely refused to allow it to be discussed. So strong did Major Chaseling resent this refusal that next day he addressed the ifollowing letter to the Minister of DefenceSir,-Touching the matter of the conference of militia omcers convened at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, on 16th and 17th September inst., I have the honour to report the following for your information direct, as it seems to me I have not received the treatment from the District Commandant, 2nd Military District, that should have been accorded me under circumstances, some of which are obvious to you and others, that I will show. 1. A circular memorandum by the District Commandant, 2nd Military District, notifyingthe convention of the conference, was sent to Officers Commanding brigades, regiments, and units of the Citizen Forces in his command. 2. I rank as a Commanding Officer and the Senior Officer in the Garrison Artillery till „my case is dealt with by Gazette. 3. Therefore, a copy of above convening memorandum should have been sent me, which was not done. 4. But, by the specific instructions of the 2nd Military District Head-quarters, it was sent to Major B. W. Warren, G.A., my junior officer. 5. My reading of the intention of the convening memorandum is that any militia officer was eligible to have a voice in the conference; if not, it would be abortive in so far as being the means of obtaining for you the information you desire. I draw special attention to the next paragraph6. During the conference, on the evening of That was in May last.

The PRESIDENT -You can't speak here, Major Chaseling; this is a conference of Commanding Omcers. It will thus be seen that both Major Chaseling and Major Warren were refused the right to address themselves to this question, although it had not been discussed at any prior stage. The letter continues7. It will be seen here that Colonel Wallack fourked discussion on the matter of resignation in the Garrison Artillery, and that,he disallowed Major Warren to even state his points. 8. Colonel Wallack refused to let me speak, -a right I claim as a Commanding, as well as 31 Militia, Officer, as per the terms of your conconsidered there, it could not appear on the vening memorandum. I have no desire in any way to be troublesome to you in this matter, but I feel sure you desire information on the subject of the Australian Garrison Artillery disaffection, and I -wished to seize the opportunity of supplying information on a matter which is canvassed by -the public of the Commonwealth. Owing to the District Commandant's action, as above stated in 6, I avail myself of the permission given in Commonwealth Military Regulations, and appeal to you, and trust that an inquiry by an impartial jury will be held into the Garrison Artillery trouble. I beg to add, in conclusion, that the AdjutantMinister has received it. Ceneral, Colonel Chauvel, occupied a seat beside Colonel Wallack, and that I have forwarded the latter a copy of this letter. That is a courteous letter explaining the position in connection with a matter of importance which was being discussed in the daily press in New South Wales, and yet the Minister of Defence did not deign to reply to it. No reply has yet been received to that letter. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Courtesy is not a part of the military business; discipline is. member contend that an officer had no right to speak upon a matter of this kind at a conference specially held to consider, amongst other things, the question of militia resignations? not allowed the only thing to do was to bring the matter before the Minister. A very successful attempt has been made to stifle this matter. That course was continued in connection with the conference held last week in Melbourne. Honourable members who were present at question time yesterday will know that I asked a question of the Minister requesting the Minister of Defence to discover whether this matter had been discussed at the conference held in Melbourne last week.

No attempt whatever has been made to stifle the matter, and the use of that word in connection with this case and the Minister is an abuse of language. has made one of his. usual nasty interjections. I have shown that at the conference held in Sydney, Colonel Wallack, as president, refused officers the right to touch upon this matter, and,, as a consequence, it could not be considered later at the conference held in Melbourne. The Minister of Defence knows all about the matter, which has been brought prominently under his notice on a number of occasions, not only by letter and interview, but also When that was by a motion of adjournment in another branch of this Legislature.

On the 21st September, 1911, three days after the letter I have read was written, and two days after it was received by the Minister, the following notice appeared in the Government Gazette:His Excellency the Governor General, acting -with the advice of the Federal Executive Council, has been pleased to approve of the following changes in connection with the Military Forces of the Commonwealth :Second Military District -Australia n .Garadmitted that, as a result of these resignarison Artillery-Majo r Chaseling is transferred to the unattached list. 30th June, 1912. Major Chaseling was placed on the unattached list as from the 30th June, 1912, in order that he might have no status at the two conferences held in Sydney and Melbourne. His mouth was shut, as I have explained, by the President of the conference held in Sydney, and by placing him on the unattached list as from the ;<oth June, 1912, it would appear to give him no legal standing at the conference. the honourable member should blame. He is the cause of all the mischief. orable member on the other side agrees that in this matter some blame attaches to the military authorities. The honourable members for East Sydney and South Sydney know the treatment meted out to Major Chaseling by the Minsiter of Defence. Board, which is the adviser of the Minister. I hope that honourable members will agree with me that, when officers of the Permanent Forces are allowed to shut men's mouths and treat them in thi.s fashion, apparently with the consent and approval of the Minister of Defence, it is time that we insisted upon a fair and open inquiry into the business. places the most illogical construction upon> the matter.

The Honorary Minister There is no analogy between the two cases. At a conference called to consider, amongst other matters., militia resignations, officers I can refer now to later action were certainly entitled to discuss the wholesale resignations that were taking place from the Australian Garrison Artillery. Such a matter properly came under tbe head of ""militia resignations."" The analogy put forward by the Honorary Minister is no analogy at all. A ll I ask is that a fair and honest deal shall be accorded to our militia soldiers. Three-fourths, at least, of the men in the regiment have shown that they disapprove of the action) which has been taken by the military authorities. In reply to a series of questions upon this matter, put to the Minister by Senator McDougall, the former tions, there was a shortage of gunners at the forts in Sydney, notwithstanding that he had previously declared that such a statement was untrue, and merely represented street gossip. The Minister further acknowledged that he had been misinformed when he stated that a fire commandership had been offered to Major Chaseling, and that the position which had 1 been offered to that officer was that of commander of the fourth company of the Australian Garrison Artillery.",22,South Australia Seamen S Artillery A Permanent Force During The

The high state of efficiency of"" this garrison was absolutely due to his efforts. I do not wonder that the whole regiment is dissatisfied because of the treatment which has been meted out to him. The Minister went on to say:As regards the position of Major Chaseling, it has been attempted to make it appear that his transfer to tbe unattached list was due to his action in complaining that he had not been allowed to represent the Australian Garrison Artillery at the district conference of militia omcers.

To continueThe facts with respect to Major Chaseling are that on 26th June, in reply to a communication from the Department notifying him that it had been decided to discontinue the regimental staff of the Australian Garrison Artillery, he stated that he would be prepared to accept the command of No. 4 Company, -Australian Garrison Artillery. He did not state anything of the kind. This offer he, a few days subsequently, withdrew, ami asked to be placed on the retired list, as from 30th June, 1912. This was also withdrawn, and, on 13th July, an application was received from Major Chaseling that he should be placed on the unattached list. That was the only thing he could do under the circumstances. July. When did the conferences take place ? Major Chaseling's request to be placed on the unattached list. Major Chaseling was still the officer commanding, and had the right to be heard. Major Warren was summoned to attend, but his mouth was also shut by Colonel Wallack. Whatever objection might have been taken to the position of Major Chaseling-and I contend no objection could be taken-nothin g could be said against Major Warren, but as the matter was not allowed to be discussed at the Sydney conference, he could not say anything at the Melbourne conference. The Sydney conference was held on the 13th July. On 21st September his transfer to the unattached list was gazetted in the usual way, with effect as from ist July. fore, that he was placed on the unattached list at his own request, and that on the date of the holding of the militia conference he was, in consequence of his own action, not entitled to represent the Australian Garrison Artillery.

The Minister carefully omitted to mention that on the 19th September Major Chaseling wrote to him regarding Colonel Wallack's action at the conference, and that, although he received that letter on the 20th, he returned no reply. In order to legalise Colonel Wallack's action, and to put Major Chaseling out of court, the Gazette notice published on the 21st September dated the retirement back to the 30th June.

Sometimes big steamers which have 'been loading at Newcastle have had to leave with only a portion of their cargo, and fill up with coal at Port Kembla. I feel sure that honourable members realize the danger of leaving a port of that description absolutely unprotected.

In consequence of the resignation of these men these two important places are left practically undefended. I ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether, in his opinion, that is a proper position, to say nothing of what has happened in connection with the fortifications in Sydney?

I trust that I have satisfied honourable members of the seriousness of the position so far as the Australian Garrison Artillery is concerned. This matter was not allowed to be ventilated at the conference which was held specially to consider these grievances. officers are apparently endeavouring to get rid of capable militia, officers with a view. of becoming absolute cocks of the walk. I hope that I shall have the support of honourable members generally in my appeal to the Minister of Defence to order a full inquiry to be held into the causes which have brought about the disbandment of a fine regiment and caused dissatisfaction generally amongst military men in New South Wales. On the Estimates for last year I endeavoured to point out to the Minister of Defence the seriousness of the position which he had created by his action in conaiejrion with the Australian Garrison Artillery. He will not deny, I feel sure, that a finer body of men. than the Australian Garrison Artillery at Sydney never existed in any military service in the world. Many of these men I have known from boyhood, and their fathers have been my close and esteemed friends, holding honourable positions in Sydney. The whole trouble appears to have arisen out of a few words which Colonel Wallack had with Major Chaseling about manoeuvring or during camp. From that moment Colonel Wallack and the Military Board seemed to have determined to push this fine body of men out of existence. It is quite true that the men in their classification have proved themselves superior to the permanent men. They have shown themselves ready at all times to perform any duty intrusted to them. Previously this section of the military service was under permanent officers. That proved an utter failure, as is shown by the fact that, formerly, the regiment numbered 440 men, whereas under a permanent officer it never got above 200, and their classification was never anything like so high as it was when in charge of a militia officer I confess I cannot understand the action of the Minister, who has shown himself at all times prepared to meet the wishes of honourable members, and anxious to do his best in the interests of the service. There would seem to be at have taken this course merely because work some influence which no one can understand. . An honourable senator in another place, and one of my colleagues here, sought some light on the question, but were unable to solve the difficulty, and we can get from the Minister no excuse or grounds for his extreme opposition to the request that has been made to him. I realize, The permanent however, that no civilian in the position of the Minister of Defence could undertake the whole control of this large Department, but must necessarily pay great respect to the advice of the Military Board; and I really believe that the present position is not due to the Minister but to his advisers. Permanent officers do not, in my opinion, make good oflicers for the militia. They are accustomed to play the autocrat with the men under their control in the permanent service, and they seek to apply the same methods to the militia; but this, of course, in the case of civilian forces, is a great^mistake. Then again, the permanent officers do not like the Saturday afternoon or the night parades, and such work ought to be left to militia officers, who make militarism their hobby, and in all things are quite at one with the men. The Garrison Artillery represents a purely technical branch of the service, and the members of this regiment require some years of training before they become expert artillerymen. The position is much the same as that in ordinary civil life; it requires, for instance, several years to turn out an efficient plumber, though a man may become expert with the pick and shovel in a very short time. However that may be, it is a. serious matter when there is great discontent in a large body of men like this. The members of the Garrison Artillery held a dinner at the Victoria Barracks, at which there was an attendance of some 400, and there, in language to which no exception could be taken, implored the Minister to retain the services of the militia officer. Of course, we all realize that in times of serious trouble, all the forces-and , indeed all the citizens of the Commonwealth -woul d be under the control of the permanent officers of the forces.

They say that they cannot afford to go to the expense of a lawsuit. The Government will not even tell them what value is placed on their properties. There ought to be a local tribunal to which property-owners could go for arbitration. There is an efficient administrator in the Territory, who is trusted and respected-Colone l Miller."" Why not give him power to enable him to treat with owners in regard to values? Why not have a little Home Rule in connection with the matter ? Why should the whole business be dealt with from Melbourne? Colonel Miller, Colonel Owen, and Mr Scrivener, who are on the spot, are all competent men, and with their aid it should be easy to arrive at finality. Honourable members should insist on justice being done to residents of the Capital, who have no votes, and apparently are to have no consideration from the Minister. The answer given this morning respecting the railway to Jervis Bay was by no means satisfactory. We arc aware that a railway has been promised, yet we can obtain no information about thc survey. The Minister simply says that the matter is coming on in a few days. Surely that is not satisfactory. Why. also, should' the Commonwealth stand in the way of the State Government connecting Nowra with Jervis Bay by rail. Surely we ought to be able to get definite information as to what is proposed to be done. I urge that the Administrator, and the officials, be given power to deal with property-owners. Unfortunate selectors who have a few hundred acres, worth, perhaps, no more than £1,500, naturally want to know what value the Government put upon their properties.

The position is doubly hard for these men, who have no representation in this House, and who think, therefore, that Parliament pays no regard to their interests. I do not think that is so. some cause for such an opinion. seems to be. better advocate than they have in the honourable member. the Honorary Minister thinks that one can catch more flies with, honey than with vinegar; but he knows that I have no official right to speak here on behalf of the people of the Territory.

The Administrator is trusted and respected, and why should he not have the power to appoint an arbitrator where necessary ? ferred properties, representing some £9,000,000. very great satisfaction. He is quite capable of doing this work. Let him obtain the owners' valuations, and if they differ from the Government valuations and the parties cannot agree, let him appoint an arbitrator to arrive at a settlement locally instead of these men being sent to the High Court. Another matter to which I desire to refer in connection with the Federal Capital is the absence of banking facilities. A number of men within the Territory have their homes mortgaged to the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, which cannot legally lend money outside the State. The Federal Territory is now considered to be outside New South Wales, and therefore the State bank cannot lend money to farmers there. The Government should arrange for the Commonwealth Bank to extend to them the facilities they would enjoy if they were within the State of New South Wales.

In the main streets of various towns land is being resumed at high prices for Savings Bank purposes, new buildings are being erected, and three sets of oflicials are engaged in doing work which could be carried out by one. The taxpayers have to bear the cost, and they are naturally becoming alarmed. I hope that we shall back up Mr Miller, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, in his efforts to bring about co-operation, between the Commonwealth and the State Savings Banks. The Prime Minister has told us that, although he has made overtures to the State Governments in this direction, they will do no business with him. Banks object to being absorbed. the people will absorb some of those who are responsible for the present situation, and in the interests of this Parliament the electors should be told who is to blame. They should be told who are insisting upon the continuance of a system which must -mean the duplication and triplication of banks and banking officials. It is becoming quite a common saying in many country towns to-day, "" If you want to sell vour land, offer it to one of the Savings Banks."" In New South Wales we have at the present time three sets of Savings Banks. not need to buy land for Savings Bank business; it can use its own post-offices.

The ex-Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Barrier, and others who have held that office, are agreed that the allowance should be increased, and the Government should anticipate the passing of the Estimates and at once give the keepers of allowance post-offices the extra payment for which provision has been made.

I should like to ask whether something could not be done to speed up our mail services in New South Wales. Our mails are being carried by coaches and horses, whilst passengers are carried over the same routes by motor cars. On the road between Cooma and Bega the mail and a passenger car leave Cooma at the same time, and, whilst the passengers get into Bega at 11 or 12 o'clock in the day, the mails do not reach Bega until 10 or 11 o'clock at night. It seems absurd that a commercial traveller following the same road as that followed by letters from his firm would get to his destination several hours before his letters reach him. Perhaps the Postmaster-General will follow the example of the Minister of Home Affairs in this matter, and send a ""chaser "" after some of these people, and stir them up. In New South Wales, apparently, the. State Government have no money to build even railways that have been promised, and in the circumstances the Department should take some steps tospeed up mail communication. I have in mind the necessity for speedier mail communication between Tarago and Moruya, Nowra and Bega, Cooma and Bega, Edenand Cooma, and Bombala and Delegate. speeding up. the Department in connection with this matter is that they cannot afford to pay for the speedier means of transit which can be supplied by private enterprise, but to carry that answer to its logical able member suggest an appeal to the conclusion we should go back to the days of the bullock-dray, since the mails could be carried more cheaply by a bullock-dray than by a coach. have already a few motor cars of their own. days motor cars are absolutely essential to enable people to get about quickly. I repeat my request that the Government will anticipate the vote on the Estimates, and will grant increases to allowance officers. I believe there is a vote of £40,000 on the Estimates to increase the payment to officers in charge of allowance post-offices. We know that the vote will be passed, and the increases will date back to the 1st July of this year, and I see no reason in the circumstances, why the vote should not be anticipated. Many of these people [210]2 are in hard straits, and if something is not done for them immediately they must resign their offices as they cannot now get a living. I am not the only member of the House who has heard from these men. Letters are received by honourable members representing every constituency, asking what these men are to do. It would be merely an act of simple justice for the Minister to anticipate the vote on the Estimates, as I have suggested, and pay the increases at once. I again ask honourable members to say whether it is fair that the owners of land in the Federal Capital area should have to go to the High Court for redress if they do not approve of the valuation put upon land resumed by the Government. In one case that has been settled, fortunately, the owner of the land resumed was a wealthy man. After he had taken fifteen or twenty witnesses toSydney, and appeared before the High Court the Government gave in. That must have cost a good deal of money, as I suppose the Government had to pay the witnesses' expenses. We should give Colonel Miller the Administrator, and Mr Scrivener, the Director of Crown Lands of the Territory, some real power and establish some degree of Home Rule and local government in the Territory. These All these services require officials might at least make recommendaThe answer we get from tions which the Minister can subsequently deal with instead of-taking people to the High Court. Mr J.

I think it is about time we brought this session to a close, but if something is not done in this matter I.shall have to move the adjournment of the House to deal with it . I desire to refer, first of all, to the matters staff, and it was a great hardship upon him dealt with by the honourable members for Illawarra and East Sydney. I shall not go particularly into the case of Major Chaseling and his staff, but propose to deal more generally with the treatment accorded to militia officers by the present Defence authofeel very strongly is that he was not allowed rities. Years ago many men, from purely patriotic motives, joined the Military Forces as volunteers, and received no pay or allowance of any kind. I say that those men are deserving of more consideration at the hands of the authorities than they are receiving to-day. I can instance my own case. T joined the Light Horse as a volunteer. I went to considerable expense in purchasing my uniform and military saddle, and getting a suitable horse for the work, and travelling about at my own expense. I say that I , and. those who f o l lowed the same course, are deserving of some consideration from the authorities, and we are not getting it. The militia are discouraged in every way, or, at all events, do not receive the encouragement due to them for the work they did in the past as volunteers. I remind honourable members that when the volunteers were changed to militia fhey did not receive any very great remuneration for their services. Taking my own case again I can say that when I became a lieutenant-colonel, commanding a regiment of militia, I received the handsome remuneration of £ 3 4 per annum, and I paid as much as fifteen guineas for a mess-jacket. Those who undertook military duties years ago, without remuneration, and -have continued to perform them, travelling about, very often at their own expense, are certainly deserving of consideration. They are more likely to be keener in the discharge of their duties than are our permanent officers. Without making any reference to Major Chaseling, I consider that militia officers who have gone through the mill are just as capable of commanding re. giments as are permanent officers. I would take it as an insult if anybody told me that I am not as capable of commanding a regiment as is any permanent officer in Australia. I will undertake to say that if I were placed in front of any regiment or brigade of light horse alongside any ipermant officer I would absolutely lose him. I believe that Major Chaseling was a capable artillery officer. that statement. and his staff that his regiment should be practically disbanded. inquiry ? to ventilate his grievances at either of the two conferences which were held. Exception was taken by the Honorary Minister to the use by the honourable member for Illawarra of the word "" stifling."" the word "" stifling,"" as applied to the Minister of Defence, was an abuse of language. this case was stifled by somebody. I take it that it was stifled at the instance of the Military Board. the fullest responsibility. ister can object to the use of the word "" stifling"" in connection with that responsibility. At all events, the fact remains that Major Chaseling was not allowed an inquiry. The militia officers, as a whole, have not received the consideration which is due to them. Take, for instance, the appointment of a temporary Commandant in any of the States. Until the present regime, the practice followed was that when the Commandant of a State was temporarily absent, his place was filled by the senior officer of that State, irrespective of whether he was a militia or a permanent officer. I admit that a militia officer might not have such a knowledge of details as a permanent officer, and, therefore, might not be able as satisfactorily to discharge the duties of Commandant for an indefinite period. I recollect that on more than one occasion the late Colonel Waddell was temporarily appointed as Commandant of New South Wales. But recently, when the Commandant of that State was absent, a junior permanent officer was temporarily appointed to the position. That, in my opinion, cast an undeserved slur on the militia officers of that State. I hold that these officers are not",31,South Australia Seamen S Artillery A Permanent Force During The

At that gathering representatives of -Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia -were present. J907 a bounty was made payable upon the imanufacture of wool tops. I take it that Parliament acted in perfect good faith at .that time, and with the idea of encouraging the manufacture of wool tops and the employment of more hands in the woollen industry.

We are told, first of all, that the company possesses machinery which practically does away with the necessity of labour with regard to wool scouring -that they have a machine, 120 feet long, which is worked by a boy. This fact is made use of to boom the company, being held out as an inducement to the public to take shares.

It monopolises the whole bounty, so that it is imposoccasion. sible for a man, unless he has practically the Bank of England behind him, to compete with it.

If this system is allowed to continue it will be a disgrace to the Parliament. the Minister will not carry out his threat to ask the House to agree to the payment of the bounty for a further period. If he does, the proposal will meet with strong opposition from myself and others, for I consider that it is a scheme to perpetuate the present penalty on the wool-growers of Australia. is interesting to point out that the honourable member for North Sydney is a follower of an honourable member whose Government inaugurated the payment of this bounty.

The honourable member for North Sydney Is, I understand, connected with the wool industry. He is a little squatter in his own way, and likes to pander to the big squatters, who have their knife into the wool tops industry. Let me show why the meat combine in New South Wales is opposed to this industry. When the industry was started it was found 1 necessary to have the sheep-skins almost hot from the abattoirs in order that the whole of the strength of the wool might be"" retained. The Sydney Meat Preserving Company, desiring to destroy the industry, refused to allow-it to have its skins. The firm was, therefore, compelled to go into the market to buy sheep, and to slaughter them in order to obtain the This is a monopoly, and is going requisite skins. It thus became a competitor in the supply of meat to the general public, and my honourable friend's company I hope that and his friends of the meat combine im Sydney have been hostile to it from the first. They are opposed to it because it is supplying cheap meat to the people of Sydney, and my honourable friend does not desire that the people shall have cheapmeat. He is one of the meat ring. We have in New South Wales the Auburn. Meat Works, which conducts a large canning industry, and is a large exporter of meat.

I can well understand why the AuburnMeat Company and the Sydney meat ring have, from the first, fought those engaged in the wool-top industry. I wish to make the position clear. The bounty was agreed ito by the last Parliament because it was believed that we should do something more than produce raw material. A Bill was passed providing for the payment of bounties to encourage the manufacture of iron -and steel, and so to confer a benefit on the -country and to provide employment for labour. This Parliament has also agreed to the payment of a bounty to encourage the production of oil. That was a wise step to take, because it means the development of another of our resources, and the employment of our own labour. when it is proposed to encourage an industry designed to convert our wool into one stage of manufacture, my honourable friend, who is an exporter of greasy wool, and does not want to employ any labour, raises his voice in opposition. on in the honourable member's own electorate. -of it. like to represent South Sydney let him -come over and contest my seat at the next -election.

As a matter of fact, it has But never sent one pound of wool to Bradford. It sends its wool tops to Japan, where they compete with wool tops from Bradford. That is the statement of the manager of the company, and it can be proved by reference to its books. He states thatThe prices we obtained for all our tops sold to the Japanese last year averaged 2 7 ^ . per lb. On the other hand, the total imports of wool tops into Japan from Bradford and elsewhere average only 27d. per lb.

I have nothing whatever to do with that syndicate, and I ask that his statement should be withdrawn. It is untrue. that the honourable member for South Sydney intended to convey that the honourable member for North Sydney was personally interested in that syndicate. Otherwise I would have stopped him. I took it that he used the words in a general sense. I regret to say that honourable members are getting into the habit of conversing loudly and interrupting me when I am speaking. That is one of the worse disordersof which any honourable member can be guilty. It has been laid down over and But bounty is over again that when Mr Speaker is on his feet honourable members must remain silent.

If he did intend his remark to be offensive he must withdraw it. my remarks to the honourable member personally. I referred only to the company which he is keeping. I understand that, he is championing the cause of the opponents of the wool top industry-in other words, that he is championing the Meat Combine in New South Wales.

I desire to make an appeal to the Government to take steps at an earlier date than they have indicated to settle the conditions which are to obtain in the sugar industry. The Prime Minister has stated that he will await the report of the Sugar Commission. The Minister of Trade and -Customs will remember that on the 5th ""September Mr Denham, the Premier of Queensland, wrote to the Prime Minister as follows :SIR, I have the honour to inform you that my colment. league, the Treasurer, on his return to Brisbane, communicated to me your express opinion that the Federal Prime Minister told him that he it would make for the welfare of the sugar industry if both Excise and bounty were abolished; removal of bounty and Excise; he said, further, ' that you would do your best to influence your that if the Queensland Government were pre; colleagues to take the same view, and, if sucpared to do certain things-if they were precessful, would next session introduce Bills for pared to bring in a certain measure-h e was -the repeal of so much of the Excise and bounty prepared to move at once in that particular re-sections as applied to the sugar industry.

But there was a "" power behind the ""thanking you for this attitude on the question, throne"" which might not let the FederalI must say I was not unprepared for the inPremier carry out what he regarded as a sane formation, as I was aware you had on former occasions expressed yourself similarly thereon. Whatever co-operation I can give you in the matter will be cheerfully rendered, for I am fully satisfied that along such lines as you suggest lies the only solution of the difficulties which have to be met. I hope, therefore, you will be able to prevail on your colleagues to take action in the direction mentioned, and to take it during the current session of Parliament, for delaying it until next year would entail very serious consequences on the industry, and, among other evils, the intensifying of the present feeling of uncertainty and unrest in those connected with it. If you can give me your assurance on this point I shall undertake to introduce legislation prohibiting Asiatic aliens from engaging or working in the industry, and compensating such aliens as may be bond fide owners or leaseholders of land now under sugar cane. The people of Australia desire the sugar industry to be a white labour one, and I gladly give my support to any arrangement which will ensure the realization of that desire. It is also their wish that this industry should pay the white labour .the highest wage consistent with its prosperity, and the better to achieve that end I shall so enlarge the Industrial PeaceB ill as to bring sugar workers (both field and mill hands) under Industrial Boards. I think that will be the most effective means of protecting their interests. The Minister will see from that communication that the Premier of Queensland distinctly stated that if the bounty and Excise upon sugar were abolished, he would introduce into the Queensland Parliament the legislation necessary to give effect to the conditions which he outlined. Cannot the Minister induce his colleagues to take action to repeal the sugar bounty and Excise with a view to enabling the Queens land Legislature, during the current ses sion of the Parliament, to give effect to the Premier's proposals? On the 13th November the Treasurer of that State again referred to the matter. He saidThey did not know what was going to be done elsewhere. They were not there to say whether the new regulations were right or wrong; but they said that if it was necessary to have those regulations, and it was not possible for sugar growing to be carried on successfully under them, there should be equalization of bounty and Excise, or something else which would be equivalent.

He said that it was utterly imshow that there is more land being planted. possible to pay the wages, and that the 2s. 2d. should have been given without the against the integrity or ability of the ingrowers having to ask for it.

[3.26] -The Minister of Trade and Customs must be a terrible man. They say that he has gone back on Protection, and, according to the honourable member for Darling Downs, he is acting improperly with regard to the sugar industry. This morning the honourable members for Illawarra and North Sydney spoke strongly about the bounty on wool tops. The former is, of course, a Free Trader, and reading between the lines the honourable member for North Sydney, like the honourable member for Lang, is also a Free Trader. Evidently the bounty has had the effect of establishing the manufacture of wool tops in Australia, and as Free Traders they do not like that. We were told that our wool tops are purchased by the Japanese, and although the honourable member for North Sydney seemed to deprecate that, there have been other occasions on which he has spoken differently of Japan. In the past the Japanese have not known, when buying wool tops, whether the wool was Australian or not. Now they know where it comes from. The honourable member for North Sydney complained that Australian wool tops are competing against Bradford wool tops, but it was the intention of Parliament in establishing the bounty that the manufacture of wool tops should be made an Australian industry, although only the first step towards the manufacture of wool and cloth. I ask if British manufacturers ever consider Australian competitors when they have commodities to sell. If we manufacture any particular commodity and obtain a market for it in Australia we are immediately undercut by the British manufacturer by way of dumping, or in some other form. Honourable members opposite are accusing those associated with this company with being a band of political pirates. the work done in Australia. we on this side have charged other manufacturers with being pirates and robbing t.he workers and consumers, we have got very little support from honourable members opposite. however, they are venomously assailing this company ; and one of the reasons given for the attack is that this branch of the industry enjoys an immunity from labour troubles-that the company are not like other manufacturers in Australia who rob their employees. does the company employ, and what wages are paid Y 700 hands employed. As to the purchase of machinery, it is open to any other company to do the same; and the fact is that, by their method of working, the company have got the better of the wool and meat kings of Australia. Honourable members opposite regard it as impudence on the part of the company that it should actually save buyers' conunission, rob the poor middleman, and deprive the European speculator of his profits. As a matter of fact, our great desire is to deprive the European comber of his profit, because our desire is to manufacture our own natural products as far as we possibly can. manufacture, but on the export. ber knows as well as I do that if we manufacture so largely and cheaply as to be able to export at a profit we are only doing what every civilized country in the world is endeavouring to do. In the past the argument of the Free Trader has been that we should never be able to manufacture for export; and, now that we are doing so under Protection, it is regarded in the light of a crime. There are two ways in which we may protect industries. The first is, of course, to impose a. duty at the seaboard, and the other is to give a bounty to encourage production, where it is felt that a duty might disarrange the industry if we cannot manufacture largely enough, and that our own people might be exploited. I have heard honourable members opposite advocate a bonus as a form, of Protection; but because the interests of their friends or supporters-espe cially foreign commission agents and the wool knights of Bradford-ar e affected, they are up in arms. No honourable member opposite has attempted to-day to defend this bonus on wool tops. The honourable member for Darling Downs, as a member of the Deakin Ministry, induced us to offer bonuses on many commodities produced in Australia; but he must have ceased to regard bonuses in a favorable On the present occasion, light, because he has allowed this attack to-day without a word of remonstrance.

Ihe amount of money earned by adult males jper week of 48 hours ranges from £ 4 for skilled wool-pullers and sorters down to £ 2 ns. for .ordinary able-bodied men, and £ 2 8s. for men -of light physique doing light work. These rates represent a rise of 30 per cent, -over those ruling before the bonus came into -operation, and the increase is due to the bonus. Other employers are forced to pay the same -rates. This accounts, in a large measure, for their opposition and for that of the meat ring, who also have to pay the 30 per cent, rise, and do not like it. That is the trouble. The honourable member for Bendigo-the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, which, for some years, piled up evidence, worthless and otherwise-and his leader, the honourable member for Ballarat, with three or four other honourable members opposite, are supposed to be Protectionists, and yet, on every occasion they, by their silence, allow individuals who sit with them to condemn any form of Protection, and do their best to cripple Australian industries. At the same time, however, newspapers which support those honourable members claim them as Protectionists. We know that they are not Protectionists, and that in Victoria they have some trouble in some of their political leagues, in the effort to smooth matters over in this connection. member for Fawkner did not "" slip "" very often when the Tariff was last before us; but after his association with the Women's National League and other political bodies of that ilk he will not be allowed to vote as he pleases on the next occasion.. yiven much chance to vote this session! whether those so-called protectionist members opposite were not in league with the Minister of Trade and Customs to permit One of the of his Estimates being pushed through in forty seconds the other afternoon.

336,Mr Mathews,"A t the last referendamorrow to this Parliament the Labour party would have ""up their sleeve"" some other excuse for not touching the Tariff. we should bring before this Parliament an up-to-date scientific Protectionist Tariff. Here is a letter signed "" Free Trader,"" which appears in to-day's Argus, and deals with the Opposition and the fiscal issueSir,-What are free traders to do at the Federal contest? Are they to stand quietly by and hear so-called Liberal candidates advocate, in the most extravagant terms,, practically prohibitive duties, a system which is gradually being abandoned by every civilized community? Logically the Labour party's position on the question is unassailable. This party admit that with high protective duties the manufacturers get most of the advantages of a privileged class, and that, until some provision is made to share the plunder with the operatives, no further increases in the present sufficiently high protection should be tolerated. Is it not abundantly convincing that throughout the universe Liberalism and Free trade are co-extensive terms? A genuine free trader strenuously objects to a protectionist being called a Liberal, and being placed in the same classification as Cobden, Bright, Gladstone, Davitt, and O'Connell. The exaggerated appeals to national animosity, hatred, and all uncharitableness against Germany, preached by Messrs. Mauger and Cook at Moonee Ponds last night, is strongly to be deprecated. Admitting that the free traders in Victoria are in a minority, time ago, exactly describes the Opposition. still this fact must be remembered, that if three-fourths of this minority are goaded by these incitements to prohibition to vote for the Labour candidates, what becomes of the so-called Liberal candidates for the Senate? As the writer says, our position is unassailable. member consider there is no new Protection now ? Boards? than once in this House that the Wages Boards, as at present constituted, do not give us new Protection. on the Wages Boards. position do if , after the next general election, they are asked to sit side by side with Messrs. Mauger and Hume Cook? It will be a terrible thing for the Free Traders of that party to have to sit with men who are described as supporters of prohibitive Protectionist duties. I should like the Opposition to act fairly and squarely on the Tariff issue. They will take up an honest stand if they say at the next general election, "" We, as a party, drop the fiscal issue; each individual member being allowed to deal with it as he thinks fit."" Will they be prepared to say, ""As a party, we have no fiscal opinions, although, as individuals, the honourable member for Ballarat, the honourable member for Illawarra, and every member of our party, are free to vote as they please on the Tariff question. We are not a Protectionist party, and do not claim to be the Protectionist party, in Australia."" That would be an honest admission for them to make. Tf, however, the so-called Liberal party-in reality the Conservative party-ar e going to be so dishonest as to claim in New South Wales to be the Free Trade party while in Victoria they claim to be the Protectionist party because they think it will suit themto do so, then, the sooner the people of Australia know it the better. When we are empowered to pass laws providing for effective Protection for every one, the Labour party will be prepared to vote for a full measure of Protection, so that Australia may manufacture all that she requires to make her self-contained. The word "" Freetectionist,"" which was coined some I wish to warn the few Protectionists on the other side of the Chamber, especially the honourable member for Wimmera, and some other honourable members who pretend to be Protectionists but who continue to sit with Free Traders, that at the next election, if they are not honest in this matter they will be exposed. I wish also to say that! honourable members opposite who are Free Traders, lock, stock, and barrel, cannot possibly hope for the return to this House of Mr Hume Cook, who has been denounced by the Argus, and by the whole of its writers. How can they possibly associate with him, seeing that he is an avowed Protectionist, and that they have no fiscal faith whatever? tion of the honourable member's party? place the new Protection on the forefront of our programme. I have frequently told the Opposition that when we have power to enact certain laws, if any'honourable member upon this side of the House refuses to vote for the new Protection, he will have to leave the Labour party.

But, in view of the opportunities which they have had to attack the Government on the question of Protection-opportunitie s of which they have not availed themselves-the least they can do is to admit that they passed the whole of the Customs Estimates in forty seconds, instead of debating the advisableness of increasing the duties which are at present levied on commodities imported into Australia. wish to protest against the delay which is occurring in the construction of the transcontinental railway. muddle which has been made by the Government in the purchase of materials for that line, and in the contract into which they have entered for the supply of karri sleepers, has put them in such a position that the construction of the line will occupy at least ten years instead of about three years. The Bill authorizing the building of this railway was passed by Parliament more than twelve months ago, and if the right steps had at once been taken to secure sleepers and rails, there would have been at least 300 Qr 400 miles of sleepers ready to lay down. In addition, those sleepers would have been more suitable for use than will be sleepers which are obtained green from the forest. The wild statements which have been made by the Minister in an endeavour to justify his position, are absolutely childish. The assertions which have been made for the purpose of injuring jarrah as a timberassertions as to its non-durability-ar e not borne out by facts. It is distinctly unfair to the jarrah industry of Western Australia that such statements should be made and circulated broadcast throughout the Commonwealth. On the 29th October last, in reply to a question put to him by the honourable member for Swan-as will be seen by reference to Hansard, page 4746-the Minister said he had telegraphed to the Premier of Western Australia, and had received a reply in which the following passage occurredAlso produced at same time pieces of powellised karri 5 f t . 10 in. and 7 f t . n in. by 9 in. and 4^ in., taken out 5th October, 1912, from culvert, which was built on 28th April, 1908, for test purposes of powellised karri inside old jarrah culvert on Woonerup line, which had been destroyed by white ants. The powellised karri was found to be perfectly sound, no sign of drv rot or white ants. At the time the Minister gave that answer, I did not catch the name of the line from which the samples were taken. But, in reading Hansard, I was surprised to find that it was the Woonerup line. Now, I happen to have converted that line from one of the first timber lines laid down in Western Australia. I pulled it up and relaid it with heavy sleepers. It is most extraordinary that the wqpd supposed to have been eaten by white ants should have been taken from a culvert in that line, because, in pulling it up, I found that miles and miles of jarrah sleepers which were laid down thirty years before were perfectly sound, so sound that I used them again. I claim that the After they had been re-laid for several years, Millar Brothers sold that line to the Government, which continued to run it on the same sleepers. What is the use of the Minister making such wild statements here ? Will they convince the people of Western Australia, who know differently? Will they convince people in other parts of the world who have purchased jarrah by hundreds of ship-loads? This Woonerup line was the first railway in ""Western Australia which ran into the jarrah country. It was built by Ballarat people and over it was run the first locomotive made in Ballarat, and the first locomotive which was used in Western Australia. These jarrah sleepers, I presume, are still in use on that line. Yet the Minister has the audacity to tell us that white ants ate the jarrah in one of the culverts upon it. It is such statements which discount his position in the eyes of the Commonwealth. If such ridiculous statements "" go down "" in this House, they will certainly not ""go down "" outside it. On a previous occasion, I stated that an 8-ft. 10-in. by 5-in. sleeper is long enough' for a line with a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge. The Minister affirms that a 9-ft.. sleeper is in use on that gauge. It is in places. But it is in use only for the reason that it was adopted years ago when chairs were used on railways, and when, owing to their use, a certain amount of timber was required outside the rail which is not required to-day. One of the best lines laid in Australia is that between Wolseley and Adelaide, which has a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, and upon which 8-ft. 6-in. sleepers are used. Can anybody say that that is not a perfect piece of railway construction? Can it be urged that 8-ft. sleepers, with 80-lb. instead of 60-Ib. rails, would not provide a track good enough for any train in the world to run over? ThenI find that the",44,South Australia Seamen S Artillery A Permanent Force During The
347,Mr Hedges (Fremantle) [4.4],"Istatement that the sleepers on the Pennsylvania line are 9 feet long is absolutely in6leepers through the powellising process they correct. I have in my possession photos showing portions of that line, over which the fastest trains from New York run, and I may tell honourable members that the sleepers in use upon it are not 9 feet long. They are only 8 feet 6 inches long. Generally speaking, they are small pine and half-round sleepers. In Canada, the people never see sleepers equal to those we produce in Australia. altogether a better class. should we lay down a sleeper of a greater length than we really require? I would also point out that if a long sleeper is put down in a line, it becomes hollow in the middle, and' thus tightens the gauge. If we use 80-lb. rails, the least dip in the sleeper will bring the tops of the rails toing were found hundreds of years ago to gether, and thus the gauge will be tightened. This results from using sleepers which are too long. A sleeper which is just long enough is much better than one which is too long. Seeing that the difference between the cost of constructing the transcontinental line with 8-ft. as against 9-ft. sleepers means a difference of from £150,000 to £170,000, I wish to know whether we can afford to go in for these fads? countries is surely good enough for us, especially when we have better material. We have been told that a 9-ft. sleeper is the standard length adopted in New South Wales for a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge. It may have been when Mr Deane was the Engineer-in-Chief there. But I would like to say that since he relinquished that position the standard length has been altered to 8 ft. 6 in., and even that is too long. authorities have only just awakened to the fact that, in the construction of new lines, the use of railway chairs has been abandoned. The use of those chairs necessitates the use of a longer sleeper. I wish particularly to protest against the delay which will be caused in the construction of the transcontinental line if the Government adhere to their determination to have the sleepers for it cut at mills erected by the Western Australian Government. So much time will be required to erect the mills and plant for the powellising that the railway could be practically built before timbers have been made absolutely uselessthe sleepers will be ready. Sleepers of the best quality in the world could have been obtained in millions without the erection of a single mill. No sawn sleeper is as good Mr Hedges. as a hewn sleeper, and if you put sawn will go to pieces. The Railways Commissioners of Victoria tried tlie powellising system, but found 'that it spoilt the timber. They sent picked timber to Sydney to be treated, but found that the treatment was not a success. The timber which I have brought here waspassed by the Defence Department, but it was required to be powellised. A contract for the conOui sleepers are of struction of military waggons was let to Why, then, Robison Brothers, and timber which, had been passed by the Defence Department was sent to New South Wales to be powellised, with the result that on its return it was condemned by the Department,, and'is now all to pieces. As I showed 1 on a former occasion, boiling and steamdeteriorate timber. I have it on the best authority that a large order for powellising was given by Alcock, the billiard-table maker, and that the timber was spoiled by the process. Timber powellised in New Zealand under the supervision of the engineer now in charge at the Port Augusta end of the Western Australian railway was not a success, the sleepers rotting. I have a statement here to the effect that timber powellised for Messrs. Perry, of Sydney What is good enough for other and Melbourne-ver y big people-wa s spoiled, the charge being 6s. per 100 super, feet for 3 inches by 3 inches, and 7s. 9d. for 4J inches by 4 inches. 1 cost to powellise 10 inches by 5 inches? more than is paid for the timber at the mill. inches by 2 feet 6 inches cost. 4d. each for It has been altered because the powellising, but the process was not a success.

352,Mr Hedges,"Tasmanian bluegum,.""the account from which I have obtained -my information, for a reason which it is -said is no doubt obvious to me after my -inspection of the samples treated. Mr saturation. To ascertain this, you must cross-cut Rennick, a civil engineer, who was for years in charge of big works in Western Australia, and has been in Tasmania, and -is a son of a gentleman who was at one 'time Engineer-in-Chief for Victoria, has written to me from Cooma, New South Wales. He saysI cannot understand how they can produce a -report from Mr Light stating that the principal -timbers used for sleepers in Western Australia are jarrah and karri. You may not know that sthe Public Works Department in 1891 and 1892 used karri for weatherboards in some of the -station buildings and for the lower chords of the .40-inch truss spans on the Perth-Bunbury portion of the south-western railway. The first 'building put upon that line was a stationmaster's 'house at Serpentine early in 1892. Karri was used for weatherboards, jarrah for framing, and ordinary white deal for lining. middle of 1893, before the line was opened for traffic, the weatherboards were renewed with jarrah, having been completely eaten out. Up 'to that time the lining was untouched, showing that those white ants evidently preferred karri to ordinary deal lining. In 1896 it was found 'that the ants had got into the karri lower chords of the 40-inch spans in spite of these being 'high above the ground on jarrah piles and with -several approach spans in jarrah between them and the embankment, and some were renewed in 1897, and I believe all were renewed before -the end of 1898. They were put up in 1892 and 1893. I have never seen any karri in use -in any standing structure for more than four 'Or five years without .getting the white ant, and Iiave always considered it was a timber to avoid. Now, I shall have to go to school again. Victorian or Tasmanian stringybark or messmate, in my opinion, is just as good as karri, and why -not powellise these timbers and save money. Another unsought letter has come to me from Mr W. J. George, who for a num'ber of years was Commissioner for Railways in Western Australia. He saysWe want the sleepers cut in Western Australia, but we have plenty of jarrah, and that is beyond question as to durability. Karri is .also, beyond question as to lack of durability. I don't understand Light's statement. I do not know of any karri sleepers in the Western Australian railways now. There may be a few in -the Denmark line, bought from Millar, but I don't think there were any anywhere else-of course, leaving out any experimental patchesI am afraid that political influence has something to do with that statement on page 5. Then, as to powellising, it has always been to me a very doubtful sort of process. To boil or semi'boil any sort of timber is to reduce its potentiality as to standing strains. Time seasoning gets rid of the moisture without reducing strength. The boiling processgets rid of the moisture and leaves the timber weaker in every way. The molasses, & c , don't impart strength -the y are only supposed to act as a preserva'tive against ants and rot. Then, as to the process, I doubt very much if 5 per cent, of the sleepers sent to Port Hedland ever got much more than an outer skin. There is (nor can there be) no guarantee or proof of complete the sleeper. Directly a sleeper is crosscut, it becomes useless as a sleeper. Such an opinion as I have read, coming from a man like Mr W. J. George, who had charge of the Western Australian railways, and who knows that the statement that karri is 'principally in use in Western Australia is incorrect, should have some influence with the Government. The following is a letter which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser on the 31st October, 1912The determination of the Federal Government to use karri sleepers in the construction of the East-West Railway has been much discussed. On Wednesday Mr James S. Heithersay, who was connected with the railways in Western Australia for about 15 years, informed a reporter In the that karri was by no means as suitable for sleepers as jarrah. He added, "" I was stationmaster at Albany for seven years,' and was in touch with the traffic arrangements between there and Beverley, a distance of 241 miles. I can remember that trains were frequently slowed clown to ensure safety on the tracks laid with karri. At the Beverley end of the line for about 40 miles jarrah was employed, and the trains often made up on that portion of the track some of the time lost on the karri section. I do not believe that one jarrah sleeper was removed during the time. I was at Albany, whereas relays of karri were frequent. It was a common thing to send messages from the traffic manager's office at Albany to various stations on the line directing engine-drivers to reduce their speed between certain mileages. The instructions remained in force until the karri road was again repaired. I have been informed by reliable authorities that karri is more subject to the attacks of white ants and dry rot. Karri is a good timber for superstructures, but for anything underground or under water jarrah has been proved to be the best. Sir John Forrest and other members have declared against karri. I might add that I know nothing about the merits of the powellising methods."" The writer of that letter used to be in charge of the Great Southern Railway at the Albany end. When the late Mr Batchelor, as Minister of External Affairs, introduced the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, he used the following words as reported in HansardI can assure the honourable member, on the authority of the officials, that the railway, so tar as Oodnadatta, was splendidly made and is in as sound a condition as any in Australia. Then the honourable member for Corio, on the 13th . October, 1910, said in this HouseAs doubts have been expressed as to the coni l l ° °J n T t h e P , ent-way, let me say that, er man although I travelled over it at express speed! the easy running of the train was in marked contrast to the violent oscillation of the Adelaidewhich they could not get rid of, as the London Melbourne express. The sleepers appeared to be in perfect order, and the railway is one of the finest and smoothest that I have had the pleasure of travelling on. That railway, which is 480 miles long, cost £2,242,342, and at the time the honourable member for Corio spoke, it had been in existence for over twenty-five years. It was built, of course, before the powellising process was known. member suggest that the sleepers on that railway have been in the ground twenty-five years? jarrah to be in the ground for forty years; indeed, I have relaid a line with jarrah that had been in the ground for thirty years. The sleepers on this line-jarrah , redgum, and so forth-were , of course, not powellised; and I ask why we should make so costly an experiment with a timber that is acknowledged to be useless for the purpose without powellising? deal to do with the preservation of timber. rotting; and it seems to me that, in view the honourable member for Riverina prethe Government should welcome evidence sently. The following is a letter written of the kind. Then there is a letter, also by Mr CharlesL . Hastie, who has been unasked for, sent to me by MrH . C. for sixty years connected with the timber Mais, M.I.C.E., who for thirty years was business, and is engaged as an expert by Engineer-in-Chief of the South Australian the Western Australian GovernmentTrue, we have very fine forests of that timber, but for sleepers or any other purpose where it will come in contact with damp, karri is bound to go with dry rot. This has been proved in every part of the world where it has been tried. As to the powellising process, no one will ever make me believe that it will prevent karri timber going with dry rot. It is very well to say that a few sleepers have been powellised and laid in the line somewhere near Perth without showing symptoms of dry rot. been proved that this process has not in New Zealand answered all expectations. The money may as well be spent in cutting the forest down and burning it on the ground as in carrying it to Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta. I am speaking after nearly 60 years' knowledge of karri timber, and not from any hearsay. Go where you like in a karri forest you will find no dead charred logs the same as you find in jarrah forest. The karri rots in a very few years. You may see a log with moss growing on it ; give it a kick and your boot will go to the laceholes. Next thing you will see it will have fallen all down like a' heap of manure. It is not many vears ago that the M . C. Davies Company had a large amount of karri cut into 9 x 3 for paving, people had found it was subject to dry rot. Thc timber lay at Karridale until the Millars' K . and J. Company took over that property under the combine. I saw them turning it over; it reminded me of turning a heap of manure. A quantity was cut into telegraph arms, for which Millars had a large order at the time, and it was shipped, but was soon found to be of no use, as the dry rot quickly found its way to where the arms were bolted on to the poles. If Mr O'Malley and others that have control of the work persist in using karri they will be the means of completely damning the timber trade of WA., which has taken 60 years battling against the timbers of the world to get it to the high standard it holds. Jarrah timber has now a world-wide reputation. It is strange that those in authority should fly in the face of public opinion, when we have .jarrah sufficient to lay sleepers in.aU the lines in Australia. Millions could be cut on many parts in the south-west that have been cut out by the various mills. I speak of a class of tree that is too small for ordinary milling and would not pay to take to the mill. They will not grow one inch in 20 years, and are only preventing young timber from growing in their place. I have had a life-long experience of the timbers of the South-West, having worked it in a l l its stages from splitting in the bush for fencing to the finest piece of cabinet work. This man with an experience of sixty years railways, and is now President of the Society of Civil EngineersI have jotted down a few remarks on the proposal to use ""treated"" karri-in lieu of sleepers of jarrah for the Transcontinental railway. I have given an extract from a paper prepared by Mr Octave Chanute, an American engineer of high repute, and an authority on, timber. The time that must necessarily be occupied in. treating sleepers effectively must be a bar to its. ThisI can scarcely believe, and it has use on a line where time is the principal element. Of course, sleepers can be "" treated "" insufficiently, and there will be every inducement tohurry the process, which will be fatal to its. success. It must occupy a certain time to extract the sap frorn 10 in. x 5 in. timber thoroughly, and' unless this is done, the timber will be in a worsecondition than it was before being subject totreatment. If persisted in, disaster and disgrace to alt* concerned must follow.

356,Mr Hedges,"As I shall prove to of the proposed £2,000,000 experiment,What about the statement that it is 9 feet?Proceedings of Inst. C. Engineers, 1907, Vol. CLIX ., f . 509. A Commission was appointed by the Agricultural Society of South France, and made a report on the result of experiments by Messrs. Sege and Fleury-Pironnet, and also on experiments of their own. Condition Favorable to Impregnation. They stated that the condition most favorable for injection of preservatives is obtained by steaming 212 deg. to 240 deg. Fah. for ten minutes to three hours, according to the kind and state of the wood. This must be followed for ten minutes with as great a vacuum as possible. Steaming not used in Europe when Creosote is Used. With creosote steaming is not used in Europe. Within the last three years doubts have been cast upon the advantages of steaming even for mineral salts. Author's Experiments for Ten to Fifteen Years. The author (O. Chanute), after experimenting for ten to fifteen years, considers the question depends entirely upon the condition of the wood to be treated. The Problem. The problem is to replace the sap with some preservative substance. To clear the sap cells so as to make room for the preservative, some motive power must be produced inside the wood. Modes Used. This may be by steam generated in the wood by steaming or by air heated by steaming, which has replaced the sap in partly-seasoned timber. Takes Eight Hours to bring the Centre of a Sleeper6 or 7 in. thick to 212 deg. Fah Timber freshly cut. The author experimented during 1890, 1900, on various timbers in different stages of seasoning, and found that it required eight hours' steaming at 20-lbs. pressure to bring the centre of an 8 in. x 6 in. freshly-cut sleeper to ""boiling point,"" at which the sap would begin to evaporate. Four to Six Months' Seasoning. With sleepers seasoned four to six months, the author found that moie sap could be extracted by one to three hours' steaming at 20 lbs. pressure. Fully-seasoned Timber. With fully-seasoned timber, i.e., after six to twelve months' seasoning, the steaming in some cases increased the weight of the timber slightly, and in others diminished it (well within 2 per cent.). With fully-seasoned timber more antiseptic (chloride of zinc) could be injected, by commencing with the vacuum and dispensing with the previous steaming. Author's Practice. In the author's practice at his works, he (1) Refuses to treat fresh-cut timber, but puts it down to season. That is the condition in which our sleepers will be(2) Begins the spring's season's treatment by steaming, unless the timber is of the previous year's cutting. (3) Omits steaming in the summer and autumn, when the timber proves to be well seasoned. He proceeds to set out different processes, which I shall not detail, inasmuch as I have other information of a very valuable character that I .desire to place before the House. A Committeeof the American Society of Civil Engineers reported in regard to various processes which had been adopted, and, at page 346 of their report, the process adopted on the Houston and Texas Central Railway Company's line is described by Mr A. G. Howe as followsTwo cylinders, each 100 feet long, in whicb timber is treated, calculated to stand a pressure of 150 lbs. per square inch. A super-heater, vacuum and pressure pumps, with suitable steam power and pipe connexions and cisterns for conveying and holding the preservative. The process in brief is :Superheated Steam : 1 . Application of superheated steam. 2. Withdrawal of condensed steam and sap -that may have come from the wood That is important. The first step to be taken is to withdraw from the bath all the sap that may have come from the wood. The report proceeds to show that the next step taken isVacuum :-3 . Production of a vacuum by means of a vacuum pump, the temperature being maintained at the same time by dry heat from the steam-pipes. Pressure :-4 . Following with the preservative at a temperature of about 160 deg. Fah., and with such pressure as may be necessary to produce desired results. The report continuesTimber treated :-Our ties contain about 4 cubic feet of timber, and iwe use five gallons of the preservative to each tie. (Texas pine.) Green Timber : If the timber (Texas pine) is green, four hours' use of the steam, and four hours' use of preservative at a pressure of 100 lbs. per square inch may not accomplish the same result as thirty minutes' exposure to superheated 1 steam, and thirty minutes with the preservative under pressure, which are sumcient when the timber is quite dry. This report shows that it is comparatively easy to treat timber that has been properly seasoned as against timber which has just been, cut, and we have to recollect that the timber to be used on the construction of this line has not yet been touched, and that it will be put into use a few months after it has been felled. The statements made by various engineers go to prove that it is -recognised all over the world that it is absolutely necessary that the withdrawal of the sap should be the first step taken in preserving timber. I propose now to refer to a German experience, as detailed by Privy-Councillor Funk, of Cologne'German experience and practice :Soaking -The system of soaking the wood in a warm or cold antiseptic solution, or even boiling therein, has proved unsatisfactory, compared with impregnation, because the solution cannot permeate the wood thoroughly. Unless the sap is Withdrawn under a vacuum, and the preservative again then applied with a pressure of from 120 to -150 degrees, these systems are useless. The ""report continuesThe impregnation process is as follows :Time : Hours3 -1 . Steaming for one to three hours at a steam pressure from 45 to 60 lbs. per square inch for the extraction of the sap, assisted by running off the extracted sap and condensed steam at intervals of thirty minutes. 'Time : Hours3 -2 . The air in the tank is gradually exhausted during one to three hours, until a vacuum of 20 or 24 inches mercurial column has been obtained. This to insure a more complete extraction of the sap from the wood and more thorough penetration of the impregnating fluid. Time : Hours4 -3 . Admission of the impregnating fluid into the tank, and absorption by, and forcing into the wood at a pressure, of 105 to 150 lbs. per square inch for three or four hours. Total time : 10 hours 30 minutes. ""We are talking of treating 200,000 tons of wood, and this gentleman tells us that the -timber. It seems to me that this is an ill time required to impregnate our hardwood -considered scheme on the part of the Gotimbers must be nearly, if not quite, vernment, in view of the fact that we have double. .available plenty of timber that does not -require to be subjected to this expensive -process. I have already pointed out to the referred to a charge of 7s. gd. per 100 House that the Powellising Company in superficial feet for powellising timber in 'Sydney charges 7s. od. per 100 superficial Sydney? feet for powellising timber, and I fail to -see how they could do the work for less. 7s. 9d. per 100 superficial feet of timber Such a price, however, makes it practically 1 inch thick. Mr Mais goes on to state impossible to deal with timber in the quanthattities that we shall require for sleepers. I -come now to a statement by Mr Mais, saturated by any hitherto known process in less M.I.C.E., who was Engineer-in-Chief for than 12 hours, and jarrah or karri would take 'South Australia. He points out that all about 24 hours per batch of sleepers. previous examples referred to relate to soft That is a statement that ought to stagger wooda point that needs to be emphasized. the Minister. He explainsHe statesAll the foregoing examples have been soft woods, and the time occupied in artificially -.seasoning only applies to soft timber. Mr Hedges. Hardwood must take nearly, if not quite, double the time. The sap and mater from freshly-cut timber must be extracted before the preservative is injected. It is perfectly obvious that unless there is a place for it, a liquid solution cannot even be forced into the timber, and most failures in treating timber have been traced to the neglect of this most obvious requirement. In any event the treatment of timber cannot be hurried, or the result w i ll be unsatisfactory, if not disastrous. If the sleepers are spaced 2 f t . 6 in. centre to centre, 2,113 will be required per mile, and as it is proposed to lay two miles per day on the Transcontinental line, 4,226 sleepers will be required daily at each end. To avoid stoppages from delay, a five-cylinder plant at each end of the Transcontinental line would be the minimum necessity and capable of treating 1,000 sleepers daily each. Plant very Costly -This plant would be very costly, and would add a considerable amount to the cost of the sleepers. Tendency to Hurry Process and Waste Money. -The rapidity of construction would be so great, that the tendency would be to hurry the process, and the result would be a waste of money, as many of the sleepers would not be thoroughly impregnated. A thin coating would be useless, as dry rot must set in. Inspection to be thoroughly Reliable -It is absolutely necessary that the inspection of the preservative process should be thoroughly reliable and skilful as well as constant to insure any measure of success. Time Required to Saturate Completely Jarrah or Karri is Unknown -The time required for the complete impregnation of jarrah or karri sleepers is at present an entirely unknown quantity, and it may be assumed to take at least twice as long as soft 'wood. All the calculations that are put before the House have been based on the use of soft A soft wood sleeper 6 inches thick cannot be By"" soft wood "" is meant, pine, beech, spruce and other similar timber.

358,Mr Hedges,"Yes. That meansheaded, "" Boiling in a preservative abandoned in Germany -and Austria,"" and it readsBoiling timber in a preservative was tried some years ago, and was abandoned in Germany and Austria as being unsatisfactory with the timbers treated, namely, oak, fir, pine, and beech. What chance can there be of dealing with hardwood ?The application of the boiling process to timhas been blazed for them by others. No bers of the same density as karri and jarrah is purely experimental, and, as far as any records are available, there is no proof that complete saturation of these latter timbers for railway sleepers has been effected within a reasonable time, or under working conditions. This, is an opinion voluntarily given by an old warrior at. the game, and given with the object of keeping us on the right track. Whether his advice be accepted or rejected will rest with the Ministry, since they are in a majority; but I think he ought to be thanked for the information he has given us. I do not believe there is in Australia a body of business men who would not accept this, advice on the part of a gentleman who has so thorough a knowledge of the subject. I have more information in regard to., the preservation of timber than time will permit of my bringing before the House. All the authorities go to prove that, while sleepers in small quantities, can be treated for maintenance purposes, treatment has never been a success in connection, with construction works where large quantities are required to enable the construction of a line to be pushed ahead. Sufficient time cannot be given to the process to insure success. Commissioner of Railways in Western Australia states that it is doubtful whether sleepers on the Port Hedland line were properly treated. Then, again, a friend of mine, who was connected with the construction of that line told me that, if there was anything in the powellising system at alii he thought that the sleepersused in the first 20 miles of that railway were, perhaps, fairly well treated, but that the treatment of those used in the balance of that 100 miles of railway was a farce. If they proved satisfactory, having regard to the treatment to which they were subjected, he believed that they would have done just as well without it. They were plate-laying that line from only one end, and if the system adopted in that case was a farce, what sort of a farce shall we have in connection with the construction of this railway, where plate-laying is to proceed from both ends, and where timber 10 x 5 and 9 feet long, as against, timber 9 x 4 and 8 x 4 , and only about 6 f t . 6 in. long, is to be used. It seems to me that the construction of this line will be delayed as the result of this experiment undertaken at the instance of some one who does not know the ABC of railway work. If that were not so, the authorities would have followed the good old beaten track, which one can afford to leave that track. The experience of thirty or forty years of railway construction in Australia teaches us, not only the methods that should be followed, but what material is required for this work. No Department can afford to disregard that experience, and to set out upon a new track. It must be acknowledged that those who have pioneered this class of construction work know a little more about the subject than does any engineer wbo can be picked up in a haphazard way. No engineer who would be useful to the Commonwealth is looking for a billet at the present time. There are twenty billets offering for every man who has the knowledge necessary for the construction of this railway. Nothing can be too good for this work. I demanded in this House that 80-lb. rails should be used, and I am pleased that the Government have decided to accept my advice. Give us a good sleeper, and we shall have a line which Americans, Canadians, and Britishers alike will 1 admit is all that could be desired. But what sort of an advertisement will it The exbe for the Commonwealth if we use a good rail and a rotten sleeper? It is essentiar that this matter should be viewed seriously. Only to-day in the Argus the Minister isreported as having stated that he has let a contract to the Western Australian Government for the supply of 680,000 powellised karri sleepers at 5s. each, delivered' at Mangimup, Western Australia That means that we shall have to pay another 2s. 6d. freight uponeach of them. He is also represented as having said that he has let a contract for the supply of 100,000 jarrah sleepers at 4s. 6d. each, delivered 1 at Holyoake or Mangimup, and a furthercontract for the supply of 720,000 karri' sleepersat 7's. 9d._ each, delivered at Port Augusta, subject to a reduction of i d . per 100 superficial feet for. powellising.. Yet he concludes his statement by saying that the question of treatment has not yet been* definitely decided on. Argus statement. The honourable member regards that newspaper as his Bible. the Minister as having entered into a contract to pay only 4s. i d . each for jarrah sleepers, and 5s. each for karri sleepers, notwithstanding the fact that the latter will have to be carried 100 miles further than will the jarrah. Minister to prove that jarrah is not a better timber than is karri, or that any karri is obtainable as near to Kalgoorlie as is jarrah. As a matter of fact, the karri upon an average will have to be carried 100 miles further. Of course, if we have money to throw away that circumstance will not weigh with us. But I submit that the question of cost ought to be a consideration with us if we, wish to secure stability of construction at a reasonable outlay. Why, a saving of i d . per sleeper in the construction of this line would represent an enormous sum. We have been told, too, that the Government could not obtain jarrah because the supply of it is in the hands of a combine. YetI notice that they have been able to let contracts to persons who have no connection whatever with Millar Brothers. For instance, they have let contracts to Bunning Brothers, to the Nelson Cooperative Timber Association, to the Timber Corporation Limited, Perth, and to Lewis and Reid. These persons are not in the combine. The Government are able to enter into contracts with these people for the supply of jarrah sleepers at 4s. 4^d. each as against 5s. each in the case of karri. greater distance from Kalgoorlie than does any other timber. have applied recently for 70,000 acres of karri country. doned the karri country in the south of Western Australia fifteen years ago.

I have not attempted to make this question a party one. But I do appeal to honourable members opposite who are prepared to give the Commonwealth a fair deal to stick to the old beaten track, and not to indulge in this experiment. There is no better timber for railway purposes in Australia than is jarrah. It is I challenge the not necessary to treat it. NeedI remind honourable members that the sleepers in the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, which had not been powellised, and which had been down for twenty-five years, were in good condition when the Commonwealth took over that line from South Australia. of those sleepers have been replaced. line in the world twenty-five years old in which nearly all the sleepers have not been replaced. It would be marvellous if we could find a timber which we could guarantee would stand for twenty-five years. In many countries the average life of a sleeper, even when treated, is only fourteen years, but the average life of a jarrah sleeper, according to Mr Dartnall, ranges up to eighteen years. What better timber do we require? If we had nothing but pine, or inferior timber such as is to be found in other countries, we might-wish to preserve it, in order to make it last longer. But in all the States we have splendid timber. In Western Australia we have timber which is being shipped to all parts of the world. Yet it is to be discarded in favour of karri. As Mr Hastie has pointed out, it took sixty years to estabKarri grows at a lish the timber industry in Western Australia, owing to the set back which it received consequent upon the export of karri. The Leeuwin was the first place from which timber was exported from Western Australia. That is where the karri grows.

With all this evidence before us from scientific men, from eminent engineers, timber experts, and old residents of Western Australia, as to the durability Yet they demolished them, of jarrah, why should we indulge in this dangerous experiment? orable member's time has expired.

I refer to the case of the transferred postmasters of South Australia, and to the promise which was made to them prior to Federationa promise which has never been redeemed. The position occupied by these officials is a very simple one. When they were in the employ of the South Australian Government they were entitled to certain emoluments. They received, for example, commission on the sale of postage stamps, and a certain sum for transacting the Savings Bank business. To all intents and purposes these emoluments formed a part of their salaries. When the leading politicians of that State were inviting the electors to accept the draft Federal Constitution, they laid great emphasis on the fact that the existing and accruing rights of transferred officers would be preserved. But after Federation became an accomplished fact, this Parliament passed a Commonwealth Public Service Act. When that measure was introduced by the honourable member for Hume, he referred to the case of these officers, and new contract, and put an end to the old repeated the promise which had previously been given that their existing and accruing rights would be preserved. He made that statement in all good faith, and I do not blame him for having made it. But I do blame the Attorney-General of that Administration for not correcting the misapprehension under which he laboured, because he must have known that when the Public Service Act became law the position previously occupied by these officers would be abrogated. In other words, they would enter into a new contract. The House was misled by it being made to appear that the just claims Of the men have been met. A clause should have been passed protecting the rights of these transferred officers,and I take it that the Government of the day did not propose such a clause because they were not prepared to recognise their rights, and preferred to break faith' with them. When We were dealing with the Navigation BillI endeavoured to have a clause inserted to protect the rights of the South Australian pilots. The Government did not take my view of the matter, but when the measure becomes law there will be no misunderstanding, and the position of the men will be exactly defined. It is not for me to complain of what the Government did, beyond criticising their actions fairly. But matters of this kind should be put on a proper footing and definitely settled. Nothing rankles so much. as the feeling that one has been ""got at,"" and has suffered treatment that is not fair and above-board, which is the feeling of these transferred officers. There are not a great many of them, and their salaries should have been fixed specially by the Public Service Commissioner. He was not bound to do that, and did not do it, but Parliament should have passed a provision requiring him to do it. In the fixing of> their salaries it should have been recognised that they had been enjoying certain privileges which could not be allowed to future public servants, but the latter would know, when they entered the Service, the conditions to which they would be subjected. These men have Been continually agitating, and are not likely to cease from their agitation. They have been advised to go to the High Court, but Save not done so, because that body decided against a similar claim made by some Victorian transferred officers. The decision of the Court was that the Commonwealth Public Service Act created a one, and that, therefore, they had no case. These men have also been advised to go into the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. It will be generally admitted that that Court decides the cases brought before it in equity and according to good conscience. Buti t cannot deal with things that happened long before it was created. I have always advised the men not to go into the Arbitration Court, because to do so would be to waste their time, the Court not having jurisdiction in the matter. This Government are not responsible for the present position, and I do not admire the slick way in which these officers were dealt with by an earlier Government. I should not like to be responsible for what occurred. It may be urged that an exaggerated case has been put forward on behalf of the men. If that is so, it is so much the better for the Government. My contention is that the matter is one for settlement, not by law, but in accordance with equity. The honourable member for Boothby suggested the appointment of a Royal Conunission, but that would mean a profligate waste of money and great delay. The facts are in the possession of the Department, and all that is needed is an arbitrator or an umpire to hear both sides, that of the Government and that of the men, and to report his finding. When that has been done, if the Government, for reasons of State policy, decide not to meet what is an equitable claim, well -and-good. The men-have -a grievance, as even the man in the street will admit when he hears the facts. Why, then, should the Government shelter behind their legal position? It is not for Ministers to say, "" We are not responsible for what has been done. The matter could have been, and should have been, dealt with by our predecessors."" The High Commissioner once spoke of the House of Commons as the whispering gallery of the British Empire, meaning that there is no grievance which cannot be ventilated there. The same thing might be said of this House. There should be no one on the Australian continent who, having a substantial grievance, cannot get it heard here and obtain redress. I do not claim that these men should be given special consideration because they are public servants, but they have a substantial grievance, and the Government, waiving their legal rights, should settle the matter equitably. I hope an Australian Government will, be never so high and mighty as to feel that they would lower their dignity by abandoning their legal rights and acting equitably. Within the last forty or fifty years we have been getting more equity and less law, and I am certainly of opinion that that is an improvement, because there is not very much justice in law. There has been a steady growth in every part of the English-speaking world of the feeling that matters should be settled equitably rather than legally, and I ask the Government to settle this matter in that way. It might be that, if both sides were put before an arbitrator, the Government position would be shown to be much stronger than I imagine it. Certainly, the matter should not be left over' to be dealt with by a succeeding Parliament. Ih a few weeks we shall separate, and later the life of this Parliament will terminate. Whatever grievances our successors may have to discuss and settle, they should be grievances arising in their own time; not matters which we should have settled. sire to refer, as briefly as possible, to the I position the Government find themselves in *on the question of the material for the construction of the transcontinental railway; and it will require only very few words, I think, to show how utterly weak and indefensible that position is. The Minister of Home Affairs, in his attempt to justify the use of powellised karri, has endeavoured to show that jarrah, as a material for sleepers, is utterly unreliable and worthless. He has produced small samples of alleged jarrah, riddled with decay and white ants, and, after suspicion was thrown on the genuineness of those samples-whe n it was more than doubted that they were jarrah, and, in all probability, karri-he , apparently after a good deal of effort, has been able to discover a surveyor's peg of jarrah which also shows evidences of decay. He has put forward, also, certain alleged evidence by those who have used jarrah as railway sleepers and found it unsuitable. If the Minister has such strong objections to jarrah as liable to decay, and as utterly unsuitable for railway sleepers, how does it come to pass that he is proposing to use a considerable number of jarrah sleepers now, in the construction of this railway, and does not propose even to powellise them? If jarrah is such a defective material as he has tried to make out, it is quite indefensible for him to utilize it. But the fact is, that all those suggestions, and all the alleged evidence regarding the worthlessness of jarrah, amount to very little, and the Minister knows it ; and, therefore, he is using a timber that has been proved by the experience of many years to be the very best that can be found for the purpose. No one in Western Australia disputes the well known fact that, for any purpose requiring a permanent timber, jarrah is very much in request. If we go to architects and builders in that State, and ask them what material they put into the foundations of weatherboard houses, we are told that it is jarrah; and could any better proof be afforded ? When any one is building a weatherboard house, he desires to have the foundations absolutely secure, and does not use a wood that is liable to decay or attack by white ants; and so jarrah is almost invariably selected. In the south-west of the State, there is another timber known as jam wood that is preferred to jarrah; but it is not always procurable. Jarrah, when selected with ordinary care, and used for the foundations of weatherboard houses, is found to be entirely proof against internal decay or attack by white ants. Further, I have noticed that in the suburbs of Melbourne weatherboard houses are now being placed on jarrah stumps; and when I ask the reason why, I am told that it is found thoroughly lasting as a foundation. We have had a second edition of overwhelming evidence to-day from the honourable member for Fremantle as to the danger of the experiment that the Government",52,Paper By The Late Octave Chanute C E France
369,Mr Fowler (Perth) [5.30],"I depropose to make. I desire to repeat that karri, for certain purposes, is eminently suitable. The Minister of Home Affairs, a little while ago, triumphantly referred to a company as taking up a tract of karri land, but it is not at all unlikely that this company had the perfectly natural and honest object of utilizing the timber for purposes for which it has been found suitable. These purposes are many; but in every case it is admitted that karri is not a suitable timber for placing on the surface of the ground, where it is subject alternately to rain and sunshine, and, in Western Australia, to the certain attack of white ants. For superstructures of many kinds karri is very suitable; it has a greater tensile strength than jarrah, and, when properly seasoned, is very desirable for such purposes as the framing of railway carriages and waggons. I do not think, however, that any one acquainted with timber -will argue very seriously that it will last for any length of time, when laid on the surface of the ground. We have had some very interesting evidence in regard to the powellising of Australian timber. If honourable members will only take the trouble to look at the samples of powellised bluegum which have 'been put in the vestibule for their inspection, they will need to go no further, in order to make up their minds as to the detrimental effect which powellising has on the hardwoods of Australia. These timbers were selected by the expert of the Defence Department, after careful inspection, I presume, to be utilized in the construction of ammunition waggons, and possibly guncarriages. At any rate, it was intended to use this Australian timber for purposes for which it had been proved eminently suitable in its natural state, without any artificial process or preparation. The expert went to those who had the timber for sale, examined it carefully, and marked it as suitable. It was then sent to undergo the powellising process, and was returned to all appearances all right. who looks at that timber now will see that on the outside it is perfectly sound; but, as soon as it is sawn, the objectionable effect of the powellising process it passes the understanding of any one who is made apparent. The boiling process, with the sudden expansion and contraction, has rent and destroyed the internal fibres; and this is not the case only in a solitary piece, as the honourable member for Denison a little while ago tried to insinuate. the sort. member cares to go to Perry's woodyard ire Lonsdale-street he will see whole piles of this timber that has been condemned by the Defence expert after it came back from the powellising process, although he had originally passed, it as suitable. that timber knows nothing about sawing timber. That is what I said. ber did not say that. The Defence expert examined this timber in Perry's woodyard, and marked it as passed, but, as any honourable member may see for himself, the expert has, since the powellising, removed his mark. been sawn with a blunt saw. ber may go to the timber yard, and have the wood sawn in his presence; and I repeat that it is not only one piece that is affected, but the whole, of the timber that was powellised. It .passes my comprehension-o r rather, I should say it would pass my comprehension if I were not acquainted with all the circumstances of the casewhy the Government persist in the suicidal course of using a timber that is more than doubtful in regard to its. lasting qualities, and, in addition, putting it through a process which the Defence expert will say has the effect of destroying otherwise good wood. We have in jarrah an almost ideal timber for the purpose of railway sleepers > and, under ordinary circumstances, it would be difficult to understand the headlong obstinacy of the Government. The best timber in the world for railway sleeper purposes is deliberately set aside in favour of a timber which is regarded as anything but suitable, and, in addition, a process is adopted, which is alleged to preserve the timber, but which, in reality, Any one destroys it. Jarrah sleepers can be obtained at less cost than the karri sleepers powellised; in other words, the perfect sleeper is cheaper than the poor one; and looks into the question why the Government persist in their course. But I say, as one knowing the facts, that this powellising of karri sleepers would never have been undertaken if the Chinn appointment had not been made.",54,Paper By The Late Octave Chanute C E France

375,Mr Fowler,"The honourable member is now imputing a wrong motive, which he has no right to do. wrong motive to the Government, and I wish that to be understood. WhatI say is that Mr Chinn, before he was appointed, indicated his intention to utilize karri in connection with the construction of this railway; and he, and he alone, is responsible for the introduction of this matter to the Government. It behoves the Government, therefore, to look around and investigate all the evidence rather than be moved by one solitary individual. have no grievance to ventilate, but, as is not unusual in political life, some one has .a grievance against me. Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, a firm by whom I was at one time employed, and for whom I have a great regard, have written calling my attention to the fact that on the 25th OctoberI stated -and the statement is proved to .be absolutely correct from the lips of Mr Justice Higgins-that the Royal Dutch Steam-ship Company pay the highest wages to their white officers of any company that trades to Australia, or on the Australian coast. One statement objected to by Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company is contained in a letter which I read on that occasion, and it is as followsPractically speaking, wages amount to ^300 per month upon a steamer of a net register of 1,886 tons, which is much higher than what an English boat would pay. My friend, Mr Forsyth, of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, Limited, writes to bring mider my notice the fact that that company's vessel, the s.s. Matungawhich maintains the mail service between Australia and Papua under contract with the Commonwealth Government, is a vessel of 1,023 tons net register, and the amount of wages we pay monthly on this steamer is at present ^450. the ist January next, when wireless telegraphy is installed, by a further £1% 15s. per month, which will mean that the total monthly wages will then be ^468 15s. This is irrespective of further payment which the result of the Navif gures will show that our rate of wages is more than 50 per cent, in excess of those claimed to be paid on the Dutch steamer, and on a vessel of 763 tons less net register. I am delighted to be able to place that statement on record, and I propose to read a further statement by Mr Forsyth, showing the generous way in which this company treated a steward who, on returning from a voyage to the islands, was declared by the Port Health Officer to be ill , and was sent into hospital, and maintained there at the company's expense. Mr Forsyth writesTo give you an instance-w e signed on a steward for the voyage to one of the island groups, but on the ship's return five weeks later the man was challenged by the Port Health Officer and declared to be suffering from consumption. We immediately made provision for his accommodation at the Waterfall Institution, and paid for his maintenance there for a period of three months, and when he became sufficiently well to return to his people we paid his passage to England, and allowed him an amount of £50, the total amount expended on his account being ^rjq 7s. i d . Such treatment is in striking contrast to that meted out to men during my experience as a ship's officer. Unfortunate sailormen visiting our ports-whethe r they received is. a month, or £ 2 , or ^ 3 ios. a month-whe n they were taken before a magistrate had no hope of escape. They were bound, to be imprisoned and fined. On one occasion, whilst a vessel to which I was attached was at Fremantle, I went up to Perth, and purposely missed the train for the return journey, so that I should not have to give evidence against a man who was being proceeded against by the captain. When I did return, the captain, who was a good fellow, although his treatment in this case was cruel, said, "" Well, doctor, my lad, we got him in spite of you."" ""That may be,"" I said, ""but you did not get him on my evidence."" If a ship's captain desires to have a man imprisoned-if he considers he is fit only to go to prison-w e should make him return that seaman to the port at which he shipped. Honourable members can appreciate the pleasure I feel in comparing the treatment to which I have referred with that detailed by Mr Forsyth. The reference that I made to this matter on a This, however, will be increased after former occasion related only to English men and officers. I wish that the standard for captains and officers of the Dutch companies were adopted as the standard by the High Court. If it were, the wages paid would be much higher than they now are in ation Bill will entail. A comparison of these the case of many of the men who navigate, and the engineers who control the engines that propel in season and out of season the steamers that trade along our stormy coasts.

378,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.44],"Ipany, whether it belongs to a combine or not. It would be well if we had, in regard to all shipping companies, the full information placed at my disposal for the benefit of the House in reference to the Dutch Steam-ship Company. this may be the last opportunity we shall have to ventilate grievances, I desire to avail myself of it in order to bring two questions before the House. The first relates to the mail service between Tasmania and the mainland. After tenders for that service had been called, and before the time for closing them had arrived, a deputation consisting of the whole of the representatives of Tasmania in the Federal Parliament waited upon Senator Findley, then Acting Postmaster-General, and laid before him certain matters for his consideration. General granted an interview fo representatives of Tasmania, and those present at the interview, so far as I can ascertain, consisted solely of members of the Labour party. I do not attach any importance to that point, but I wish to allude to certain information given to the people of Tasmania by those honourable members as to the arrangement which they said had just been made between the Postrnaster-General and the shipping companies concerned. After they had given that information, I asked the Postmaster-Generali f he would lay on the table of the House the correspondence that had passed between his Department and the shipping companies concerned.. He promised to do so, but I am not to see that correspondence until the contract is actually signed. It is affirmed in the Tasmanian newspapers that the account of the interview with the Postmaster-General which was given to the press by Labour representatives of Tasmania was not a correct statement of what really took place. The Examiner of 8th inst. published an article in which. i.t stated that two or three bourne and Burnie all the year round. Duritems which are rather important from the point of view of the shipping companies Were not disclosed. According to a statement made by Senator Ready in the course of an interview with newspaper representatives, the Postmaster-General arranged with the Union Steam-ship Company and Messrs. Huddart, Parker, and Company for a two years' contract upon the basis of the previously-existing arrangement for the carriage of these mails. He went on to say that the companies had promised to put on another ship of the type of the Loongana by the year 1914 if they received an increased subsidy and were given a seven years' contract. There was to be, he said, a service of four trips a week from each end; two trips a week were to be made direct from Melbourne to Launceston, and two from Melbourne to Launceston via Burnie. It is asserted in the Tasmanian press that that statement by Senator Ready omits two rather important points In the first place, the Examiner complained, not in the article to which I have referred, but in a later issue, that the Postmaster General did not disclose the fact that if the subsidy of .£13,000 per annum were increased by £2,000, this extra service would be granted. It states that the additional subsidy would not have to be paid for a period of seven years-that it would have to be paid only for five years, Some time later the Postmastersince it would take the company two years to build and place in the service a vessel of the type of the Loongana. Another point which is not made clear is that during the busiest three months of the year-durin g the tourist season-the y were prepared to run an extra trip per week to Launceston, or, in other words, three trips direct from Melbourne to Launceston and two vid Burnie to Launceston. The Postmaster-General turned down those proposals because, he said, Tasmania would not fare so well under them as under the existing arrangement. I was inclined at first to agree with him, but I was not then aware of these two facts which, according to the Examiner, were not disclosed. I am not suggesting now what I consider the contract ought to be; I simply bring these facts before the House, because I think the Minister ought to be made aware of them. At present the Loongana makes three trips each way between Melbourne and Launceston during the summer months, and the Oonah makes two trips a week between Meling the winter three trips a week between Melbourne and Launceston are made by a combined service supplied by the Loongana and the Rotomahana. Under the scheme which, according to the Examiner, was put forward by the companies concerned, more trips per week would be run to Launceston than under the existing arrangement. There would be eight as against six sailings per fortnight from Launceston, whilst there would be the same number of trips to and from Burnie, save that in the latter case the service would be supplied by a ship of the Loongana type",56,Paper By The Late Octave Chanute C E France
379,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot) [5.51],"A sinstead of by the Oonah. The Postmaster General promised to let me see the correspondence, but I have not yet been afforded an opportunity to do so. The newspapers, apparently, have been able to get all the details, whereas I am told that I cannot obtain them until the contract has been signed. The basis of the contract was arranged some time ago. It seems to me that, although the new arrangement provides for two trips a week from Melbourne to Launceston vid Burnie, a rising Tasmanian port, Devonport, is going to be neglected under it. At present the Oonah runs from Melbourne to Burnie and thence to Devonport. It takes in cargo at Devonport overnight, and returns to Melbourne vid Burnie, If , under the new contract, a steamer is to similar potatoes were planted in New go from Melbourne to Burnie, and thence direct to Launceston without touching at Devonport at all, it should not be accepted without the fullest consideration. There is one other matter to which I desire to call the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs. consider whether he cannot see his way to reimburse a company which has suffered a serious financial loss in an attempt to benefit the producers of Tasmania. With; a view to combating the Irish blight, some time ago the River Don Trading Company sent to New Zealand for a variety of seed potatoes which were reputed to yield heavily, and to be blight-resistant. variety wasknown as the "" Gamekeeper."" The River Don Trading Company was so rushed with orders from the Tasmanian farmers that it could not possibly fulfil them. Accordingly the company arranged for a small consignment from New Zealand. Melbourne, where the laboratory tests disclosed traces of Irish blight, as a result of which the Quarantine Department held up the consignment. At this very time. I may add similar potatoes were being shipped to Sydney, where the consignees vvere permitted to pick them over, to destroy the bad tubers, and to sell the remainder for human consumption. privilege was, however, denied to the River Don Trading Company, which was ordered either to return the potatoes to New Zealand or to destroy them. spondence on the matter ensued, and the Quarantine Department then permitted the company to sell the potatoes to ocean-going steamers for stores. Had they been granted permission to sell them to InterState vessels for stores the tubers would Mr Atkinson. have commanded three times the price which they realized. Later consignmentsfrom New Zealand were allowed to be picked over, and the good potatoes sold for consumption in the Melbourne metropolitan area. Such a chance to obtain the top market price was denied the consignees in the present case. For endeavouring to fight the scourge of Irish blight, with a view to assisting the producers, and not of making a profit, this company lost something like £ 5 0 upon a consignment of approximately 100 bags of potatoes. Had these potatoes been allowed to enter Tasmania the farmers of that State would have been willing to.use them as seed. Moreover, it is certain that South Wales. I do not blame the Quarantine Department for the action which it took, because it is only right that in matters of this kind it should exercise the closest supervision. But in view of al? the circumstances I ask the Minister whether, on the ground of equity, he cannot I ask him to do something to reimburse this company which has suffered a serious loss. [6.8] I desire to say a few words upon a matter which vitally affects a number of persons in Victoria. I refer to the new regulation which has been formulated by the Postmaster-General in regard This £0 the late-fee charge upon letters posted at railway stations. In this State it has always been customary to allow those who live in the vicinity of a railway station the privilege of placing in a box-on the station, five minutes before tbe departure of the train, any letters intended for These potatoes were brought to transmission to Melbourne. But now the Postmaster-General, in a desire to establish a uniform practice throughout the States, has issued a regulation under which a great number of persons in Victoria will be deprived of this convenience. I am aware that owing to representations which have been made certain exemptions have been granted. But those exemptions This are of a limited character, and quite a number of individuals are labouring under a severe handicap as the result of the withdrawal of a convenience which they Some correhave hitherto enjoyed. I recognise that in order that the proper status of various country post-offices should be accurately determined, it is necessary that the mails should be made up at those offices I realize, too, that a number of rural offices have suffered considerably in status owing",57,Paper By The Late Octave Chanute C E France
380,Dr. Carty Salmon (Laanecoorie>,"to the practice which has heretofore prevailed in Victoria of allowing persons to post letters at railway stations. But I venture to say that the cases in which hardship has occurred are very few indeed. good enough to leave matters as they were. practice was limited to Victoria, otherwise I would have closed down upon it . Minister representing the Postmaster-General to make a note of my complaint. It would be very much better to extend the convenience to which I have referred to other States than to deprive a large number of people in Victoria of a privilege to which they have been accustomed. We have always been told that, under the Commonwealth, the privileges of the people would be extended, rather than curtailed. In the same way, the public servants of the States were assured-as the honourable member for Hindmarsh pointed out this afternoon-that if they were transtional opportunities for acquiring reliable ferred to the Commonwealth, their existing and accruing rights would be preserved to them. The general public are just as much entitled to have their privileges prethis Chamber, may well be asked to tell served to them as transferred public servants are to have their Tights preserved to them. To limit any of the conveniences which the public have enjoyed at the hands of the Postal Department is, in my opinion, a retrograde step. The Post Office carries out a very important work. It is the link between those who live in. distant parts of the Commonwealth and the residents of the great centres. Dwellers in the country have to forego many luxuries which are enjoyed by those who live in the great centres of population, and, consequently, they ought not to be deprived of a privilege which they highly prize. In Melbourne we have a postal pillar at almost every street corner. In this cityincluding the greater Melbourne radiuSa city which embraces an area of nearly 100 square miles, I do not think it is possible to go more than 200 yards from a postal pillar. so.

I would very much prefer to see the Postmaster-General initiating a progressive policy by extending to other States the convenience which has been so highly prized by the residents of Victoria. The ex-Postmaster-General was There is another matter about which I should like information. I wish to know the attitude that will be taken by the Minister of Defence in regard to proposals recently submitted by the Committee which dealt with the question of compulsory training. It would appear from the press reports that drastic changes have been suggested, and I think that sufficient time has elapsed to enable the Minister and those associated with him to be able to give us an idea of how these suggestions are to be received. I have always had the opinion that the members of the Defence Forces have had too little consideration paid to their opinions on matters of policy and administration. Men who have made a lifestudy of defence, and who have had excepinformation regarding it, ought to receive consideration. The Honorary Minister, who represents the Minister of Defence in us what 'view the Minister takes of the sweeping changes which have been suggested to him. I understand that one of the suggestions is that a coat or. tunic should be substituted for the shirt in the present uniform of the Senior Cadets. But a comparison of the cadets clothed in the shirt uniform with those clothed in the old uniform, as they marched in procession last Saturday, would have shown the enormous advantage of the former. It is a workmanlike and useful costume, allowing more freedom of action than the old uniform, and so cut that it would be easier than the old uniform to pass on from one lad to another. These and other matters will, I am sure, be carefully, but quickly, considered by the Minister, who, as well as the Honorary Minister, has a very intimate knowledge of the details of our training scheme. wish to again draw attention to the position of those in charge of semi-official post offices. Although the matter has been considered by the Department, I hope that it may be gone into afresh, with a view to persons who have performed excellent service over a number of years. Country representatives know that those in charge of",58,Paper By The Late Octave Chanute C E France

There are about 300 persons in charge of semi-official offices, most of them ladies, and many of them have given the best of their lives to the work of the Department. Some of them, I understand, have held their positions for fifteen or sixteen years, and they have been so long engaged at their work that they have become as efficient as any officer in the Service could be, but, at the same time, have made it difficult for themselves to get other employment. I know that it is not possible for the Minister to appoint these persons to the permanent Public Service, but I should like him to do something for them. Although their remuneration has been improved recently, it is still very low, and less than they should get. Minister) [6.24] I assure honourable members that each grievance that has been put before the House will be carefully considered by the Minister concerned, and will receive the attention characteristic of the members of this Government. We must congratulate ourselves upon the small number of grievances ventilated, and upon the absence of any complaint of an exceptional character. The honourable member for Laanecoorie partly supplied an answer to his request in referring to the sweeping alterations suggested by the different conferences of citizen officers. sweeping, they cannot be hurriedly dealt with, but must be given> earnest and serious consideration, and will be accepted or rejected according as they fit in with our scheme of defence, which is based on the recommendations of Lord Kitchener, one of the greatest soldiers of the Empire. However much we may desire to meet the wishes of officers who have done excellent service, their suggestions must be considered' in relation to the whole scheme. We recognise that our citizen soldiers form the backbone of our defence system. On them will fall, in time of trouble, the actual defence of the country. Their interests will, therefore, be studied in detail, and nothing will be done to interfere with their effectiveness. The honourable member for Illawarra dealt very vigorously with the case of Major Chaseling, with the full details of which he is possibly not acquainted. In giving effect to the recommendations of Supply [REPRESENTATIVES.] {Formal). Lord Kitchener, the abolition of the regimental staffs of the Garrison Artillery in New South Wales and Victoria was found necessary, and this abolished a position held by Major Chaseling. The redistribution of electorates has occasionally resulted in the abolition of a member's seat, an almost identical case. Major Chaseling at first recognised the position, and accepted a command which was somewhat junior to that which he originally held; but subsequently declined it again, and asked to be placed on the unattached list, his wishes being met, and the resignation taking effect from a given date. Time does not permit me to enter into a full explanation of the circumstances now, but the honourable member for Illawarra is at liberty to see the whole of the papers, and possibly I may have another opportunity to explain at greater length. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. Question resolved in the negative. (TRUSTS) BILL . torney-General) [8.0] I move That this B ill be now read a second time. This is a proposal to alter the Constitution by empowering the Parliament to make laws with respect to trusts, combinations, and monopolies. It is proposed to insert in section 51 the following paragraphBeing (xl.) Trusts, combinations, and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods, or the supply of services. This proposal to amend the Constitution should receive the assent of the House and the approval pf the people. It is a proposal to give this Parliament power to deal with the most notable and menacing factor of modern life. PerhapsI may be permitted to invite honourable members to consider the extent to which comparatively recent changes in the economic sphere have revolutionized production, and, in consequence, have revolutionized the conditions under which production and distribution must be carried on. From time immemorial-and at any rate, for over a century of what may be fairly termed modern history-competitio n was the prevailing law in the economic sphere. The consumer found himself in a world in which a number of traders, merchants, and manufacturers of onesort or -another -",59,Paper By The Late Octave Chanute C E France

389,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Atcompeted for his custom, and sought to press on him their various wares. His every want was supplied, so far as the conditions then were capable of supplying them, by the unrelated efforts of these competing units. There was no concerted effort to find out what the market required to regulate output or fix prices. There was waged, on the contrary, in every department of the economic world a fierce and relentless war of competition. From this -economic strife the consumer generally -reaped the. benefit of cheap goods, while the manufacturer, trader, or workman too often found his speedy way to financial ruin. Competition, which has many virtues, and which, in some of its operations, can never be eliminated from any sphere of human activity, has also many defects, and these are radical in their nature. Competition under a primitive system of production -was in keeping with its environment; but as developmentin the methods of production proceeded, it became less and less fitted to survive. We to-day, who are living half-way up the pyramid of modern -economic development, see round us a world in which competition is either dead or dying. The new conditions are permannent; it is not a flash in the pan or an evanescent deviation from the settled order of things that we see, but a new order, radically different from the old, the inevitable consequences of the factors that distinguish and dominate modern civilization. We live in an age of machinery; of centralized and co-ordinated effort-in an age when successful production carried out in any other than by up-to-date methods, by persons having possession of great volumes of capital, is impossible. On every hand we see the small manufacturer or trader brushed to one side. It is the -day of big men. In pre-historic times conditions existed in the physical world favorable to monstrous mammals and giant saurians which, in their turn, gave way to a more specialized and highlyorganized order of created beings-bu t in these later days we now see around us gigantic economic and highly specialized organisms, products of the changed environevidence here during the last few days to ment. And the economic world of today is controlled by them. I desire to emphasize in the strongest manner of which I am capable the revolution that this change has effected in the position of the consumer. consumer is the community; for every individual is embraced in the term. The con[»«] sumer in the days gone by was, as I have said, protected by the competition of rival traders for his custom; and, consequently, prices were kept down to a level that allowed only that margin of profit that was fair and reasonable for the manufacturer or trader. If the profit was more than was fair, competition reduced it ; if it was less than fair, the manufacturer or trader who tried to produce at an unremunerative price became bankrupt, and prices rose. The consumer, living in a state of society where economic competition prevails, in general gets things at a fair price. This was his position when our political economy was formulated by those very eminent, but, in many cases, totally impracticable men, who gave us our text-books in the dismal science. They conceived that the state of things which then existed was not only proper, but immutable ; and on that basis they formulated their political and economic theories. The doctrine of laissez faire was held by them sacred, and all attempts to impair it declared unscientific and dangerous. It is no exaggeration of terms to say that those doctrines are as little applicable and as useless to present conditions as would be the weapons of the phalanx or the legion directed against modern battle-ships. They have no relation to existing conditions. We are living now in a new world where the dominating factor is not competition, but co-operation; where the consumer is no longer protected by rival traders seeking his custom, but where everything he desires, and everything that he must have, is under the control of a comparative handful of persons who decide what the output shall be, how it shall be distributed, and at what price. That is the state of things in Australia, to-day. The doctrine of laissez faire-le t things alone-is no longer applicable. I do not deny that in countries like ours,, with enormous territories, varied and bounteous resources, the more or less primitive industrial conditions prevailing outside the cities permit competition to still exist to a certain extent. But we have had show to what extent competition has already disappeared and is being continuously eaten away. I have myself given instances of this that cover nearly the whole industrial field. I have done this, although The it is extremely difficult to obtain precise details in connection with the matter. Nothing is more natural than that this should be so. in which competition hardly exists, and where the consumer has no natural protection. Now, the Constitution under which we live was formulated to deal with a con dition of things in which competition ruled, and does not enable us to protect the consumer who lives under conditions where competition does not exist. It is not suited to the new condition of things. Yet the consumer must be protected. The question is, how? in the most positive way that the consumer will never again be protected by competition. For combination must necessarily thrust it aside. The odds against competition are too overwhelming for it to hope to succeed. economic production possessed by those who control great capital are obvious. Who to-day is able to sell the cheapest-the small man in a humble way, or the great combine or trust that controls, not only the inlets and outlets* of industry, but the products and the markets in which they are to be distributed, the sources from which are drawn the raw material, and the most up-to-date machinery for dealing with all these that the civilized world can supply? isolated trader; the individual who has nothing but his brains and a few pounds of capital cannot hope to compete in such circumstances. The world, then, to-day is a world in which competition, so far as the average consumer is concerned, and so far as the great proportion of the things he consumes is concerned, no longer exists. It is for that reason that we are asking for power to make such alterations in the Constitution as will enable us to deal with this new condition of affairs. This is a revolution that has been achieved in our time. No revolution that was ever consummated in the history of the world can compare in importance with this revolution that has gone on before our eyes during the last twenty-five years. The tendency before that time was plainly to be seen. But during the last quarter of a century, trusts, combines, and great aggregations of wealth have progressed at such a rate as to stagger mankind. I said in this House a night or two ago that the Steel Trust of America controlled a capital of £300,000,000. Conceive of a condition of things of which that is typical. And it is typical. It is true, perhaps, that that is the greatest trust in America, but its operaitr. Hughes. We are, then, in a world tions are not wider than are those of the Beef Trust, the Oil Trust, the Tobacco Trust, and many others. Provided the control is over the whole industry, what does T it matter whether the capital of the trust be £300,000,000, £50,000,000', £5,000,000? The consumer is equally at the mercy of any set of men whose interests are bound up in doing, not what is fair to him, but what is best for themselves. I make no charge against those who control I desire to point out again trusts and combines. I think they are as;, good as other men. All men situated a» they are would do as they do. Human-nature is singularly pliable. It adapts itself to its environment, and were we as they are, we should probably do as they do.. The advantages of They are as moral, as good, and as honest: as are other men; but their opportunities, for exploiting the consumer are too greats for human nature to resist. No despot yet ruled for any length of time and whose rule 1 was uniformly just and good. Power without responsibility will undermine the most; honourable, just, and perfect character. Here are men who are responsible to no power.. And what is their power? It covers andidirects the lives and destinies of all of us:. Here are bodies of men who determine theObviously not the conditions under which we shall all live.. They say to one set of men, "" You shall' work for me for 8fd. an hour."" "" You shall'work for me for 8fd. an hour, and do as T wish, or else, throughout the length and; breadth of America, you shall not be employed."" They say to another, ""You shall! pay £ 7 5s. 6d. for every ton of my rails, or' you shall not obtain any rails on this earth f. And there is no appeal. These are. facts. I shall not say that condi-' tions are so bad here; but they are bad enough. As I said in the House a-, day or two ago, there exist in Australia, monopolies whose control over the industry to which they relate is equal to 90 per cent, and 93 per cent, of the whole industry. They can say to the people, "" You shallor you shall not have this commodity; you shall pay this price or not have it,"" or "" We will or will not carry your freight."" Andi t is upon their fiat and their decision that our destiny hangs. This is not, and cannot be, denied. It is said, however, that this; state of things will right itself-that there are in existence factors, that will deal witb it, and that, anyhow, we ought not to complain. We have much less to complain of than has America; but I submit that that is not a sufficient reason why we should do nothing. The case of a man who has just: foeen run over by a tram, and whose leg has had to be amputated, is very bad; but at is certainly not as bad as that of a and has lost both legs. I take it, however, that it is a poor consolation to the .man who has lost one leg to be told, ""'' In the next bed, there is a man who has lost both legs."" Such a statement consoles .neither the one nor the other. A t the present juncture, action is possible. This counwould be a waste of time, and I do not 'try has not yet fallen so hopelessly into the .grip of the trusts that it may not shake -itself free. In America there is reason to 'believe that things have gone beyond that -stage. There the trusts control not only ,prices to the consumer and the wages of the worker; nor are they satisfied with ""limiting output and creating artificial scarcity. -over again that they have corrupted the institutions of government, legislature, press, and judiciary. It is they who legislate; they who declare what the law is in very many of the States -of the Union. Given a Plutocracy such as -exists in America, and how can Democracy stand upright and rear its head unashamed .and virile ? Democracy is a plant of tender -growth. It can be corrupted. It can be -.undermined. If it is to be other than a -sham, it must have power and opportunity to exercise that power over all persons. It is proposed to amend the Constitution to -give us power to deal with trusts and -combines. In this Parliament in 1910 the honourable member for Flinders supported a proposal to amend the Constitution as we de-sire. The honourable member for Wimmera followed him, whilst the honourable member for Angas, in a memorandum prepared iby him when Attorney-General, favoured an .amendment of the Constitution giving us power to make laws to deal with "" Trusts -and combines in restraint of trade in any , State or part of the Commonwealth."" It is therefore perfectly clear that the authori'.ties on the Opposition side of the House recognise that the present position is un-satisfactory, and that the Constitution, as it stands, will not enable us to deal with ""it. who must be regarded as the best consti-tutional authority on that side of the House, has declared himself entirely in -favour of the amendment which we are .putting before the Chamber this evening. ""The honourable member for Angas, whose reputation as a lawyer, and! as a fair and broad-minded man, stands very high, has declared in unequivocal terms that we must man who has been run over have an amendment of the Constitution to enable us to make laws with respect to trusts and combines in any State or part, of the Commonwealth. Yet there are some honourable members of the Opposition who, in the face of these opinions, declare that we are amply clothed with authority. It propose to trespass upon honourable members' patience, to say one word more in reply to such statements. It is sufficient that the law dealing with Trusts and Combines has proved to be futile. And we can do nothing to amend it . It is admitted that an amendment of the It has been proved oyer and Constitution ought to be made. The whole question is to what length that amendment ought to go. In my opinion, it ought to go to the extent of enabling us to deal with trusts and combines, whether they have relation to trade and commerce, manufacture or service. The honourable member for Angas' proposed amendment does not go far enough. It would leave the most powerful Trusts outside the law. It is very small satisfaction to the people of a free country to know that, because a combine does not restrain trade or commerce, but controls the manufacture of say, sugar, iron, bricks, harvester machinery-we cannot deal with it . Yet under the proposed amendment of the honourable member for Angas, that would be our position. We should have power only in relation to trade and commerce. It is perfectly clear, then, that whatever power we have in this relation must extend to trusts and combines whenever we find them, and regardless of the part of the industrial field in which they may be engaged. If they control, anything of importance to the people, we ought to be able to deal with them. I hope I make myself perfectly clear when I say that this party does not take up the position that all combines are bad. I have been misrepresented so often that I am becoming case-hardened ; but 1 may be permitted to state my creed once more. I believe in co-operation. I believe An honourable and learned member, that both in its principles and its results it is so obviously superior to competition that sensible, civilized men can scarcely hesitate as to which tbey will accept. Combination is very much better for the people than cut-throat competition provided that it exists for the benefit of the people, and not for the benefit of the few who control the combination. But we want power to deal with all combines. When the Anti-Trust Bill was before this House, and an honourable member moved to insert the word "" destructive "" before the words "" combines or trusts,"" so as to make that legislation apply only to "" destructive trusts,"" I said that we ought to have power to deal with all trusts, just as we have power to deal with all men. A man for twenty years may lead an upright and honourable life, but if he then commits a crime, is the law not to apply to him? It certainly is to apply. It is to apply to him, not when he is good, but when he is bad. through life, and the hand of a policeman never rests obtrusively upon us. If we do wrong, however, why should it not do so? With trusts it should be the same. We ought to have control over all trusts, but not because trusts are in themselves bad. Combination, I say, once more, in the most emphatic way, is a law of modern civilization. It is here to stay. machinery; if it be used for the benefit of the people, it is good; if it be used to the detriment of the people, it is bad. I spoke of machinery; let me draw from it an illustration. Under the Factories Act, a machine cannot be worked except under certain conditions. The parts likely to injure a workman must be guarded. steps in. and says to an employer, "" You shall not work a man more than seven, eight, or ten hours per day, as the case may be,"" and the question is not "" Ought the Factory system to be suppressed because there are some insanitary and badly equipped factories, or all machines destroyed because some are carelessly exposed or used to the detriment of the community,"" but "" How is it used?"" If badly, then the law must intervene, but not otherwise. I may be asked to what particular purpose we propose to put this power. I have here an article in the North American Review for December, 1911, by that distinguished benefactor of mankind, Mr Andrew Carnegie. He speaks as a man who is clothed with authority. If there is anything about a trust that Mr Carnegie does not know, I am sure that undisciplined stomachs like ours could not digest it. Mr Carnegie gives the world the benefit of his experience of trusts, and with his conclusions in the main I entirely agree. In regard to Mr Hughes. them he lays down several propositions. He saysWe assume the following as indisputable :First -The cheapest mode of production of articles in general use is best for the nationas a whole. Second -Enormous works and immense aggregations of capital are indispensable, since production must be conducted upon a large scale; the larger the product the more economical, the less the general expenses and many other itemsvf cost. Third -Granted combination, there must be regulation, and as no judge the world over isallowed to sit in judgment in a case in which he is personally interested, so no producer canbe judge of prices. Fourth -It follows that an industrial CourtMost of us go must be formed which shall fix maximum prices, that the consumer may be protected against extortion. Those are the opinions of Mr Andrew Carnegie, who goes to the length of declaringwhat he conceives to be the position. Assuming that, co-operation is the law of the economic world, he lays down certain principles which ought to be applied to theI t is like changed conditions. He says that it is. wrong in principle for the man who controls an industry to say what the price of the commodity which he produces should? be. He affirms that an industrial Court should determine prices, so that the consumer may get justice. Judge Gary, Chairman of the Steel Corporation, supportshim. On page 918 of the same magazineThe law he says"" I believe we must come to enforced publicity and governmental control."" In answer toCommitteeman Young's question, "" You meangovernmental control of prices?"" Mr Gary replied, "" I do; even as to prices. . . . "" Asked by Committeeman Littleton, "" Is it your position that co-operation is found to take theplace of competition?"" Mr GaTy answered,. "" It is my position."" And to Mr Littleton'squery, "" And that co-operation therefore requiresstrict governmental supervision?"" Judge Gary responded, "" That is a very good statement of the case. I believe that thoroughly."" These are the statements of the case by twomen who, in different ways, have been or are connected in the most intimate waywitb the greatest corporation in the world. They say that it is coming to governmentalcontrol, that it is a wrong principle for a combine to fix its own price. 1 wish to thoroughly impress upon the House and* the country that this idea, which isrev.olutionary in appearance, is so only because the whole condition of things under which the citizens of this country grew upand acquired their ideas on economic subjects has fundamentally changed. Theref is no competition now. The combine has the consumer absolutely at his mercy. If he says, "" The price of coal is 24s. per ton,"" it is 24s. per ton, and there is an end of the matter. It is idle to go to the next shop, because there exists that honourable understanding which conduces to such delightful uniformity of prices, and has many things to recommend it, although it does not appeal to the average citizen at all. It is proposed that we should have sufficient power to regulate and control combines-that we should have power to fix prices. Not this Parliament, but some tribunal appointed by it. reading a highly interesting dissertation upon my economic heresy in stating that the natural corollary to fixing wages _ in a country like this is to fix prices. I have quoted some excellent authorities in support of my heresy. In my opinion, it is a perfectly good idea. If it is permissible for a legal tribunal to fix wages, why is it not permisible for it to fix prices ? If one is an economic heresy, so is the other. As to whether both are economic heresies we do not need to inquire, because this country is committed to one irrevocably. We say to the workman, "" You must go to a tribunal which will declare your wage, but when you are utilizing that wage to purchase commodities, then the price of those commodities shall be fixed, not by a legal tribunal, but by persons whose interests are entirely diverse from yours, and chiefly relate to high dividends and to heaping up still higher mountains of accumulated profits."" It may be that high prices have been caused through many other things than trusts. I have no doubt that the increase in the supply of gold has exerted some influence upon prices. It is said that it is wholly responsible for high prices. I do not believe that for a moment, but I admit that its influence has been considerable. I think, too, that the influence of trusts and combines has been very considerable. But even if trusts and combines have not raised the price of any solitary commodity by a fractional part of a farthing, the necessity for this amendment of the Constitution would not be one whit the less, because they would still control prices, and could, when they pleased, raise them. be bodies in this country over which the people have no control-bodie s which determine how much shall be produced, how much shall be distributed, and how much shall be paid for various commodities. I want, in relation to this question of the causes of high prices, to quote from an authority of high standing. Mr J... A. Hobson, an economist of great reputation, and one who has made this branch ofi economics a particular study, in the Contemporary Review for October of the present year, declares that the influence of thegold supply has been very much exaggerated. He continuesThe aggregate of "" money"" thus expended in this country alone would amount to a good many thousands of millions, and when we consider how vast -would be the sum for the whole inI remember dustrial world, we can recognise how trifling: an .addition the £50,000,000 of gold would maketo it. It would raise general prices by somesmall fraction of 1 per cent., that is all. That is the settled and deliberate opinionof one of the leading modern economists-.; Upon page 491 of the same publication hesaysThe rapid rise of trusts, cartels, conferences,, pools, and other forms of trade combination OP agreement belongs clearly to the epoch of rising prices and must be considered contributory to it. For though the business men -who form these combinations are motived partly by economics in business methods which may assist and not retard production, the main object at which they aim is the maintenance of high> prices by means of a control of output. The normal result of the formation of combinesis to restrict the rate of production, makingit lower than it_ would have been under an eraof free competition. We have in this country, in which trustsand combines operate largely, a ProtectiveTariff. These two circumstances must beconsidered in conjunction. In a country where there is no Protection, the internal 1 combines are faced with outside competition. There is, therefore, on the face of it, less opportunity for trusts and combines in a Free Trade country than in a Protected country. I do not regard that as a factor which affects this question very materially. But on the face of it I think it is obvious that in this country the combines inside are protected from thecombines outside. Now, it is an axiom in> the conduct of combines, that they sell the commodities which they produce dearest in the home market and cheapest in the foreignmarket. In Germany they are forbiddenby law to do that. But it is, nevertheless, the practice all over the world. The Steel' There would still Trust does it. It charges the Americanmore for his rails than it charges anybody else. It is the glorious privilege of the American to pay more for what he gets than is paid by any other man on God's ... .. J -earth. In this country, protection is extended to the combine inside. Where does the consumer come in? Apparently, he -comes in only to fill the humble but neces.sary office of paying up and endeavouring ^o look as pleasant as possible. I take it ""that that is not the end for which we were sent on this earth at all. And this Parliagreat industrial corporations is comparatively ment and this party are here to see that -everybody gets a perfectly square deal. We are not here to crush the merchant, the trader, or the manufacturer, whether he be part of a combine or not. We are here to .give everybody a fair and equal opportunity. At present this is denied to -every trader not in the combine. In -order to do what we want, our powers must be extended in several directions. First: We must have power to secure publicity. I lay special emphasis on that. Then we .must have power to regulate, to control -combines. And lastly, to nationalize them. ""The power to nationalize must naturally be used sparingly, because the resources of the Governmenit are not limitless, yet is is a power that all Governments ought to possess, and that nearly all Governments, except this, do possess. Its exercise is recom-.mended and favoured ini Germany to-day. At page 205 of W. H . Dawson's Evolution -of Modern Germany, it is stated "" that the nationalization of coal mines is advocated by leading economists like Wagner and Schmoller, and all parties but one in the Diet would favour the immediate adoprtion of suoh a measure."" The Labour party is pledged to the nationalization of monopolies, that and no more. The word "" monopoly "" has no mysterious ancT esoteric meaning, but monopolies are protean in shape, and therefore baffle definition, ithough we all know one when we see it or feel its effects. Technically the only monothat 10 per cent, dividends must be paid ? poly is that of the patentee, but actually there are many monopolies, and we ought -to have power to nationalize those we cannot otherwise control.

A condition precedent to all effective legislation is precise knowledge relating tto the subject-matter of the proposed legisMr Hughes. lation. James E. Garfield, ex-Secretary of the Interior, says on page 144 of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social ScienceThe basis of proposed legislation should be publicity. With publicity as the basis, constructive legislation for the supervision, regulation, and control by the Federal Government of the simple. We must then have power to inquire, to regulate, and to control. The proposed amendment will give us this power. It will enable us to give effect to the greater part of that policv of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to which the honourable member for Parramatta has lent his approval, ""the New Protection policy."" We shall have that elysian state of things whose portrayal threw this House into a very frenzy of delightful expectation. We shall have the means to regulate prices, and the consumer will not be forgotten as at present he is. We shall then indeed have the many and great benefits which the leader of the Opposition said would flow from the new Protection. And not before we want them. For although the regulation of wages by legal tribunals has resulted, in the vast majority of cases, in substantial increases to the remuneration of workmen, it has been largely thwarted by corresponding but unnecessarily disproportionate increases of prices. When wages are increased in any industry, those who control that industry are accustomed to increase the prices of their commodities much more than is sufficient to merely recoup the extra expense. They act upon the principle that whoever suffers they must be exempt. Profits are with them sacred. But profits are not sacrosanct. Why should it be regarded as a fiat of the Almighty One great corporation, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, regards it as a mathematical axiom that cannot be departed from. It tells us thatAny advance in wages arising from natural causes we will bear, but the loss that may ensue through attempts to interfere with the operation of the laws of nature must be chargeable against the increased price that results from the changes in the Excise duty, because the margin of profit now left to us will not stand any reduction. which never falls below 10 per cent., while the accumulated profits of the company amounting to £3,675,000. Yet to reduce those profits by 1 per cent, would be an impious interference with the Divine law 1 I wish the House and the country to know what this great corporation regards as the rates of wages fixed by natural causes. Sugar Refining mills have to face the competition of the. Millaquin and Central mills as well as of some smaller mills. These mills pay 30s. a week with keep, but the Colonial Sugar Refining mills pay only 27s. 6d. a week with keep, and a bonus of 2s. 6d. to those who remain during the whole season. Wales there is no competition, and the rate paid at the Colonial Sugar Refining mills at Harwood Island, Broadmeadow, and Condong, to adult unskilled workers, for such heavy labour as the stacking of cane, is 20s. a week and keep, with a bonus of 2S. 6d. a week to those who remain during the season. 5 per cent., or is. i d . a week, extra is given. given before the Royal Commission in answer to questions 16394, 16405, 16595, : and 17338. . If we interfere with the natural laws responsible for those wages, the cane-growers are not to get the benefit of any increase in Excise, or any other benefit that Parliament may grant, because the profits of the company cannot be reduced! This is not a singular case; there are others. But after all only a handful of men are employed on the northern rivers, while every person in the community is a consumer of sugar. We .all enjoy the benefits arising from the admirable and systematic control of this industry. We all have to contribute to keep up the dividends of this great monopoly. We wish to put an end to the impotence of this Parliament, so that it may be able to legislate for the people. We wish this Parliament to be able to exercise rationally and effectively the functions for which it was deliberately created. protect itself, and the Parliaments of the States cannot protect it. If it be said that they can protect the people, I ask why do they not do so ? The honourable member for Flinders has jpointed out that they cannot do it . The State Legislatures of America cannot protect their people, not for the want of trying, their statute-books being swollen with Acts resulting from their efforts to grapple with the question. the nature of things this task cannot be achieved by any but a central authority 1 controlling the whole domain of trade, commerce and manufacture. In Queensland the Colonial Nothing less than what we ask for will suffice. The honourable member forAngas recommends the amendment of the Constitution to give us power to deal with trusts and combines in restraint of trade in any State or part, of the Commonwealth. That recommendation has two cardinal defects. In the' firstI n New South place, it contains words of limitation, and'' the amendment if made would enable Parliament to deal only with trusts and' combines in restraint of trade. One Court might take one view and another Court: quite another of what constitutes restraint: of trade. We desire power to deal, not. merely with,trusts and combines that reA t Condong strain trade, but with all trusts and combines. We do not wish to suppress therm? any more than we wish to suppress tradeso. in general, but we wish to have power tocontrol them, not only if they restrain-, T h a t is the evidence trade, but also if they oppress the people, charge extortionate prices, or sweat theirworkmen. In the second place, his amendment falls short, because it does -not relate to manufacture or the supplyof service. The great combines of the day are not confined to trade and commerce. It was laid down in E . C. Knight v. United States that the trade and? commerce power does not extend to-manufacture. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo yesterday declared most positively that this Parliament haspower to deal with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. If he meant that we have power to deal with their operationsso far as Inter-State trade and commerceare affected, I agree with him, but it is primarily a manufacturing company, and.' its Inter-State commerce is but a fractional and negligible part of its operations. The power of the company to charge what prices it likes for sugar does not arise out: -of its Inter-State trade and commerce The public cannot operations, but from its position as a manufacturer of raw and refined sugar. Therefore, we must have power to deal with trusts-, and combines in relation to manufacture, and also in relation to services. With the experience of the past decade, are we deliberately going to fool the people once more-to ask them for power which stops short of enabling us to do the very thingwe declare should be done ?

The Federation was formed for may make mistakes. In face of the fact that there are combinations in relation to manufacture in this country; that, possibly, the most dominant of all combines is in relareason I ask the House and the country to tion to manufacture, the honourable member does not propose to alter the law so as tto deal with such combines. His amendiment must fail for that reason. There is just one more phase of the -matter on which I desire to touch. It is -said that the cause of high prices and all -the trouble in this country is the high wages ruling amongst the workers through Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts-that when prices go up, the Labour party is to blame. I shall not attempt to deal with that as if it were a rational and rea-soned declaration, but shall content my-self by pointing out that in every country -in the world the phenomenon of high prices -is to be found; and that it manifests itself with, the greatest intensity in the United 'States of America, where there are no Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts. But -the trusts and combines in that country are beyond anything on earth. God ""knows, no one can say that wages are 'high in the United States, when a man works twelve hours a day for ""8f d. an hour in the employ of the greatest corporation in the civilized world. And it cannot be said that the ""Commonwealth is caUed upon to pay £ 7 5s. 6d. a' ton-muc h more than a fair price for rails-becaus e of the high wages paid to the men who make the rails. High prices result from many causes; and, -in my opinion, there is no more dominant cause than trusts or combines. To what -extent those trusts or combines manipulate prices we are unable to determine in any -particular case except by inquiry; and effecing with such a state of affairs except by tive inquiry we cannot make. We do know, however, that there is nothing to stop these the community for the welfare of all of -organizations manipulating prices as they like, excepting those natural and fixed 'limits beyond which human nature is unable 'to endure. Like the lawyer who, -when he was called before the Bar 'for the unpardonable sin of taking a small fee, pleaded in extenuation that he had ""taken all his client had, those trusts and combines do not charge any more than -they think people will pay, but they do not stop short of that point. This amendment 'is necessary, and does not go further than is necessary. It gives Parliament power to do that which ought to be done. This Parliament alone can exercise such a the protection of the people, who cannot now be protected through-any agencies of government, State or Federal, and for that assent to this proposal. adjourned. (NATIONALIZATION OF ney-General) [9.5] I move That this B ill be now read a second time. I propose to detain the House only a few minute's. This proposal, substantially, was before Parliament in 1910. An alteration has been made in proposed sub-clause 2 providing that the clause shall not apply to any industry or business conducted or carried on by the Government of a State or any public authority constituted under a State. This limits the power of this Parliament to any industry, or business of producing, manufacturing, or supplying any specified services, which both Houses, by an absolute majority, may declare' to be the subject of a monopoly. There is nothing that I can add in this connection to that which I have already laid before the House. The Labour party has favoured nationalization of monopolies, and advocated it before the electors ever since they came into public life. When a state of things exists in which there is no competition, and in which the welfare of the public is at the mercy of a great corporation, it may be that there is no method of dealnationalization, and the taking over by that which was controlled by a private corporation for the benefit of a few. I have already quoted authorities to show that nationalization is favoured in Germany, and is receiving support in various quarters in other civilized countries. The tendency of the age is to resort to governmental or public control of various utilities and industries. At the present time in Victoria a proposal to nationalize the Melbourne cable tramways receives considerable support; the tramway services in the suburbs",67,Second Reading

Nationalization of monopolies is not a general, but a specific power which, under the proposed new section, is to be exercised in certain definite ways. industry must be taken over and paid for on just terms, and may then be carried on by the Government, or dealt with in any way the Government pleases. There is nothing in this proposal which ought to excite alarm or opposition in the mind of any person, whether he be a supporter of the Labour party or not. There is no hint of expropriation; it is simply a business like proposal to take over and conduct, as a Government monopoly, that which already exists as a private monopoly. adjourned. (RAILWAY DISPUTES) BILL . ney-General) [9.14] I move That this Bill be now read a second time member for Illawarra was another who This is a Bill to amend the Constitution to enable the Parliament to make laws concerning conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes in relation to employment in the railway services of the States. It is to be noticed that this proposal differs very materially from that which was before the Housei n 1910. Under the proposal of 1910 it was sought to give this Parliament power to make laws in regard to labour and employment, including labour and employment and the prevention and settlement of disputes on railways the property of a State. to the creation of Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration for the prevention and settlement of disputes in the railway service of a State, and is in harmony with that provision inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904. It will be remembered that in 1904 the honourable [212] member for Ballarat, who was leading the Government, resigned office rather than agree to an amendment to include railway servants within the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill . Inter-State disputes. however, was given to that amendment by the honourable and learned member who then represented East Sydney. It became part and parcel of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and did very well for The some tinie, but its subsequent career -was rather chequered, and it finally was declared ultra vires by the High Court. I hope, however, that although it fared .so badly, those honourable members who in its hour of travail in this House were its stalwart friends will not now desert it . Lest either they should have forgotten this, one of their very many good deeds, or the country should lack matter to inscribe on tablets of brass to be erected in this building, when all who are here have gone. I shall read the names of tbese gentlemen to the House. I find that the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Perth voted for this amendment, as well as a number of others who have ceased to be members of this Parliament. That, in itself, is a very sinister circumstance. I hope that this will not be regarded in the light of an obituary notice, but it certainly has that appearance to me. The honourable voted for the amendment. All the other honourable members-and there were many -wh o were colleagues and friends of those honourable gentlemen, for some reason or other, are unable to be present in the House this evening. Death is not responsible for the absence of any but one; there must be some other reason for their absence. The fact remains that the whole of that section of the party now represented in this Chamber by the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Illawarra voted with great earnestness, and even enthusiasm, for this proposal. It The present proposal is limited is said that it was then a comparatively innocuous proposition in that it extended only to Inter-State disputes. If I am to understand that that is the only objection to it , I think it fair to give the House an opportunity to consider the position.

397,Mr Hughes,"Quite so. Effect,to enable us to agree, such, a little thing as that ought not to keep us apart. I suggest, therefore, with all deference to the honourable member for Parramatta, who finds himself now in the greatest possible difficulty, since he has no one save the honourable member for Illawarra to consult in regard to his past efforts, that he should agree to this proposal. The rest of his party who voted with him on the occasion to which I have referred are gone, and those with whom he is surrounded now were, on that occasion, his opponents. I ask the House to accept this Bill for the reason that, as the honourable, member for Ballarat has told us very many times, we in this Parliament are charged with the duty of endeavouring to promote in every possible way industrial peace in Australia. One of the most effective ways of doing that is to secure power to deal with disputes in the railway service of a Statei f unhappily there should arise on any occasion such a dispute as might involve the whole Commonwealth in its meshes. The industrial power of the Commonwealth ought to extend to all industrial disputes wherever they arise; it was the settled and deliberately expressed wish of this Parliament, in 1904-5-6, that it should be so extended. that the High Court has decided that we had not the constitutional power to deal with the matter should surely not be a bar to our asking for that power."" We put this proposal before the House, and ask honourable members to assent to.it. a strictly limited power. authority over State railways, but merely power to create Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration in which all great industrial disputes may be heard and settled. I shall not detain honourable members any longer in dealing with this matter. I have set forth miy views on this and the measure with which I have last dealt at considerable length in connection with the other Bills. I only trust that in my exposition of them they have not suffered. I ask the House to come to the consideration of these proposals with the assurance that it is my clear conviction that they are absolutely necessary to meet the existing situation. sense of the word do they impair the spirit of our Federal Constitution, nor do they violate the terms of the compact. And they are imperatively necessary to enable this Parliament to do that for which it was created. Debate (on motion by Mr W. H . BEER EXCISE BILL. and Customs) [9.26] I move That this B ill be now read a second time. When the original Bill was introduced in this House, in 1901, by the late Mr C. C. Kingston, it was agreed that the practice which had operated in the various States prior to Federation in relation to the making of a certain allowance on the contents of vessels containing beer, when charging Excise, should continue to operate in connection with it. At that time, the up-todate methods of brewing which exist to-day were not in operation. There was no filtering or chilling of beer, such as is now carried on in up-to-date breweries. In the circumstances, therefore, although a hogshead could contain from 50 to 54 gallons of beer-in the majority of cases they actually contain 54 gallons-it was the custom to require duty to be paid upon only 50 gallons. That has been the practice since the passing of % the Beer Excise Act of 1901. As the result of exhaustive inquiries which I The mere fact have caused to be made in all the States, 1 find, however, that there is no necessity to continue the practice of making an allowance of 4 gallons in the case of hogsheads, 3 gallons in the case of barrels, and 2 gallons in the case of half-hogsheads. It is So far as kilderkins are concerned, it is It gives us no not proposed to depart from the existing practice. It was held, when the original Act was passed, that hotel keepers and others who dispensed this beverage could not draw off more than 50 gallons of beer from a hogshead, although it might contain up to 54 gallons. As the result of the improved brewing conditions that exist to-day, they can do so, and consequently the Commonwealth is losing revenue to the extent of between £25,000 and £30,000 a year. of beer? In no ment of an additional 6d. by way of duty on a hogshead of beer, which is sold today by the breweries at £ 2 15s. 6d. In some cases, the price is a little higher, and in others a little less. I do not think the passing of this Bill will affect the price of beer. It is not introduced with the object of increasing the tax. Our aim is",69,Second Reading
