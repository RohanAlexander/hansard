That the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 should be so amended as to admit of the regulation of the admission of the Japanese people to Australia being made the subject of diplomatic negotiation and mutual arrangement, subject to any proposed treaty being submitted to the approval of Parliament, or so as to atlmit of the Japanese language being .included with those of European nations as the basis of an educational test of the rights of immigrants : thus to remove from the Japanese people the implied stigma, of which they have complained, of being grouped with other Asiatic races as "" prohibited immigrants."" Whatever other honourable members may think with regard to the motion, I consider it one of the gravest importance,, because it will afford this House an opportunity to recede from the step which it took in 1901 in regard to the Japanese nationa step which I then regarded, and still, regard, as a diplomatic mistake of the first order. It is a singular fact that, although this notice of motion has been on the business paper for nearly twelve months, I am afforded the first opportunity to bring it forward, upon the very day on which there appears in the daily press a detailed statement of the second alliance entered into between the mother country and Japan. I do not hesitate to say that that alliance is one of the most intimate diplomatic alliances that the mother country has made in modern times. It is in the nature of a diplomatic marriage, because each nation has paid the other the compliment of agreeing to afford mutual assistance, for better or for worse, in the event of war during the next ten years. One cannot read the second clause of that treaty without feeling 1 hat the mother country, of which we always acknowledge the greatness, and of which' we all feel proud, has paid the Japanese nation the most profound compliment. In order to show the far-reaching effects of this agreement, I would point out that it is provided in article 2 that if by reason of unprovoked attack or aggressive action, wherever arising, on the part of any other power or powers, either of the contracting parties should be involved in war for the defence of the territorial rights or interests mentioned in the preamble of the treaty, the other power shall immediately come to the assistance of her ally, conduct the war in common, and make peace in mutual agreement with her. This intimate alliance and diplomatic marriage has been effected with a nation in whose face we have slammed the door; and it seems to me that the motion affords us an admirable opportunity for reconsidering the step which' we took in 1901, though we can Mr Bruce Smith. hardly take that course to-day with the same grace that would have characterized similar action on our part in that year. The motion has, I fear, not been understood by more than a small number of honourable members. I have gleaned from conversations which I have had with many members that they were under the impression that I was seeking to induce tlie 'House to alter the law in such a way as to permit of the introduction of Japanese into this country without reasonable limit. I wish honourable members to understand that I am attempting nothing of the kind-no t that my view of the Japanese is not sufficiently liberal to incline me to do so, if I saw an opportunity of giving practical effect to my wish; but I recognise that as this Parliament is constituted the chances of inducing it to go back on the principle of restriction are hopeless at the-present time. All I am now asking is that the House shall deal with the Japanese people in the manner in which they asked us to deal with them in 1901, namely, to take them out of the category of Asiatic nations generallv with whom they have been grouped, and to deal with them in the same way and in the same spirit that the mother country has adopted in regard to the much greater question of a common ground of defence in war. All I ask the House to do is to pass a resolution, which will authorize the Government to take some legislative step that will recognise the great national power of the Japanese people, as well as their international claims to our consideration, at the same time taking whatever precautions are required to guard against an unlimited influx of Japanese-if there should be any fear of such a thing in the future. It is necessary that I should deal briefly with the correspondence which took place, not only between the Commonwealth and the Japanese people, but between some of the States authorities, especially those of New South Wales, and the Japanese people prior to the passing of the Act which has so much offended them in their national pride.

The world-speciall y Great Britain-woul d not leave them alone, but by fire and sword won from reluctant peoples rights of trade and residence. As history is counted, the years were but few since British guns had thundered at the portals of one Eastern country after another, and demanded that all doors be opened to tlie Britisher, not only for trade, but for residence. This historical fact certainly carried with it some counter obligations, even if there were no such things possible as international treaties or courtesy. Those who demand a privilege should be careful how they withdraw a similar privilege. Colonel Bell, who is an able thinker, has put in a very succinct . way the same aspect of the question in a small work called Little Giants of the East.

25,Mr Brucesmith,"I think it wasThat correspondence took place in 1897. In 1899, Mr Eitaki wrote to the Premier of New South Wales upon the same subject, and from his letter I make the following brief extract: Mv Government, I am sure, will be quite ready, at anv moment, to give any assurance, or to enter into any suitable arrangement, for controlling emigration to New South Wales.; and they do not wish it to be believed for a moment that they have any thought or wish to promote Japanese emigration to your shores, or elsewhere. In May, 1901, the Federation had already been established ; and when it became known that legislation of the character to which objection had been taken in 1897 was likely to be submitted for the approval of this Parliament, Mr Eitaki addressed a letter to Sir Edmund Barton, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. From that epistle I shall make two extracts which contain its gist. The writer saidThe friendship that exists between the Empires of Great Britain and Japan leads me to suppose that your Government would not, willingly, take steps, calculated to wound the feelings of the people whom it is my privilege to represent. The Japanese belong to an Empire whose standard of civilization is so much higher than that of kanakasI ask honourable members to take particular notice of the point which was emphasized and italicized in this letter in 1901, because it forms the basis of my motionnegroes, Pacific Islanders, Indians, or other Eastern peoples, that to refer to them in the same terms cannot but be regarded in the light of n reproach, which is hardly warranted by the fact of the shade of the national complexion. My Government recognises distinctly the right of the Government of Australia to limit in any way it thinks fit the number of those persons who may be allowed to land and settle in Australia, and also to draw distinctions between persons who may, or who may not be admitted. As Japan is under no necessity' to find an outlet for her population, my Government would readily consent to any arrangement, by which nil that Australia seeks, so far as the Japanese are concerned, would be at once conceded. MightI suggest, therefore, that your Government formulate some proposal, which, being accepted by my Government, would allow of the people of Japan being excluded from the operation of any Act which, directly or indirectly, imposed a tax on immigrants on the ground of colour. In September, 1901, the Japanese Consul again wroteAn impression appears tc exist in some.quarters, and to find voice in certain sections of the Australian press, that Australia is in danger of an influx of Japanese immigrants. I have already endeavoured to show that this impression is altogether erroneous, and in support of this position I have been requested by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Tokio to bring under your notice some clauses of the Japanese Act (passed in 1896, and amended this year, 1901) for the regulation and control of emigration and the protection of Japanese emigrants. Under this Act it is provided that no Japanese may go abroad without first applying to the Government (in writing) for permission to do so, and his application .must be accompanied by a guarantee, signed by two or more responsible sureties, for the good conduct of the emigrant while abroad. On receipt of such application, the Government may grant a passport, provided that it is satisfied as to the character of the applicant, the position of the sureties, and also that there is no danger of the emigrant's presence being in any way offensive to the people of the country whither he intends to go. I would respectfully ask you to refer to the extract from my letter to the Right Hon. G. H . Reid, dated 16th May, i8qq, which I enclosed in my letter to you of the 3rd May last. The extract reads as follows :"" My Government, I am sure, will be quite ready at any moment to give any assurance, or to enter into any suitable arrangements for controlling immigration to Australia."" a guarantee of the good conduct of the emigrants while abroad? says so. the Government of Western Australia should be able to recover something under them. ment is omnipotent; no Government could absolutely regulate the conduct of its people when abroad, although it might take every precaution 1 recognised bad characters, who were introduced into Western Australia from Japan. before the House the statement of a Minister of a great nation, and I think we might well pay that Minister and the nation itself the compliment of presuming ' that, if there were any lapses from the principle contained in the Act to which he refers, they were of an accidental character, and that the Government of Japan could not be held responsible for them.

He pointed out in it the character of certain legislation that had been passed in Japan, and requested that some effort should be made to enter into a treaty by which the desired exclusion might be Asiatics as well as the people of Japan, against effected. In the same month Mr Eitaki whom the measure is primarily aimed. addressed a further letter to the Prime Mr Eitaki went on to sayMinister with reference to the proposed education test. from it is certainly interesting: In Japanese schools and other educational establishments the most approved European methods are adopted, and the most important works on science, literature, ait, politics, law, On the 5th October, 1901, he again wrote&c., which are published in Europe from time to time are translated into Japanese for the use of students. Thus a Japanese, without being acquainted with any other language than his own, is frequently up to a very high educational standard in the most advanced branches of study, by means of a liberal use of these translations. I cannot imagine any sufficient reason why the Japanese language should not be regarded as upon the same footing with, say, the Turkish, the Russian, the Greek, the Polish, the Norwegian, the Austrian, or the Portuguese, or why, if an immigrant of any of the nationalities I have mentioned 'may be examined in his own language, the same courtesy should not be extended to the Japanese. . . .

I ask honourable members to notice what an immense volume of correspondence took place on the one side, in order that they may appreciate what I have to say with regard to the scant I courtesy afforded by the answers which were sent. On 20th Septembei, the Japanese Consul addressed a letter to the Prime -Minister, in which he referred to the Mansard report of' a speech made by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat-the present Prime Minister-in which he saidWe hold that the test should exclude alien My request is that the Japanese may be treated The following extract in the same manner as an European nation. TheB ill is unmistakably and confessedly turned at the Japanese, upon grounds which must form the subject of the strongest possible protest should it be passed. My correspondence, however, was not fortunate enough to produce the desired effect, inasmuch as the educational test decided upon is racial, pure and simple . . . fhe subsequent insertion of the word "" European"" in an amendment . . . emphasizes the intention of the B ill to make racial distinctions. I think honourable members will recognise that so long as the Immigration Restriction Bill was so worded as to require the passing of an educational test in the English language the Japanese offered no objection, because all European and Eastern nations were treated alike. But when the Bill was so amended as to require an immigrant to pass an examination in an European language, it was held that the differentiaIn the Immigration Restriction tion of the Japanese language from those of all Europeans was such as to give rise if any European immigrant to a sense of injury to their national pride. In this last letter, Mr Eitaki statedI have received a cable from His Imperial that account, to convey to Your Excellency their dissatisfaction with those measures.

The Premier of New South Wales answered in these terms -and this is the only letter which I find on record as a reply to the three that were directed to him, as Senator Pulsford observes, in suchl an exceedingly good-tempered spiritSir,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 24th inst., and hasten to assure you that the proposed legislation to which you refer proceeds from no unfriendly feeling towards the Japanese Government,_ but simply from a desire to prevent a state of tilings which might give rise to much agitation and friction within our borders. The Prime Minister of Australia wrote even more vaguely, in answer to the series of something like eight long diplomatic lettersSir,T have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the n t h , 16th, and 20th inst., on the subject of the effect of the Immigration Restriction B ill (now before Parliament). So far as Japanese are concerned, I need scarcely say that your representations are receiving the fullest consideration of the Government. This, so far as I have been able to ascertain-and I shall be glad to be correctedis the only letter which was ever sent by the Prime Minister to the Japanese Consul, in acknowledgment of the many communications to which I have referred. I submit that the Japanese authorities were treated in an off-hand manner. Apparently, it was not suflicient to have passed legislation of this kind. I cannot conceive why the Japanese Consul should not have been addressed in a spirit of diplomatic friendliness. It might have been pointed out that --whateve r the Japanese might think of the attitude of Australia-so long as the people of the Commonwealth entertained a fear that the Japanese might come some day in large numbers to our shores, it was necessary to take steps to give assurances against such an influx. H a d that been done, I think that the Japanese would have felt that they had at least been paid the compliment of receiving a clear, explicit, and straightforward explanation for the action of the Commonwealth. Pulsford uses even stronger language with regard to this correspondence. He writesIt can safely be asserted that the whole records of consular and diplomatic correspondence contain few, if any, instances of an offer so courteously and repeatedly made by a great and friendly nation being so contemptuously ignored. As the House knows, notwithstanding these protests-despit e our larger knowledge of Japan, and our growing .recognition of its national pride-the B ill was passed. I,, and others, (protested against it.

WhatI contend is, that whilst we may have been justified from the point of view of ""the people"" in passing a B ill to exclude Eastern races, we were not justified in differentiating between this great nation and all the other nations of the world, of which perhaps not more than four can be compared to her. We were not justified in so differentiating between them and all the European nations, as to say, "" We do not even intend to provide that your language shall be one of those in which an educational test may be made."" to have an educational test? that many of us regarded the measure as a most hypocritical one. It was not honestly intended that educational fitness should be the qualification for admission to the Commonwealth. The provision in question was an indirect and politically'dishonest method of overcoming a difficulty, and was designed to give the Government a plausible sort of excuse for keeping the Japanese out of the country. from the line of argument which the honourable and learned member has so far pursued. is only another reason why we might have been more straightforward with the Japanese. We knew that we were not dealing with a dull, stupid, uneducated race; and when we found that we were legislating in regard to a people as intelligent as ourselves, it would have been better for us Senator to have said in a straightforward way, "" We shall not allow Asiatics into Australia, until we see how public opinion evolves."" emanate from?

I contend --thoug h I am not going to spend time in discussing this aspect of the case, because I think the House recognises the truth of what I am about to say-that the Japanese rank with the people of the first four nations of Europe. No one who has looked closely into their civilization, habits, government, constitution, and administration, can doubt that, whilst the world has believed them to be asleep, or continuing in the old exclusive manner of living which they followed for manv centuries, they have really been making tremendous strides in every channel of human activity.

If the honourable and learned member has read it carefully, he ( must know that it is an undertaking on the part of both countries to come to the rescue of each other if the status quo should ever be interfered with by another nation,either as affecting Japan, or as affecting Great Britain in India, China, Japan, or Corea. It is a big thing for the English people to undertake to abide by the status quo which Japan has brought about in the East, but their quid f r o quo is in the undertaking of fhe Japanese to help England if the status quo in India should be aggressively affected in any way. I challenge the honourable and learned member to name any treaty or alliance which has been entered* into by Great Britain with any other country during the last fifty years which will compare with this treaty for what I have called intimacy and mutual trust. I have said that the Japanese as a nation are hurt, and I could, if necessary, quote the statements of fifty Japanese public men to support that assertion. I shall quote, the remarks of one or two very prominent men, to show honourable and what the feeling is in this matter on the part of the Japanese, and I am sure that honourable members, however strongly they may hold the opinion that these people I learnt from should be excludedfrom Australia, will not shut their ears to this evidence that our action has greatly hurt the pride of the Japanese people.

The trade question is a very important one.

I want honourable members, if they can, to take so broad a view of this question that, notwithstanding our desire to exclude all coloured races from Australia, we shall at least act like gentlemen towards the people of other nations, and tell them, ""We shall treat with you and converse with you, although we as a people are strongly prejudiced against your coming to this country.

Count Okuma, one of Japan's leading statesmen, has saidWhenI was Foreign Minister, seventeen years ago, the Australian legislators were considering the question of excluding the Japanese. I then represented to the .English Government that such a course would be a wrong to humanity, and against the interests of the Australians themselves, and that the English Government should advise the Australians not to take such a course. About seven years ago, when I was again Foreign Minister, the question of Japanese exclusion was again raised. I then represented to the British Government that such a course would be offensive and wrong, particularly as the Japanese nation was making such great advances in civilization and material progress. I have many other quotations from Japanese holding, high positions. Mr Noma, a member of the House of Reprsentatives, has saidI brought the matter before the House, and all the members agreed with me that it was an insulting action towards our people. I wish honourable members to understand that this subject has been brought before the Parliament of Japan, which is elected a franchise as free as our own; and our So keenly did my countrymen feel the slight With regard to the Australian Exclusion B ill , Japanese nation; an insult which a thousand years would not wipe out. The whole of thepeaceful and friendly character, but they ought to suffice to show that the Japanese national pride has been seriously wounded; and. in view of that fact, we ought to consider whether it is not possible to effect the purpose of our legislation by diplomatic means, so as to save this great nation from offence, and our own good name as a discreet people. and learned member think that the Chinese also are hurt by our action? expressed themselves in the same way; and, moreover, I do not think that they have so far qualified themselves as the Japanese have done by their progress, or by their enlightenment, to receive the same consideration at our hands. PerhapsI recognise as fully as does the honourable and learned member, the prospect that in the near future the Chinese, under the tutorship of Japan, will realize the strength of their position, and the possibilities of their people; but, at present, China is not so educating herself, or distinguishing herself, among progressive peoples, as to make the call upon us so strong as that which Japan puts forward. However, my feeling in this matter is such that if the honourable and learned member for Corio, will. bring forward a suitable motion, relating to the Chinese, I shall be happy to co-operate with him. I have had to look on many sides to obtain material in support of my motion, because I recognise that I might stand here for a very long time, and speak my own personal opinions of the civilization, culture, morality, and progress of the Japanese without making much impression upon, honourable members. honourable members are not prepared to take the step that I am now aboub to propose, they must decline, with the full knowledge that the extreme progress which has been made by the Japanese people is now being generally admitted, and has secured for them the respect of Europe. The conditions of to-day are very different from those which obtained in 1901. Our knowledge of Japan and of the Japanese is very much greater than was then the case, and the position which the Tapanese occupy is very much more forward. A l together, Tapan. occuoies towards Australia a. very different position from that whirh she filled in 1901. In that year we might have taken the step I am now proposing, as an act of national courtesy, but to-day we shall have to act rather from considerations of international policy, because we know that Japan has become one of the great factors of the world's jpeace. Honourable members may recollect a wellworn text which recommends us in certain cases to make peace quickly. It is not, however, upon that ground that I am asking the House to move in this matter, because in all the literature that has come under my notice, I have never read of one phrase used by the Taonnese which would indicate that they were likely to allow their disappointment or pride to prompt them to say an angry word about us. In fact, magnanimity is a national characteristic which will lead the Japanese rather to heap coals of fire upon our heads than to utter words of anger. I remember one remark of the Marquis Ito spoken by him after he had commented on the action of the Australian people, and the effect it would have upon the Japanese. He said that he wondered what the Australian people would say if some day when they were in trouble, the Japanese sent their fleet down into their waters-to help them out of their difficulty ! That is the spirit of the Japanese people, and no Britisher who has not studied their national characteristics can thoroughly realize their magnanimity with regard to others who have given them offence. I have not met with one report of an utterance by a Japanese politician or public man, in which anv angry spirit was allowed to escape. All that was indicated was a feeling of disappointment and offended pride at the way in which their nation had been treated. I should like to quote an utterance of the honourable member for Gippsland, which If seems to me to accurately present the position to-day. In the course of an interview on 13th June, he said, with regard to JapanThe question as to what Australia should do, in view of the altered condition in the East, is a big one-the whole situation will require to be carefully considered by the Federal Government. It' must be apparent to every thinking man that the sense of security we have always considered we derived from our great distance from the bases of all the great military or naval powers of the world, has now been removed. We now find one of the great naval and military powers of the earth within a very short distance of our shores. That puts us in a very different position from that which we considered we occupied heretofore. . . It is fortunate for us that the great power that has recently arisen in the East is friendly with Great Britain. She is an ally of the Empire. Of course, that condition of things might not always continue.",20,Australia

They never were incapable of great, colossal,' even Titanic, works. Read Rudyard Kipling's account of their ancient fortifications. He wrote well of them in his book of the Seven Seas. Look at their stupendous castings in bronze, the mighty wood work of their temples. Turn back to their armadas of the thirteenth century. Though selfexcluded from the world, they have been well abreast of the world in all arts and industries; and now in the world they take their place in front along the whole line. That is the testimony of a member of the Labour Party in thas House, who has opened his mind to whatever impressions might be made upon it by travel in Japan during the past few months. timony as to 'the reasonableness ofi my motion has been borne by several sections of the press. not of my motion, but generally of the movement which I am seeking to further, said:Probably hex Government will be as ready to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in limiting Japanese immigration in our direction as Australia can desire; but, as a great power, that the honourable member admitted into the fraternity of civilized nations -and the result of the war must be to place her in that position-sh e will need to be approached with a courtesy and a consideration hitherto conspicuous by their absence.

53,Mr Brucesmith,"I take it that the English press has to say with regard to this intended step on the part of a member of this House. self as follows:The motion of which Mr Bruce Smith gave notice yesterday in the Australian Federal House of Representatives will evoke a feeling of gratitude and satisfaction both in England and Japan. His reason for the proposal is that Japan, by her work of civilization and reform, has shown her right to be regarded as one of the great nations of the world. Japan is England's ally; and it were only right and proper that the subjects of a State, whose policy, as we know, from a note of Lord Lansdowne's, is identical with that of England, should be treated with a f u l l measure of respect by the New England of the Southern Hemisphere. Like the Italians of the Risor Gimento, they have conquered the world's esteem in battle; and whatever the issue of the present struggle, their conduct during it will be embalmed in history as one of the most precious examples of human fortitude and devotion in the hour of tribulationThe war may be said to have made an end of the ancient superstitions regarding the illimitable gulf between Europe and Asia. In Japan the impartial observers of the world have seen a State which obeys the Western code of honour, whose subjects make war in the most chivalrous manner, whose statesmen keep the pledges which they give, whose people are ready to a man to be killed for a great idea. The hard things which are said today about Japan upon the continent were said forty years ago about Sardinia, and will hereafter be said about any State which arises to disturb the existing conditions of world power. But they cannot hide the fact that Japan is in the right, and fighting, as we in England believe, for a cause which is the highest and greatest to be conceived by man-he r freedom, her integrity, her very existence as a nation. Quite apart from the war, however, the question which we have to consider is: Are the Japanese as a nation worthy of Australian members will notice that I do not at present ask that they shall be pernuttad to enter Australia. shall deal with them by treaty, in order that their national ifeeling may not be wounded, as it has hitherto been. not suggest that they shall be permitted to enter Australia in large numbers, but I wish to ask whether they are worthy of our trust? That question ought to be answered without the slightest hesitation. The mere fact that the mother country has entered into so remarkable a treaty with them should be conclusive evidence that they are so worthy. But if we must look more rilosely into the history of Japan as a nation, and the morale of her people, let us see how she stands when compared with other nations. In the first place, it is well known-and I regard it as one of the Mr Bruce Smith. greatest tributes to her stability as a nation-that she has lived for 2,500 years It expressed itunder the same line of monarchy. For twenty-five centuries there has not been the. slightest departure from the Imperial line of descent from which the present Mikado springs. That is certainly a strong argument in favour of national stability, and that .is the attribute to which the British nation should look more than to any other. Japan had her census as far back as 86 B . C It is recorded in her history that at the time the people in Great Britain prior to the visit of Caesar-were running about with their bodies painted, the Japanese had established a census, and as late as 658 A.D -that is, 400 years before the Norman conquest-the y had systematized it to such an extent that it could be relied upon as a trustworthy record of her population. In 1900, no less than 13,000 foreigners visited Japan. That nation had advanced to such an extent that no difficulty appears to have been experienced by outsiders in entering her territory and travelling through it. Only the other day I heard some honourable member say that the Japanese really excluded other races from their country, and that consequently other nations were justified in retaliating. In refutation of that statement. I would point out that it is recorded in statistical works -the accuracy of which there is no reason to doubt-that no less than' 13,000 foreigners-one-sixt h of whom were Britishersvisited Japan in 1900, without any embargo being placed upon their movements. consideration ? Honourable domicile is another. I merely ask that we ing that the Japanese should be allowed even to visit Australia. But I shall show in a moment what Canada and the UnitedI do States have recently done in this connection. visit us freely do. learned member knows that, but the statement which he made just now is capable of a wrong interpretation. of Japanese come here at the present time without experiencing any difficulty.

I am aware that my speech must resemble an historical essay; but the nature of the case demands that I should put before the House the character and history of the Japanese, whom we have hitherto treated in so arbitrary a way, and whom I wish should be treated differently in the future. I come now to some testimony with regard to the monarch who stands at the end of a dynasty which extends for 2,500 years without a break. In his book, Colonel Bell saysWhileI deny that the achievements of Japan are more wonderful than those of the British race, though the latter was struggling upward for near two hundred years, and the former was rushing forward but forty, every student must confess that in the whole range of history, there has never appeared another man, who in far-seeing wisdom, in a generous love of justice, in keenness of perception, in enlightened statesmanship, and patriotism, worthy to be compared with this Oriental potentate; and to my notion, the ablest statesman and diplomats of this age, are those now controlling the destinies of our Eastern ally. I hold in my hand a manifesto from which I should like honourable members to allow me to read four short extracts. It was the first of the kind issued by the present Mikado, in later years, when the desire for reform became accentuated in Japan. It reads1. That a deliberative Assembly should be formed, and all measures decided by public opinion. 2. That the principles of social economy should be studied by all classes of the people.' ,3. That the foundation of the Empire may be firmly established, we should seek knowledge throughout the whole world. 4. All old and absurd customs should be discarded, and impartiality and justice should become the basis of action. I say that if any reigning monarch had been asked to lay down four great primary principles upon which the success of a nation could be founded, he could not have outlined four more succinct and comprehensive which I have quoted. in this country, and; elsewhere, are under the impression that the daily life of Japan of to-day is regulated by old, crusted, con servative principles which we should con953 sider unworthy of a civilized people. But honourable members will observe that the Japanese themselves are here admonished by their Mikado to discard all old and absurd customs, and to make impartiality and justice the basis of action. different. to say that if we ourselves were to be judged by precept and practice, and if true Christianity were taken as the basis of conduct in our own country, we should find that there is a greater chasm between the actual and the ideal than is to be found in any other country in the world. There is no country in which one standard is being preached, and another practised morn than is the case in our own. I would therefore ask the honourable and learned member for Corio. who has had a legal training, to consider for a moment the logic of his interruption. What possible bearing can it have on my present contention? I am not suggesting that we should shake hands with the Japanesethat our people should be compelled to intermarry with them-in short, that we should take them fo our national bosom. I am merely urging that we should deal with them in a diplomatic manner, in order that we may regulate their inability to enter our country. The Constitution of Japan is one which everv honourable member would do well to studv. I had the advantage of receiving a copv of it some four years ago, and I venture to say that it is one of the most enlightened Constitutions that the world has seen. Everybody is aware of the immense trouble which was taken in its preparation and drafting. The Marquis Ito-on e of the most eminent statesmen in the world-spen t years in Germany, the United States, and Great Britain, during which time his attention was almost exclusively devoted to the drafting of a Constitution for Japan, because the adoption of that Constitution was to mark an entirely new era in the history of that country.

Colonel Bell, who visited^ the master the mechanism of liberal Government; Parliament and the Courts of Japan, said that Japan, by her earnest study of modern science, her keen appreciation of the benefits of civilization, her strong perception of national responsibility, and her perseverance in mastering the principles of right conduct, as accepted by civilized peoples, has justly earned a place in the family of nations. If we look to her Parliament, what do we rind ? She has a House of Representatives, like our own, and a House of Peers. But in connection with the House of Peers, Ave find a novel feature, which is suggestive evea to ourselves. Legislature includes not only Princes of the blood and Peers, but men of distinguished service, of remarkable erudition, and representatives of the highest taxpaying section of the people. In Japan it is held that the particular district which can show that it has paidi the largest share of the taxation of the country shall be entitled to send representatives into the House of Peers to take part in checking its legislation. from England, where wealthy brewers are made members of the House of Lords. copied from England, because it does not provide that men who have succeeded in industry merelv shall enter the House of Peers.

In Japan, the Constitution merely allows Superior Courts, and 310 District Courts. In no Legislative Assembly or Court of law whose sitting I have ever attended, is there more earnest dignity and decorum. That is striking testimony to the way in which the Parliament of Japan and its Courts are conducted. Their laws were codified and systematized as far back as 1882, and again in 1889, and I may also say-althoug h being a senior memberof the Bar myself, I cannot claim that it That branch of the redounds to their credit-that they have an organized Bar of advocates for suitors before their different Courts.

It is very difficult now-a-days to say what is the English or Australian law, but it would be much more difficult for an Australian to express an opinion on a Japanese law point. I hope, therefore, that the honourable member will not put such questions to me.

A l ways remember that you owe your country everything, and that you should exert al-1 your influence to further its interests. The honourable -member for Melbourne, from whose book I have taken this address, concludes with these words, which emphasize the whole pointIn giving these rules, the Mikado solemnly Our moral notions do not materially di'lTer the moral teaching of the Gospel in and purport. Morality has been a feature in Japanese education for centuries. It chivalry, the dicta being chiefly founded on the precepts of Confucius.

He cmtinuesThroughout all grades of the educational system in Japan this Imperial code forms the basi3 of the moral and ethical teachings.

Hence the by the honourable member for Melbourne, whole Japanese ethical system, known as whose testimony the House will see I Bushido, rests without dogma on the principle that the highest -satisfaction is to be found in highly value, regarding it, as I do, in the the exchange of kindness. Bushido makes the nature of admissions by the other side. interests of the family the concern of each memHe says, speaking of Western colonizaber, it makes the interests of the State the contioncern of each family. I might make further quotations from the Age, bearing equally important testimony to the worth of these people; but I shall content myself by quoting again from the book published by the honourable member for MelbourneI have no desire to raise a scare or to promote any distrust of our allies-the Japanese. No man appreciates more highly than myself their masterly action in war, and patient, untiring industry in peace. I gladly bear evidence, exploitation. The one object has been to make also, to their magnanimity and level headedness in triumph, and to their fine toleration in matters of faith and form. Passing ever other quotations, I propose to read a tribute from the enemy of the Japanese, which was published in the R/tss, one of the most popular of the newspapers of St.' Petersburg: All the stories told of the brutality of the them, it may be admitted, white flowers of the Japanese have been shown to be unfounded. Our soldiers, who have been prisoners, and escaped, are unanimous as to the kindness shown them by the Japanese. And the same feeling is expressed in letters coming from our soldiers, people trespassed on. prisoners of war. A feeling of mutual respect has grown up between ourselves and the Japanese. Our opinion of the Japanese has completely altered. My limit of time has been almost reached, and I am anxious to come to some of the more substantial testimonies with regard to the civilization of these people. I have before me testimony as to Japanese statesmanship, and also testimony from various Mr Bruce Smith. vernment in colonizing the island of Fore pirates and a variety of other criminal classes were living ForA I find it impossible to doubt that in their own lands and in their own waters the Easterners, as represented by the Japs and the Chinese, must henceforth be regarded as invincible, and not to be touched aggressively with any impunity. And, following immediately on that appears the advisability-nay , the urgent' necessity-of every power of the West considering forthwith its position in the East. A reckless and rapacious inconsiderateness has so far characterized all their exploitations, for every "" Sphere of Influence"" is but a field of profit-that -is, to drag away the wealth, the accumulated produce of the East for the support and enrichment of the West. All talk of civilization and Christianization is mere pretence and humbug. Wherever the West has. settled down in most force, there degradation of the native people is most deplorable. Bryce states this plainly as regards Canton, and it is true all along the coast. The white settlements are made up of a few high-class officials, some few of garden of our highest civilization. But the bulk is vile: and in the general system there are elements mixed, repulsive to honest democratic ideas, as insulting and offensive to the great That passage and the facts it embodies offer a very striking contrast with the effect which Japanese colonization has had upon Formosa. For want of time, I pass away from a mass of interesting matter to quotations in a more concrete and statistical form. I have in my possession to-day two most valuable and complete statistical works on Japan. One is called the Financial and Economical Annual of Japan, and the other Japan in the Beginning of the Twentieth Century. Both have been translated into English, and both have attached to them diagrams cf a most careful and scientific character. I do not hesitate to assert that no country in the world is at the present time publishing statistical works which are more carefully and scientifically prepared, or more beautifully and informingly illustrated by their diagrams, than are those published in Japaln. Thesje works treat of finances, loans, currency, money market, banks, clearing Ijouses, army, navy, post and telegrapas, railways, shipping, education, colonization, and industries. They show that the trade of Japan with the outside world is worth something like £21,500,000; the trade with Europe being worth about .£9,500.000, and the trade with Asia about £12,000,000. Japan's trade with British India is worth about .£5,000,000 a year, and with Great Britain about the same. In Japan there are 28,000 public schools, attended by 5,085,000 scholars, and 1,676 private schools, attended by 173,000 scholars. 109,000 professors, and teachers in the public institutions of the country, and 8,000 in the private institutions. Japan's schools are classified as primary, blind, deaf and dumb, normal, higher normal, middle, higher girls, high, universities, special, and technical. There are seventy-eight high schools and 400 technical schools. Occupying university chairs are twenty-nine professors of law, twenty-seven professors of medicine, twenty-one professors of literature, twenty-one professors of science, and twenty-two professors of agriculture. There are also special schools which give instruction in agriculture, commerce, navigation, and fisheries. The Japanese Imperial library contains 419,000 volumes, and there are forty-nine country libraries, containing 408,000 volumes. A writer on Japanese education says :The Japanese have an intense love for learning. There are about 30,000 schools, 100,000 teachers, and 5,000,000 scholars in Japan. Ninety per cent, of the boys, and 71 per cent, of the girls, throughout the entire country are receiving an education. The Government schools are all secular, and neither of the four religions of the country-Buddhism, Shintoism, Confucianism, or Christianity-is taught, but good moral science is taught in them all. In the school books they are taught to be honest and truthful, and sober and modest, polite and respectful to their parents, and to their brothers and sisters, and neighbours, and charitable to the poor; to train and cultivate their moral faculties; to train and cultivate their intellectual faculties, and to be upright in every thought, word, and action In the matter of writing Japanese excel; they are beautiful penmen, and good draughtsmen. Education is compulsory in Japan; the school attendance is exceedingly good. I quote the following return from the Japan Times, July iS, 1903 :"" The number of Japanese boys and girls who were of school age at the end of the 34th fiscal .year (1901). was 6,497,489, of whom 776,565, that is, 12 per cent., did not attend any school. The causes of non-attendance were poverty in 84 per cent, of the cases, sickness in 13 per cent., and miscellaneous causes in 3 per cent. There were, in 1902, 250,072 pupils studying English, while only 8,973 pupils were studying ofher languages foreign to the Japanese, a great compliment to the country to which we belong. Although Japan has a population of only about 47,000,000, and a territory of about 163,000 square miles, while Russia has a population of about 130,000,000, and a territory of nearly 9,000,000 square miles, Japan has more pupils in her schools than there are in the Russian schools. In There are Japan's elementary schools there are 4,302,000 pupils while in Russia's elementary schools there are only 4,193,000 pupils. In Japan, 92 in every 1,000 of the inhabitants go to school, and in Russia only 32 in every 1,000. The figures for . secondary schools and universities are 1 equally in Japan's favour. The Japanese are great readers of both books and newspapers. I find that in one year the books taken from the public libraries numbered 668,703. The greatest number of books read in that year related to mathematical science arirl medicine. In the next class were those relating to history, biography, geography, travels, and voyages. Then came those relating to literature and language. Next came those relating to law, politics, sociology, economy, and sta-tistics. After them came those relating to arts, industries, engineering, and military and naval science, while the rest were encyclopedias or related to miscellaneous subjects. Apparently no works of fiction were supplied by these libraries; or, if such books were issued, there is no record of them. Japan encourages inventions; 7.000 patents have been granted in that country, together with 21,000 trade marksand 2,000 designs. The Department of State records a farming, population of 28,000,000. There is an agricultural department, whose branches deal with irrigatiran, drainage, reclamation, and zation, and in connection with which there are experimental farms for instruction in agriculture, and horse breeding, while .publications on agricultural subjects are issued. a hypothec bank, with local branches, which makes advances to farmers for .all purposes of their industry. coal, oil, iron, copper, and sjulphur is carried on in the country. ; Coming to the finances, I find that the public revenue is 251,000,000 yens, or ,£25,000,000 a year, and the public expenditure yens, or £24,500,000, Japan's national debt was yens, or ,£59,500,000, which is little more than two-thirds of the public debt of New South Wales, and about the same as that of Victoria; although Japan has managed to buy for herself one of the finest navies in the world, and has proved herself superior to one of the greatest European militarv powers. as much to ""the fore as is Australia. banks doing, business there are the Bank of Japan, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Hypothec Bank"" of Japan, the local Hypothec Banks, the Hokkaido Jiank, the Industrial Bank of Japan, besides ordinary banks and savings banks. In 1902, Japan's despatches of foreign mails, including parcels, papers, and letters, numbered 7,010,000. orders domestic money-orders. savings banks of tbe country, in 1903, there were 2,859,000 depositors. million telegraphic patched throughout Japan in 1902, and 600,000 foreign telegraphic messages were sent away. There are 30,000 subscribers in that country. mestic 208,000,000 cards, 149,000,000 newspapers and magazines, 48,000,000 10,000,000 parcels, or 900,000,000 posted articles in all. Thirty-seven million pounds have been invested in railways in Japan, there being 3,010 miles of private lines and 1,226 of Government lines, Her shipping, in 1902, included 1,441 steamers, aggregating 610,000 tons; 3,977 sailing vessels, aggregating 336,000 tons; and junks, aggregating 2,351,000 tons. figures show that Japan is progressing by leaps and bounds, in a way in which proMr Bruce Smith. fertilibably no other country has progressed in the world's history. I invite those who doubt the wisdom of the modest step which sericulture, cattle breeding, I advocate to look into these statistical works for themselves. If they do, they will There is be astonished at the proportion of the track and national concerns of Japan. It may be asked, what are other countries doing in Mining for this matter? I would refer, first, to the example of Canada. A cable of the 26th April stated that the Canadian Dominion House of Commons had disallowed British Columbia legislation against Japanese im245,000,000 migrants, on the ground that such restrica year. In 1903, tions were incompatible with British Im6 595,000,000 perial interests. In Senator Pulsford's book on The British Empire and the Relations of Asia and Australia, there is an account of the steps which President Roosevelt has taken to insure the courteous treatment of Japanese citizens, and only this week it was reported that an American Chamber of Commerce has asked the PreIn banking, Japan is sident of the United States of America to The recommend Congress to pass legislation which will promote harmony between the United States and Japan. On the 23rd June, a cable message stated that Canada Colonization had invited Great Britain to ask Japan to include the Dominion in the terms of the Anglo-Japanese treaty of 1904. I do not wish to prolong my remarks, because the time allowed by the Standing Orders for 6,776,000, and the arrivals the discussion of motions has nearly exSixty thousand foreign moneypired. I only wish to say, in conclusion, were issued, and 9,000,000 that I have heard a little song which In the Postal speaks of "" lovers in the shade "" and "" summer friends.""

Honourable members will see clearly that the motion does not ask that the Japanese shall be admitted to our shores, if we are not yet ready to go so far in our liberal policy.

HO ME RULE FOR IRELAND . Debate resumed from 31st August (vide on the matter, and I did not wish to inflict GINSThat an humble Address be presented to His stand-point.

I challenged the honourable member particular we congratulate the people of the for proof in support of his statement, but United Kingdom on the remarkable Act directed he was unable to furnish it. I think it is towards the settlement of the land question, and unfortunate 'that the name of the first on the concession to the people of Ireland of a Governor General of the Commonwealth measure of Local Government for municipal purposes. But the sad history of Ireland since the should have been dragged into a debate of Act of Union shows that no British Parliament this kind, in association with an organizacan understand or effectively deal with the ecotion whose aim is to set one section of the nomic and social conditions,of Ireland. Enjoying and appreciating as we do the blestion, and which lives upon the prejudices sings of Home Rule here, we would humbly express the hope that a just measure of Home of the past. I believe that the Marquis of Rule may be granted to the people of Ireland.

68,Mr Ronald (Southern Melbourne),"a charitable institution, feeling confident that that honourable gentleman has too high a sense of honour to take so vile an oath. If the Marquis of Linlithgow had associated himself with the Orange movement, his connection with it would not have enhanced the prestige of the society, but would have caused that eminent gentleman to fall greatly in the esteem of a large number of citizens of the Commonwealth. I refuse to believe the statement until it is proved beyond all doubt to be true. We have already demonstrated that upon political, national, and moral grounds we are perfectly entitled to express our opinion that it is desirable to grant autonomy to Ireland. We have answered the objections which have been advanced in support of the hands-off policy, namely, the contention that we are not justified in interfering with the domestic policy of the Empire, to the extent contemplated. We have pointed to a number of precedents which are furnished by the history of the Empire, and I submit that the interchange of opinions between the Legislatures in the various portions of His Majesty's dominions are calculated to lay the foundation of a practical Imperial or Anglo-Celtic Federation. not for one moment suppose that the Imperial Parliament will regard our action in presenting an address to His Majesty upon the subject of Home Rule for Ireland as an impertinence or as any undue interference by us in matters beyond our province. No such intention' underlies the proposal. They did not so regard the kindred motion which was passed three times in Canada. The attitude of certain honourable members in opposition to this motion is perfectly intelligible. that an attempt is being made to intro duce a disturbing element into our political life. I am sorry to say that the disturbing element of factional prejudices is already in operation amongst us, and that our political affairs cannot be established upon a reasonably secure basis until the present vexed question of Home Rule for -Ireland is settled. I believe that the resolution will be accepted by the British Parliament in the spirit in which it is conceived. It contains one paragraph which I should prefer to see excised; but I can assure honourable rnembers that there is no intention to commit an impertinence or to affront the Imperial authorities. I need not delay the House any further, because I have already spoken at Mr Ronald. considerable length on a former occasion. I hope sincerely that the motion will be agreed to by a large majority, and that we shall be able to demonstrate to the Imperial authorities that, apart from anything approaching a meddlesome spirit, we take a lively interest in the domestic affairs of the nation. Further, I hope that the interchange of opinions between the Legislatures of the nation may prove to be the beginning of a closer and more tangible union, which may ultimately take the form of a Federation of the Anglo-Celtic races. Referring'once more to the statement of the honourable member for Dalley, that the Marquis of Linlithgow was connected with the Orange institution at one time, I wish to say that, even if our former Governor General was induced to join the organizastion, he could not have been aware of the hideous oath by which he would be required to bind himself to carry out the objects of the order. I feel perfectly sure that he will give an emphatic denial to the statement. think any one can ever have his attention I do drawn to any question affecting the welfare of the people of Ireland without expressing the strongest possible sympathy with the Irish people in reference to the long and dark period of oppression and injustice through which they have passed at the hands of the superior power of Great Britain. No man can become familiar with Irish history without feelings of profound indignation at the intolerance and injustice which animated the dominant power in its dealings with the Irish people. They think But there is no doubt that, many df the miseries of Ireland were not due to op: pression or injustice. Some of the saddest aspects of Irish history are presented by the bitter feuds which have paralyzed the real power of the Irish race for many centuries. If they had been as united in the defence of their rights as the smaller population of Scotland has been, they would have been able to stand side by side in those days, as the patriots' of Scotland did, and we may be sure that many a dark page of wrong and hardship would never have been written in the history of the Irish race. One of the sources of their weakness was the intense dissension which in those days seemed to mark the relations of the various divisions of the Irish people, and one cannot help regretting that even to-day they are divided by differences of the bitterest",31,Australia
69,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"I do notkind. can help expressing his highest admiration for the character of the Irish people. The effect of oppression and wrong upon national character has often been disastrous. Many noble (peoples have been bent down by oppression andi wrong until they have lost the noblest attributes of their national temperament. that, in spite of the wrongs which they suffered in those dark centuries, the inhabitants of Ireland stand before the world today as one of the most generous, virtuous, and gifted peoples on the face of the globe. Another of their attributes which excites-and ought to excite-the gratitude of every loyal subject of the Empire, is that they repaid oppression and injustice by magnificent services .to Great Britain. Their achievements on the battle-fields, which helped to win the E m pire, their brilliance in diplomacy, their signal services in tlie governing circles of the nation, have been such as to excite admiration. I have said enough to show that I approach this subject with no unworthy feeling, with no disparaging element of scepticism as to the worth of the Irish race. I now come to the motion,which is under consideration. Whilst there are many sentiments in the proposed Address which must elicit our approval, we have to ask ourselves: ""What is the practical point of these resolutions "" ? It. is that a request, in the form of a petition to the King, shall be submitted in the name of the House of Representatives of the Australian Commonwealth, asking the people, the Government, and the representatives of the United Kingdom, through the Sovereign, to make a vital change in the system ofi parliamentary government which prevails there. I encounter, upon the very threshold of this proposal, one or two most serious difficulties. In the first place, whilst upon every matter which affects any ;part of the E m pire it is the undoubted right of every British subject to express his opinionswhilst he has the right to appear upon any . platform to ventilate any grievances-whe n we seek to express our opinions, not in our individual capacity, but as embodying the views of Parliament,* and as representing the voice and judgment of the people, we have one or two preliminary questions to consider. The first is : "" What right has the House of Representatives in this Commonwealth to propose to interfere in [roo] I would also say that no one one of the burning questions of political controversy in the mother country to-day?""

A great, deal of the prominence which has been given to the subject of Home Rule for Ireland, in the United States, Canada, and Australia, has been prompted less by a regard for the welfare of the Irish people than by a desire to make political capital out of Irish disputes. very strong feeling behind it. the people may be, they have the freest means of expressing them, both in the press and by public meeting. But the question which I wish to put to honourable members is : "" What right has this Parliament to interfere with the Legislature of the mother country in a matter of internal concern, and to ddrecu the form which legislative changes in Great Britain shall take "" ? the mother country? terest in a number of things with which it is not our business to meddle.

But what that mighty mother of all our Parliaments does not and dare not do, some of us are prepared to do in a spirit of cool complacency. We presume to cross the seas and to enter into a political controversy in the mother country on the very eve of a general election, at which this question of Home Rule for Ireland will be one of the principal issues. We make our appearance in the presence of K in g Edward, and constitute ourselves his advisers in regard to the shape that a British political agitation should take.

That There are sort of statement, which is a very common one, is based upon a most superficial view. On what state of affairs did the agitation for colonial parliamentary independence arise? Gentlemen were sent across the seas to this distant dependency of the Crown to assume despotic power in the management of this But we must country, and the agitation for parliamentary independence was an agitation against a state of irresponsible despotism. The person who was put into Government House owed no responsibility to the Australian people; he was responsible only to the Imperial Government. It was a natuloyal subject against another. ral and manly desire, springing from the genius of the British race, that led us to demand a change-to desire to exchange for the despotism of the person sent out from the mother country some system of parliamentary government. We had no Parliament when we fought, and so we fought If the House of Commons for and won the parliamentary institutions that we now possess. The moment the mother country granted parliamentary institutions to Canada, Australia, and other parts of the Empire, she granted with it such an an implied power to demand even r tually separation. The corollary of the grant of the right to manage our own affairs in our own Parliament is the right to separate from the mother country, when the people of this country desire to do so. That is one difference between the two cases. If those who granted self-government to Canada or Australia did not realize that the grant of that right carried with it the right to separate-the right to absolute independence if desired, they failed to know what every statesman should have known. Let us suppose that the people of Australia decided the connection between Australia and the mother country should cease, and that decision was endorsed by the two Houses of Parliament, which carried resolutions after a general The proposal to do so election on the point in favour of the severance of the tie which binds us to the mother country. How could Great Britain, which gave us the right to manage our own affairs as a free people, with a free Parliament, draw her sword to destroy the aspirations of that free people expressed by that free Parliament? What English statesman would contemplate such a situation? ment to the position of Ireland. I am dealing first of all with the position of Australia; and if honourable members will give me the opportunity I will deal with the case of Ireland. I am pointing out, in reply to an argument, in which Ireland and Australia are placed on the same basis, that there are distinctions between the two. MrM ' AHON Parliament in 1782, without expressing any desire to separate? that Parliament, and of the methods which suppressed it, must be known to the honourable member. superficial knowledge of the way in which that Parliament was taken from Ireland can help feeling ashamed at the infamous tactics that were employed. But I wish to return to two points in respect of which there is a vital difference between Ireland and Australia. first of all that there is no analogy between the condition of Ireland and that of our own self-governing Colonies in reference to the demand for parliamentary institutions. We asked for parliamentary institutions because we had none, and because there was no Parliament of any kind in which we were represented. said, instead of having a Parliament, had a despot, and had to. choose between the two. we should have longed for a Parliament?

The difference between the position of Australia and that of L e t us apply that arguIreland is that when we sought self-government we had no Parliament and no pretence to a share of representation in any I am just going to do so. Parliament. was. I am simply pointing out that on the basis of union-of the three kingdoms being one-thi s is an important fact. On any other basis my argument would altogether D i d not Ireland have a fail. If the position taken up is that Ireland should be an independent community, that she has for centuries prayed The history.of for independence, that her aspiration is to be free, and that there should be an Irish' nation as well as an Irish Parliament, a different line of argument will have to be followed. I am assuming, however, that the No one with the most Irish people do not wish for independence. I am asuming that they are content to remain within the United Kingdom, and that they do not wish to break off their connection with the British Parliament. On that basis I say that the British Parliament is one in which' Ireland holds a fair share I should have mentioned of representation. It would be just as wise to ask that Scotland should dominate the British Parliament while she remains one of the three kingdoms, as it would be to ask that Ireland should do so. I wish, however, to point out that Ireland has representation in the grandest of all Parliaments. We may talk of the Canadian ParAustralia, as I have liament, or of that of Australia; but what are they when compared with the grand Imperial Parliament, which has the destinies Is it a matter for surprise that of a fifth of the human race within its grasp?

The agitation 'now is for a modification of that relationship, and I am willing to take as S h e mav not value her reperfectly loyal and sincere the profession that this desire for an Irish Parliament is not the prelude to a demand for total separation from the mother country.

There was a time when I should not have stood here for a moment to gainsay the right of the Irish people to any remedy of the wrongs under which they suffered. There is no doubt that the desire to make Ireland a real partner in this great Parliament-the desire to give the Irish people an honest share in the rights and liberties of Englishmen and Scotchmenhas been very tardy. It was in a very tardy and grudging way that the English people of seventy, eighty, or a hundred years ago gave Ireland any! sort of share in the rights of free men. If the people of Ireland at such a time had risen in rebellion and cast off the British yoke, no man who respects human rights would have said that they were not entitled to do so. I am happy to say, however, that a different relationship has grown up between the Irish people and the rest of the people of the United Kingdom. tardy, but it has been magnificent. No one can forget the grand part that Gladstone, played in redeeming the character of the British people in their dealings with Ireland-n o one can forget that mighty effort which disestablished the dominant .church, then representing only a fraction of the stone in declaring for Home Rule were of the noblest character. There is no doubt that Gladstone's inspiration was a noble one. He believed that, by extending self-governing institutions to Ireland, he would crown the real, true, and lasting union between the Irish people and the people of Great Britain. But I am addressing a House of Parliament in this distant part of the King's dominions, in which it is proposed to express an opinion in favour of a radical change in the parliamentary institutions of a self-governing community. Gladstone advocated. one that I revere; but it should remind us that one of the best inspirations of his policy was the maintenance of ithe right of people to manage their own affairs. Shall we be managing our own affairs if we at There this time interfere in a parliamentary struggle which will presently be submitted to the arbitrament of a General Election in the United Kingdom? There may be members who were sent into this House to express the voice of their constituents on the question of Home Rule for Ireland, but I am not one of them. During the past twenty-five years I have never been asked by my electors one single question on this subject. If I am to vote on it, as the representative of East Sydney, surely I must first know what tlie electors of East Sydney think in regard to it? My private opinion is quite anothejr imatter. The seventy-five members of this House can, every one of them, go on to the platforms of Australia, and express their opinions on the subject of Home Rule in the freest way possible. They can address public meetings on the subject; but, in doing so, they will be expressing only their own views and opinions. They have, so far as I know, no right to represent the views of their constituents. The expression of our Reparation has been individual views outside this Chamber is one thing, and the expression of our views as the representatives of the Australian people is another. Our action here should be based only on opinions submitted to our constituents, and after their opinions have been ascertained-no t by a secret method, or by guessing or jumping at conclusions-bu t as the result of open discussion. My honourable friends must admit that if this question be put before the counW as a Home Ruler. try as a live political issue for the next He was, and his motives elections, it would turn Australian politics upside down. Speaking of the constituencies generally, no one can say what their verdict would be in regard to it. We have no right to arrogate to ourselves the power to speak on behalf of the Australian people when they have not authorized us to do so, and when we have not asked for authority to do so. As I have said, we can declare our own opinions on this subject outside, but we have no right to use the name of Parliament in expressing them as if they were the opinions of the people. This issue has never been before the people. I decline to countenance any such action.. In favour of what Mr This discussion will, unhappily, tend to bring the question into the arena of AusT h e name of Gladstone is tralian politics.

The issue may come to this: A candidate may say to the Socialists in his constituency and I have no doubt that in many cases it would be a determining appeal "" I am not a Socialist, Michael; but I am a HomeR u l e r "" ; or "" I am a Socialist, Andrew; but I am not a Home Ruler."" I regard the question of Home Rule for Ireland as one which must be left for determination to the good sense and intelligence of the 41,000,000 of the British people. It has nothing to do with the politics of Australia. now for or against a candidate, according to his religion. minds me of a state of things which I think no one wishes to The honourable member for .'Gwydir-to show how near we are to sectarianquestions in discussing the subject of Home Rule-whe n I jocularly mentioned Home Rule a few days ago, seriously exclaimed, ""What right have you to raise the sectarian question?"" A representative of the people mixes up sectarian issues with the Home Rule question so closely that I could not mention Home Rule without being accused of raising the sectarian issue. the right honourable member mentioned Home Rule that made the honourable member for Gwydir exclaim. honourable member for the Barrier reminded me of the occurrence, and enables me to add that those who wish to preserve the politics of Australia from side issues should avoid intruding this question of Home Rule. I wish again to emphasize the fact that every member whom I am addressing has a perfect right to talk about Home Rule outside the House. As a British subject, he can hold meetings to advocate it, he can write articles in support of it, and he can seek to influence the people upon in every conceivable way. But in this House Ave are not authorized by our electors to express their opinions on the subject. We are free to govern Australia; we are free to take up all sorts of matters,, as they arise, in the exigencies of Australian legislation, whether they have been before the electors or not. But I draw a sharp line between the use of our consciences, our judgments, and our advocacy in Australia of Australian reforms, and the arrogation of a right to speak for the 4,000,000 of Australian people on a subject which has nothing to do with Australian politics.

As Ave settle that question, Ave settle the question of an Irish Parliament.

It is within the province of their politics, while it is not within the province of our politics. I leave it to them to settle this .great problem, which affects the happiness and welfare of the Irish and British people. No man has a more earnest desire than I have that such a settlement mav be arrived at as will strengthen and increase the prosperity of Ireland, while preserving the -stability of the Empire. I should act fairly if I did not put the position which I take up plainly before the House, and, in order that honourable members may take a course which will probably be more satisfactory than negativing the motion, or agreeing to the previous question, I have a proposal to make. thought at one time of moving the previous question; but I felt that such a course might be thought to be unsympathetic with respect to the legitimate aspirations of the Irish people. I have no desire to take up any unkind attitude with respect to that once oppressed and once wronged people. I have no desire to add in the least degree to the misfortunes of that country. But I put the Ireland of to-day before the world as a country which has been treated more generously than any other -during the last twenty years. has been the desire even of the resolute -opponents of Home Rule, the Conservative Party of England, to do some long delayed measure of justice to Ireland that the principles of British legislation have c-een strained favour, not of the dominant power of the landlords and tenants of the great rural districts of England and Scotland, but of the people of Ireland. £100,000,000 of British money have been pledged to place the Irish landlords and tenants in .a position that British landlords and tenants have never occupied and never will -occupy. That is, I say, a magnificent proof of the generosity of the dominant power, which might have employed the most barbarous methods of past ages for the purpose of oppression and wrong. But in the brighter stage upon which the relations of England and Ireland have -entered, we see the unbending Tories forgetting all their principles and prejudices with regard to the ownership of land in their endeavours to place the Irish tenants upon a better footing than they ever occupied before. money into the pockets of the landlords. lish people have not landed estates. The honourable member's statement might applyto a few fortunate gentlemen who have large estates in Ireland, but that daring departure from all maxims of British law in reference to the ownership of land would have been impossible if it had not proceeded from a generous impulse of the I do not think whole British people. I look upon that as a sign of brighter days, because the generous treatment of a generous people like the Irish race must yield a rich harvest of goodwill and understanding. I rosity to the Irish landlords, who have been enriched to the extent of £12,000,000. matter; but does the honourable member forget the improvements effected in the condition of the Irish tenants. I think that there is some reference in the resolution before us to the enormous benefits conferred on the Irish peasantry, who were at one time in a condition of the utmost misery. We know that now the tenant can stand up against his landlord in the So ardent face of the law, and obtain some justiceand generous justice too. In conclusion, I desire to say that no man wishes Ireland a more generous measure of prosperity and contentment than I do, but I leave to breaking point in this question of parliamentary policy and parliamentary change, to the august tribunal of the people of the UnitedK in gdom, and, so far as I am concerned, I shall stand against the intrusion into this Parliament of burning questions which have created so much bad blood and bad feeling in other parts of the Empire.

If, after I have had time to further consider the amendment, I find that it is merely an expanded negative, it will be my duty to rule it out of order. A t present I think it is more in the natuie of the "" previous question,"" and therefore in order. on this question under a great disability, since I am called upon to follow the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney, who has just treated the House to a most eloquent speech. the further disadvantage of having received from a number of my constituents a request that I should support the motion. I recognise the fact that if I do not comply with their desire I shall excite a considerable amount of animosity in my electorate, which may have a disastrous personal effect in the future. However, I have never hesitated to do what I believe to be right; and, when I remember that some time ago I opposed the motion in favour of petitioning the English Parliament against the introduction of Chinese labour into the Transvaal, on the ground that we had no right to interfere in such matters, I do not see how I can support the present proposal. On the occasion referred to I expressed the opinion that the English Government would treat the petition with contempt, and my prediction proved to be a true one. In dealing with this matter we must remember that the decision of the Irish people to cast in their lot with Great Britain was arrived at in their own Parliament, and, although it has been asserted that certain members of that Legislature were bought over by Lord Castlereagh, the fact remains that the representatives of The right honthe Irish people, of their own free will, deliberately entered into the union. Under, these circumstances, it seems to me that we have no right whatever to interfere. We must also remember that Scotland, which at that time was in exactly the same position as Ireland, has never asked for a Parliament of her own. are always discontented people in every community, and it is possible that a few Scotchmen may have desired to see a Scotch Parliament established, but there never has been an expression by the Scotch people of a unanimous desire to have a Parliament of their own. It is quite possible that Great Britain may in time grant powers of administration to the Irish people similar to those which are now exercised by the London County Councila system of, local government which has latterly come much into vogue in Great Britain-bu t it is not for us to say that the time is ripe for any such change. What does this proposal mean? Does any honourable member suppose that the Irish people will be content to have a local Parliament which will have no voice in matters relating to the I stand at army and navy? Is it not recognised that this is merely the thin end of the wedgethat the more the Irish people get, the more they will want? What have the people of Ireland been doing during the last twenty years? They have been agitating for Home Rule, not by legitimate means, but by means of incendiary methods. It cannot be said that the Irish people have been unjustly treated so f ar as their representation in the British Parliament is concerned. Some time ago, when a redistribution of seats in the British Parliament was proposed, it was established beyond doubt that, in proportion to population, Ireland possessed more representatives than England, and considerably more than Scotland.

He urged, first of all, that we had absolutely no mandate from the people of Australia to consider this question; and, secondly, that even if we had, we have no right to interfere. Finallv, he contended, with great force, from the point of view of any one who loves the Empire, that it is neither expedient nor wise for the House to meddle in matters over which it has 'no control.

Those who have dealt at length with the maltreatment-and I use the word ""maltreatment"" advisedlywhich the people of Ireland suffered in centuries gone by at the hands of the mother country, may well be asked whether they can find in the long range of history the case of any country which, in the centuries long passed, did not maltreat its dependencies, or its people. Let us look, for example, at France, and endeavour to ascertain whether there is any demand on the part of the descendants of the Huguenots for separation from the central authority.

Thelegislation and recent debates in the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom, of a sincere desire now to deal justly with IrelandThis, I believe, is the blarney-stone; but if those responsible for the' motion have sincerely used these words, they are surely prepared to leave to this beneficent authority, which is now ready, according to their own statement, to deal with Ireland fairly, the destinies and future prosperity of that country, which we all wish well. these words were not sufficient, the motion continuesand in particular we congratulate the people of the United Kingdom on the remarkable Act directed towards the settlement of the land question, and on the concession .to the people of Ireland of a measure of local government for municipal purposes. It has been said by an honourable member, who has spoken in support of the motion I think it was the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that Home Rule for Ireland does not mean absolute separate autonomy for that country. clares that those honourable members who tell us that they do not wish Ireland to have complete autonomy are congratulating the people of the United Kingdom on having granted to the people of that country a measure of local government for municipal purposes. liament, which it is proposed to insult with the concluding sentences of_ this message, is prepared to deal justly with the people of Ireland, and has already agreed that a considerable measure of that partial autonomy, of which the framers of the motion say they are in favour, shall be granted to her. _ I think it is clear from the opening sentences of the motion that those responsible for it feel that the Parliament of the United Kingdom is eminently fitted to deal, and to deal justly, with the people of Ireland. Having that view. I entirely fail to understand the reason for the insult comprised within the concluding sentences of the proposed petition. say thatThe sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland. Those who are responsible for the motion say in one sentence that the Imperial Par-;, liament is eminently just, and anxious to deal with the question of Ireland's wrongs, and in another that no British Parliament can deal with the question. Surely that is a most extraordinary contradiction. Are honourable members sincere when they say that they have observed in the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom"" a sinAs if cere desire now to deal justly with Ireland,"" and add that ""no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland"" ?

Surely, if we owe anything to the constitutional head of this great Empire, it is to fearlessly tell the truth-if , indeed, we do. not owe that duty to our self-respect and the sense of conscience which even poliI t shows that the Particians may be expected to possess. But the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne does not ask for absolute local autonomy for Ireland, although he speaks of us as ""enjoying and appreciating the blessings of Home Rule,"" and therefore asking for similar advantages for that country. All he asks for is "" that a just measure of Home Rule may be granted to the people of Ireland."" What is "" a just measure of Home Rule"" ? Again, we are told that the people of Ireland have asked for Home Rule through their representatives. Where are those representatives asking for it ? Are they asking for it in Australia, where, we can Hear them, or in the Hous.es of Parliament at Westminster, in the heart, of the Empire, where the people of the United Kingdom can hear them?

Surely the Parliament of the United Kingdom is better able to deal with and decide this question than is the Parliament of Australia. I sincerely believe in the absolute loyalty and devotion of the Irish people, and am proud of the fact that I am descended from Irish stock. Therefore, I ask, why should it be inferred that, if the request of the people of Ireland for Home Rule is not granted, they will do something which may imperil the ""peace and integrity of the Empire"" to which I believe they, as well as we, are proud to belong? The motion contains a series of contradictions, which should justify any deliberative assembly in rejecting it. be moved in this Parliament until the people of Australia have expressed their opinions on the subject. when I continue my remarks on a future occasion, to put that view very strongly before honourable members. The movers of the motion sayIt is our desire for the solidarity and permanence of the Empire, as a power making for peace and civilization, that must be our excuse for submitting to Your Majesty this respectful petition. The petitioners, then, themselves admit that an ""excuse"" is necessary for this proposed offensive interference with the self-governing rights of another part of the Empire! they make to their constituents, who have not authorized them to deal with this question? pass a motion which will appease all sections. It is a singular thing that those who profess to be satisfied that the Imperial Parliament intends to deal justly and properly with Ireland are the men who propose this gratuitous interference with the self-governing rights of Great Britain. with the good name of Kelly should stonewall a motion of this kind. honourable member of the name of Higgins should draft a motion so f u l l of casuistry. If he regards this question as so urgent, and has the welfare of the people of Ire973 land so much at heart, why does he not resign his seat in this House and himself lead a crusade in Great Britain to obtain from the electors of that Parliament, in whose trustworthiness and inherent goodness he has expressed so much confidence, the alleged rights which the eloquence of the representatives of Ireland in that Parliament have been unable to obtain for her?

It will be impossible for us to acquire a reputation for 'business aptitude, and for the despatch of public business in a proper >vay, unless the expression of the individual -.njws of honourable members on various questions which come up for discussion are regulated by some standard, and limited in some manner. I am glad to say that my late honourable colleague, the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who practically represented the late Government on the Standing Orders Committee, has bestowed considerable attention upon this question. I do not know whether he has brought tlie result of his labours before the Standing Orders Committee. Committee did not think too much of them, and therefore did not adopt my proposals. orable friend's object was to arrive at some method of limiting the length of speeches in this Chamber. Viewing this question entirely apart from its party aspect, I would strongly urge the Government, without waiting for the f u ll consideration of the Standing Orders, to grapple with the difficulty. I admit that one of the obstacles in the way of dealing with the Standing Orders in the course of a busy session arises from the fact that they present innumerable topics for discussion, and must therefore occupy a large amount of valuable time. A t the same time, I consider that the House will continue to occupy an altogether wrong position until a wellthought-out and complete code of Standing Orders is adopted. It is a reflection upon this Parliament that, although over four vears have elapsed since the establishment of the parliamentary government of the Commonwealth, we are still at the mercy of temporary Standing Orders, which, were intended merely to fill up a gap until we could' get into working order and adopt a complete set of Standing Orders adapted to our v I was exposed to considerable ridicule^ because I laid great stress upon this subject, but I have no hesitation in saying as leader of the Opposition what I stated as the head of the late Government, namely, that the business of the Commonwealth Parliament will never be properly considered or despatched until we have a proper set of Standing Orders. It is easy to emplov ridicule in attacking those who are taking up a sensible attitude, and I think [REPRESENTATIVES.] (Formal). that ridicule was never more misapplied than in connection with my endeavour to place in the forefront of the Ministerial programme the question of new Standing Orders. I do not think that any honourable member on this side of the House has occupied the attention of honourable members for more than three hours at any one time this session. I most nearly approached that limit in my speech on the Bonus for Manufactures B ill , which occupied two hours and three-quarters. With that exception, I do not think that any member of the Opposition has occupied more than one hour and a half at any one time. Yes , I did do so; but the ber for Macquarie occupied four hours on one occasion. I understand that my honrent session. That was when the honourable member was speaking .from my notes on the Tariff, and the incident has become ancient history. We were all very excited on the subject of the Tariff, and perhaps we expressed our views at inordinate length. So far as the present session is concerned, I think I may say that the members of the Opposition have not so far abused their rights as members by making speeches of inordinate duration. very frequently. have done what I never did before. I have actually read through the Hansard reports, and I wish to say that I never read a collection of abler speeches in connection with' ordinary topics of legislation than those delivered by honourable members on this side of the House. Their deliverances were pregnant with the most cogent arguments in favour of the views they were advocating, and there was an entire absence of ill-feeling. In fact, I think my honourable friends'had a tendency-to minimize fhe evils of the present Administrarequirements. tion, and the incapacity shown by the Minister of Trade and Customs to understand the measures which he had introduced. I think that my honourable friends carried political generosity to an extreme in the mildness of their criticisms of the Government in connection with the provisions of the CommerceB ill .

When the late Government were in office under the mistaken idea that they were occupying their position subject to a written understanding with some honourable members-that turned out to be a chimerical notion-the y were exposed to speeches from honourable members then sitting on this side of the Chamber, two of which occupied four hours each, or a total of eight hoursthe period which the present Prime Minister very properly allots to the parliamentary day's work. The honourable member for Darling, who, I am sure, has endearedTiimself to all honourable members, especially by the kindness of his references to ""our travelling arrangements, (and the honourable member for Gwydir, who is not so capable of the friendly emotions of human nature, but who has many excellent qualities, delivered speeches on matters of no importance which together occupied nearly nine hours. I do not suppose that during the whole of his public career the ""Vice President of the Executive Council, who supports the dignity of his onerous office with becoming modesty and with a due sense of shame, and who is one of the most brainy among the silent members of Parliament, has consumed so much time as was occupied by the two honourable members referred to in discussing side issues. In fact, their exertions have produced such an unhappy effect upon them that they have since been mentally paralyzed. honourable member for Darling or the honorable member for Gwydir to the cruelty of a five hours' speech ? Irrespective of all these party considerations, and of the question of what sort of men are in office, I say that no Government will ever be able to render a proper account of their trust as leaders in the performance of parliamentary and legislative duty until they adopt some means or other to curtail the abuse of the privilege of speech. I am glad to say that no such abuse has occurred during the reign of the present Administration. That fact is entirely owing to the character for political sagacity and moderation borne by honourable members on this side of the House. They have carried the high traditions of the late Administraoperation of the suggested Standing Order, tion even into the cold shades of Opposition, and the present Government have not been exposed to the strain of speeches of four or five hours in length. I hope the V 975 I do as to the urgency of introducing a complete code of Standing Orders. I do not at all appreciate the marvellous devices which are being sprung upon an astonished Parliament Ly the Standing Orders Committee. I could understand the Committee laying upon the table a set of Standing Orders aimed at speeches of undue length, which have been the curse of all Australian Parliaments; but, as a matter of fact, the Committee have no new proposals to make beyond one of a remarkable character, which has excited the ridicule and contempt of the whole of the Australian people. Where is the inconvenience in forming a quorum if there are twenty-five honourable members within the precincts of the House? It simply imposes on those honourable members who do not happen to be present at the particular moment when the bells are rung, the trouble of walking from one or other of the ante-rooms into the Chamber. If honourable members are in their party rooms, they have merely to walk a few yards in order to make their appearance here. If they are in the billiard-room, the refreshment-room, the writing-room, or the library, the only inconvenience to which they are exposed is that of having to walk a few yards. The Constitution is very clear upon this subject. It declares that, in the absence of legislative provision to the contrary, the attendance of twenty-five"" out of seventy-five members shall be necessary for the transaction of public business. I should be Who would now expose the the last individual in the world to be so unreasonable as to suggest that twenty-five honourable members ought to be in the Chamber every moment that the House is sitting. But in view of the express direction contained in the Constitution. I do say that, if any honourable member draws attention to the fact that the statutory number of members is not present, a quorum should be formed. Why should a novel standing order be proposed to meet the convenience of four or five honourable members who wish to absent themselves from the' proceedings of this Chamber? It strikes me as being one of the most ludicrous efforts at reform of which 1 have ever heard. Instead of drawing the bands tighter, it is actually proposed to make them looser. Under the honourable members might remain for hours outside the Chamber, attending either to their own private business or to public affairs, whilst the House continued to transact the business of the country with only five or six honourable members present, so long as the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees was satisfied that there was a quorum within the precincts of the House. Thus, while five or six honourable members might be in the billiard-room, another five or six in the refreshment-room, a similar number in the library and the party-rooms, and five or six more in the vaults engaging in gymnastic exercises, under this precious Standing Order business could proceed so long as the Speaker was satisfied that a quorum was within the precincts of the building. Is that the sort of reform that we ought to expect from the Government? Surely one of the reasons why excellent work should now be done is to be found in the fact that the Government occupy an invidious position. Here. is a Ministry which, outside of itself, numbers only four or five supporters in its own party. Surely honourable gentlemen in that position might, hope to make up for the ignominy of it by endeavouring to improve the methods of transacting public business. But the onlyemanation of their genius in reference to the opportunity of considering the difficulty conduct of parliamentary business is a suggestion to render the easy life of honourable members still more.easy, by making the transaction of public business in the absence of a quorum equivalent to its transaction in the presence of a quorum. I believe that we shall hear no more of that proposal. It has apparently been buried. If the Government had been in earnest about it they would have submitted that Standing Order by itself, and have brought it into operation without delay. But they felt-and properly so-^that they had made a false step, and that there was only one method of escape from it, namely, by burying this new-fangled idea in 400 or 500 other orders, so that we should, for some time to come, hear no more about it. I say again that if any honourable member upon this side 'of the House occupied four or five hours in delivering a speech as some, honourable members opposite office!-I would heartily applaud the Government if they submitted a Standing Order to put. an end to such an abuse of privilege. No man has a right to occupy such a large share of the public time. I. should not speak so long as I do, but for the fact that I am very frequently absent 1 from the House, and that I do not often occupy its time. I would, however, always Mr Reid. attach a safeguard to the time limit. I would make that limit a thoroughly liberal one, and I would attach to it a provision that, without debate, the question might be put to the House or Committee"" That the honourable member be further heard."" If any honourable member were addressing himself to a subject of large importance and complexity, which called for a speech beyond the usual limits, I am sure that the sense of fairness of the House would immediately allow the Standing Order to be relaxed. We all know that in the warmest conflicts that have taken place in this House, the moment an appeal has been made to the fairness of honourable members, that appeal has never been in vain. With such a safeguard as I have indicated, a time limit might very well be imposed upon speeches. However, the urgency of this matter seems to have disappeared, since my honourable friends have gone over to the other side of the Chamber. BeforeI conclude my remarks, there is one matter to which I wish to refer, because since I last addressed myself to it, I have had an whicli was then presented to me by, the Prime Minister. I refer to the settlement of the trouble connected with the Federal Capital. I had never previously, considered the difficulty as to whether it was within our power to pass a measure which would give the High Court an opportunity of settling such questions as those involved, by means of some friendly arrangement. Of course, I do not pretend to express any very weighty opinion, because I recognise that there are members in this House who have studied constitutional, matters much more thoroughly than I have done. Nevertheless, I have taken an opportunity of referring to our Constitution upon this subject, and I should like to express the opinion at which I have arrived in reference to the powers which we, by legislation, can confer upon the High Court. I am sorry to see in the newspapers a statement by the Predid when I was in mier of New South Wales to the effect that he considers that a recent communication from the Prime Minister frustrates the hope of a peaceful settlement of these difficulties. that is due to mv entertaining a different view of the law from himself. pondence will be made public.",46,Immigrati On Restriction Act Cus

I am still of that opinion, and I have offered to take action in the matter. . 1 hear the Prime Minister's statement. I do not think that I could add any weight to the learned advice ""that he Has received, but having carefully considered the section in the Constitution which relates to the Seat of Government, I have come to the conclusion that no real difficulty should be experienced in the way of an appeal to the High Court. Of course there is the technical view that the ordinary working of the machinery of that tribunal is by means of litigation and contest; but I do not think that I am expressing a very strange opinion when I say that its higher function is to settle any matter connected with the Constitution which involves a difficulty of interpretation, or in respect of which there is a conflict of judgment, as between the Commonwealth and the States. What possible objection can there be when the two parties interested agree to invite a friendly decision by this judicial tribunal? It would be only the most technical and lawyer-like mind which couldi imagine difficulties in the way of such a Bill being passed as the Pirime Minister suggests. If the Premier of New South Wales does not entertain the overtures which, I understand, the Prime Minister has made, to the effect that some such measure should be passed in order to enable this vexed question to be referred to the High Court, I shall be profoundly disappointed. I think that our experience in reference to matters of conflict between the Commonwealth and the States is sufficiently painful to compel us to adopt the most amicable and peaceful method of settling in every case the question in dispute. I can conceive of no more fair method of deciding the question in dispute in reference to the Seat of Government than that of an agreement between the parties to I am very much opthe dispute to submit a special case to the High!

It might be met by an agreement to regard the Act in a certain light, but the initial difficulty which attends the driving of a peg in New South Wales territory is that we can drive a stake to determine the site of the Capital only within territory which has been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. on that point by driving the stake. State would accept that act as being sufficient to bring the matter before the High Court. I am not at all concerned with the mere formal method of bringing the question before the Court, for there should be no difficulty in regard to it. My difficulty in reference to the proposal to drive a stake is that, under the Constitution, the determination of the site of the Capital hinges upon a prior consideration-the acquisition by the Commonwealth either by grant or purchase, of a territory. Until we have a territory we cannot have a sits for the Capital. the first question to come before the High Court. stitution provides thatThe seat of the Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament-",48,Immigrati On Restriction Act Cus

The Constitution declares that the Seat of Government shall be determined by the Commonwealth Parliament, and it then goes on to deal with a matter regarding which the Federal Government is not supreme, unless it exercises certain powers under the Property Acquisition Act. The grant can come only from the Government of New South Wales. The word "" grant "" implies the giving of land by the owner, which', in this case, is New South Wales. The Commonwealth can acquire the land only by mutual arrangement or by the exercise of statutory powers. There appears to be no chance of a mutual arrangement being .arrived at, because, I understand, South Wales objects to the selection of Dalgety. The next point is that, since a mutual arrangement is impossible, New South Wales must either grant, or we must acquire, under our own statute, the territory within which we propose to establish the Federal Capital. So far as this point is concerned, I think that New South Wales would be successful before the High Court.

203,Mr Deakin,"He will be here preattention of the Government the question of the valuation of harvesters. My desire is to avoid the introduction of any sort of party feeling, and to deal with this case from the highest possible stand-point. I am sure that it is to the interest of any Government to inspire in the minds of the community a feeling that, whatever its fiscal views may be, it is anxious honestly to administer the Tariff, and to act just as fairly to importers as to any one else. It is to the interests of any Government to show that the Department of Trade and Customs, in its administration of Statute law, knows no bias-that the rights of every man, no matter how humble or inoffensive he may be, are fairly considered. I strongly -urge the Prime Minister Io recall the facts of this case. If any one had told me that in Australia an interested party could walk into the Customs House, and cause to be altered the decision of the. Department, which had been established by a previous Minister, after inquiries had been conducted in Canada, South America, and South Australia, I should have hesitated to believe it. I thoroughly admire the enterprise of the McKays, in connection with the Sunshine harvesters. I do not wish to associate myself with any unfriendliness to a firm which, I think, has shown a marvellous amount of invention and enterprise. I look upon a man who invents an improved method that. An Australian firm was using the invention long before the McKays used it. as much pirating of inventions as any firm in the world has done. used the same principle years ago. deserved praise, neither do I desire to do injustice. I can speak only according to my own knowledge and belief. I do not know of the pirating referred to. If there has been any, I have no sympathy with it. to. say that the firm has pirated. guilty of piracy until it has been proved against him. My impression of the McKays is a most favorable one, and I regard their business as a grand Australian industry, which I do not wish to see crippled. But it is a matter of serious concern to the public that an Australian manufacturer, however estimable, has been allowedto go i|nto the Customs House, and cause the decision of a previous Minister, come to after a full inquiry and the most careful consideration of all the facts available, to Le altered without an opportunity being given, to the firm prejudicially affected thereby to answer the representations made by him. made until the officers of the Department had advised: that it should be made. for the officers of our public departments. My own antecedents, as a one-time public servant, cause me to feel greaf respect foE the public servants of Australia, and I have not a word to say against them. But they are only human, like the rest of us. The point I am making is that the books of the Massey-Harris Company were closely investigated by one of the highest officers in the Customs Department of Canada, the investigation concerning not only the profits and quotations of the particular machines imported into Australia, but the basis of cost and profit applied to all the firm's manufactures, and the result was a certificate to the honesty of the firm's valuations. toms Department had suspected for years that those machines were being undervalued for Customs purposes. It was no sudden suspicion. a public officer making one recommendation to one Minister, and another recommendation to another Minister only two months later. available then. decision within two months, he would be asked to give the reason, and I think that the officers of the Department should explain why they altered their recommendation in this case. At first they stated that £ 3 8 ios. was a fair valuation. I do not think it is right not prove that the machines were worthmore. after the Customs Department of Canada had assisted the Commonwealth Government in the investigation to which I have referred, Let me put the case without referring to the Sunshine harvester, or any ' particular article of manufacture.

But the Government did not stop at that. They were not satisfied with the information received from Canada, and they telegraphed, through the Governor General, to Buenos Ayres, whence they obtained confirmatory opinions from the -British Consul. Then they investigated the books of Messrs. Clutterbuck, at Adelaide, to whom for many years the Massey-Harris people had been selling their machines. The honourable member for Gippsland exhausted every means of information available in Canada, South America, and South Australia, and was satisfied with the recommendation of his officers that the valuations of the importing firm were correct. A change of Government occurred, however, and on the representations of a rival manufacturer, who said that he had received a. letter from a man in Italy, the same officers without referring the matter to the firm whose actions the statement of this interested person, and a new Minister brought into operation a section of the Customs Act which prevents them from going into open Court to prove their innocence. a monstrous state of things. on the part of the' Department does not inspire confidence. Of course, Ministers are responsible for the actions of their officers, but I am putting the blame on the officers of the Department to meet the interjection to which I am replying. the thorough investigation to which I have referred, the officers of the Department reversed their original recommendation, because of the representation of an interested business rival to the firm affected. free-trader like the honourable member for North Sydney had been Minister of Trade and Customs, and, on representations made by an importer behind the back of an Australian manufacturer, had reversed the decision of a protectionist predecessor, come to after thorough inquiry, Lringin -; into operation a section of the Customs Act, preventing that manufacturer from vindicating 'himself, the country would have rung with justifiable indignation.

The books of the of the country we must not be biased by personal feeling. We desire that the highest standard of administration shall be set. If the protectionists wish to increase the duty on harvesters, there is an honourable and honest way to do so. This method of acting unjustly to an importer cannot commend itself to those who are anxious for the maintenance of the purity of our Departmental administration. The Minister of Trade and Customs has made a statement to this House on the subject which 'has placed a different complexion upon it, and we on this side said at the time, "" T h a t is a very fair proposition."" So long as the right thing is done, we do not wish to make too much of any little error that may have been committed in doing it.

But it is beneath the dignity of the Commonwealth to keep them in their present position longer than is absolutely necessary. the remotest intercourse with any member of the firm. nor do I wish to know them. Information has been conveyed to me that the Massey-Harris Company invited the Government to send an officer to Adelaide to inspect the books of Messrs. Clutterbuck, who buy these machines from them. Customs officer was despatched to Adelaide and was afforded an opportunity to go through the books of the firm there. I am given to understand that he found that the Massey-Harris Company, who import the harvesters in Melbourne at a Customs valuation of £38 ios., absolutely sell them to Messrs. Clutterbuck in Adelaide at £40 each. Now, this firm might have had an opportunity of compromising this matter. I do not wish to break confidence too far, but I believe that if they had chosen to confess themselves guilty, by consenting to a compromise, they could have done so; but they very naturally-and I think very honorably-declined to arrive at any compromise. They refused to accept a proposal that the valuation for duty purposes should be reduced by £10, that is to say, from £65 r o £55That offer was made to them by the Customs authorities some few days ago. I do not suggest that the offer was conveyed officially or formally, but it was made to the Massey-Harris Company through their solicitor. In the course of an interview which that gentleman had with the Comptroller-General, it was put to him in this way, ""What about making the value £55 ? "" That would bring the valuation down by £10. The solicitor, I think very fairly and honestly, absolutely refused to accept any compromise with regard to the valuation of the article.

Sworn in* voices, covering several years' exportations of harvesters to Buenos Ayres, have been Mr Reid. sent out from Toronto, in Canada. I have the invoices, which were handed to me, not by the Massey-Harris Company, but by an honourable member of this House. The notarial certificate-the sworn declarationI have never seen or had identifies every one of the invoices, which show that in the early stages of the export I do not know them, business, the value of the harvesters was a little higher than at present. Some invoices for 1902 show that the value placed on the machines was $240, which, roughly speaking, would be equivalent to about £ 4 8 . That was at a time when the busiA ness was in its infancy, and orders were limited. There are other invoices, covering the last two years, and dating from 22nd August, 1903, onwards, which show that the price at which the harvesters have been delivered in Buenos Ayres by the MassevHarris Company is $225, or about £ 4 5 . I understand that these sales were on credit, instead of for cash. The $225 is the f.o.b. price, and that seems to have been the rule throughout the two years. I do not wish' to attribute any intentional mis-statements to misinformed. But it is strange that a man who ought to have known the facts so well should have been so misled. According to his sworn evidence, the value of these machines delivered in Buenos Ayres was £ 6 0 , or £ 1 5 over and above the value given in the sworn invoices covering a period of two years. I wish to put fhe matter in the fairest way willing to assume that he was deceived. The facts, however, only tend to show how dangerous it is for the Customs Department to rush to conclusions merely on the strength of statements made by interested persons. The Customs authorities were ready to take action on produce to them in respect to the price of harvesterstsent to Italy. It now transpires that the quotation given in the case referred to was for a single harvester, which was ordered through the London agent of the Massey-Harris Company. The machine Massey-Harris Company therefore had to bear transhipment charges. promise he made to the House, that the Massey-Harris Company should have an opportunity to appeal against his decision.

I now wish to say one or two words with reference to a paragraph which appears in this morning's newspapers, to the effect that the views expressed by the leader of the Labour P.arty, and also, I believe, endorsed by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, in favour of an amendment of the contract section of the Immigration Restriction deliberately. The fact is that he made tion Act, are not shared by all the members of the Labour Party; that, in fact, if the members of that party are not equally divided upon the subject, a considerable number of them are opposed to any alteration of the section. I should be very sorry to think that the statement is true, because matter of vital importance to us. It is of immediately the leader of the Labour Party announced his readiness to have the Act amended I hastened to express my gratification, and to assure the Government that the Opposition would be only too glad to help them to amend the Act. I hope that, whatever may be the state of feeling in the Labour Party, the Government will have the courage to carry out their announced intention. It has been declared that the Government propose to amend the section, and that they are only delaying their proposals until they can be carefully drafted-it is alleged that a great deal of difficulty will be experienced in the drafting-and embodied in their immigration policy. I only wish to say, by way of an antidote to the statement contained in the press-if such an antidote be necesorder to drive back to their own land our sary-that , supposing the members of the Labour Party show any opposition to this portion of the Government programme, there will be no sort of ehendeavour on the part of the .Opposition to embarrass the Government by withthink is necessary, let us stipulate all sorts drawing support from them. No matter what difficulty the Government may be confronted with in respect of their friends and supporters in their praiseworthy endeavour to amend the section, I think I may promise, on. behalf of the whole of the members of the Opposition, a loyal and solid support, irrespective of party temptations or party advantage. I cannot help feeling that, apart from any question of immigration, or of adding to our population, we cannot, except by an amendment of the Act, dispose of the slanders upon the Commonwealth, in many cases absolutely untrue, ill-founded, and malicious, and in some instances sent from Australia by Australians. is that many of them are fabricated in Australia, and are made to impose on the ignorance of English journalists. for Oxley is not altogether guiltless. honourable member will imagine for a moment that he made the misstatement in quesa mistake in regard to the law, just as Full Courts sometimes do. Nobody would accuse him of being actuated by any malicious motive. I am very anxious ""that we shall establish friendly relations with the people of the mother country. That is a no use attempting to dispel slanders upon Australia when, upon the face of our own laws, this charge can be truthfully levelled against us-that if an Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman endeavours to come here as an honest working man-no t as a loafer -and for that purpose enters into an honest business engagement at the Australian rate of wages, he can be sent to gaol for six months, and the only way in which he can escape that penalty is by finding two sureties, who will guarantee that he shall be transported from the shores of Australia. What a mockery such a condition of things is upon the word "" transportation "" I It is.a word that we have always associated with the criminal class, but Australia has invented a new kind of transportation in fellow-countrymen, whose only offence i i that they have an honest job ahead of them. The Labour Party may well wish to help us to remove that stigma. Let us surround the provision as carefully as we of safeguards, let us provide that any agreement which! is deceptive as to the ordinary rates of wages obtaining here shall be torn up by the nearest magistrate: but when we have safeguarded our law in that respect, do not let us lay the hand of the policeman upon an honest fellow-countryman.

The law provides that an Englishman, who is a manual labourer, shall be a prohibited immigrant if he comes here under contract, and that he shall be liable to six months' imprisonment. The honourable member's justification for that law is that nobody has attempted to get into gaol. What man will come to Australia from the old country while such a law operates?

We may keep our gaols for aliens if we choose, but we have no right to open the doors of our prisons to honest British subjects, whose only offence is that they come here, not to loaf on the people of Australia, but to do honest work.

The wretched pretence that there is a difference between these two classes of contracts because, in the one case, ment. Instead of doing so, they returned they are made in Australia, while in the other they relate to men who come from the mother country under agreement to work in Australia, instead of entering into a contract when they reach here, is one of those shallow subterfuges which show the extremities to which my honourable friends of the Labour Party are driven. I am quite familiar with the interjections that have been made while I have been dealing with this question. When I went all over Australia, denouncing the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act, I was met -with precisely the same ejaculations from various suspicious characters in different parts of the halls in which I spoke. It was quite a common thing to hear such interjections as "" Why, they are bondsmen,"" ""They are chattels,"" or ""They are slaves."" I say, with all respect, probably just as respectable, and as honest, as is any member of the Labour Party, or of any other party in this House. In my opinion, so long as this law exists, we are justly exposed to truthful, honest, well-founded accusations that, by our laws, we are treating our fellow countrymen in England, Ireland, and Scotland as other nations treat aliens. I suppose that is a fair statement to make. We have been told that the laws of Canada shut out men under contract. That is again only half a truth. Canada does not shut out a single emigrant from England. Ireland, or Scotland; she does not by any such law exclude a. single subject of King Edward. Some of our honourable friends feel hurt because the people of England say unkind things about Australia, Australian laws, and Australian Parliaments; If honourable membut, so long as this law remains on our statute-book, the English people are entitled 'to refer to it in terms of the strongest reprobation. honourable member seek to amend the Act when he was in office? many men of the stamp of the honourable member in the' House There was no chance of amending the law while I was in office. gentleman did not try to do so. of Australia to return to this House sensible men, who would pass such an amendother men in large numbers.

Speaking for himself, that honourable member said, quite recently, "" Oh, it has been a very unfortunate piece of business. We do not want to shut out honest working men, coming from the old country.

The honourable member did not profess to speak for his party; but I am very happy to think that at the next election I shall have his support in my endeavours to secure the return of men who arc prepared to amend this law. With reference to the proposal of the Government to submit a comprehensive scheme for the promotion of immigration, I have only to say that any well-considered proposal with that object in view will receive the support of nearly all, if not every one, of the members of the Opposition. The matter is one of great importance to Australia; but the mere promise to encourage immigration will be of no avail. I hope to see the Government, in a very short time, submit their immigration policy. that they will find that they have a number of friends on this side of the House. Whatever the attitude of honourable members sitting below the p-angway may be, I can safely say that, if the Government seek to pass measures designed to promote immigration, the Opposition will set aside what they think are well-founded grievances, and support them. The Government are in power. We feel that we cannot shift them, and while they remain in office we are anxious to assist them to carry out any useful work of which we approve. When they take this step they will learn who are their best friends in the House. In view of the contract which has been entered into by the Government of New South Wales, I hope that the Government will make some statement with reference to the Manufactures Encouragement, B ill . right honourable member not to discuss the Manufactures Encouragement B ill . order by referring to the contract which has just ""been entered into between the Government of New South Wales and Mr Sandford. I may express my very great pleasure that Air. Sandford, instead of the syndicate of which we have heard, is to have an opportunity to carry out this great work. As a resident of New South Wales, I heartily approve of the which the Government of that State has made with him. One grand feature of the contract is that it will save the Commonwealth a/n expenditure of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , which it can ill-afford to make. The arrangement made with Mr Sandford by the Government of New South! Wales will cover abour ^500.000 worth of material. Sir WILLIAM LYNE T h a t will be approximately the value of the manufactured article. that under the contract they, will pay only 6.7 per cent, more than they would have to pay for the imported article. That means, at the most, about ^ 3 5 , 0 0 0 on the total expenditure of ,£500,000,. and this increased expenditure will be borne cheerfully by the people of New South Wales. I think that the House mav congratulate itself that, as the result of this agreement, we are placed in such a position that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill may well find its way under the table. When they do so, I think It is time some statement was made to the House with reference to the intentions of the Government in this regard Has the Treasurer provided in this year's Estimates for the £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 proposed to be expended under that Bill? made in the Bil l itself for the expenditure. made in a B ill , the Treasurer usually makes some explanation in regard to it, but I do not think the right honourable gentleman referred to it in the course of his Budget statement.

The information which I obtained in regard, to the point in. dispute was that these machines were valued there at £ 4 1 when they crossed the border, but in a report which I received, it was pointed out that too much importance could not be attached to that fact, inasmuch as there was no duty to be paid, and the valuation was merely a fanciful one. That may, or may not, be correct. voices quoted by the leader of the Opposition related to actual sales. Sir WILLTAM.

I have not gone into that calculation, but I am familiar with what Mr are arrangements whereby manufacturers, McKay said when before the Commission as to the value and the price of the MasseyHarris machines. The rieht honourable member for East Sydney stated that I promised the House that I would, allow the firm concerned to commence proceedings against the Government in a court of law. Whilst he was speaking, I turned to the Hansard reporfi of mv speech on the occasion in question, and found that what I said was as follows: I may say at once that if the Massey-Harris Company have any reliable facts or data to bring before me, I should like to have them submitted for my consideration. If they then commenced proceedings against the Government, I should be very much disposed not to place any impediment in their way, but to give them every facility. I cannot say anything fairer than that. My only desire is that there shall be a true valuation for the purposes of the Customs, and to see that fair play is meted out to all. A few weeks afterwards the MasseyHarris people, with their solicitor, waited on me, and showed me certain documents, which I asked them to leave. They preferred not to do that, but said that they would send copies. After a week or two, or perhaps longer, I received those copies, and then took action, with a view to finding out a little more than was disclosed on the papers. difference between the freight charges put down by the Massey-Harris people for the carriage of their harvesters from New York to Australia, and the freight charges paid by McKay to send his harvesters from Australia to South America, the amount in one case being about £ 7 or £ 7 ios., and in the other about 30s. could not be sent from Melbourne to Sydney for 30s. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am' speaking from memory, but the amounts were practhe intically what I have mentioned. In explanation, I was informed by the representative of the Massey-Harris Company that the Sunshine harvesters were packed differently from the way in which their harvesters were packed, and therefore cost less to transport, but I have not had a sufficient explanation of the difference. easy to find out the actual freight charged, by ascertaining the measurement. with the transport of goods from the interior of America to the seaboard, there railway companies, and agents all gain certain pickings. An article is ordered at a very low price, and excessive freights are charged for sending it by rail or other conveyance to the seaboard', part of which is returned to the manufacturer. At the port of export-the f.o.b. port-thes e charges, are deducted, and the Customs valuation is made on the price, less that deduction.

The last Government dealt with it. control of the Customs Department, the country was losing from £30,000 to £40,000 a year in the way I have described, and I made a regulation providing that the Customs valuation should be the f.o.b. price at the port of export with all charges added, instead of the f.o.b. price with a deduction of the charges for transport between the place of manufacture and the port of export. to all imports?

He tells me that three years ago only forty or forty-one harvesters were imported into and sold in South Australia by the Massey-Harris Company; that two years ago the importation had increased to seventy or eighty machines; and that last year no fewer than 450 or 470 were imported; and of course the manufacture of a like number in Australia prevented. surely would not use the Customs regulathe result of my action has been, not to tions to alter the Tariff? . right honourable gentleman will acquit me of light thrown on the whole subject is the having attempted to do anything of the reason why harvesters can now be bought kind.

I shall not debate that question at the present stage, but I do not think that his statement is correct. ThenI take strong, exception to an interjection which was made by the honourable member for Gwydir. deliberately-and he adhered to his statement, despite the fact that it was contradicted-that when the honourable and learned member for Corinella proposed, and I seconded, a motion, at a meeting of the Standing Orders Committee, in favour of limiting the speeches of honourable members, we were members of the late Government. I have here the minutes of the meetings of that Committee. I find that notice of the motion in question was given on 17th August last. The present Government came into office upon 7th July. I learn from the records that the honourable and learned member for Corinella movedThat this Committee is of opinion that some method of limitation of debate should be provided in the Standing Orders. That was on the 17th August, some time after he had vacated office. August the following statement appears in the minutes of proceedings of the Committee :the purpose of limiting debate, the Committee deliberated. The Committee took no action in the matter. there was a generally expressed opinion that it would not prove as time-saving in operation as was anticipated. It was recognised that discussion might be prolonged in other ways, and one member of the Committee declared that he did not approve of the adoption of these arbitrary means to curtail debate, because they usually defeated their own ends. that, at best, the proposal would only have a moral effect. so. As a result, it was decided to take no further action. In the light of this evidence, the honourable member for Gwydir must see that his statement was made without knowledge. whilst he was a member of the late Government, intended to take action, if he did not actually do so. [101] orable member is now declaring what were our intentions. Does he mean to say that two members of the Standing Orders Committee who are members of the Opposition supported a proposal which was intended to shorten the proceedings of Parliament He stated whilst another Ministry was in office, for the benefit of a Government which had ceased to exist? The honourable member adhered to his statement, which should have been withdrawn immediately it was denied. I maintain that members of the Opposition have shown quite as much desire as have the Government to legitimately curtail debate. The honourable member for Laanecoorie also alluded to an attempt which From these was made last night to count out the House, as if similar tactics had not been frequently-and upon two occasions successfully-resorte d to during the term of office of the previous Government. Yet he expressed abhorrence and surprise that anything of the sort should have been attempted. I should not have risen had he not made an attack upon the Opposition which was altogether unjustifiable. Coming to the question of the valuation of On 24th harvesters for the purposes of the Customs, I would point out that the Minister has clearly indicated that he has allowed himself to be influenced by certain matters to which he should really give no consideration. He stated! that he found that the sale of imported harvesters in South) Australia had largely increased. that it is a sign of increasing cultivation. The fact that there has been an increase in the sale of these machines in South Australia should' not influence the honourable gentleman in dealing with this question.

370,Mr Dugaldthomson,"I believe that the Minister must recognise that charged as he is with the duty of protecting the revenue, and of seeing that trade is honestly conducted, he ought to institute legal proceedings against any firm, which, in his opinion, has been defrauding the Customs. This firm certainly has been doing so, if the valuation of £ 6 5 is the true one. If such proceedings are not to be taken the opportunity of having the question settled in a court of law should be given the importers. the impression that he had already promised to give the firm in question an opportunity to test the correctness of his decision. When he says, in effect, to them "" I am not prepared to punish you, as I ought to do, if , as I allege, you have bean under-valuing your imports,"" he ought also to say, "" I am prepared to give you an opportunity to show that I am wrong, and if you prove your case, I shall i.evise the valuation."" stated that certain firms in the United States and Canada were over-estimating the railway and steam-boat charges from the place of manufacture to the port of shipment. I quite agree that under the old practice, there was a great danger of that being done. For some reason or other the practice was adopted of accepting as the basis of valuation the rates ruling for goods at a particular market in the country of . manufacture, regardless of whether that market was on the coastline or in the centre of a large continent. opening was given for fraud-for the un'due inflation of railway charges, and the consequent reduction of the cost 'at factory. I quite agree that the new system is one that ought to have been adopted from the first, and that the f.o.b. price at the port »f export should be accepted. I think the Minister said that he was satisfied that there was a great deal of under-valuing taking place in connection with exports from America. Sir WILT .

If fraud has been --committed in this direction, it may be desirable for the Minister to consider the advisability of resorting to this system in the United States. I wish now to allude briefly to the present system of rating telephones. This is a matter to which I have previously 'drawn the attention of Ministers, and I was under the impression that it was to receive consideration. There are some regulations in force which do not fit the conditions to which they apply. If twenty-five applications to I was under be connected with the telephone service are received at the one time from a suburb which may have suddenly sprung into existence, a charge of only £ 5 per annum is made i(n respect of each subscriber, but in a suburb where there may be 100 subscribers who have applied at different times to be connected, a charge of £ 6 per annum may be made. In another case we have the strange anomaly that in a thickly-populated suburb which may be regarded as The honourable gentleman part of the city itself, and where there are perhaps 100 or 200 subscribers beyond the mile limit, a charge of £ 6 per annum is made, whilst those living in a suburb fourteen or fifteen miles away from the central exchange-san d where the cost of making the connection is consequently much greater-hav e to pay only £5 P e r annum, although there may not be more than twenty-five or thirty subscribers there. The regulations simply take into account the distance from the centre, and not the density of subscribers. I In this way, an should not have alluded to this matter, but for the fact that a promise has been made on more than one occasion, that it will receive consideration. I understood from the late Postmaster-General that these regulations were about to be revised. I do not attach any blame to the present Minister, because I know that he has not been long in office,, and could not reasonably be expected to have already attended to all these matters; but I think it necessary that the Telephone Department, which is a business one, should have its regulations framed T h a t is so. upon business lines.

If the Federal Capital is placed in a dis-. trict away from the main line, all mails will be at least half a day longer in transit each way, which would be a great objection in these days of quickness of travelling and rapidity of communication. I should have been willing to see the Constitution amended, so that a site might be chosen anywhere within the mother State. the country within 100 miles of Sydney had been made available, the Federal Parliament would long since have chosen a suitable site, and we should now be meeting in a Parliament House belonging to the Commonwealth. meets in the Federal Capital, the New South Wales representatives will gain a great advantage, because they will have much less travelling to do, while the Victorian representatives, who so strongly objected to expenses being granted to members, will find that the cost of living, when one has to spend part of at least four days everv week in travelling, is considerable. allowance given to us under the Constitution may be sufficient for a member who resides in Melbourne, it is altogether too little to a representative coming from another State.

He has also assured me that The honourable he had no intention to make a bitter attack on the honourable member for Laanecoorie.

I do not defend attempts to defraud, and should like to see such attempts punished. When this Parliament the Postmaster-General, in common with most honourable members, recognises the important part which telephones play in connection with the development of our territory, and I therefore ask him to consider the advisability of bringing more prominently under the notice of the public the means 'provided for their convenience.
