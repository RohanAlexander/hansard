Major Kyngdon to be officer commanding R.A.A., Queensland. Major Hawker, now in New South Wales, to be officer commanding at Thursday Island. God help the men at Thursday Island if Major Hawker is sent there. I ask the Ministeri f the statement which I have read is correct? As the Government has declared itself to be in favour of defending the country by means of citizen soldiery, is it not intended to give our militia officers an opportunity to show what they can do in some of these positions? At least one of them must be fit for promotion of this kind, as he is now acting in a very important position. Will the Minister give the militia officers a chance to secure promotion to these posts, in order to prove to the people of the Commonwealth that we desire to encourage service in the militia? parently the expert officers belonging to the Military Board do not wish to leave their present positions, so that they would not be injured by the promotion of a militia officer. a considerable amount of information to taken of the information. me.

No honourable member has approached me with a request for an adjournment, and I certainly do not intend to propose one myself. ister willing to agree to a proposal to adjourn over to-morrow ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -That depends upon whether the proposal is made under conditions that I can accept. The Government will not move that the House adjourn over to-morrow unless certain conditions are complied with. I quite agree with the honourable member for Riverina that when an understanding is arrived at between the leaders of parties, that the House shall not sit on Friday, the earliest been declared void by the Court of possible intimation of the fact should be made to honourable members. As far as I am concerned, that intimation will be given. the Treasurer whether he can give the House the date upon which we may expect him to deliver his Budget speech? that I cannot yet fix the exact day, but I will do so as soon as possible. I think it will be about the middle of next month. to ask whether the Treasurer is aware that some of the States Treasurers are unable to make their financial arrangements pending the delivery of his Budget statement, and also whether he can inform the House why his Budget is to be delayed this year? According to his present forecast, it will be made more than a fortnight later than it was made last year. the honourable member that it would be very gratifying to me if I could lay the Budget papers and the Estimates upon the table of . the House at an earlier period than I have indicated. But a variety of circumstances will prevent my doing so. The illness of the Prime Minister is amongst them. Many matters of policy have to be dealt with, and his unfortunate illness is responsible for some delay. Minister settle those matters? important to be dealt with, save by the head of the Government.

My experience is that it entirely depends upon the circumstances attending the voiding of an election as to whether or not the Government interfere. I know that that was the course adopted upon several occasions in New South Wales, and I take it that when the Prime Minister considers this matter he will probably act in the same way. Of course, there may be circumstances under which the Government may be called upon to defray the expenses of the candidates. opportunity of discussing the question upon a future occasion.",16,Friday Sitting

43,Mr Tilley Brown,"I shall take an-Acting Prime Minister whether, when deciding the question to which the honourable member for Indi has directed attention, he ""will take into consideration the claim of the widow of the lace Mr Crosby, with a -view to seeing that she is at least paid the allowance to which her late husband would .have been entitled, had it not been for the bungling of our electoral officers? Sir WILLIA M LYNE I do not know whether any legal claim exists in thac particular case. If there be no such claim, the matter will have to be decided by the -Cabinet. Consequently I am unable to .give the honourable member an answer to his question immediately. that the case may be considered when the other cases are under review. ' Sir WILLIA M LYNE -It will be considered by the Cabinet, though it is not exin the metropolitan centres will be undertaken? actly in the same category as the other -cases to which reference has been made. Acting Prime Minister has not understood the full import of my question. I wish, briefly, to put the actual position before him, and to conclude by asking a question. It is a well-known' fact that had it not been for the mistakes committed by electoral officers in South Australia, the late Mr Crosby would have been declared -elected as a senator. Had that declaration oeen made, he would have been entitled to a certain parliamentary allowance up to the time of his death. I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will -consider the claim of his widow to that allowance, as well as her claim to his elecin possession of the information which he tion expenses. To my mind, she has an infinitely stronger claim to consideration than anomalies in the telephone charges in liad those candidates who were reimbursed their expenses, because their elections were voided by reason of errors on the part of our electoral officers. Prime Minister inquire into the case with a view to seeing whether Mrs. Crosby is not entitled to the consideration which I . -suggest ? the honourable member's question, I may -say that I am not aware that any claim has been made by the 'widow of the late Mr tained with the remainder of the Adelaide netCrosbyPerhaps the honourable member is. In the absence of any claim, what can the -Government do? Estimates for the payment of the amount. JNO claim was made in the other case. T Sir WILLIA M LYNE I do not know what course was adopted in that case, but if a claim is made, and the amount claimed is brought under the notice of the Government, the matter will be considered. It is utterly impossible for me to say that it will be allowed, when I am not aware of the whole of the circumstances. Honourable members, however, may trust me to be sympathetic so far as the claim of this lady is concerned, although I must first of all ascertain what is the amount at issue. 5th July, the honourable member for Perth asked the following questionCan the Postmaster-General say when the undergrounding of telegraph and telephone wires I have now obtained the following replyIt will be seen from the reports that the delay is due to the desire of the Department to use conduits made in Western Australian Pottery Works. The experience in Western Australia is not isolated; it has been found in other States that the first efforts to make conduits suitable for use in underground telephone construction have not been very successful, but after a few preliminary trials, the initial difficulties have generally been overcome; it is hoped that this will be the case in Western Australia. the Postmaster-General whether he is yet promised to obtain yesterday regarding South Australia? receipt of the information which the honWill the Acting orable member seeks.

But I do not mind what the honourable member says. orable member is deliberately misleading the House. heard the honourable member in this House and the State Parliament of New South Wales on many occasions during the last fifteen or sixteen years, and know that he always sings the same song. I am simply giving the facts of the case. I supplied to me by the officers of the Department as facts. the honourable member makes of the information that I complain of. orable member states that these centres are in all the States; and in consequence of that statement, which was made last month, I have obtained some information. I find that in Tasmania and Western Australia the system is not followed. Adelaide there is one case, though it is not that of a fictitious centre, but simply an arrangement made under the authority of Sir Charles Todd in 1899, in connection with the Semaphore. that there was one fictitious centre before Federation; in Melbourne there were two before Federation, and in Sydney there were ten before Federation. when Sydney has more cases than all the other States, put together, for the honourable member to try to make us believe that the practice was common throughout the Commonwealth. I admit that there are anomalies in the telephone system. I remember the scream which the honourable member made when I introduced the toll system, and how he prophesied disaster; but he does not say anything about that system now. 1 COOK The honourable orable member. is making an entirely misleading statement. Everyhonorable member (knows the obloquy that was thrown upon me when I introduced the toll system. No doubt the system has introduced ,so)me anomalies; and I agree that all subscribers should be on the one footing.

But the Postmaster-General could lead us a long way. The other day, however, when I applied for an extension of my line from the wall to my table, I was told that I could not have it without changing from the flat rate to the toll system. Before the Minister extends the toll system, I hope that he will give the House an opportunity to discuss his proposals, and will lay before us exact figures showing the cost of administering the telephone service, and the returns obtained, so that we may know what changes are desirable from the taxpayers' point of view. The toll system is a fair one, and the flat rate system is infamous, so that I hope the Postmaster-General will do what he can to bring every subscriber under the toll system. vice given to the Grand Hotel, Melbourne, used to cost twice as much as the subscription, and the continual use of the telerjhone was a nuisance to the Department.

[3.47] I think that the Postmaster-General should be the very last person in the world to take exception to statements made by honourable members upon this side of the House, especially in view of what has occurred during the past two days. I complain of the statements which the honourable gentleman has made to-day. How he can endeavour to put into the mouths of honourable members statements which are absolutely unwarranted passes my comprehension. To-day, he declared that I had been ""screaming against the toll system."" I do not recollect that I have ever criticised be called upon to pay ^ 5 and £ 8 per that system. I have always been in favour of a reasonable toll system. His statement in that connection is one for which there is not a tittle of foundation. He also affirmed that I am opposed to a reduction in the telephone rates. I have made no such statement. The whole gravamen of my complaint is that the Postmaster-General is raising those rates, and is doing it in an underhand and foolish way. eost me half what it used to. friend must not think that his case is a typical one. I am pointing out anomalies which exist. So far from desiring to increase rates, the Postmaster-General knows very well that I was the first Minister in Australia to reduce them. charge in New South Wales from £ 1 2 to £ 5 per annum, and the rest of the States copied my example. I was the first to attack the old rates. The Postmaster General is well aware of that, because it is a matter of common knowledge. WhatI did say to-day was that, side by side with a decrease of the rates, there should be a strict maintenance of the efficiency of the service. I declared that the cutting down of the rates should form no excuse for an inefficient service, otherwise we should be taking away with one hand what we gave with the other. I repeat that there has not been an increase in the efficiency of the sendee side by side with the cutting down of the rates. The [34]2 Postmaster-General has said that I wish subscribers who are 5 miles from a centre to pay only the same fee as those who reside close to that centre. That is not the case. .Centres containing 250 subscribers, who are resident 4 miles from the central exchange, are to-day paying ^ 3 per annum more than is paid by small groups who are 4 miles further from that exchange. That is the effect which has been produced by the abolition of the fictitious centres of which the honourable gentleman has spoken. These fictitious centres represent a reasonable solution of a very troublesome difficulty. The arrangement in respect of them had worked smoothly for years. By abolishing those centres, the Postmaster-General has created anomalies which cannot continue. It is intolerable that two neighbours should annum respectively for their telephones. I object to the Postmaster-General .attempting to mislead the House by declaring that I have done things which I have never contemplated. The honourable gentleman laughs. It is something to laugh at, I suppose. Personally, I should be ashamed to attempt to deliberately mislead the House. I object to his action in making statements concerning me which he knows to be absolutely incorrect. That is my complaint. I shall be very much obliged if he will say, in a truthful manner, what he knows about my record in the Postal Department. to praise the honourable member. the Postmaster-General to praise me. I merely wish him to cease making untruthful statements, and I have a right to require that at his hands, in the interests of decency and fair play. Question resolved in the negative.

Section 78 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1902 provides that "" Nothing in this Act shall authorize the expenditure of any greater sum out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund by way of payment of any salary ti.an is from time to time appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose."" Exception to this has been made in regard to the minimum wage and salaries less than ;£rio a year, as being, a fundamental principle of the Act.

It is not possible, therefore, for me to pay these increments until the amounts are appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose. I have made this statement very definite because J have been asked the same question a dozen times in this House, and a hundred times by public servants throughout Australia, and, although I have given replies in exactly similar terms, still a number of persons evidently think that the twoWhether Treasurer can pay increments upon salaries Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, New South without those salaries having first been apWales, also a report submitted this year by Mr propriated by an Act of Parliament.

The regulations provide that officers of the Cadet Corps (who are mostly teachers) shall have priority for such appointments within certain con? ditions, but there is also a provision for applications being invited as for General Instructional Staff when sufficient candidates from officers of Cadet Corps are not forthcoming. It was thought desirable at the initiation of tain instructors who had been accustomed to deal with boys. 2.

I desire to say that this Bill is somewhat similar to the measure which I introduced during the last Parliament. It is designed to give absolute security to the insurer, whilst at the same time preventing him from contracting himself out of his liability' to the insured. I think it will be found that its proposals are reasonable, and if the leave which I ask be granted, I shall take an early opportunity to move the second reading of the measure.

I did not hear the name of the author of the definition which he gave us, but understood him to say that Socialism was State enterprise for the equal benefit of all. That is a definition to which I do not subscribe. A gentleman associated with this House, in the course of a conversation, put the position very aptly. He said that if a cow suffering from tuberculosis, or a horse with girth-galls, were seen in one of our streets, the State authorities would interpose for the benefit of the animal-that .could be called paternalism; but that if the State did something for the benefit of man, it would be defined with an opposition-face as Socialism. In looking through the Bill, I find that it is of a distinctly socialistic character. In the first place, it is proposed to subsidize certain industries to the extent of .£530,000. Then under paragraph b of clause 4, bounties are to be payable in respect of goods whichhave been grown or produced in not less than the prescribed quantity and subject to the prescribed conditions.

178,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"The y have struck4ion. I do not desire to speak at length, -but I could not resist the opportunity to point out the ridiculous position in which these honourable members have placed themselves. Every time they speak in the House the political chickens which they hatched -during the election campaign come home .to roost. I have experienced no trouble in regard to the way in which this Bill may be described. The name of a proposal is immaterial to me, and I shall deal -on its merits with every proposition submitted by the Government. Although many honourable members of the Opposition Joudlv voiced their anti-socialistic humbug when on the hustings, we find that in this House, when they are faced with the invincible arguments of common sense, their fancies vanish into thin air. The collective wisdom of the representatives of the people proves true to the well-established principle that the collective power and the -collective purse .should minister to the needs -of the weaker divisions of labour and industry. -should like to add my congratulations to those which the Attorney-General has re-ceived upon the way in which he introduced this Bill, for I think that he made a very clear and satisfactory statement to the' House. We are told that the Bill is designed to encourage new industries-to induce people to quit our too populous cities, and make our waste places smiling oases. but it is for us, as business men, to view the proposal from a practical stand-point. The real question that we have to solve is whether the Bill is likely to achieve so desirable an end. I have very grave doubts-upon the point, and when I look -at the history of the bounty system, I feel that I am justified in the position I take up. be served by the granting of bounties either in France, Germany, or Australia, have been effected. The Victorian Government some years ago endeavoured to encourage new industries by means of bonuses, but, with the exception of the butter bonus, their efforts in this -direction met with no success. Unfortunately, it is only too usual in the case of bounties, for a lot of the money, which ought to go to the producers, to find its way into other channels. I think, however, that butter is an article, the manufacture of which was really promoted by means of a bounty or bonus; but that is the only successful application of the system to which Victoria can point. Another unfortunate circumstance is that very frequently bounties encourage people to engage in industries, which are abandoned as soon as the money has been paid over. On page 5 of the report of the experts, dealing with the prospects of the cotton industry in Queensland, it is statedThe second period' was in the late eighties, when a bonus was also given, but not on the growth of the plant. The bonus offered was 2.5,ooo for the first 5,000 yards of cotton goods, but the manufacturing company ceased business very soon after the bonus had been paid over. In the same State, a similar case occurred in connection with the bounty on silk. Some j£8oo was voted for the encouragement of the production of this commodity; and some people actually engaged in the industry; but as soon as the £800 had been paid over, the manufacture of silk languished and died. As to the Bill itself, if I may presume to criticise, I think it attempts too much. Here we have a long list of items, the production of which is to be encouraged, each by means of a small sum; and I am afraid that if the Bill be passed as presented to us, we shall find that we have spent all these small sums, aggregating a large amount, without actually benefiting any industry whatever. In my opinion, the Government ought to have picked out three or four items, the production of which is really fitted to the conditions which preThe object is a worthy one, vail in Australia, and which, with assistance, might have formed the basis of permanent industries; that would have been acting in a more business-like way, with some hope of ultimate success. When I say that the Bill attempt too much, I mean that it deals with too many items, and that the sums allotted are too small, in many instances, to attain the end Very few of the objects sought to desired. In Queensland, I understand, the State Government there spent no less than £750,000 before the sugar industrywas established on anything like a satisfactory ba'sis. How, therefore, can we hope to establish industries, such as are represented by the items on the schedule, on the slender pittances allotted? Personally, I believe it is possible to establish industries by means of bounties, but the history of the system inclines me to the conclusion that very few industriescan be helped in this way; and therefore we should be extremely cautious in our legislation. Cotton, jute, rubber, combed wool' or tops, and fish, might very well be",30,Reading Given Power To Make Regulations
179,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot) .[4.13],"Imade the subjects of a Bill of this kind. The fishing industry, especially, would be a good one to establish, if a bounty can' bring about that result, because it is a national industry in which people in all parts of the Commonwealth could participate. But the other items I have mentioned, with the exception of combed wool or tops, would be confined to Queensland and the Northern Territory. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That remark does not apply to flax. can be grown almost anywhere in the Commonwealth. In regard to cotton, neither the report of the experts nor of the authorities in Queensthe iron industry were established here, land is very encouraging. other hand, there is the report of Mr Jones, whose opinion, I should say, is worth more than that of the experts, bearing in mind his greater knowledge. grower himself. cotton industry could be established in Australia, but I doubt whether the bounty mentioned in the Bill would prove anything like sufficient. As I have already indicated, I think the Government would have been better advised to select only a few items, like those I mentioned, so that it could be fairly tested whether the commodities could be successfully produced in Australia. There are certain items in the schedule which I think the Government would do well to eliminate in the first instance. In the case of olives, for example, the industry has already been well established in South Australia, and the bounty for many years would be absorbed by the growers in that State; in short, the bounty would go to people who have established themselves without it, and do not require the assistance. The chances of peanuts and palm oil have, I think, already been demolished; and they may be easily removed from the schedule. the Government can see their way clear to amend their proposals in what I consider a business-like way, and confine their attention to cotton, flax, jute, wool, and fish, I shall be glad to support the Bill. There is another consideration which makes us chary of the bounty system, especially in Australia. Most of the commodities mentioned in the schedule are produced in other parts of the world by the lowest paid labour, and the question is whether we in Australia, who have to employ white labour, and pay adequate wages, can produce them at a profit. This, to my mind, is a very serious consideration, because, unless we can produce in sufficient quantities to export, and compete in the world's markets, we cannot employ many people profitably, or do much in the way of settling our empty spaces and improving the prospects of Australia generally. I should like to see the Government introduce a proposal for an iron bounty, instead of the bounties now submitted, because the chances of success for the iron industry in Australia are much better than the chances of any of the industries contemplated by the Bill. If But, on the far more men would be employed than would be the case in the production of many of the items in the schedule. tablished. ' it is not likely to continue without some State assistance. afraid to proceed in that direction, so long as the duty is not made too high. Many previous speakers have urged that this Bounty Bill should not be dealt with until after the Tariff has been introduced; and I think that that view is the right one. It' would be better for us to know our financial position before we vote the large sum of money involved in this Bill. Although, as I have said, the bounty on each item is not, in my opinion, sufficient to establish an industry, yet the small sums, added together, form the very respectable total of £-530,000, which is rather a large amount of money to fritter away when there is a danger that we may be unable to point to any successfully established industry If the bounties be friven, a good many people will probably be encouraged to engage in the new industries, and if the sums If prove insufficient, either a renewal of the bounties or high protective duties will be asked for. I am sure that is not what is contemplated by those who have expressed their good intentions in the Bill before us. The honourable and learned member for Flinders was quite right when he said that we should have had the Budget proposals before we were called upon to consider this measure.

I hope that the good advice given by the honourable and iearned member will be taken to heart by the Government; because, although this Bill in itself may not be regarded as a very serious step in a wrong direction, still it may be the first towards doing business in a slipshod manner. I hope that on future occasions when proposals of 'this Jkind are brought before the House, a statement of our financial position will be given, and the means to be taken to provide the money asked for indicated. I do not intend to deal with the schedule in detail, because such a discussion is better reserved for the Committee stage; but I ask the Ministry-althoug h T have no hope that they will adopt my suggestion-to limit their proposals to a few of the, items in the schedule. I feel so strongly that that is the wise course to pursue, that if the Government insists on pushing through the B ill , the whole B ill and nothing but the B ill , it will be my duty to oppose it, because I cannot see any reasonable chance of success in attempts to deal .at 'one time with a large number of new industries. If Ministers, in the first place, limit their energies to the encouragement of a few industries only, I shall be prepared to support them. I listened to the address of the Minister in charge of the Bill with considerable pleasure, and gathered from what he said that the Government intend to take precautions to insure the success of the action which they propose in regard to the en couragement of certain industries. Our object, as business men, should be to do all that is possible to attract population to our shores, and thus provide for the cultivation -of what are to-day practically waste lands. If we do this we shall increase the public Tevenue, and make Australia a more prosperous country. favour of giving bounties for the establishment of industries, and in a country which possesses tens of millions of acres -of practically unused land it is the duty -of the Government to take all means for the development of its capabilities and resources. But before anything definite is done for the encouragement of particular industries, a close inquiry should be made into climatic conditions and soils, because without due precautions the best-meant efforts will f a i l. Possibly the Government intend to arrange through the States Departments of Agriculture for the oversight of their experiments. If advantage is not taken of the teachings of science, and the proper consideration of local conditions is neglected, the chances of success are very small. Most of the States have at times given bounties for the encouragement of industries, but as they did not supply expert advisers to instruct growers how to plant, where to plant, what to plant, and how to .garner, most of their attempts to encourage primary production have merely iesulted in the waste of money. The failure of such experiments not only damps the ardour of those who have been induced to try new methods, but deters others from entering upon industries which, under proper conditions, might prove very remunerative. I agree with the honourable member for Wilmot that it will be best for the Government to reduce its proposals to five or six items. Parliament has decided that Australia shall be a white man's country, and therefore, I do rot approve of the offering of bounties for the encouragement of what are black men's industries. The growing of rubber is such an industry. Mr W. H .

Let us proceed cautiously, and endeavour to make a success of a few industries, and then we shall inspire confidence in persons upon the other side of the world to come and settle in our midst. Some honourable members have declared that there is no land available for settlement in Australia, and that land taxation is necessary. I say that in the different States there are millions of acres available for settlement, and that these lands can be purchased cheaply. I wish to see the iron industry established, because I believe it to be of national importance. Later on we may have to build our own Navy. Consequently, we must work for the benefit of the nation as a .whole. We must not spend the taxpayers' money foolishly in attempting to foster the production of many of the articles enumerated in the schedule of this Bill.

Some honourable members have urged that this Bill ought not to be proceeded with until after the Tariff has been disposed of. That is the old story. Those who do not approve of a measure invariably advocate its delayed consideration. In my opinion, it would be far better for them to openly oppose it. We hear too much talk about delay, and it is time that we pressed forward with legislation, especially in view of the fact that the Senate is waiting for measures from this Chamber. Several honourable members have advocated expenditure upon the establishment of an Agricultural Department for the diffusion of knowledge. I am satisfied that all of us wish to see production increased. But what I desire to point out is that the proposals which are embodied in this Bill would encourage diversity of production, and that must inevitably lead to the creation of an Agricultural Department under Commonwealth control. This diversity of production is the reason why the Statistical Department in America is such a grand institution. I was considerably amused when I heard honourable members object to the Bill upon the ground that bounties were proposed in respect of too many items.

I am very pleased that the Government have decided to offer a bounty of 20 per cent, upon jute. One of the heaviest charges upon the wool and wheat producers of the Commonwealth is that levied upon jute fabrics. I am also glad that it is proposed to pay a bounty upon the production of combed wool and tops. I remember reading an article not long ago upon the trusts of America. It was written by a free-trader. This gentleman had very little knowledge of the subject upon which he was writing, because he expressed astonishment at the action of America in imposing a heavy duty upon clean wool and a light impost upon greasy wool. He was too short-sighted to see that the object was to encourage the scouring of the wool to be undertaken locally. I am satisfied that the proposed bonus for the production of combed wool and tops will induce the preparation of that article to be undertaken in Australia. I welcome' every increase in the labour market. To-day, we are all anxious to secure population. We want to see Australia filled with white people. Instead of one or two great industries, such as wool and wheat growing, we desire to see a thousand-and-one industries established-industries which will enable a very large agricultural population to exist here. Unless we have diversity of production, unless we can establish industries which will permit men to make a good living out of 10 acres, as well as out of 10,000 acres, we shall never attract a large population. That is ona of the reasons why honourable members should encouiage every effort made by the Government to establish industries based upon proper lines. For nearly twenty years before entering this House, I have carefully studied all social movements and conditions throughout the world. I have taken into consideration what other countries are doing in the direcmust necessarily benefit the rest of the comtion of developing their industries with a view to assisting similar development in Australia. In Germany, where population is much denser than it is here, it is a sinor any other ""istic."" We should set aside gular circumstance that almost every man desires to follow agricultural pursuits. There nearly every man who can secure a small area of land is an agriculturist. I hope the day will soon come when we shall see thousands of men cultivating small areas even in the neighbourhood of our cities and large towns, and I welcome this measure as one that will assist in that Mr Foster. direction. We must consider not merely the individual who wishes to launch out upon a big undertaking, but the man who desires to make a small beginning in raw production. I have listened with amusement to the ridiculous badinage on the question of Socialism. On a previous occasion, I referred to mininga great industry of raw production-and made it clear that I considered the day will not come in our time when it will be necessary to socialize or nationalize speculative mining. I believe also that we shall not see the necessity to nationalize general farming pursuits. Time after time we shall be forced in the days to come to nationalize manufactures in many directions, and also to nationalize our banking system, but there will be no need to nationalize raw production, since the best wheat, the best wool, or the best olive oil, as the case may be, must be produced in order that the best prices may be secured. The farmer cannot adulterate his produce; unlike many manufacturers he cannot palm.off shoddy. Furthermore, in the readjustment of the methods of industry, which I feel must take place all over the world, we shall have to leave openings for those who do not care to work for a wage. I am one of those who would sooner resort to a primary industry, and take all the risks attendant upon such a calling, than offer my services to another for what I considered an inadequate wage. I look upon the encouragement of a diversity of industries such as is proposed by this Bill as something for which we all can fight. Some honourable members, in dealing with the Bill, take up the selfish attitude that by passing it we shall benefit only a few. If we succeed in building up these industries we shall benefit the whole of the people. Anything that is calculated to assist an important body of men such as those who are struggling to make a living on the soil, munity. In supporting such a measure as this we should refuse to discuss the question of whether it is socialistic, anarchistic, such considerations, and determine to give an undivided support to measures which, whether socialistic or otherwise, will be for the general welfare of the people. IVIr. KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [5.5]. I do not wish to occupy the time of the House by making a lengthy speech, but I think it necessary to say that, having regard to the financial position of the State of which I am a representative, I do not feel much like voting for this B ill . I am, nevertheless, a staunch supporter of the Government, which, in the circumstances, I believe is a good one. A bounty, to my mind, is either the father or the child of bribery. If the Government were to expend £ 5 3 0 , 0 0 0 within the next fifteen years in settling people in the Northern Territory, they would do far more to develop the Commonwealth than we should by granting bounties on the products of industries which may flourish, like the green bay tree, while these grants are forthcoming, and die away as soon as they cease. The Government would do well to expend the amount to be appropriated under this B ill in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, or Germany in the Northern Territory, and I would suggest that it should be allowed to stand over until they have had a further opportunity to determine whether it is expedient to devote so large a sum to the purposes enumerated in the schedule. I should like also to know whether the funds necessary to meet this expenditure are to come out of the general revenue, or to be provided by loan. I should strongly oppose the floating of a loan. of revenue. standing the assurance, I am not prepared to say that I shall ,vote for the B ill . shall wait to see what position the House generally takes up. for the Government to exercise its governmental powers in placing immigrants on the land, and an expenditure of ,£530,000 would be sufficient to settle 5,000 families in the Northern Territory. If a man has any brains he does not require much capital to give him a start, and as long as he can hang on to his holding until he gets a bit of a monopoly, he cannot help, ultimately, reaching a position of affluence. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bil l read a second time. In CommitteeClause1 agreed to. Clause 2There sha.ll be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, the sum of Five hundred and thirty thousand pounds during the period of fifteen years commencing on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and seven, for the payment of bounties in accordance with this Act. [5.11] -This clause provides for an appropriation of revenue, and I very much regret that under the Standing Orders it is impossible for us to propose to eliminate certain items in the schedule, and to substitute others. I do not know if it is possible to overcome the difficulty. doing so. that we have been caught napping. The course I have outlined could have been taken when we were in Committee to consider the message from the Governor General. Since we have allowed that planting white citizens from stage to pass we are in the same position that we should occupy if we were considering the Estimates. In other words, whilst we may delete an item in the schedule, we cannot add to it. It seems to me that such a rule should not apply to a Bill of this description. I can quite understand its application to an express provision relating to the distribution of moneys, but I do not think it should apply when, as under this B ill , an appropriation is incidental to the carrying out of a national policy. I would suggest to the Minister that the clause might very well be postponed until we have dealt with the schedule. It would be idle to agree to the appropriation of £""530,000 under this clause unless we were prepared to agree I to the items in the schedule in respect of which that amount is made up. I take it It would be better that the Standing Orders would permit us to vary the amounts in the schedule, provided we did not increase the total of the proposed expenditure; but I think this clause should be postponed until we have had submitted to us the financial proposals of the Government, or at any rate until the Tariff resolutions have been brought down, and we know exactly what is going to be done. I am quite certain that' the schedule will be materially altered. I protest against this proceeding in the dark, without knowing the whole mind of the Government in regard to the stimulation of industries. However, I can do no more than utter that protest. Everv honourable member seems to have a different viewpoint from which he approaches the consideration of this question.

Sir orable gentleman give me a reason instead of sitting there and snapping out "" No "" ? When the Tariff has been dealt with, we may find that some of the items in the schedule are unnecessary. The honourable member for Wimmera spoke last night most eloquently of. the way in which export can be encouraged by means ofduties, and, as I say, it may be that the bounties may be found quite unnecessary in regard to some of the items when the Tariff shall have been revised in the near future-thoug h goodness knows when we may expect to have the Tariff submitted. 1 suppose the Tariff would never come before us if Ministers had their way. Sir member is quite mistaken. "" strangled industries "" seems now to be a mere matter of history. During the election all industries were supposed to be more or less in a state of collapse, but since the election all have been thriving, and now, to use a vulgarism, "" everything in the garden is lovely."" It could not hurt the Government to tell us whether the proposals in the schedule represent the whole of the treatment to be meted out to some of these items ; they would be revealing no secrets, and doing nothing wroncr.

The debate on the second reading showed that there is great diversity of opinion as to the manner in which this appropriation should be expended; but the Government must be perfectly well satisfied that there is a majority of honourable members who are prepared to support a reasonable measure having for its object the establishment of successful industries. But it is not right that, at this stage, we should be asked to appropriate this large sum without having first considered the schedule, especially in view of the strong feeling expressed by a large number of the money should be amended. A number of honourable members are of opinion that the money could be better applied by limiting it to one or two distinct items; and, under the circumstances, to pass this clause would interfere with the proper ventilation of the question. As I said during the second-reading debate, I am favorable to the general principle of the B ill , and desire to see proper appropriations made in furtherance of the desired object. I suggest to the Minister that he might, without any of the malicious and highly erroneous suggestions which are attached to any effort that mav be made to secure the postponement of this measure, consent to delay its consideration until we have before us suffido not, however, attach so much importance to that point as does the honourable member for Parramatta, because the annual appropriation can be readily and easily made up.

256,Mr Frazer,"I begin to doubt, thethem, as they are entitled to do, in the light of the general finances. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has referred to two or three items of expenditure which must inevitably fall upon the Commonwealth. Reference has been made by him to the very large expenditure proposed to be incurred in respect of a Federal system of old-age pensions, and, when speaking the other evening, I alluded to several other items of expenditure which we have to face. Honourable members of the Labour Party, who support the Ministry, are much less concerned than we are with regard to the financial proposals of the Government, since they are prepared to accept direct taxation as an aid to the revenue already derived. quite right as to that. Mr W. H . IRVINE I think that I am expressing the view of most honourable members on this side of the House, as well as of some of the supporters of the Government, when I say we are not prepared to accept direct taxation in aid of the revenue of the Commonwealth. Is it conceivable that, if we proceed with the various proposals suggested from all sides of the House and also reduce our Customs and Excise revenue by granting an increase of effective protection-a n increase to which this House will probably agree-w e shall be able, without direct taxation, to keep the finances of the Commonwealth in a satisfactory position? Even assuming that it is, we are entitled at this stage to have a statement from the Treasurer. If the Government have not arrived at any conclusion as to the balance of the finances with which we are about to deal, are they not adopting, not merely a haphazard, but an utterly reckless and dangerous procedure in asking the Committee to agree to this large expenditure? Prime Minister whether he is going to force this House, which exercises financial control, to allow this financial measure to pass out of its hands before it has an opportunity to arrive at some estimate of the general finances of the Commonwealth. I understand the honourable gentleman to say that he does intend to do so, and therefore I join in the protests that have been made. as I can employ against what is an utterly irresponsible method of conducting the finances of the Commonwealth. of Trade and Customs) [6.3] -On e would imagine, after listening to the mischievous statements of the honourable and learned member for Flinders One would imagine from his statement that the Commonwealth was not prepared to incur an expenditure of £70,000 or £80,000 per annum £80,000 ? honourable member would allow me to proceed. The honourable and learned member for Flinders doubtless desires to prevent the passing of any legislation of this character until the Tariff Has been submitted. If that be so, his object is to prevent our doing any work of an important character until the>Tariff has been dealt with. Some time will probably be occupied in the consideration of the Tariff resolutions. Mr W. H . IRVINE I have not said anything abouf the Tariff.

IRVINE -The honourable gentleman may think what he pleases. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the honourable and learned member may wear it. I have here reports of speeches which he made before he sought election to this House, and I find that they are not consistent with speeches made by him since then. Judging by his attitude in dealing with a measure designed to benefit the producers of Australia, one is inclined to believe that he intends to adhere to some of the principles expressed in his earlier speeches, and not to those to which he has more recently given utterance. with the honourable and learned member's argument ? no argument. A Government that is not prepared to accept the responsibility for a measure of this kind, which involves a comparatively small annual expenditure for a great Commonwealth, is not fit to hold office. If it is not prepared to accept the responsibility for submitting such a proposal before the Budget statement is delivered, and when it knows practically, although not absolutely, what the nature of that statement will be, it certainlv is not fit to remain in possession of the Treasury benches. enough for the Opposition to complain when the Financial Statement is submitted and it shows that we have acted improperly. It is idle to attempt to delay the passing of this B ill on the ground that the House should have a statement of the financial position of the Commonwealth before it sends it on to another place. I cannot say exactly when the Treasurer will be able to . submit his Financial Statement. honourable and learned member for Flinders, therefore, is simply playing with this question, and injuring those whom his party were returned to assist. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Can the honourable gentleman give us an outline of the financial position? Sir WILLIAM LYNE to do so Mr W. member would not. one knows better than does the honourable and learned member himself that he is talking nonsense when he suggests that I should It seems to me usurp the position of the Treasurer by giving the Committee an outline of the financial situation. It is simply absurd that such a request should have been made, either to me or to the Attorney-General, If the cap fits, and it was for that reason that I referred just now to the honourable and learned member's speech as being a mischievous one. I understand that the leader of the party in the Opposition corner has not said anything. nonsensical talk on the part of the Minister, and I hold that he has no right to make such a stupid, senseless remark. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am sorry if I have made a mistake, but I remember that, as the result of an interjection made by the honourable member for Maranoa, the honourable member for Kooyong made a speech in which he assumed the position of leader of the Opposition corner party. is making an absolutely incorrect statement. 1 said on the occasion in question that I spoke on behalf of members in the Opposition corner.

The Minister in charge of the B ill has asked the Committee to proceed with It will be time its consideration, and some of the items in the schedule may be amended. The question of whether they should be altered is a matter which the Committee in its wisdom must determine. In the event of the amount set apart for any of the items in the schedule being reduced, this clause, which provides for an appropriation, will be recommitted, so that it can be made to harmonize with the schedule. man say whether the Government are satisfied that the financial position will be sound in the event of our passing this B ill as well as the Postal RatesB ill , and the other measures on the business paper?

It is unfair and unreasonable that honourable members should imagine that we are likely to do otherwise. I can well understand the insinuation made by the honourable and learned member for Flinders that certain honourable members are in favour of direct land taxation. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Insinuation ? said straight out that some honourable members were in favour of direct taxation. Sir WILLIAM LYNE of land taxation. That was one of the planks in the platform upon which I was elected. Mr W. H , IRVINE -Perhaps that is why the honourable member is so reckless in regard to the amount of money that we spend ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE reckless as the honourable member is in the statements that he makes. AlthoughI am in favour of direct taxation, I am not tionI shall not take any step in that direction until the House knows what is going to be done. The object of the Government in asking honourable members to agree to this Bill is certainly not to force direct taxation upon the people, and the amount of the appropriation is comparatively small having regard to the total revenue of the Commonwealth. I am not an enemy of the B ill , or of the bounty system, but I am amazed that an honourable member charged with the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth should be prepared to deliver such a speech as that which we have just had from the Acting Prime Minister. In answer honourable member for Kalgoorlie, he admitted that, although he had brought down a measure providing for an appropriation of £ 5 3 0 , 0 0 0 , he had not made an estimate of the expenditure and When we are dealing with money which belongs to the people of Australia, we ought to adopt ordinary business methods. Every man in business, when entering into an enterprise of the magnitude of that submitted to us, sits down and calculates every shilling that it may be necessary to expend; I am not going and, if that be the course adopted in private affairs, how much more careful should we be when dealing with the public finances? The Minister has shown himself utterly incapable, and, if he is representing the Government at this moment, he has shown that the Government are utterly incapable of administering the affairs of the country. The attempt of the Government to assist the producing interest is a commendable one, which ought to be encouraged in every way, but, at the same time, we must, in the inI terests of the people, first ascertain that we have the money to spend. I am in favour business. the Government do not care one jot how long this Bil l remains before the House, in order that it may block business. We were promised that the Tariff proposals would be submitted immediately on the return of the Minister of Trade and Customs from Great Britain; but they were not I am not so ready, and the Bounties Bill and other measures are introduced simply in order that we may mark time. We have been marking time ever since the session opened, attempting to force the posiand the order has gone forth that we shall continue to do so until the Tariff proposals are ready. orable member supports this proposal for postponement ? House there is no desire to delay public business for one moment, or to interfere in any way with the submission of the Tariff proposals. I am certain that honourable members in this corner, and on al] sides of the House, will give every assistance to the Government to dispose of the Tariff. In reply to the honourable member for Bourke, I point out that the honourable member for Kooyong, in asking for a postponement, was simply acting on those ordinary busito an interjection by the ness principles which in private lif e have led to his success and that of other men in the community. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the A t torney-General will regard this B ill as a serious business proposal, and allow us, revenue of the Commonwealth. who are responsible for the appropriation of the money, to know, in detail, as far as possible, what money we have to spend. ring to Hansard of last year, I find that the Bounties Bill was introduced immediatelv after the Budget; and that, I think, was a good order of procedure.

281,Mr Glynn (Angas) [6.20],"On referafter the Treasurer had delivered his Budget speech, the second reading of the Bounties Bil l was moved ; and 1 cannot see why that order of procedure should be reversed this year. There is an additional reason why the BountiesB ill should follow the Budget. A month or six weeks ago, the Treasurer, speaking in Queensland, expressed sympathy with the suggestion theie made that, instead of bounties being granted on sugar, increased direct protection should be given to the industry. In other words, the proposal was that the bounty and the excise should be abolished, and the prohibitive duties of £ 6 on cane and £ i o on beet sugar should be preserved. If that suggestion were acted upon, there would be a gap in the revenue to the extent of at least £ 4 ^ 0 , 0 0 0. Last year the revenue was £608,000, from ""which had to be deducted the bounty under the new system, which was commenced on the 1st January this year; and if , as seems probable, the Treasurer in his Budget speech proposes to abolish the bounty and Excise, while retaining the import duties, there must be a deficiency to the amount I have stated. venue from sugar was £ 7 8 0 , 0 0 0 , but we have paid £^730,000 in bounties up to June this year. I do not know on what grounds the Treasurer has reversed the order of procedure. tection shall not be quite so stiff as people think, and does not mind anticipating his revenue, and forcing his own hand in the direction, of moderation. If that is not his intention, the present course seems a most fatuous one to follow, in view of the policy indicated by the Prime Minister on the hustings, and foreshadowed by the reports of the Tariff Commission, which would mean a shrinkage in the revenue. not attach much importance to the postponement of the clause, because under it no more money can be spent than is iustified by the schedule. Trade and Customs has told us that we may pass the clause if we like, but that he will not spend the money if he has not got it. However, if the Bill be passed, the Minister will be bound by law to spend the money, and will have to get it from somewhere. I am tired of hearing gentlemen like the honourable member for Corangamite declare ing that they are anxious to help the producer, and. when the opportunity presents itself, raising all sorts of objections. do not represent a producing, constituency, but I am anxious to help the producers. For various reasons, I do not like bounties; and if I could find a better method, supported by a majority of honourable members, I should be glad to vote against the Bill. It is high time to do something for the producers, and the B ill is the only method proposed by the Government, or by any other section of Parliament. IfI thought there was any difficulty about finding the money necessary to meet the re. quirements of the B ill , I would be opposed to it ; but when I look at the finances of. * the Commonwealth since the inauguration of Federation;, I can see that there is still a large margin after the comparatively small expenditure proposed by the B ill . ' We cannot establish industries without encouraging immigration, and thus largely increasing the number of taxpayers, and, of course, the revenue. If industries are not established, then, of course, this money will not be spent; but if they are established the wealth of the country must be increased. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie A few years ago, the repointed out that the Government have in view schemes, such as penny postage, which will entail a large expenditure. Well, I am not prepared to vote for penny postage, which will not help the producer or the Perhaps he intends that the propoorer people of the community, but will be advantageous to only the commercial classes and others who have already been given so much assistance in connection with the cheapening of telegrams. The BountiesB ill , if it does any good at all, will be productive of wealth; but it would be hard to convince me that the spending of £""300,000. which represents the probable cost of penny postage, will in any way add to the I do material prosperity of the country. I should be strongly opposed to a bonus for the iron industry, and I should be opposed to the granting of bounties The Minister of under this Bill were it not for the fact that it will take a good many years to establish some of the industries represented by the items in the schedule. If we were to impose duties instead of granting bounties, Ave should only be penalizing the consumers of the country for some years to come by removing competition. pared to do that, and I hope that one of the Government's schemes in the near future Avill be the establishment of a ComI monAvealth Bank, which will make such",45,William Lyne Th E Honourable Cient Knowledge Of Our Financial Position I

First we have to ask ourselves whether we are earnest in our desire to help the producers; and if we are, we must then make up our minds as to the best way in which to give that help. The Government tell us that the Bill represents the best scheme they can devise,, and, in the absence of a better, we should pass it, taking our chance as to the necessary funds. assist the producers we must give them more than bounties we must give them cheap land, and this ought to be done in the near future. I should not be afraid of expending much larger sums than that proposed by the Bill in order to help the producers. reasons, I hope there will be no more delay, unless the proposed postponement is supported by sounder arguments than I have vet heard. orable and learned member for Flinders travelled beyond the question immediately before the Chair, and dealt with the general question of legislation, complaining of the clumsy way in which the Government had introduced this Bill. honourable and learned member was justified; and the position only shows that the first work of the session should be the Budget, when the Government, through the Treasurer, would take the responsibility for the financial proposals of the year. A l though the honourable and learned member was justified' in criticising the conduct of business by the Government, I scarcely think his remarks constitute an argument against bounties, or in favour of the postponement of the clause. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7-45p.m. honourable and learned Flinders, that a Bill involving so large an expenditure as this does should be preceded by a financial statement, applies also to the Postal Rates Bill, and all measures involving the outlay of large sums of public money. To meet his objection, it would be necessary for the which I am about to make be carried into Government to have .its Budget 'Speech delivered as early as possible in the session. The point. taken by the honourable and learned member, although urged by him So as a reason for postponement, is really good ground for a motion of censure, because of the slovenly manner in which Ministers are doing their work. But we know that the Government is sure of its numbers. The passing of the Supply Bill last week showed that it possesses the confidence of Parliament. Therefore, it would be enough for the Acting Prime Minister to say that, things have occurred which make it impossible to present a statement of the finances forthwith, but the Treasurer will be ready to do so within a few weeks. If Buti f we really wish to I voted for the postponement of the clause,, it would be merely because I am altogether opposed to the granting of bounties.

I believe that a number of other honourable members upon the Opposition side of the Chamber are beginning to see the light. But when we are asked to authorize the expenditure of such a large sum of money as this Bill involves, I think that we should look around with a view to ascertain what demands are likely to be made upon us during the next four or live years. It is very easy for us to pass Bills involving an expenditure of £400,000 or £500,000, without having any regard to the financial necessities of the Commonwealth in years to come. But when we come to realize the magnitude of the sum involved in the Government proposals we ought to hesitate before giving our assent to a Bill of this character. I ask honourable members to reflect upon the loss of revenue which the adoption of penny postage will involve. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Probably we shall not be given that information.

We should not agree to the payment of bounties to enI think that I know when courage new industries unless we are tolerably certain that they can be successfully established here. Many of the items in the schedule in my opinion ought to be omitted. For instance, I do not think that we should grant a bounty for the cultivation of rice or coffee, whilst it is questionable whether we could successfully produce hemp or rubber in Australia. When we reach the schedule, I shall endeavour to secure the elimination of some of the items for which, in my opinion, there is no justification; The object which the honourable member for Dalley has in view in moving the amendment is a laudable one, but the proposal which he makes is too large a one to be dealt with in connection with such a measure as this. Within the last week some of us have seen what is being done towards the establishment of the iron industry in New South Wales. Private enterprise has proved that the iron ores of New South Wales are such as to enable better iron and steel to be produced there than is obtainable from England. We have, therefore, some reason for proposing to encourage such an industry. I do not think, however, that it should be assisted at the present time by means of a bounty. The imposition of a protective duty would be more effective, and for that reason I am not prepared to vote for the amendment. WhilstI do not approve of the clause as The Bill relating to penny it stands, I am not in a position to say to what extent the proposed appropriation should be reduced. We should deal first of all with the schedule, and, therefore, I think the clause should be postponed. that if necessary I will ask that the clause be recommitted. bling over terms. There is practically no difference between postponing a clause and recommitting it.

In the year 1903 there were 31S acres under coffee in Queensland, the total yield being 83,632 lbs.

I take it that that is the advice on which the Government are acting. It is grown under the conditions governing orchard work, principally in small areas as a subsidiary crop, though there are many who make it the principal crop. The soil most suitable is a well-drained loamy soil, but it will grow in p'oorer soils. The best situation is in the tropics with a range of temperature from 55 degrees to 80 degrees F., and it will thrive at an elevation of say 2,000 feet. An extremely wet climate is not favorable to the coffee plant and exposure does not suit it. Propagation is by seed. It will be admitted that at some seasons of the year the Northern Territory may well be described as having an "" extremely wet climate. ' ' wasted on bounties in an attempt to develop industries of this kind, when there are hundreds of other ways in which our surplus monev may be spent more profitably for the benefit of the people of Australia. Turning to another item, I ask whether there is any necessity to demonstrate that Australia can grow tobacco equal to that specified by the experts? large areas have lately come under tobacco cultivation, and the product is superior to any hitherto raised in the Commonwealth. Indeed, it is pronounced' by experts to be equal to Virginian leaf. member ever smoked it ? ^1011 joyed it . The soil in the north-west of New South Wales, and on the borders of Queensland, is capable of producing tobacco equal to any produced elsewhere, if there is a reasonable return for the labour. Agricultural Department of New South ConWalesI procured some, and it nearly killed everybody who used it. to which I refer have taken place since the honourable member left the Agricultural DepartmentI do not know whether that has been because he left. The trouble is not the want of a bounty, but the want of a market in which a legitimate price can be procured for a good article. The restrictions on the sale are of such a character It proves that, in the as to deprive the grower of a fair return for even the best leaf he can produce. Where is the competition for the leaf ? HowI will many buyers are there? There is practically only one buyer; and the great need is protection against the ring or combine which is crippling the industry. I know of men who, previous to the formation of the combine, obtained is. and is. 2d. per lb. for their 'leaf, but, since the combine has got control, the growers have to take whatever price is offered. It is futile to expect the bounty to overcome that d if ficulty, because the money would be simply taken by the combine, which would sweat the growers. No matter what our opinions may be as to bounties, while the industry is so shackled such assistance can be of no avail. Then we are asked to spenrl the people's money in encouraging the production of jute. I see nothing in the report to hold out any hope of success for such an industry or to warrant the Government in including jute in the schedule. I The public money ought not to be admit that some of the bounties proposed may be effective in soil which is not of the best, but the peculiar position is that the Government propose to force by artificial means the production of articles on soil that is not otherwise used, while there are millions of acres of good land which is not being put to its f u l l productive use. When we of the progressive party express a desire In the districts 1 represent to develop the resources of the Commonwealth, not by bounties, but by bringing the good land of the Commonwealth into f u l l productive use, honourable members opposite are not in accord with us, unless the reform is carried out under such conditions as will give no return to the men who take up the land.",50,William Lyne Th E Honourable Cient Knowledge Of Our Financial Position I

Why then should we offer a bounty for the encouragement of an established industry? We should profit by the confessions which Victorian representatives have made in regard to certain of the bounties which were once in operation in this State.

Fruit trees cannot be grown there, vines are attacked, and flowers have to be planted in pots to protect them from the ravages of this pest. The leader of the Labour Party brought back with him photographs of white ant hills which stand as monuments to the destructiveness of this scourge. Hills as high as the columns of this Chamber, and as broad as the gable end of many a house, cannot be built by a few ants. Indeed, in parts of the Territory it is difficult to drive through the ant hills. these facts to show how ridiculous is the suggestion that cocoanuts may profitably be grown in the Northern Territory.

Of course, my remarks concerning the Northern Territory may not be, very palatable to some of my South Australian friends, but I have to speak of what I saw during my visit there, irrespective of whether or not I may hurt their susceptibilities. I think that the money which it is proposed to spend to foster the production of sisal hemp could be better devoted to old-age pensions. I am of opinion that New Zealand flax also could be profitably grown in Southern Australia, and that there is therefore no need for us to offer a bounty.

For some time past I have been striving to understand the position taken up by a number of honourable members of this Committee. A t last I fancy, that I begin to see a little daylight. In the first place, we have a Government in power which outsiders declare is kept in office by the socialistic party.

Under cover of this measure it is proposed to hand over the taxpayer's money to a limited number of private individuals, and to deny him any control over the business which they conduct. The only restriction that the taxpayer is able to impose is that the recipients of the bounty shall employ white labour and pay white . men's wages. That is one of the objects towards which the Labour Party has been working for years. from that one condition, the management of the business is to be left entirely to private individuals. The honourable member for Gwydir is very much afraid that these individuals will not succeed. I am inclined to agree that there will be a lot of failures, because I regard private enterthe Crown lands available here are really prise as an all-round failure. But, nevertheless, the Bill represents the half-way step to Socialism. This evening the honourable member for Dalley, who was a pronounced anti-Socialist, and an out-and-out free-trader, has been "" barracking '' for bounties, so long as a bounty is given to the iron .industry. serves to point the educational influence of the Labour Party in this House. The strongest anti-Socialists are rapidly coming bers in the Opposition corner have simply round to our way of thinking, and within a few years the whole of them will be advocating Socialism. of progress how many centuries will elapse before the workers are insured the fruits of their labour? have referred is rapidly taking place. As the honourable member for Gwydir has pointed out, we are being invited to enter upon a very heavy expenditure, and we have not been able to ascertain from the Treasurer what is the financial position of the Commonwealth. The Government seem to have behind them funds as vast as those at the disposal of the Bank of England. give them credit for having carefully considered their various proposals, but 1 am anxious to ascertain what is the ultimate object they -have in view. This Bill will involve an expenditure of over £[500,000. A Federal system of old-age pensions, to which the Government is pledged, will be responsible for a further expenditure of something like £1,500,000, and we shall also have to meet a heavy liability in buildorable member for Gwydir seems to have ing an Australian Navy, in providing for the administration of the Northern Territory, and ultimately in constructing transcontinental lines to Kalgoorlie and to Port Darwin. I have been endeavouring to think out what is behind all these proposals. The granting of bounties in respect of natural products will naturally mean a big thing for the land-owners, for the 720 persons and companies that own half the alienated land of New South Wales, and for the handful that own the larger part of the alienated lands of VicBut apart toria. In passing, I should like to say that I think it is idle to assert that there are millions of acres of Crown lands in this State. As a matter of fact in making their estimate the Victorian Government have not allowed for the areas represented by public roads and parks, and very limited. These bounties, if granted, will tend to bring about intense culture, and in that way jwilf largely increase land values. It seems to me that, having by means of an expenditure of millions brought about this result, the Government will hold in reserve a substantial land tax, His action merely and that their proposals in this direction will enable them to obtain a very large revenue from that source. Honourable memtaken up the anti-socialistic cry, in order to soothe their electors, and I have no doubt that some of them, who have previously declared themselves strongly in favour of land values taxation, will come to the help of the Government when they seek to carry out these great schemes. The land problem is the bed-rock of all our difficulties, and until we stop the confiscation that is now going on, we shall always be handicapped. I use the word ""confiscation"""" because I find that even many honourable members of this House are strongly in favour of it. They are decidedly in favour of the individual land-owner being permitted to confiscate. the value given to his land by the efforts of the rest of the comI munity. The Labour Party say that, when a community creates the unimproved value of land, that value belongs to the community, and that it is wrong that the few should be allowed to take from the many that which the many Save created.

I do not propose at this stage to discuss in detail the items in the schedule, although I am unable to understand why some of them should have been included in it.

According to the reports of the experts, districts having only a limited rainf a l l are best suited for coffee raising, and my own electorate comes within that category. I should like in this connection to protest against the tendency on the part of many honourable members to speak of Australian aboriginals as negroes.

The production of olives is one of the industries in respect of which a bounty is proposed. As a matter of fact South Australia for some years has been supplying the New South Wales market with olives and olive oil . It seems to me that the Government are practically saying to those engaged in the industry there, "" You have already established your inrdustry, and are doing very w e l l ; but we propose to give you a bounty on the understanding that you will employ white labour and pay white men's wages."" I think that is a sound proposition. Perhaps it is just as well ber makes such statements he will cause the Government to lose the support which some honourable members of the Opposition are giving the B ill . They are always prepared to boost up private enterprise. I regard as a friend any one who is ready to take a step towards the accomplishment of my ideals, and the Government seem to be prepared to do so. The honourable member for Gwydir declared that cotton-growing would not pay in Australia, and when it was pointed out to him that the industry was already being carried on in Queensland, he said that In cotton was only being grown there in order that the oil extracted from the seed might be used for soap-malking purposes. I think that the honourable member in making that statement proved that the industry could be made a payable one. Cotton is being grown on the Darling. River. One of my constituents on the Marra has grown cotton which has been pronounced by an expert to be exceptionally fine, superior even to the American article. I believe that cotton can be profitably raised in Australia, and that the industry might very well be encouraged. Whilst some of the items in the schedule must be carefully considered, I am not prepared to vote against this appropriation.

It has been proved that the woollen mills in Australia can turn out goods which hold their own in the world's markets. Many years ago, when in New Zealand, I met a representative of one of the biggest wool firms at Home, and he told me that the products of the Roslyn and other mills had absolutely nothing to fear in the markets of the world. Under the circumstances, I think that the item of combed wool is perhaps one of the best. The wool industry is the biggest in Australia, and when we have opened up that beautiful country between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, we shall have room for millions more sheep. The world's supply of wool must come largely from Australia, and the proposal in the Bill is, perhaps, encouragement of the woollen industry.

When we have imposed a progressive land tax on the big estates, large tracts of country, now idle, will be put to their proper use. At present only 5 per cent, of the alienated land of New South Wales is cultivated, and we may be sure that it is the best land, while in Viccoria there are millions of acres of splendid country still untilled. If , by means of a land tax, these lands are brought under cultivation, and industries introduced which require small areas with gration will boom. ought, therefore, to be pleased that the Government, with their very .limited following, have the courage to enter upon such a policy as that indicated by the B ill . I hope honourable members will assist to hasten the prosperity which we may expect in a few years by opening out the lands to cultivation. No one can take exception to the principle of the measure. way of doing what a Tariff essays to do in a very indirect, and sometimes very unsatisfactory, way; it is for this reason a measure in which everything depends on detail. If any one were willing to distribute a certain amount of money among -deserving persons, the whole population would assent, and difference of opinion would arise only as to who were deserving. No doubt, under a form of Government in which the most intellectual and wisest people were in office -permanently , I mean 51 it would be very desirable that certain industries and certain individuals should be favoured in the way indicated. But I am bound to confess that, although I have heard a great deal since I arrived the other day about the items in the schedule, and I have heard to-night more about Angora goats and white ants than ever I heard in my life-thei r habits seem to be quite familiar to certain gentlemen who have been putting in a profitable time for the a good start towards the country in the Northern Territory-som e of the items do not commend themselves to me. We are not here to waste the public money, but to put it out to advantage, and we have at our disposal a very limited The banks are running over with amount. Some of the items in the schedule are very good, and some are not good, and those that are good seem not to be encouraged by a sufficient bonus, while quite a number, which are to be encouraged, seem to me to be of no use. The history of every country is studded with cases where industries have produced just enough to obtain a bonus, and have then faded away In other countries, if not here, capital has been diverted fro m other industries into the beet-sugar industry, which was not, in itself originally, sufficiently profitable, and the bonus having been procured'-whic h made the industry profitable to those engaged-productio n ceased. That is not the sort of thing we want to encourage. I say nothing about cotton, although it is very clear from the intense cultivation, then immireport of the Queensland experts that, Honourable members unless a market is found for cotton seed, the growth of cotton is not likely to be profitable. I emphatically take exception to the item of mohair, because if there is any logic in the argument of those gentlemen who recommend that there should be no bounty on concentrated milk, on the ground that that would divert capi, tal from the manufacture of butter, the stimulation of the mohair industry would certainly divert capital from It is a plain and direct more profitable undertakings.

MrW . H . IRVINE (Flinders) [9.53]: I hope that the honourable member for Dalley will not press the amendment, because it places many honourable members in a false position. us have taken exception to the time and manner in which the Bill has-been introduced, we are in favour of. the principle of. bounties, and are of opinion that the best thing we can do is to deal with the schedule as soon as possible, afterwards recommitting this clause to bring it into harmony with any alterations that may be made in the schedule. orable and learned member for Flinders complains that the amendment puts those who are in favour of bounties in a false position; but what about those who oppose the granting of bounties ? No member of the Committee has strongly supported the measure, and most of the speakers seem to think that the £ 5 3 0 , 0 0 0 mentioned in the clause will be wasted. The honourable member for Darling favoured us with a long philosophic disquisition, in which he tried to show that a nigger is sometimes not a nigger, but he did not deal with the question at issue. I have always been opposed to the granting of bounties, and pointed out last night that the granting of bounties is a step towards Socialism, because State aid must be followed by State control. I , as an anti-Socialist, do not desire to take this step. If we vote public money to support the olive industry, why should we not similarly give assistance to every other industry in Australia, .and then assume control over them? . spoke of the B ill as designed to increase the prosperity of the country; but the industries mentioned in the schedule, even if established here, would not affect our conditions very much. Furthermore, the granting of .£1,000 to one industry and £[2,000 -to another is not likely to be of much asMoney that is sistance. The honourable member for Wentworth has spoken of the amendment as -trifling with the question, and thinks that it would be better to negative the.clause; but I have already replied to the contention The amendment -of those, who have asked for a postponement on the ground that the Government .should, before bringing forward proposals involving large expenditure, make a statement of the financial position. I have shown that the Postmaster-General, in bringing down a B ill for the establishment of penny postage, could be met with the objection that no financial statement had been made showing the probable effect of his proposal upon the revenue. I suggested that to press such an objection would be equivalent to a vote of censure upon the Although a number of Government for its slovenly method of doing things. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Flinders that no great enterprise should be undertaken without considering its probable effect on the finances. No man in private life who desired to remain solvent would begin an enterprise of magnitude until he had ascertained his financial position. The Government, however, is supported by a majority. That was shown by the action of Parliament last week in passing the SupplyB ill . WhatI shall propose if the amendment be carried is that £ 3 3 0 , 0 0 0 be devoted to the establishment of the iron industry, and £[100,000 to the establishment of the shipbuilding' industry. I hope for the support of those who are in favour of the granting of bounties for the establishment of industries. Most of the Ministers have declared themselves in favour of a bounty on iron, and have voted for such a bounty. The iron industry would provide employment for highly-paid artisans; but most of the industries mentioned in the schedule require low-paid labour for their success. The Postmaster-General has been a sturdy advocate of a bounty on iron, and has contended that it would provide employment for thousands of persons. able member help us next time ?

If we reduced the items to the -extent of £[100,000 or £200,000, we .should then be able to devote part of this proposed appropriation to a much better *ise than if we expended it on some of the proposed bounties. throw a lot of this money into the Yarra .as to vote it away under the conditions prescribed by the Bill. If this amount is to be expended, I wish to see it wisely used, and I maintain there is no prospect of its being wisely, or at all events, effectively used unless we obtain the best skill to guide those who will engage in these industries, and so enable them to work under the most favorable conditions. the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill came to a close, I was engaged in another part of the building .attending to my correspondencea work that I should have deferred had I thought that the discussion was likely to collapse -so suddenly. HadI been present, I should certainly have called for a division. I cannot support any amendment which proposes a reduction of the amount to be appropriated for these bounties only with the object of spending the balance in other similar directions. I was prepared to move the omission of the words "" and thirty thousand."" would have left a sum of only £500 to be expended during a period of fifteen years with respect to these bounties, and would have had the effect of destroying the whole proposal. I am pledged to oppose bounties. As one of the few remaining free traders in the House, I regard the granting of bounties, except in the special circumstances to which I referred in my speech on the second reading of the Bill as being only one degree less objectionable than the imposition of protective duties. The best course to pursue is not to vote for an amendment which will simply mean that part of the total appropriation will be diverted from certain items in the schedule toothers to be proposed, but to reject the whole clause. We should have a straight out vote -on the question of whether or not an appropriation should be made for this purpose. I am fortified in my determination t'o vote against these bounties by the statement which the Postmaster-General made in answer to the honourable member for Dalley, who inquired whether it was the intention of the Government to submit proposals for the granting of bounties to other departments of industry. I gathered from that statement that a short time hence further proposals will be made for the expenditure of still more public money in this direction. very good, but the well is fairly dry. winlc is as good as a nod to a blind horse. The honourable gentleman allowed it to be inferred, from his remarks, that if we agreed to the appropriation of £530,000 for the purposes named in the Bill, we should be asked to sanction a further expenditure in respect of other bounties*. That is an additional reason why this clause should be opposed. I hope we shall have a division on the question of the appropriation, so that we may know exactly what attitude honourable members take up. like to point out to those who say that instead of pressing my amendment, I should refrain from taking action until we reach the schedule, that even if I succeeded in securing the omission of nineteen of the twenty-two items in that schedule we should not have a sufficient sum provided by this Bill to give assistance to the iron industry, to say nothing of the ship-building trade. The only two items in respect of which a Such an amendment, if adopted, substantial sum is to be set apart are those relating to wool combing and "" fish preserved in tins or casks."" If any items in the schedule can be defended, they are the. only two, and if others were agreed to, I should be compelled to support them. Any industry that is powerful enough to have friends in this House will naturally secure assistance. I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether it is contemplated to propose in the Budget any extension of the bounty system, or whether the Government are satisfied with the present Bill? If the Government are prepared to make provision for a bonus on iron, my objection to the expenditure under the Bill will cease. am in the proud position that I can do as [' please on fiscal questions, because, when [ went before my electors, I insisted upon having a free hand, and that free hand I am exercising to-night.

[10.34] I am astounded at the speech of the honourable member for Dalley.

I always find, however, that honourable members like the representative of Dalley, whenever they can see some small political advantage to be gained for their constituents, are prepared to throw principles to the winds. As I said before, I am not strongly in favour of bounties, but they represent the best system that can be adopted in regard to some industries at the present time. I ask honourable members not to agree with the honourable member for Dalley, and make the bargain he suggests. 1 am prepared to join the honourable member in assisting the iron industry, as I would in assisting any other industry. method when an industry has been established is to"" impose a duty, so as to protect it against the unfair competition of cheap labour, I hope I shall find the honourable member with me in this connection when the Tariff ""is before us. does not want a bounty House adjourned at 10.46 p.m. Mr Sandford takes the view that a bounty' is not the best mode of encouragement.
