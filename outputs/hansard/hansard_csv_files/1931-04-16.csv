0,"House Of Representatives. Thursday, 16 April, 1981. Took The Chair At 2.30 P.m., And Offered Prayers. War Indebtedness To United Ter) [2.32]","by leave-In connection with the recent negotiations in regard to the war indebtedness of Australia to the Government of the United Kingdom, it has been agreed between the two Governments that the following statement be made:""When the Prime Minister of Australia attended the Imperial Conference last year, he discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the question of the revision of the terms on which Australia's war indebtedness to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom was funded in 1921. The negotiations were continued after the Prime Minister's return to Australia. The indebtedness funded under the Agreement of 1921 represented the advances made by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia for war expenditure, and totalled £92,480,156. At the time when arrangements were made for these advances, His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia expressed the desire that Ausonly the actual cost of the advances to tralia should bear the whole cost of its war effort. Accordingly, it was agreed that the moneys would he lent to Australia at the rates of interest at difficult time, on the United Kingdom which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom itself borrowed them. This principle'was embodied in the Funding Agreement of 1921, which provided that the average rate of interest on the indebtedness would be £4 18s. 4d. per cent, per annum, representCommonwealth's present difficulties, ing the cost to Great Britain of raising and, in spite of Great Britain's grave the loans from which the advances were made. In addition, the Funding Agreement provided that His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia would make sinking fund payments sumcient to bring the total annual payment for interest and sinking fund up to 6 per cent., and thus provide for the repayment of the total indebtedness during a period of 36 years from 1921. In the recent negotiations, His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia asked that the rate of interest be reduced, that the period for repayment of the principal sum be extended, and that the half-yearly instalment of £2,774,404 due on the 31st March, 1931, be funded. In support of this claim, His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia represented that whilst the heavy annual payments under the present agreement had been within Australia's capacity during years of buoyant revenue, the serious fall in national income had entirely altered the position. Moreover, unemployment, reductions in wages and general governmental expenditure, greatly increased taxation and high exchange charges, had enforced heavy sacrifices on the Australian people, and had considerably increased the relative burden of interest payments, including those under the funding agreement. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom replied that, in their view, the 1921 agreement represented a fair and generous interpretation of the desire expressed by the Commonwealth to bear the whole cost of their war effort. The annuities represented Australia, and the reduction of the Australian payments meant throwing an additional burden, at an exceptionally taxpayers, who had also to face very great difficulties in respect of debt, taxation and unemployment. At the same time. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom stated it fully sympathized with the problems, both financial and economic, was ready to respond to the appeal of",10,Setup

2,Mr Scuiilrj (Yarra,"Prime Ministhe Oommonwealth by a substantial temporary reduction of payments due. Accordingly, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom expressed its willinguess to agree that His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia should have the option of postponing four half-yearly payments, of £814,200 each, of the sinking fund on the Australian indebtedness to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. In postponing these payments, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom did not propose to increase the amount of future annuities, but only to prolong the period of repayment by two years. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom hoped this offer would be accepted as a sincere endeavour on its part, despite its own difficulties, to share the burden under which the Commonwealth is labouring. His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia expressed appreciation of the friendly spirit animating this offer, and, in accepting it, acknowledged that it wjould give material temporary relief. The effect of this arrangement will be a reduction of over £1,600,000 per annum in the payments to be made by the Commonwealth to Great Britain under the funding agreement during each of the next two financial years, and the extension of the period of repayment of the principal debt by two years. will also be relieved of the exchange charges which would have been payable if the repayments had not been deferred. His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia still holds the view that there are good grounds for an extension of the period for the repayment of the Australian debt to Great Britain. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, on the other hand, considers that as repayments of capital will be entirely suspended for two years, and a further revision of the period of repayment would not afford any immediate relief, consideration of the question is at present neither necessary nor desirable. His Majesty's Government in th« United Kingdom expresses the hope that by 1933 the economic situation in Australia will have so greatly improved that the need for any further revision will not arise. leave-Honorabl e members and Australian citizens generally will receive with great interest and real relief the statement by the Prime Minister. Those feelings will, however, be tinged with regret that the economic circumstances of Australia should have made necessary such an appeal to the Government of Great Britain. The alterations in the funding agreement have been arranged in the right way-by friendly approach and negotiation and not by bluster and threats. If we ever lose our friends in Great Britaini t will be our own fault. In 1926, when Mr Bruce and I were attending an Imperial Conference, we approached the British Government with the object of securing a revision of the funding agreement in a manner favorable to Australia in relation to both the period of repayment and the rate of interest. At that time, however, the relative economic circumstances of Great Britain and Australia were such that we felt unable to press our representations further. I welcome, as I believe the Australian people will, the announcement the Prime Minister has made. The Commonwealth budget for Trade and Customs) [2.40] -by leave -My attention has been drawn to a letter published under the heading, ""Ugly Rumours "", in the Labor Daily, Sydney, of 10th April, over the signature of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), in which he accuses me of rushing the tabling of the duty on petrol in containers of less than 40 gallons at the last moment before the adjournment of the Parliament for the Easter recess. He also states that there are ugly rumours afloat, that it is well-known that this duty will close down all small concerns operating in Australia, and that it will leave an open field for exploitation by the big combined oil interests. These statements are not only untrue, but also very unfair; and it is a",10,Kingdom

4,Mr Forde (Capricornia,"Ministe rpity that the honourable member did. not make some effort to ascertain the facts before rushing to the press and making irresponsible statements and contemptible insinuations. What was done was what the big oil companies, comprising Shell, Vacuum Oil Company, Atlantic Union, Texaco, and others did not want us to do. No tariff question has received more consideration than that of the duties on petrol. It is one of the most contentious subjects which have been before the Government. to charge an additional 1-Jd. per gallon on petrol in containers covering both drums, and tins and cases, was first included in the schedule introduced on the 11th December, 1929, as a deferred duty as a result of a decision made by Mr Eenton before he went to England, and it had quite a lot to recommend it. The deferred duty was, however, postponed from time to time, pending an investigation by the Tariff Board. The Board reported on the 6th November, 1930, aud recommended that the deferred duty be applied to petrol imported in cans and cases, but not to petrol imported in drums. The Board's recommendation was put into operation on the 25th March, 1931, four months later, after the whole matter had been fully considered by a sub-committee of Cabinet. It cannot, therefore, be said, with any semblance of truth, that this decision was rushed. imposed were not what were asked for by the major oil companies. Tariff Board's report has been circulated for the information of honourable members. It recommended against the additional duty on petrol in drums for the reason that largesize drums were not being made in Australia, and there was no certainty, on account of the cost of manufacture, that the duty, if imposed, would lead to local manufacture. of the board, it would be more profitable to import the petrol in drums than to import it in bulk and pack it into locally-made drums. The duty would merely add to the cost of the petrol without conferring any benefit on any local industry. The board added that to permit importation in drums over 40 gallons would enable the Mr Forde. independent importers to continue a business which otherwise they would have to forego, and that it was desirable that the competition resulting from their operation should be preserved. The board, however, considered that, as, at present, a number of well-established plants in the Commonwealth producing cans and cases are capable of supplying the whole of our requirements, there appeared to be no good reason why the petrol sold in cases and cans should not The proposal be packed in Australian-made containers. It pointed out that the local manufacturers are at a disadvantage in competing with imported cans and cases containing petrol and on which no duty is levied. The board did not think that much additional employment would result from the imposition of the duty, but if not imposed there was likely to be a loss in existing employment. The board stated further that, if the duty were imposed, some of the package business would be diverted to bulk, but any disability suffered in this respect by the independent importers should be greatly minimized if they can continue to import petrol in drums. On the 19th November, 1930, Mr Cornfsrth, of the Vacuum Oil Company, Mr Darch, of the Shell Company, and Mr Eyan, of the Atlantic Union Company, waited on the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) and myself and made Furthermore, the duties representations in favour of the deferred duty being imposed on petrol in The drums as well as on petrol in tins and oases. Mr Darch said that the Shell Company had an established industry making tins and cases, and had to pay 8d. per case duty en raw material, while its competitors could import their petrol ready packed without additional duty being charged. He further stated that protection against tins and cases alone would not be sufficient because the imFurther, in the opinion portation of petrol in drums was killing probably the tin and case trade, and that, if protection were given, the difference in price between packaged petrol and bulk petrol would not be increased. He added that if the protection were not given against petrol in drums, the case and tin factories would have to close down and that 100 hands had already been put off, reducing the number of employees from 500 to 400. the duty was not placed on drums as well as cans and cases, it would be better to put it on none. Mr Cornforth also stated that if the suggested duty were put on tins and cases only, it would have the effect of practically putting the t in and case plants out of existence, and it would materially affect the local canister makers because the case business of to-day would revert largely to drums. Gleeson, of DnitedO i l Products Company, Melbourne, representing the independent importers, interviewed me in January, 1931, and stated, among other things, that his company did not want the deferred duty to be placed on petrol in drums because that was the only way it had of bringing in supplies. On the 19th February last, a deputation, introduced by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Holloway), and the honorahle member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney), urged that the deferred duty be operated on petrol in drums as well as on tins and cases. A t this deputation the following bodies were represented:The Chambers of Manufactures of all States except Tasmania, Victorian Box and Can Makers Association, Canister and Drum Manufacturers of all States except Tasmania, Sheet Metal Workers Unions, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. Shortly before the resolutions of March were introduced, Senator Millen, on behalf of the VacuumO i l Company, of which company I understand he is a director, made strong representations to me and to the Comptroller General of Customs, that the duty should be imposed on petrol in drums as well as on petrol in tins and cases, and f a i l in g that, that no duty should be charged. From what I have said, it w ill be learned that the major o i l companies and other parties interested, except the independent importers, desired that the deferred duty should be imposed upon petrol imported in drums as well as petrol in tins and cases; that it would be of no benefit to i m pose it upon petrol in cans and cases only, if petrol in drums were excepted. Having these representations and reports, the Tariff Sub-committee of the Cabinet, after f u l l consideration, decided to adopt the recommendations of the Tariff Board and included the item in He expressed the opinion that if the March tariff proposals accordingly four months after the report of the Tariff Board had been received. These recommendations, in the opinion of the Tariff Board, were founded on the evidence submitted to the board, and the sub-committee could see no good reason for departing from them. Instead of resulting in the closing down of the small concerns, the action taken should have Mr P. J. quite the opposite effect. Thati t should, as alleged, leave an open field for exploitation by the big combined interests, is incomprehensible, in view of the representations made by and on behalf of the major companies, which distinctly indicated that the additional duty on petrol in tins and cases only did not suit them, and would be ineffective from their stand-point, unless it were imposed on petrol imported in drums as well as in cases and cans. The following statement is taken from an article headed, "" Petroli u Bulk,"" which appeared in the Melbourne Argus of the 10th A p r i l , 1931:It is explained by the oil companies that no reduction has been made in the price of motor spirit in cases and tins, owing to the fact that the recent duty of l*d. a gallon on petrol imported in this form has not been extended to petrol imported in drums. In the last few years the oil companies, whicli have established extensive plants in the Commonwealth, have had to face increasing competition from sources which have not incurred a capital outlay of any extent to carry on their business ""in Australia. The oil companies state that these competitors render no service to Australia, and operate only in the few most selected centres. On the other hand, the combined capital investments in the Commonwealth of the leading oil companies, it is stated, approximate £20,000,000,and tlie annual wages bill of the companies concerned ranges from £6,000,000 to £8,000,000. The competitors of these companies import their supplies in drums, tins, and cases, but now that the impost of l^d. a gallon on petrol imported in tins and cases comes into operation, the use by them of tins and cases may cease. The competitive trade may now be restricted by these importers to petrol in drums, which will not have to carry the extra charge of Hd. a gallon duty. A few years ago, the principal oil companies decided to import their motor spirit in bulk, and some of them established tin and case plants in Australia. The bulk importing system brought considerable demands to Australian tin and case makers, with the result that their businesses expanded, and a great many more persons were employed than formerly. The managing director of one of the large oil companies said yesterday, that as petrol imported in drums was exempt from the duty of l j d . per gallon, which applied to petrol in tins and cases, it would probably be found necessary for the oil companies to discontinue I have no answer to it at all, or that I am to supply petrol in cases and tins. When existing contracts with Australian canister makers had been completed, he added, they would not be renewed, because it would be necessary to use drums. Thus a large number of workers would have to be dispensed with. Primary producers in the more distant parts of the Commonwealth would be put to inconvenience, because it would be necessary for them to take drums. Many farmers and others preferred to purchase motor spirit in cases and tins, because they valued the packages. It declared that my statement was irresponwas unlikely, however, that they would pay a high price for petrol in cases and tins when it could be obtained in drums for about 3d. per gallon less. Should the duty be imposed on petrol imported in drums, there would be no need to suspend operations of the case and tin plants, and petrol in cases and tins would participate in tlie reduction in the price applied to that in bulk and drums. Notwithstanding this, there has recently been some activity in the can and case business. In New South Wales an order for 4,000 four-gallon tins per month has been placed with a local manufacturer by one of the oil companies. Another company has stated its intention of ordering requirements locally after present stocks are depleted. The Queensland Can Company has recently received an order for 100,000 tins from one of the large oil oompanies, and a sample order for 150 .'.ases has been placed with a case factory at Perth. Referring again to the allegations of the honourable member for Werriwa, I do not know what, if any, "" ugly rumours "" are afloat, but I do most emphatically resent the imputations conveyed by such statements, as the action taken by my colleagues and myself was open and above board, and was based on a report of the Tariff Board, a body appointed by the Bruce-Page Government. The report has been made available to honourable members, and to the public. That report, in our judgment, contained recommendations which seemed to provide a fair and reasonable solution of the difficulties of the conflicting interests concerned. by leave-It is difficult to follow the statement as read by the Minister for Customs( Mr Eorde). can read it in Hansard. and I shall answer it at the proper time. UnlessI make some reference to it now, however, it may appear to the public that evading the issue. The Minister accused me of making irresponsible statements. Nothing that I have said has been half so irresponsible as the statements made by the Minister. -Order! sible. that it was untrue. so far as to say that. I repeat that ugly rumours are in circulation regarding this matter. I have evidence of that but I left it at home, thinking that no discussion would take place on this subject until the tariff debate came on. I am prepared to stand by every line I wrote in the Labor Daily. rumours are. in innuendoes. We know that, in spite of the Tariff Board's report, the Minister informed honourable members that he did not intend to impose this duty. tended to put a duty on petrol drums. promise, the Minister, just before members left for their homes, tabled an amended tariff schedule imposing the new duty. It was done with almost indecent haste, the Minister's action suggesting that there had been some sudden occurrence which had caused him to change his mind. It was evident that it had nothing to do with the Tariff Board's report, because that report was in the Minister's possession at the time when he informed the House that it was not the Government's intention to impose the duty. I shall leave the matter at this point for the time being, but when the tariff debate, which has already been too long delayed, comes on, the Minister will hear more from me. and his colleagues can force the Government to bring on the tariff debate. of the kind.",11,Peteol Duties

Altogether 73,000 articles, including jackets, greatcoats, and breeches, will be made available. The stores are held principally in New South Wales and Victoria, and will have to be distributed on a pro rata basis to the States, which have no stocks themselves. The distribution will bb made on condition that the State Governments shall bear the cost of dyeing, and will defray freight charges. The New South Wales Government cannot see its way to pay for dyeing, and in the case of that State other arrangements have had to be made.

NEW ENGLAND AND NEW SOUTH Makin) I have received a communication from the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) intimating that this afternoon he desires to move the adjournment of the House in order to direct attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The position in which residents of New South Wales, and taxpayers of other States, find themselves owing to the proposed action of the New South Wales Government in respect to its future financial obligations."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. The Prime Minister stated last night, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, that the New South Wales Government had recently paid certain interest which was due on the 1st April on account of its American debt, but had declined to pay interest to British investors on 3 per eent. and 5 per cent, loans then falling due, and had also failed to pay the sum of £453,000 on account of Australian indebtedness during the last two months. I congratulate the Government on having kept the name of Australia high by meeting those obligations, although, unhappily, the name of New South Wales has been dragged in the mud. This default on the part of the New South Wales Government is the most shameful act in the whole history of the British dominions, and it raises most important issues, touching both our national honour and our material interests. What we have to consider is how we can most quickly counteract the effect of this action of the Premier of New South Wales( Mr Lang), and prevent its repetition. Three immediate questions arise. Will the default of New South Wales tend to compel default on the part of the Commonwealth, and, if so, what can be quickly done to prevent that? What can be done to protect the taxpayers of other States from being unfairly burdened with the payment of interest on debt that New South Wales has incurred? What steps can the Commonwealth immediately take to ensure that money raised by taxation in New South Wales, for the specific purpose of paying interest, in a considerable part of that State, shall be applied in a legal and constitutional manner to the purposes for which it was raised? This default of New South Wales damages not merely the external credit of that State and of Australia, but it also imposes great disadvantages upon the whole country. honourable member to go too far into that matter since it is siib judice. cuss the legal aspect of the subject, I am more concerned with the future action to be taken by this Parliament in regard to the raising of taxes to enable us to meet this position.

39,Dr. Earle Page,"Many convenprovides very definitely in section 51 paraincome taxation by two-thirds of the graph, i i , that the Commonwealth cannot discriminate between States or parts of States in the levying of taxation. Consequently the Government cannot put a special tax upon the people of New South Wales in order to recoup the amount that must be paid in interest on account of that State. It will have to impose general taxation on the whole of Australia to obtain this money. But what field of taxation is left unexplored which is likely to yield millions of pounds? Our customs duties have been increased repeatedly during the last eighteen months with the object of adding to the revenue, but unfortunately the result is that the amount now being received through the customs is diminishing rather than increasing. The amount received so far this financial year is £8,000,000 less than the amount of anticipated receipts from this source for the nine months that have elapsed, and it is quite likely that by the end of the year it will be £10,000,000 less than the estimate. £2,000,000 less than the estimate. The March income tax returns are £700,000 less than the returns for the corresponding month of last year, and the post office receipts are £1,600,000 less than the amount expected to be received for the nine months of the financial year that have elapsed. It must be quite evident, therefore, that it is hopeless to expect to obtain additional revenue from these sources. The Government must look to new sources of revenue to meet these unexpected charges. vantage in this respect compared with the States. The money paid in interest by the State Governments is obtained largely from receipts received from various public services such as the railways, although a certain proportion of the receipts from taxation are also devoted to this purpose. The New South Wales Government receives about 3 per cent, on the total amount borrowed or three-fifths, of its total interest payments through the railways. Gommonwealth Government to increase its revenue by £6,000,000, it would be necessary to increase the sales tax by one and a half times above what it is to-day or to increase the Dr. Earle Page. present amount. Of course, the country, could not bear this additional burden. In these circumstances, the people of New England desire me to intimate to the Commonwealth Government and Parliament that they are prepared to agree that their liability in respect of these payments shall be determined by some impartial tribunal chosen by the Commonwealth Government. They estimate that this liability is between £40,000,000 and £50,000,000, and they are prepared to meet the interest charges on this amount. They are anxious and willing to pay. They also desire me to urge the Prime Minister and the Parliament to take the appropriate action to ensure that the money which is at present being raised in their area for the specific purpose, amongst others, of paying interest on their debts shall be spent in a legal and constitutional way in meeting those commitments. They pray that they may be allowed to keep faith with the Commonwealth, and with the British and AusThe sales tax has yielded tralian investors who lent their money for the development of this area. They also pray that they may be given the opportunity to maintain their honour and their good name and reputation as British and Australian citizens. They assert quite definitely that they are not responsible in any way for the putting into office of the Lang Government in New South Wales. At the last State election 112,000 voters in this area voted against tbe policy of the Lang Government, while only 80,000 voted for it. It is at a disadTwelve members were returned for this area opposed to Mr Lang's policy, and only two in favour of it. The people of New England prepared a draft constitution, at a convention, which was held recently, which they propose to submit to the Commonwealth Parliament as soon as they can obtain the signatures of a sufficient number of petitioners who will declare their readiness to accept that constitution. They intend to ask the Commonwealth To enable the Parliament for permission to carry their own obligations to govern themselves, and to assist the Commonwealth in the difficult times in which it finds itself. I suggest to the Government that one of two courses may be adopted with the object of allowing these people to shoulder their own responsibilities. suggest that it is not possible rapidly, if at all, to secure the assent of the New South Wales Parliament to the proposals of this convention, because there is no certainty when that Parliament will meet or that when it does meet it will approve of the scheme that has been put forward. The people of New England approve of the almost unanimous recommendation made by the Royal Commission on the Constitution for the disintegration of existing States. This commission, which consisted of representatives of the Labour party and other parties as well as of business and other interests, recommended that before any State should be subdivided the proposal should receive the endorsement of 40 per cent, of the electors in the whole of the State, and 60 per cent, of the electors in the area concerned. The commission made that recommendation in the report which was presented to this Parliament in 1929. They recognize that that will occupy some time, and so they urge the Commonwealth Parliament, if it desires that their taxes for this year shall be applied, as they are intended to be, to the specific payment of debts due to Commonwealth and overseas bondholders, to adopt a shorter cut by appealing to the British Parliament to' exercise its original power to legislate at the request of this Parliament. Section8 of the Constitution Act providesAfter tbe passing of this act the Colonial Boundaries Act 1895 shall not apply to any colony which becomes a State of the Commonwealth; but the Commonwealth shall be taken to be a self-governing colony for the purposes of that act. The effect of that is that from the passing of the Constitution Act the Imperial Parliament will legislate in respect of the boundaries of the Commonwealth only. But there is nothing to prevent the Imperial Parliament, at the request of the Commonwealth Parliament, legislating to provide for the State of New South Wales to be disintegrated as it was when Victoria and Queensland were severed from it. That would be justifiable in view of the special circumstances now obtaining; majority of the members of the State Parliament are refusing to pay the interest due by New South Wales te I British and Australian bondholders, but they are discriminating in favour of American bondholders. the people of the whole State were taken on the subject of repudiating debts, would not the majority declare in favour of the payment of the debts? would. The majority of the people of New South Wales, especially the country people in the south, north and west of the State, desire to prevent a repetition of what is occurring to-day, and the only manner in which that can be insured is by giving to them, through a new legislature, control of their own affairs, revenue and expenditure. A referendum by the Commonwealth on that subject might be taken simultaneously with the other. The Commonwealth Parliament, before requesting the Imperial Parliament to intervene, would be justified in conducting such a referendum. It is absolutely necessary that action along these lines be taken, because, unless Ave do something to diminish the power for evil now possessed by the huge State of New South Wales in regard to the breaking of federal contracts, the Commonwealth will be landed in difficulties which it will be unable to survive. The people of New England, and I believe of Riverina also, believe that the Federal Parliament should be unimpeded in its responsibility of maintaining the credit and good name of Australia. It is almost impossible to visualize repudiation by any other State, but if Victoria or Queensland were to follow the example set by Mr Lang, not nearly the same amount of damage to the financial position of the Commonwealth would be done as is being done by New South Wales to-day. I have shown that even if the Commonwealth sets off against the interest payments made on account of New South Wales the payments which would ordinarily be made by the Commonwealth to the State under the roads agreement and in respect of transferred properties, this Parliament will still have to find annually £6,000,000 for the satisfaction of State bondholders.

If one State, especially a big State like New South Wales, should break an agreement which has been entered into in good faith and 101,573,117 in reliance on the honesty and decency 3,047,193 of the contracting governments, there is 667,068 no penal provision for forcing the default3,714,861 ing government to keep to its bargain.

I trust, 13,586,793 therefore, that the Government will 3,714,861 favourably consider my suggestion to 9,871,932 obtain an expression of opinion on this 3,684,871 question from the whole of the people of New South Wales. The matter is urgent, 6,187,061 and can be dealt with immediately. When a similar position arose in the United States of America, and West Virginia 92,215,049 declined to obey the federal law when the 2,766,451 balance of the State of Virginia did 228,729 not, a provisional government was established within ten weeks, and it was 2,995,180 able to collect taxes.

For my own .. part, I am of opinion that the majority,",19,Wales Formalmotion For Adjournment
42,"1,702,574 Mr Scullin (Yarra","-Prime Minisif not the whole, of the people of that State, wish to do this, and I believe that if a vote could be taken my belief would be proved to be correct. The speech of the right honourable member for Cowper raised many important and serious questions. He pointed out that the obligation that has been cast upon the Gommonwealth Government by the default of New South Wales is very serious, and he stated that the people of tfhe northern parts of New South Wales desire action taken by the Commonwealth Government to enable them, at least, to meet their obligations, so that they may not be under the stigma of default. The honourable member indicated three ways in which what they desired could be done. .First, he said, a new State could be set up with the consent of the Parliament of New South Wales. That method at present is, of course, regarded as impossible. The seGond was the adoption of the recommendation of the royal commission that inquired into the Constitution, amending the Constitution so that a vote may be taken on the subject over the whole area of New South Wales, including the portion of .the State concerned. But such an alteration of the Commonwealth require a referendum to the whole of the people of Australia, and the proposal would have to be approved by a majority of the people as a whole, and in a majority of the States. An opportunity will be given to the people of Australia to amend the Constitution at the first opportunity, and when that happens I hope that the people will clothe this Parliament with constitutional powers to enable it to meet circumstances like those which have now arisen, and other circumstances as they arise. The third method suggested, aa one which could immediately be given effect, is to appeal to the British Parliament to pass an act to sub-divide the State of New South Wales. That suggestion does not appeal to me, nor to the Government. We in Australia must work out our own destiny, under the Constitution set up by our people. I believe that the people can and will elect parliaments that will preserve the honour and good name of Australia, without it being necessary to appeal to the British Parliament to interfere. The status of the Commonwealth of Australia as a dominion of the Empire has been greatly enhanced, strengthened and broadened as the result of the recent Imperial Conferences. The 1926 conference laid down certain principles, which were given more concrete form by the last Imperial Conference. Australia has now been given complete autonomy. Such autonomy, howeVer, has not been given to the State Parliaments, and that creates an anomoly. There is, therefore, a strong argument for the alteration of the Commonwealth Constitution so that the Commonwealth Parliament may be able to amend the State Constitutions, and give greater local autonomy. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) raised the question of practical finance. What are we to do? How are we to meet the new financial obligations cast upon us, which he estimates, after making certain deductions, at an amount exceeding £6,000,000 ? This matter is perhaps sub judice, at all events as to the Commonwealth right of recovery and the legal interpretation of the financial agreement, but not as to the effect nor the amount of the default. Upon judgment being obtained in our favour, this Government will take action to enforce it. Constitution would There will be no roundabout method required to remove from the shoulders of the people of Australia the obligation that rightly belongs to New South Wales. Regarding the extent of the default, I point out that the interest payments due to British bondholders on the 1st April was about £730,000, or, adding exchange £952,000. The sum of £730,000 is the amount included in the claim embodied in the writ which had been served upon the State of New South Wales. That is the only amount that is sub judice. In addition, the interest payments due to the Commonwealth Government by the Government of New South Wales total £436,000, including £221,000 of ordinary interest and £215,000 of interest due on loans for soldier settlements. That makes a total default of £1,388,000. If we deduct from that the Commonwealth contribution under the Financial Agreement for March, 1931-£243,000-the net amount for which New South Wales is in default is £1,145,000. The total payments due by New South Wales from the 1st April to the 30th June, in respect of interest payable to British bondholders exchange on that interest, and of interest payable to the Commonwealth, are £3,636,000. The amounts which the Commonwealth may hold as a set-off total £1,3S7,000. Therefore, the net obligation which may fall on the Commonwealth by the 30th June next is £2,249,000. Mr Lang paid to America interest at the rate of 5 per cent., although he refused to pay to British bondholders interest on a 3 per cent. loan. interest due paid to America? date. It is remarkable that Mr Lang can speak about differential treatment between nations, when he takes action that differentiates between America and payment to Great Britain. Mr Lang has stated that the money has been withheld from the British bondholders because it is required to relieve unemployment in Australia. Surely that argument should apply also to the payment of interest due to the bondholders in America. The argument is shallow, and is merely an attempt to obscure the issue. What is the effect of this default? No advantages will be obtained by Australia as the result of it. The effect of Mr honour their bonds, which are often Lang's action is merely to place on the Commonwealth the responsibility for paying interest due by New South Wales. As the Commonwealth must recoup itself by collecting the money from the States, New South Wales gains nothing. The burden is not lessened, but only shifted temporarily. Many disadvantages must arise as the result of the default. Our credit, both in London and Australia, has been adversely affected. The time when we might expect to raise money overseas has been indefinitely deferred. In Australia, the proposed wheat loan for the relief of distress among wheat growers had to be abandoned, although everything was in readiness for giving effect to it. The hope of a loan for new works in the near future has disappeared. The general effect of the Lang policy in. New South Wales will be-(a ) The destruction of confidence in government contracts; (b) The encouragement of breaches of contract by private individuals; (c) The refusal of taxpayers to pay taxation, especially those affected by interest reductions; (d) The reduction of interest to savings bank depositorsthere is £31,000,000 of deposits invested in the government securities of New South Wales; (e) The flight of capital from New South Wales, and the curtailment of credit; (/) The inability to raise loans for public works and wheat relief; (g) Tbe serious damage to trade and industry, which will result in unprecedented unemployment. any figures to show what amount of money has been withdrawn from the savings bank of New South Wales by depositors ? payment to propose to quote them. should be quoted. advisable to make the figures known. The action of Mr Lang has damaged our trade and industry, and weakened faith in government promises. Government loans are debts of honour, but there is no means of recovering from governments without the possibility of international complications. If governments definitely and deliberately refuse to termed gilt-edged securities, they break their word of honour to the people. There is nothing more serious than deliberate default. Mr Lang, when he took office, was, no doubt, faced with great financial difficulties; but these were increased by his own action. He refused to take his place on the Loan Council, excepting at the first meeting after his election, and he refused to co-operate with the Commonwealth and the State Governments in securing financial relief. His action has frightened investors and others, and has endangered the financial stability, not only of New South Wales, but also of the whole Commonwealth. Despite his aloofness, his Government has been generously treated by the Commonwealth aud the Loan Council ever since it has been in office. It has been granted money for the relief of unemployment, and has had increased loan allocations. Mr Lang was offered assistance in securing the money necessary to pay British bondholders on the 1st of April, and also the money necessary for the relief of wheat-growers.",20,Queensland

Until Mr Lang announced his policy of default, the Loan Council and the Commonwealth assisted him in every way. His actions have cut across the Federal Government's policy and endangered its adoption. The Lang policy, instead of giving relief to unemployed and to starving people as he claimed it would, must ultimately add to their miseries. The right policy is to stand up to our debts, to employ people on works, and to increase production. That is the definite policy of this Government. We cannot assist the unemployed or necessitous wheat-growers if we weaken confidence in this country, and destroy tbe nation's credit. We believe in taking proper and permanent methods to meet the immediate situation. With proper assistance from the banks, our policy of providing work for the unemployed, and increasing production, could, immediately, be given effect, but in the absence of their co-operation, this Government has been forced to ask Parliament to approve of new measures to obtain the finance necessary to enable it to carry out its policy. We cannot accept the suggestion of the right honourable member for Cowper, but the Commonwealth Government will take the proper action to recover the amount due to the Commonwealth. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has rendered a service in bringing this question before the House, thus enabling the Prime Minister to take advantage of a convenient opportunity to make a statement. Eecent events have demonstrated the value of the financial agreement to the Commonwealth, and to the people of Australia as a whole. If a State had defaulted in the absence of the financial agreement, almost inevitably the Commonwealth would, in order to protect the general credit of the governments of Australia, have been forced into meeting the amounts due. Under the financial agreement, however, the Commonwealth Government has the right to meet those amounts, and to take legal action to recover them from the defaulting State. An agreement between Governments rests upon the good faith of the governments concerned, but when the financial agreement was drafted, and an amendment was made in the Constitution dealing with this matter, provision was made for the enforcement of the agreement, not only in the terms of the agreement itself, but also in the new section 105A of the Constitution. I suggest to the Government that if it should find any difficulty of a technical nature in the enforcement of the agreement, reference should be made to section 105A, sub-section 3 of the Constitution, which provides that the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws for the carrying out by the parties to the agreement of the terms of the agreement. I am sure that this House, and this Parliament as a whole, with very few dissentients, would support the Government in any proposal for new legislation designed to carry out the agreement made by the Commonwealth and the States. I specifically mention that, because it is possible that legislation by this Parliament might facilitate matters on this occasion, or in the future. The right honourable member for Cowper referred to those portions of New South Wales which desire to dissociate themselves from the action of what I shall call the Sydney Government. say. The honourable member knows that he is speaking of the New South Wales Government. ber knows quite well to what I am referring. I have the right, I think, to make a distinction between the mind of that Government, and of the people of New South Wales as a whole, the majority of whom are certainly opposed to the action of the Government. In many parts of New South Wales exception is being taken to the policy of the Government, which is, of course, in the legal sense, the Government of New South Wales. Sections 101 to 124 of the Constitution, which have to do with the formation of new States, can only be applied after the fulfilment of many conditions. One of these is the consent of the Parliament of the State concerned. The actual result is that those parts of New",22,Queensland

As a general rule, I would not favour any proposal to go outside Australia for the purpose of obtaining legislaseriously consider this proposal. tion affecting Australia. When, however, a very desirable object is to be achieved, when those concerned feel very strongly on the matter, and have sound reasons for so feeling, when the credit of the country is at stake, then, I suggest, consideration should be given even to an extraordinary remedy of this character. Suppose a particular area of New South Wales, containing a population greater than that of some of the existing States, to be practically unanimous in its desire to form itself into a new State, and suppose that practically unanimous desire to arise from a definite infringement of the law by the Government of the State; aud suppose the Parliament representing the whole of Australia to be also practically unanimous in its wish to give effect to the desire of the area concerned, then, under those extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, it would be certainly proper to consider the advisability of applying to the Imperial Government to exercise its supreme legislative authority. tralia.

At the 1930 Imperial Conference it was expressly agreed by the governments of all the dominions and the Government of Great Britain, that Imperial legislation might properly be passed relating to any dominion at the request, and with the consent of, that dominion. That is a useful reserve power, and should, I believe, continue to exist. In normal .cirsay that we should appeal to Great cumstances no one would dream of suggesting the utilization of such a power, and it is only because of the present very exceptional circumstances that I suggest that the Government should at least conThat appears sider the desirability of taking what I admit would be extraordinary action to deal with an extraordinary situation. If the Government and Parliament of New South Wales saw that there was a real risk of losing a large part of the area of the State, that would, I believe, prove more effective at the present time than any threat of legal proceedings. I suggest that the Government should When the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) states his readiness to ask the Imperial Government to interfere with the governmental affairs of this country, it makes one wonder where we are drifting. I am convinced that the statesmen of Great Britain have more sense than the Leader of the Opposition, and that if any such request were made they would tell us to settle our own difficulties. It is not likely that Britain, in this day and generation, would consent to get herself embroiled in quarrels with her overseas dominions. When the day comes that the Imperial Government, at the request of the self-appointed advocates of vested interests, interferes with the domestic affairs of any of her dominions, on that day will begin the dissolution of the British Empire. Honourable members opposite who scoff show that they have learned nothing from history. I should like to see more evidence of the spirit of Sir Henry Parkes in matters of this kind; a greater determination to safeguard the right of this country to govern itself. When Sir Henry Parkes was Premier of New South Wales he refused to allow a ship-load of Chinese to land in Sydney. The British Government cabled to him stating that he was interfering with the rights of the Chinese nationals under a treaty entered into by Britain. Sir Henry Parkes, who was not an Australian, but an Englishman, cabled back that Britain could alter her treaties or Australia would make her own. That is the spirit we need in Australia at the present time. It is tragic to see honourable members get up in this House and Britain to settle our difficulties. Sueh",23,Queensland

As for the agitation in favour of the formation of new States, it is remarkable that the only time the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) becomes active in this matter is when he finds himself in Opposition. It is useful to him then; but during the five years when he held office under the Bruce-Page was in a position to dictate its policy, he was silent about new States.

He did speak very feebly on the subject on one or two occasions. For my part, I do not wish to see new States created. I desire this Parliament, and this Parliament alone, to be the supreme legislative authority in Australia. After listening to the speeches of the right honourable member for Cowper and of the Prime Minister, one could not help sensing the atmosphere of mutual admiration in which the subject was being discussed.

I do not intend now to deal with the constitutional difficulties in the way of that reform, but a situation has arisen that justifies the representatives of that area in this chamber in bringing the wishes of those people under notice.

74,Mr Thompson,"I think that theallowing for the constitutional difficulties, a rid the fact that we bave had to recognize that the establishment of a new State would be a long and difficult process, there comes a stage at which we are entitled to ask for some support from the National Parliament ""in a situation that has brought the agitation to a head. Hitherto, we have based our agitation upon the ground of the general misgovernment of our area, not by the Lang Government only, but by all the governments of New South ""Wales for many years past. But we did not contemplate that the Lang Government would commit an act of .the grossest infamy, and that more than 400,000 people in Northern New South Wales, who have been agitating for separation for years, would be committed, without consultation, to a policy that must be absolute anathema to every person with decent and honourable instincts. The repudiation action of the Jifew South Wales Government came upon us like a bolt from the blue, and is hateful to the vast majority of our people. It may be said that some people living in Northern New South Wales support the Lang Government; but I point out that only 70,000 votes were recorded for the Labour party at the last election, while 112,000 were recorded against it. Although our people returned to Parliament members who had no mandate to approve of a policy of this description, we are committed to it for the next three years. This policy will be disastrous to the State, and will be an everlasting humiliation to all her citizens. We have approached the National Government with this request on the grounds of emergency and urgency. We are prepared to shoulder our own obligations. If there is no other way of enabling us to do so than by invoking the aid of the British Parliament, we ask, as people who have been seeking self-government for many years, that such aid shall be sought. Every time the request of the people of New England for separation from New South Wales is referred to in this Parliament, honourable members opposite jeer and sneer at the advocates of the new State, and put every possible difficulty in the way of the achievement of their objects. member support a referendum for the abolition of all States? is ridiculous to ask me such a question. That policy is quite antagonistic to the movement which I represent. We are prepared to support the holding of a referendum with the object of revising the Commonwealth Constitution to give this Parliament power to facilitate the establishment of new States or provinces. We are reiterating our desire for separation at this time, because of the disgracef u l action of the New South Wales Government, which we feel makes it impossible for us to hold up our heads as honourable citizens of that State. Our people have been bled white by the taxation imposed upon them by the New South Wales Government; but the present Government has increased this taxation by 33-J per cent. Four hundred thousand of us are now contributing about £10 per head in direct taxation to New South Wales. The revenue received from us is in the neighbourhood of £4,500,000. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has indicated that the interest debt in respect of works constructed in New England is about £2,500,000 per annum. Seeing that we are contributing very much more than that amount to the New South Wales Government, we are justified in expressing our indignation against the shameful way in whicli that Government is robbing us. We are not receiving value for the money we pay to the New South Wales Government. It is Dot being used for the economic development of our area, and, consequently, we feel that it is the last straw for us to be connected in any way with a policy which involves the repudiation of honourable obligations. We have not subscribed to that policy at any time, nor have we ever subscribed to the policy if the party responsible for it. If the Commonwealth Government intends to adopt the attitude that it cavt do nothing for us, and that the Imperial Parliament is not likely to concern itself with our request we are at a dead end. If the Government will not agree to the holding of a referendum to ascertain the view of the people of New England on the separation of that area from New South Wales, we ask it to give the",26,Queensland

Many honourable members opposite favour an amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution which will give this Parliament the power to amend the Constitution; but we are opposed to that policy. ask the Government to convey to tbe Imperial Parliament the request that a homogeneous community of nearly a half a million people, which has been agitating for self-government for several years, shall be given the opportunity to declare, by referendum, its desire for separation from New South Wales. We would prefer, of course, that the Imperial Government should grant our request straight out; but if it does not feel disposed to do that, it is surely not too much to ask that the mind of our people on this subject should be ascerneophyte, and I do not intend to take any tained by referendivm. want six senators like the other States? we had them the status of the Senate would be improved. We desire our wishes to be given effect in a constitutional way. We object to being associated any longer with a government of welshers. If this Government is really opposed to the welshing policy of the Lang Government, and if it has any backbone, it will at least take the responsibility of forwardany of my four and half minutes in ing our request to the Imperial authorities. It should be remembered that the Imperial Parliament still has sovereign power to create new States in the Commonwealth. We are still members of the British Empire in spite of the views expressed by tbe honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini). It is deplorable to us that the policy of the New South Wales Government should be advocated in this House; but, as the present Government has declared its opposition to it, we feel that it should assist us to able grounds it is not too much achieve our desire for separation from New South Wales. If the people of Australia were given an opportunity to express their mind on our proposal, I am sure that, in their present temper, they would approve of it, and relieve us of the disgrace of continuing our association with the present New South Wales Government. [4.25] I rise principally to direct attention of the failure of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) to deal with the real issues that have been raised by the action of the Premier of New South Wales. The honourable member We regards the Premier of New South Wales as a courageous man, the saviour of the country, and the only Labour leader who is willing and able to help the workers of Australia. That is the pedestal upon which the honourable member places Mr Lang. ber for Dalley was placed upon a pedestal until he was found out. Mr Lang in Dalley. member for East Sydney is a political notice of his impertinent and foolish interjections. The honourable member for Werriwa spoke for the ful l time allowed him by the Standing Orders, but did not touch the ethical and practical issues raised by the action of the Premier of New South Wales, though he claims to be a supporter of that gentleman's policy. honourable member for Dalley does not know about ethics. dealing with the honourable member's interjections. The honourable gentleman has accused this Government of running away from certain issues; but he himself, like Mr Lang, whom he supports, has run away from the issues that have been raised. I ask him how he can justify the action of the Premier of New South Wales in paying New South Wales interest due in New York, and repudiating that which is due in London. If this action can be defended upon any reasonto ask the honourable member to defend it. If the repudiation of overseas interest is justifiable in relation to Great Britain, why is it not justifiable in relation to New York? Why has there been differentiation in favour of the United States of America and against Great Britain? These are reasonable questions, and the honourable member should have some reply",27,Queensland

84,Mr Theodore,"I shall not wasteto them. I point out that, although certain of the English loans repudiated by Mr Lang have an interest rate of only 3 per cent., and that those due in New York are in respect of money raised at £5 Ss. 8d. per cent., the New York interest has been paid and the British interest left unpaid. On what principle can such differentiation be defended ? Why has the Premier of New South Wales and those who support h i m refused to tell us on what grounds they favour the payment of interest due to a foreign country, and the repudiation of that due to a British country? Like his leader, Mr Lang, the honourable member for Werriwa has run away from that question. When I asked h i m for a reply to it he descended to personal abuse of myself. There is another aspect of this subject which merits attention. Mr Lang has defended his repudiation policy on the ground that we should not be paying high rates of interest upon war loans while returned soldiers and workers are unemployed in Australia. He has created the impression in the mind of a section of the public that his action has led to the reduction of interest on war loans. But that is not so, as has been pointed out a dozen times. Mr Lang's action has not resulted in the reduction of a single penny in the interest charges on war loans. The interest payments which he has repudiated are due on loans raised for the construction of public works in New South Wales, and not on war loans. New South Wales is not answerable for the payment of a penny piece of interest on our war debt, and nothing that Mr Lang can do can abate to the extent of a single shilling the interest due on these debts. The . payment of that interest is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. Mr Lang knows this, but he chooses to ignore it, and continues to mislead those who follow him. A t the Premiers' Conference held in this very chamber in February last, at which Mr Lang announced his intention to repudiate the payment of interest overseas, the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and I pointed out to hi m that the adoption of that policy would not relieve Australia of the payment of this interest, but simply [32] shift the responsibility for it from the New South Wales Government to the Commonwealth Government, because the Commonwealth Government is under obligation to meet all interest charges which are not met by the States. It was also pointed out to Mr Lang that only a small portion of the overseas debt was war debt, and that even that small portion was not a liability of New South Wales, but of the Commonwealth. Yeti n his campaign on this subject Mr. Lang is continuing to mislead the people. Neither he nor his supporters have been candid with the rank and file of the Labour party in New South Wales or elsewhere. They are running away from issues which have to be faced, and running away from them in the most dishonest fashion. Debate imierrupled under Standing Order 119.

103,Mr Nairn (Perth) [4.34],"On e ofTo try to apportion the blame for this failure would be futile, for the mere placing of the culpability on this or that party would not help the farmers. I hope that we shall be able to devise means by which a little practical aid may be afforded them. All members who have spoken during this debate have recognized the claims of the wheat producers to special consideration, and if we are really less than one farthing. In the light of sincere we should approach the problem with a determination to find ways and means of giving assistance to them. Of the three schemes which have been submitted to the House the principal one is that put forward by the Government for the relief of wheat-growers by the issue of a fiduciary currency. That proposal is of no practical value to the farmer, because the bill to give effect to it will not be passed. Men needing assistance will see no virtue in any scheme that will not produce the necessary money. Even though this measure should be passed by this House it will never become operative; it will merely be sent forward to another place in the expectation and almost certain knowledge that it will be rejected there. Eor that reason alone this fiduciary currency proposal should be discarded as of no practical benefit to the farmers. But, irrespective of the principle involved, balance an increase of 4s. a bushel in the scheme could not render assistance to the wheat-growers within six or eight months. I do not question the bona fides of the Minister for Markets, but if be is really desirous of helping the man on the land he will discard this method as unacceptable to the Parliament as constituted, and proceed to develop some alternative that has more hope of success. That most worthy of consideration is a proposal to impose a sales tax of £7 4s. a ton on flour. The only objection urged against that is that it may increase the price of bread, but that anticipation is not justified by the experiences of the past. A sales tax of £7 4s. a ton on flour is equivalent to 4s. a bushel of wheat. If 4s. were added to the ruling rate, the price in Australia would be raised to about 7s. On occasions the price of wheat has been higher than that. increase the price of a 4-lb. loaf by 3d. the year 1921-22 the average price of wheat in Australia was 9s. a bushel, and the average price of the 2-lb loaf in the four chief wheat-producing States was 5.8d. In the year 1928-29, the average price of wheat was only 4s. 9d. a bushel; yet the average price of bread was 5.65d. Although the price of wheat in 1928-29 was 4s. 3d. a bushel lower than in 1921-22, the price of bread dropped only .15d., or those experiences, I see no reason why an increase of 4s. a bushel in the price of wheat should be reflected in a dearer loaf. [Quorum formed.] The proportion of wheat in a loaf of bread is comparatively small. In one shilling's worth of bread the wheat content on present values is only 1-Jd. The remaining 10-Jd. is distributed between the millers, bakers and distributors. Therefore, it is possible substantially to increase the price of wheat without causing anything like an equivalent increase in the price of bread. The greater portion of the cost of bread is represented by the wages of the millers' employees, bakers, and carters, and overhead costs and profits. Already wages have fallen, and they are likely to decline still further. Rents also have decreased. These two factors should be sufficient to counterthe cost of the raw material. There is a tendency to-day towards greater competition in trade, and there should be no increase in the price of bread should a sales tax be imposed on flour. If any increase in the price of bread did take place, the State Governments would not be slow to counteract it by fixing the price of that commodity. If the Government is not prepared to impose a sales tax, it should at least apply for an internal loan in order to provide assistance for the farmers. When the proposal of a bounty of 6d. a bushel was announced, it was stated that the scheme would be financed by an internal loan. Within a week the Premier of New South Wales made his threat of repudiation, and the Oommonwealth Government immediately abandoned its proposal to apply to the public for a loan, believing that any chance a tax would that it had of being successful had been destroyed by Mr Lang's statement. But that statement has not half the' force in Australia to-day that it had immediately",31,Moloney
104,Mr Gibbons,Such,32,Moloney
105,Mr Nairn,"Not necessarily. Duringit was made. When it was made there was considerable doubt whether the majority of the members of this Parliament would adopt the repudiation policy of Mr so long as this bill is associated Lang, but I am glad to say that, with the exception of five honourable members, this Parliament generally definitely decided to have nothing to do with the policy of repudiation. In any case the people of Australia are not likely to permit Mr what would become of Australia? It Lang to carry out his threat. If an appeal were made to the public to subscribe to a loan of £6,000,000 for the relief of the wheat-farmers, I feel sure that the people would respond, as they did when the last appeal for £28,000,000 was made. The interests of the banks and other financial institutions are bound up with the wheat industry. The Government would be justified in floating a loan, because even if it were not fully subscribed, the deficiency could be made good by imposing a sales tax to enable some small measure of assistance to be given to the wheat farmer. scheme submitted by the Government has been associated with some unsatisfactory and unacceptable condition. The objectionable feature of the first scheme was the principle of compulsory pooling. The proposed guarantee of 3s. a bushel had to be abandoned because it could not be financed. Now the proposed bounty of 6d. a bushel under this bill is associated with the principle of inflation, which is certainly objectionable to the majority of the members of this Parliament. Notwithstanding my desire to assist the farmers, I am compelled to vote against this measure. If it were placed on the statute-book it would be of no value. It would not be operative, and would serve merely as an excuse on the part of the Government for not giving effect to any other scheme. Once this measure is passed the farmers can say good-bye to any assistance from this Government. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to compromise by accepting the proposal of this side of the House to impose a sales tax on flour. If he does that, he will receive the gratitude of the farmers and great CTedit from at least the decent minded and right thinking people of Australia. We cannot all have our own way. We must come to some compromise to make any progress at all. If the Minister persists in his attitude the farmers will receive nothing, and their hopes will be disappointed. There is no prospect at all of any assistance being given to them with the principle of inflation. Honourable members opposite have producedfiguresin an endeavour to show that wheat production is no longer economical, but if we abandoned wheat production would mean throwing thousands of additional men into the ranks of the unemployed. It would indeed be a policy of disaster to abandon wheat production. We must keep our lands in cultivation. I hope that the Minister will take a national view, and in the interests of the farmers agree to a compromise on the lines suggested by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart). bill gives satisfaction to none. Even the Minister himself cannot be satisfied with Every apparently practical its provisions. It is the last throw of a desperate man, and he has risked his all on this legislation. What has the Minister offered the wheat-growers of this country? He has offered them on paper 6d. a bushel, but virtually 4^d. a bushel. The average crop per acre in Australia last year was about twelve bushels. safe side. Twelve bushels per acre at 4-J. a bushel works out at 4s. 6d. per acre. That would be of no assistance to the wheat-grower. He is being deceived by this Govermnent. In proposing to pay this bounty to the wheat-growers, whether they need it or not, the Government is making a further mistake. It is true that a loan is to be raised to assist necessitous farmers, but the bounty is to be paid regardless of the financial position of the wheat-growers. It will be paid to the farmers in Western Australia as well as to the farmers in South Australia, although there is no comparison between the needs of those two groups of growers. In Western Australia wheat is being grown on cheap lands, which were purchased at a price that enables wheat to be grown profitably. In South Australia, in Victoria, and in a certain, portion of New South Wales, exorbitant prices were paid for wheat lands, which precludes any chance of making a profit.",32,Moloney

The wheat grower, in respect of this bill, is like a man. in deep water clutching at a straw in the hope that it will buoy him up, but the moment he grasps it he realizes that it has no stability and will not prevent him from drowning. so far as the wheat-growers are concerned.

The growers in Queensland are in a more fortunate position, because in that State there is a guarantee of 3s. lOd. a bushel. In the other States the farmers are to receive a bounty whether they need it or not. I recognize the difficulties that confront the Minister, but why deceive the wheat-growers by leading them to believe that something is being done for them when actually they -will receive no material benefit at all? The question of Government assistance to the people on the land is a vexed one. When the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, the hop-growers of Tasmania found themselves in difficulties, and asked the Commonwealth Government to assist them. They were given a sum of £25,000 on the written guarantee that when their crops were sold in London, the first fi25,000 received would be handed to the Oommonwealth Government. If Government assistance in every instance were given on those lines all would be well. For years I have opposed the principle of Government assistance being given to producers-who find themselves in financial difficulties, because there is no end to it. be impossible for the wheat industry to When we consider applications for assistance upon their merits, it often happens that our sympathies carry us away, and lead us to do things which are economically unsound. We should get down to fundamentals, and censider whether or not a proposal for relief measures up to sound principles. Some time ago, a great case was made out for the relief of the hop-growers, and they obtained assistance. It was not long before the tomato-growers of Bendigo made similar again the Government came to their assistance. Then the doradillo grapegrowers along the rivers fell on evil times. Could the Government stand by and let them go under? No; it came to their assistance also. Now the Government is called on to do something for the wheat-growers. No one denies that the wheat-growers are in great difficulties to-day. It is costing them more to grow wheat than that wheat can be sold for in the world's markets, but this measure would not solve their problems. help, but, unfortunately, the honourable member's amendment is out of order. ruled out yet. ruled out. Of course it rests with the Minister. member ought to consult the Minister for Agriculture in Queensland to find out what he would think of the sales tax on flour. Queensland are not interested in this measure. They are provided for, being already assured of 3s. lOd. a bushel for their wheat. There is something wrong with the wheat industry of Australia, and this measure will not remedy the trouble. The disease affecting the wheat industry is over-capitalization, a complaint which has stricken, not only the wheat industry, but practically all our other primary industries as well. [Quorum formed.] Until a re-adjustment can be made in land values, it will pay its way. I am opposed to this bill, on the ground that it is illusory-that there is no meat in it-that it will not be of airy material assistance to tht wheat-farmers, and, further, that the money will be paid to those who do not, as well as those who do, need assistance. My chief objection to the bill, however, is that if carried it will necessitate an issue of fiduciary notes. I am opposed to the issue of such notes, and I do not desire that any vote of mine shall furnish an representations, and argument for the Government in support of the issue of such currency.

If that is not the reason for opposing it, I have not heard any other definite reason advanced. I have not heard any member on the other side attempt to show wherein lie the defects of the policy of raising money as proposed by the Government. Nobody has suggested that this country is so bankrupt that the issue of credit contemplated would not be justified for the assistance of a section of the community that is down and out. All we hear is on all fours with what was said in 1910 about the "" Fisher flimsies "". I believe that one or two members of this House to-day stated at that time that those notes would not be worth 5s., but not one of them was prepared to accept less than 20s. for them. statements made in 1910 may be repeated in this chamber to-day, that does not prove the policy of the Government in this matter to be unsound, particularly as there is no other feasible way of meeting this desperate situation. with the farmers. farmers will require much sounder argument than has been submitted by the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill) if he votes against this bill. It was amusing to hear the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) when he' submitted his amendment to providean advance of 3s. a bushel. Allowing for the difference between the present price of wheat and 3s. a bushel, an amount of £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 would have to be provided, and it would be necessary to resort to an advance of credit to make up that sum, just as is contemplated under the present proposal. The honourable member was so illogical in his arguregard to wheat marketing. Provision ment that he could not have been serious about the matter. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) has explained a dozen times why the bill for the advance to the farmers of 3s. a bushel was not proceeded with. The measure was passed by this House, and immediately the Government asked the Commonwealth Bank Board to make the necessary finance available the Board replied that it had been informed by its legal advisers that this could not be done constitutionally. Commonwealth Bank had regard to the 2s. advance provided for in the bill, and not the Commonwealth guarantee of 3s. obtain a guarantee from the Commonwealth Bank that the 4s. could be financed ? another matter. We called their bluff in regard to that by proving up to the hilt that the necessary arrangements to provide that 4s. were made with the Commonwealth Bank. reason why the first proposal was unconstitutional, and did the Government endeavour to put it in a constitutional form ? Board said that after consulting their legal advisors they could not make that money available. Their advisors told them that, under the Constitution, Parliament could not guarantee the bank against loss. be guaranteed, and not 3s. ? was a guarantee connected with the Wheat Marketing Bill with which the States were associated. Had the first proposal of the Government been given effect, the second and third proposals would have been unnecessary. Nearly every honourable member opposite who has spoken on this bill has prefaced his remarks by saying that this is the Government's third attempt to deal with the wheat problem. The fact is that the Government's policy in regard to wheat marketing was fully set out in the first bill, which was known as the Wheat Marketing Bill. That bill set out the complete policy of the Government in was made for control, and for the establishment of an organization. When the Leader of the Opposition moved an amendment to provide for a guarantee of 4s. a bushel without a pool, I refused to countenance any guarantee without a full organization. The bill was rejected through no fault of the Government. The Government would have been quite justified at that sta£e in going no further, but it did go further, and, instead of getting credit",35,Moloney

I repeat that the Government's policy was contained in the Wheat Marketing Bill, and when it was defeated in another place, by friends of honourable members opposite, the Government would have been justified in proceeding no further in the matter. I do not consider it a sound policy to offer guarantees unless there is complete organized control as provided for in the Wheat Marketing B ill ; but I realize that desperate circumstances justify desperate remedies, particularly when honourable members on both sides of the House favour action along the lines proposed. I have always claimed that unless we give control to the growers themselves, backed by a board on which there should be at least one Government representative, we cannot properly safeguard the payment of a guarantee. Whatever happened regarding the second and third proposals they were brought forward only because the Government was defeated, through no fault of its Own, in regard to its declared policy as set forth in its first bill. say that the Government is powerless to help the wheat-growers unless it is allowed to print notes? answer that question. What are the alternatives to this proposal? Under present circumstances we can conceive no other means of rendering the necessary assistance. I think that the Leader of the Opposition said that he would favour the Government's plan if we could raise the money by loan, but the honourable gentleman knows what has happened in regard to loans. There was a meeting of the Loan Council at which the Government proposed to raise the necessary money by way of loan. Although the Loan Council unanimously agreed to the floating of the proposed loan, the foolish statement made immediately afterwards by the Premier of New South Wales was not conducive to the success of such a move, and it was generally agreed that it would be useless to make it. The position has not altered since then. The honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), and others, have suggested that a sales tax of £2 10s. per ton should be imposed on flour over a period of years, and that the proceeds should be used to guarantee the bank in an advance of the amount required; but there are many objections to the adoption of that course. The Ministers for Agriculture, in the various States, could no doubt give honourable members opposite substantial reasons why such a scheme could not be put into operation. The New South Wales Parliament, for instance, has passed a bill which authorizes the Government to acquire flour at £7 10s. per ton, retail it at £10 per ton, and use the net proceeds for the assistance of the farmers. It is estimated that this action might have the effect of increasing the price of a 4-lb. loaf of bread by Id. If an additional tax of £2 10s. per ton were imposed on flour, bread would probably be increait-d by 2d. per 4-lb. loaf, and the New South Wales Government would probably object to siich a happening. Action is also being considered in Victoria to fix the price of wheat for home consumption. It will be seen therefore that the imposition of a sales tax on flour would result in dangerous duplication. There is a widespread demand in favour of the re-introduction of the Wheat Marketing Bill. ter propose to re-introduce it ? earliest possible moment. The policy laid down in that bill would, if put into operation, give permanent relief to the farmers; but the policy of imposing a sales tax on flour would give them only temporary relief, and as it would need to be continued for a number of years it might endanger the prospects of giving full effect to the scheme contained in the Wheat Marketing Bill. An integral part of the policy laid down in the Wheat Marketing Bill is the power given to the States for the fixation of the price of wheat for local consumption, so that any loss incurred in the payment of a guaranteed price of wheat in respect of the portion of the crop exported might be made up by the extra price obtained for local consumption wheat. The farmers would not thank us for imposing a sales tax on flour if it endangered the operations of a permanent wheat marketing scheme.",36,Moloney

134,Mr Paekee Moloney,"A t theThe honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) should be the last to criticize the sincerity of the Government's desire to assist the wheat-growers. I well remember him visiting me in my room after the other place rejected the Wheat Marketing Bill last year. He strongly denounced the members of that chamber for their action, and I concurred in his remarks. There is a reliable test of sincerity in matters of this kind. It is to be found in the division lists. All the members of the Labour party in this whamber, and in the other place, voted in favour of the Wheat Marketing Bill. That is the best test of sincerity, and if the members of the other parties had stood up to the test the farmers of this country would not be in their present difficulties. for Echuca used the strongest language in denunciation of the members of the other place who voted against that measure. He also denounced the methods that were adopted to secure the defeat of the bill. It is well known that the representatives of the wheat merchants of Australia left Canberra the Dight before the vote was taken in the other place with the boast that they knew that the numbers were all right, and that the bill would be defeated. In all the circumstances, I am amazed that the honourable member for Echuca should forsake the honest and straightforward attitude that he adopted at that time. attitude that I then adopted. pleased to hear it . I told the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that, in this speech, I would give him the reasons why the Government could not accept the amendment he intended to move with the object of giving effect to the provisions of the Wheat Advances Act. The Government considers that it is unnecessary and useless to go on with that measure for the conditions which made the proclamation of it impracticable at the end of last year ing desperate situation can be met only still exist. I have said definitely half a dozen times, and the Minister who was acting in my stead at that time has also said definitely, that the Commonwealth Bank Board obtained legal advice to the effect that the proposed government guarantee of the bank against any loss that might be incurred in paying 3s. per bushel f.o.b., for this season's wheat could not be given effect because of constitutional difficulties. There should therefore be no misconception in the mind of the wheat growers on this subject. I repeat that there would have been no need for this measure or for the proposed bounty of 3s. if the Wheat Marketing Bill, which embodied the policy of the Government had been agreed to. The steps since taken by the Government were due to a realization that the position of the farmers was desperate. When the Wheat Marketing Bill was defeated in another place, through no fault of the Government, it could have easily rested on the policy it had attempted to put upon the statuteThe honourable member book. not. vernment would have been justified in doing so. If the honourable member had piloted through the House' a measure embodying the policy of a goveniment of which he was a member, and the bill was defeated in another place, would he feel called upon to change his policy and introduce some other proposal which he regarded as unsound? I said in the first place that any method that might be suggested would be incomplete if it were not allied to that control of marketing which the Government's original bill proI have not forsaken tlie posed. Our second measure, and the bill now before the House, have been rendered necessary wholly by the opposition which the Government encountered in another place. again ask the Minister whether, having regard to all these facts, he still says that the Government is powerless to do anything for the wheat-growers unless allowed to print notes? failed to get its policy accepted in another place the Government feels that the existby the creation of a fiduciary currency if the wheat-growers are to receive help in the quickest possible way. answer to my question is "" yes "". answer is as I have stated.

It is for them to convince the opponents of this bill how utterly stupid is the contention that the provision of £6,000,000 of fiduciary currency will be harmful to the people. No proof has been adduced that this proposal is unsound. If this measure and the Fiduciary Notes Bill be enacted £6,000,000 will be available for the relief of the farmers. Of that amount £3,500,000 will be distributed to them as a free gift, and the other £2,500,000 will be disbursed by the States. All of the money will go direct to the wheat-growers. No honourable member will deny that the farmers would receive the money with open hands. They are in a desperate position, and the resolutions they have passed show that they are anxious for the assistance which the Government proposes. This is the only definite and practical means of providing help immediately, and if it is rejected the responsibility will rest upon honourable members opposite, and nobody else.

This is a suitable clause upon which to state the real nature of the bill, the second reading of which has been carried by a large majority. I doubt whether a single member who voted for the measure really believes that it will ever operate, or that any one will get 6d. out with the fiduciary issue have said that of it . I make that observation with reference to every honourable member who voted for the bill. Although this measure is to be called the ""Wheat Act 1931, that, I contend, is a complete misnomer. I suggest that it ought to be called the Wheat Promises Act No. 4 of the year of grace 1931. This is the fourth attempt of the Government to deal with the question of wheat. The other three have failed. The first I opposed. of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) opposed every one of them, including the Wheat Marketing Bill. keeps on saying that we opposed the Wheat Marketing Bill, when every one knows that we did, I fail to understand. He is much more satisfied with himself than is anybody else. of the Opposition did not call for a division on that bill. made the same speech on this subject about twenty times in this chamber. I wonder when the Minister was in Opposition, how many times no division was called on bills against which he had spoken. Of course, everybody knows that there were scores of such occasions. so. be called the Wheat Act 1931 at all. It will never have any relation to wheat, because its operation depends entirely upon the passage of another bill. pressly and explicitly admitted to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr enthusiasm among the supporters of the Maxwell) that this bill would not operate, Government that I am forced to raise my even though passed by this Parliament, unless another measure recently passed by this chamber was passed in another place. Accordingly every honourable member who supports this bill supports the other measure in principle. representation. some honourable members who disagree they are justified in voting for this bill because there is a provision in it for raising money by way of loan. The Minister has knocked out the bottom of that argument completely and entirely, because he has said that the money cannot be found except by a fiduciary issue. When one wills an end, one wills the only means by which that end can be attained, and honourable members have been told by the Minister in charge of the measure and by the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) that not one penny will he paid under this bill to the farmers unless there is a fiduciary issue. For that reason I say that this bill is misnamed. It is obviously a political device to catch the politically innocent. To secure the support of certain honourable members on this side, the Minister has omitted from the bill any reference to the only means whereby the bill can become operative. Surely we should look at realities and not at shams. What is the reality of this bill? This is a proposal to raise £6,000,000 by a fiduciary issue, and by no other means, for the assistance of the wheat farmers. For that reason the Opposition voted against the bill, knowing quite well that it was only a device to procure votes, and to enable the Government to pretend, as the Minister for Markets has pretended throughout the country, that those who vote against this impossible measure are somehow opposed to the interests of the farmers. That is not the case, and every honourable member knows that full well. seems to be disturbed. but my remarks are arousing such",39,Speaker Hon Norman Makin H I L L W C Ward E J

I cast my vote on the second reading of the bill with the greatest satisfaction, and I shall have the greatest pleasure in explaining my attitude to any audience of farmers or of any other section of the community anywhere in Australia. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. The position of the wheat-farmers to-day is the most desperate in the whole history of their existence, and I refuse to make them a pawn in any party squabble. The Country party has shown that it is ready to support any measure brought down by this Government to remedy or alleviate the serious position of the farmers, even though it may not be in complete agreement with its proposals. all guarantee the farmers 4s. a bushel; and then introduced a later bill to guarantee them 3s. a bushel. We supported both of those bills, and just before the dinner adjornment to-day, we endeavoured to carry an amendment requiring the Government to proclaim the act under which the farmers were guaranteed 3s. a bushel. The bill was passed through the House three months ago with great eclat, and later it passed the Senate also. refused to proclaim the act, although it declared that its provisions would prove the salvation of the farmers. The present bill, instead of securing to the farmers a return of 6s. 6d. a bushel as promised them by the honourable member for Calare( Mr Gibbons), or 4s. or even 3s. a bushel, merely offers them a bounty of 4£d. a bushel; nevertheless we are prepared to support it. machinery of the hill is faulty, and the amount offered paltry, but we intend later to move an amendment for the imposition of a sales tax on flour, to redeem an immediate loan for the assistance of the wheat-farmers. Eveni f we cannot carry that amendment, we should like to see this bill put on the statute-book, because we do not believe that the Government has very long to live. Wheni t is dismissed from office, public confidence will be restored, and the incoming government will have the choice of half a dozen different methods of financing this scheme. remind the right honourable member that he cannot be permitted to make a second reading speech at this stage. to certain statements made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham). He said that the bill had a direct connection with the Government's proposed fiduciary note issue. I desire to point out that the bill has nothing whatever to do with the fiduciary note issue, and can operate absolutely independently of it. If any further proof were required of that, other than the terms of the hill itself, it is to be found in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition himself to the effect that, notwithstanding any provision in any other act, all moneys payable by First of virtue of this bill shall be paid out of the Government proposed to money borrowed in accordance with the provisions of the bill. Tbat shows conclusively that there is nothing in the bill to connect it with an issue of fiduciary notes, apart from ministerial declaration. On one occasion an income tax bill was introduced into this Parliament, and was declared by the Minister to have a certain meaning. After it had become an act, it was declared by the High Court to have an exactly opposite meaning, although the intention of Parliament at Yet the Government has the time it was passed was quite clear. The financial provisions of the present measure are exactly the same as those incorporated in every loan bill passed through Ihis House. honourable member to keep to the clause. party will attempt, during the consideraThe tion of the remaining clauses of the bill, to improve it in such a way as to make the financing of the scheme certain. If the Government will not accept our proposition, it must accept the responsibility for refusing it. It will then be evident that the Government is bringing forward this measure simply as an electioneering bait to catch the farmers. However, the Government will not always be in office, and when it is turned out, this scheme can be used to help the farmers, as they should be helped. Clause agreed to.

165,Dr. Earle Page,"The Countryclause provides that the Wheat Advances Act 1930, shall be repealed. The Wheat Advances Act, if I remember rightly, was passed as recently as December last. It was one of the most remarkable pieces of legislation ever passed by any Parliament in any country. When the bill was before the House, the Government was told in the kindliest manner from this side of the House that the act could never possibly operate, that the proposals which it contained for paying the guaranteed price of 3s. a bushel for wheat by means of advances from the Gommonwealth Bank, those advances to be guaranteed by the Oommonwealth Government, which could obtain funds only from the bank itself, were of such a nature that the act must inevitably fail. duced, I Minister for Customs( Mr Forde). He is a gentleman who always has a great deal of enthusiasm for his measures, whatever his understanding of their significance or effect may be.

The men jection with a volume of sound without meaning. The Government was warned that the act could never come into operation. It never did come into operation. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth we had the spectacle of a government having submitted legislation to the Parliament of Commonwealth, and getting it passed through both Houses, appealing humbly to the citizens of Australia a month later to regard the act as a dead letter. I think, the exact words used. Now we are asked to go through the solemn farce of repealing this inutile and ineffective measure. I support this elause wholeheartedly, and I suggest to the Government that it should introduce what I may call an omnibus bill, to repeal quite a number of the acts for which it has been responsible. I do not know how mueh longer this Government is going to remain in office, and the indications are that Ministers do not know either. I agree entirely with the principle of this clause, which is that legislation introduced by this Government should be repealed. The principle is sound, and ought to be extended. I am glad to find myself in agreement with the Government at least in this, and I have the very greatest pleasure in giving the clause my support. congratulate the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) upon his action in calling together the different branches of The bill was introhis party with the idea of securing unity. think, by the present No doubt it has been a most successful conference as demonstrated by their votes this afternoon.

The Wheat Advances Act of 1930 which, The by this clause, it is proposed to repeal, was introduced by the Government which counted as one of its leaders the man who now it is predicted, is to become the who are now being boomed as the potential saviours of the nation, and who have been taken to the bosom of the Opposition, were those who fathered the legislation which it is now found necessary to repeal. If the primary producers were in a position to finance the marketing of their own products, 25 per oent. of our population would not be starving to-day. Yet, although the position is so desperate, every effort by the Government to help the farmer is made a joke Those were, of by the crowd of galoots opposite, who are in comfortable enjoyment of their salaries.

184,The Common,"Mr STEWART -Allowing that allThis clause furnishes a further indication as to who is really governing this country. I can understand the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) being pleased about the proposed repeal of the 1930 act, since this course of action has been precipitated by the interests which the honourable gentleman represents in this chamber. Under the present monetary system, and while the Commonwealth Bank is governed by such men as are now in charge of it, this Parliament will always be placed in the position of having to revise its attitude to matters of finance. Consciously Gibsons, the Drummonds and the rest of them have the capitalistic outlook. They cannot be expected to have any other attitude of mind; but I quarrel with any government that reappoints suoh men to the board of the Commonwealth Bank. The proposed repeal of the 1930 act shows again that the Commonwealth Bank is part and parcel of the private banking institutions. It is useless as a national institution, and it will continue to be ineffective so long as it is constituted on present lines. do that it has not done? it should have done what it was asked to do under the Wheat Advances Act. Of course, the bank is conducted to-day in the interests of the institutions whose interests would be affected if the 1930 measure were put into operation. This clause demonstrates clearly that the Government has no effective voice in the realms of finance. said, the present Ministers are a bad lot; but the Leader of the Opposition and his followers would be much worse. The Constitution clearly provides that if the Senate rejects or fails to pass a bill the Government may re-submit it after the expiration of three months. to do so. with the Leader of the Opposition. The Government has miserably receded from one position to another, and has not had the courage to stand its ground. So long as it remains rn office, it seems to me it will continue to do this kind of thing. It is allowing the bankers to govern Australia. The board of the Oommonwealth Bank would not allow effect to be given to the provisions of the Wheat Advances Act because the Government would not intimate its willingness to allow wages and pensions to be reduced. It is to the credit of the Government that it would not go so far as that. The Wheat Advances Act was not proclaimed, simply because the banks said that it should not be proclaimed except under certain conditions; and the Government has complacently or unconsciously, the accepted that position. We shall have to repeal more legislation unless the Government takes its courage in both hands. To-day it is like a ball with a dent in it. When the dent is pushed out in one place a bigger dent is caused somewhere else. sorry that my amendment, which provided for thfc withdrawal of this bill and the proclamation of the Wheat Advances Act, was not accepted by honourable members. It is significant that that act did not contain the provision which was in the Wheat Marketing Bill that, notwithstanding that certain of its provisions might be found to be unconstitutional, the remainder of the measure should continue to be enforceable'. That provisiou which would have enabled the Government to enforce compulsory pooling, and at the samts time claim that the payment of a guarantee of 4s. was unconstitutional. The Minister has not told us which parts of the act passed in December are unconstitutional, nor has he told us why those parts cannot be repealed, and the remainder of the measure put into operation. There is no doubt whatever that a definite promise was made to the farmers that the Government would pay them 3s. a bushel f.o.b. for their wheat. In a speech which he made on this subject some time ago the then Acting Minister for Markets( Mr Forde) saidI appeal to a l l the political parties in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, which urged the farmers to grow more wheat with the object of correcting our adverse trade balance, to do everything possible to protect this industry. It is not the fault of the farmers that tlie bottom has fallen out of the wheat market. The farmers responded nobly to the call that was made to them, and they should receive every assistance from the different governments.",43,Speaker Hon Norman Makin H I L L W C Ward E J

192,Mr Gregory (Swan) [8.34],"I amI am quite satisfied in my own mind that if a sales tax on flour were agreed to, aud it were provided that the revenue received from it should be hypothecated for the assistance of the farmers, there would be no difficulty whatever in finding the money required to make the advance payments. Both Houses of the Parliament agreed to the proposal of the Government that 3s. a bushel f.o.b. should be paid for wheat; yet only four months later we find honourable members going back upon that promise. I hope that we shall have an opportunity later to reply to the remarks made on this subject by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham). For my own part, I can see no difliculty in finding money to make this advance to the farmers, assuming, of course, that the Government earnestly desires to make it. The then Acting Minister for Markets, in moving the second reading of the Wheat Advances Bill, saidThere is no doubt whatever about the meaning of the language of the bill. The bank w ill provide the money that is necessary, Wales that the State Government has had and the Government w ill refund it to the extent of any loss that is incurred on the final realization of the crop. In these circumstances I must refuse to vote for this clause, and I hope that there is still sufficient honesty in Parliament to cause the majority of members to do likewise. There is no justification whatever for repealing the Wheat Advances Act, and it is absolutely disgraceful that it should even be suggested. In fact it is nothing more than a deliberate repudiation of a definite obligation created with the approval of both Houses. It is ridiculous to say that it would be unconstitutional to provide for the payment of a bounty on wheat. Last year we were deluged with bounty bills. Australia has been paying bounties on the production pf iron and steel for many years, and it was even suggested last year that we should pay a bounty on sewing machines. The proposed bounty on wheat merits the support of every honourable member, for if the farmer fails, no one can say what will happen to Australia. It is disgraceful that Parliament should be asked to pass this clause. regret that honourable members opposite have suggested that the Government does not really desire to assist the farmers. The only reason why it is necessary to repeal the Wheat Advances Act is that the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank, having obtained legal advice, has intimated that the measure is unconstitutional. It seems to me that if it is unconstitutional to appropriate money for the payment of a bounty on wheat, it is unconstitutional to appropriate money for the payment of the maternity allowance. The decision of the Commonwealth Bank Board in this connection has raised a very serious issue. It appears now that the Bank Board has only to decide that a measure is unconstitutional and it can entirely set aside the decisions of this Parliament. The inability of the Government to give effect to the provisions of the Wheat Advances Act has resulted in a serious disorganization of the wheat industrya disorganization which may have tragic results. The position is so diflicult in New South a bill drafted to provide for the re-valuation of country lands, with the object of determining what is termed their productive value. This has been done doubtless because of the serious condition of the wheat industry this year. In my opinion, the Board of the Commonwealth Bank has refused to provide money for the purposes of this act principally because it is out of sympathy with the objects of the measure. A continuation of this policy will, undoubtedly, mean that the Government of the country will be in the hands of the financial institutions and not of the National Parliament, and this is a matter which should receive the earnest attention of Parliament. About four months ago this House passed a bill which provided for a guaranteed price.of 3s. per bushel f.o.b. for wheat. The Government was to pay the farmers a first advance of 2s. upon delivery of their wheat at railway sidings, and other payments were to be made later. That measure was certainly in the real interests of the wheat-farmers. The Parliament and the country accepted in good faith the assurances of the Government, and I strongly resent the fact that, through the",44,Speaker Hon Norman Makin H I L L W C Ward E J
193,Mr Gibbons (Calare) [8.40],I,45,Speaker Hon Norman Makin H I L L W C Ward E J
194,' Mr M. Cameron (Barker) [8.44],"blundering and ineptitude of the Ministry, the wheat-farmers have been sorely disappointed and reduced to their present tragic circumstances. When the Wheat Advances Bil l of 1930 was being dealt with, harvesting was in f u l l swing. Many growers had had an opportunity to sell at a very much better price than they were able to obtain later, but those merchants who had been previously operating were frightened out of the market. The then Acting Minister for Markets( Mr Forde) was assuring the farmers that everything would be right, that the machinery for the payment of a bounty of 3s. would be in operation, and they would receive all that had been promised to them. Week after week went by, and although the promises of the Government were reiterated, nothing was done to honour them. Now we are told that the act of last year must be repealed, for constitutional reasons. If constitutional obstacles to the operation of the act exist, why were they not discovered six months ago? The people are asked to trust Parliament, but what Confidence can they have in a Government or Parliament which imposes on them in this manner? I strongly object to the repeal of the act. It promised to the farmers the payment of a bounty in veal money. promises a smaller payment in fictitious money. I am sure that this offer will never be worth anything; for that reason I voted against the second reading of the bill this afternoon, and I shall vote against this clause to repeal the Wheat Advances Act. Mi-. GABB (Angas) [8.48] -Although I voted for the second reading of this bill, I am opposed to the repeal of the Wheat Advances Act of 1930. I listened with amazement to the statement that the act was never operated because of legal obstacles. Unless my memory betrays me, we considered in the Labour party's room whether we would accept 2s. 6d. a bushel offered by the bank. I invite the Minister to produce a document relating to the matter that was placed before caucus. If it was possible for the bank to pay 2s. 6d., obviously no legal difficulties existed. The real trouble that the Commonwealth Bank could not was that whilst the bank offered 2s. 6d., the Labour party insisted upon 3s. Probably that was the reason why the bank subsequently sought for legal reasons to excuse the non-payment of the guarantee. Neither the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) nor the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) was in Australia when the bill was passed, and I resent the statement by them that legal difficulties have prevented effect being given to the measure. If the act is not repealed, and no benefit results from the bill now before us, it may still be possible to render some assistance to the wheat growers under existing legislation. Therefore, I shall vote against the clause. -This Parliament has never witnessed a more humiliating spectacle than it sees to-night. Three months ago the act which we are now asked to repeal was carried by 37 votes to 9, and we were assured by the Minister in charge of the measure that it would be of real help to the wheat-growers. Ministers were reminded at the time that legal obstacles might be encountered, and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) offered his assistance as a constitutional lawyer to assist the Minister in so framing the bill as to obviate that possibility. That fact is on record in Hansard. The Minister Now the Government blandly assured us that he was advised that nothing in the bill was unconstitutional. It was common knowledge that the Commonwealth Bank had offered a payment of 2s. 6d., and that caucus had insisted on 3s. If there are legal obstacles to the operation of the act, and I doubt that---ney-General( Mr Brennan) say? tinguished by his silence and absence from the chamber. If legal difficulties had existed, they could have been readily resolved by the simple expedient advocated during the consideration of the measure, namely, the imposition of a sales tax on flour in accordance with the suggestion that had been made by Professor Perkins. The then Acting Minister for Markets( Mr Forde) had been continually changing his position. In November, he declared pay a first advance of Is. 6d., notwithstanding any guarantee that might be",45,Speaker Hon Norman Makin H I L L W C Ward E J

I thought I had made the position quite clear in my second-reading speech. The Commonwealth Bank will find the initial advance of 2s., which w ill be paid to the voluntary pools upon the delivery cf wheat at the rail sidings, and so much of the remaining shilling as will be necessary to meet freight and other charges will be provided from time to time. the bill. everything in the bill, but the Government will have power to make regulations. It is nonsensical for the Leader of the Opposition to quibble on such matters. I have circulated certain amendments designed to remove any donbt that thore might be in connection with the method of financing the crop. It is obvious that the act was not passed hurriedly or carelessly. Every honourable member who voted for the bill was aware of tbe facts. agreed to without a division. difficulties which subsequently arose were due to the inability of the Governm^jf to find the money. The Commonwealth Bank could make the payment if a sales tax were imposed on flour, and according to the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore), and the Minister for Markets( Mr gance. It was generally known at the Parker Moloney), the bank can still find the money if the Fiduciary NotesB i ll is agreed to or a loan is floated. Clearly, there are no constitutional difficulties in the way. All that is wanting on the part of the Government is the will to find the money required in the simplest and quickest way. Apparently, although caucus may have been sincere, the Government regarded the Wheat Advances Act of 1930 as merely a bait for unsuspecting farmers. It is a scandal that we should be asked to repeal a measure the second reading of which was carried almost without dissent only four months ago. Money can be found to finance the payment of 3s. a bushel instead of the paltry 4^d. that the Government is now offering. I ask honourable members to declare, by their votes, that the Wheat Advances Act shall remain on the statute-book. Even the passing of this bill will not be a reason for its repeal. The honourable In one respect, the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) is demonstrating some knowledge of husbandry; as he puts out his new bait he collects the old one. Unfortunately, both baits were laid for the wheat-grower, and the new one contains the more virulent poison, I propose to vote against the repeal of the Wheat Advances Act, because, with all its defects, it is better than the measure now before us. I did not like some of its features; but it was not tacked on to such dangerous financial proposals as the fiduciary currency legislation. Moreover, it offered more adequate relief to the farmers. A payment of 3s. f.o.b., on this year's wheat would probably l if t half the farmers out of their difficulties, for the time being at any rate. This bait of 44d., saturated, as it is, with poisonous financial dope, will merely serve to accentuate the difficulties of the wheat-growers. congratulate the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) upon his magnanimity in proposing to repeal the Wheat Advances Act of 1930. At least he may claim that he was not responsible for that measure, which was piloted through the House by the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) with remarkable confidence, and even arrotime that the Commonwealth Bank would not find the money for the payment of 3s. a bushel, and that the bill was designed, not to assist the wheat-farmers, but to make political capital out of the embarrassment of the bank. The proposal to repeal the act is extraordinary. The Government's pretences of assisting the farmers have steadily diminished. Its first attempt to that end was said to be worth, to the wheat-growers, about 2s. 6d. a bushel; the second dropped to 10d., and this bill now before us offers a mere 4 j d .

This attempt to repeal tbe act under cover of an inconspicuous clause iu this bill seems to me to be nothing short of repudiation. I shall certainly oppose the passage of the clause. ringah) [9.25] -The proposal to repeal the Wheat Advances Act emphasizes the confusion which the Government has created in its ineffective efforts to assist the wheat-farmers. When the Minister for Customs( Mr Eorde) was introducing that measure, he spoke with such earnestness and assurance that he convinced a number of honourable members of this House that the Government would really be able to find the money it promised to pay the farmers. Unfortunately, there had been published a clear and definite statement from the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to the effect that it would not be able to advance more than 2s. 6d. a bushel. record of Hansard, were I permitted to quote it, would prove the truth of what I have stated. It was made clear that a sum of £4,500,000 would have to be advanced by the Commonwealth Bank, over and above the estimated return from the sale of wheat. The Commonwealth Bank Board intimated that it would not be able to find that amount, and, in consequence of that statement, I , and many honourable members of this House, voted against the bill. We recognized that if the Commonwealth Bank could not extend credit to cover the advances, the Government would have no alternative but to inflate the currency, and to that we were not prepared to agree. A little later, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) wrote to the Sydney Morning Herald pointing out that the amount for which the Commonwealth Government was making itself responsible would be, not £4,500,000, but £8,000,000. The Leader of the Government in the Senate declared that the Government was unable to find any money at all. In sucb circumstances, is it surprising that members of this House, who wished the farmers well, refused to fool them further by assisting in the passage of a measure which, it was clear, could not be implemented. After the bill had become an act, the Minister for Customs( Mr Forde) had to endure the humiliationwhich no other Commonwealth Minister has ever suffered-of telling the farmers, who had been depending on the promise of the Government, that they must fend for themselves, because they could no longer place any reliance upon the legislation which had been passed. Government. Minister does not deny the facts of the case as I have stated them; all he can now say, when he is driven into a corner, is that it was not the fault of the Government. Whose fault was it then? Who misled the farmers ? Who told them that the money would be found, and that they would receive 3s. a bushel for their wheat? Who but the Minister for Customs, backed up by his Government? It was the same Minister who admitted later that the Government could not do what it had promised, and that the farmers would have to get out of their difficulties as best they could. The Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney), who at that time was in London has since returned, and he now tells us that a marketing bill is to be introduced. In answer 'to a question he stated this afternoon that the bill would be introduced before the elections. It is evident, then, that he regards the present bill as certain to fail, and he proposes to have another shot at it later. The 1930 act was a fraud perpetrated on the farmers, and in that respect it was akin to the present proposal. am sorry that the Government finds it necessary to repeal the Wheat Advances Act. It has been suggested that the Government might have informed itself as to the constitutionality of the measure before having it passed through the House. Last year both Houses of Parliament agreed to an amending arbitration act. That caused considerable debate both here and in another place, managers were appointed by both Houses, a conference took place, and the bill was accepted, but, when an attempt was made to put it into",49,Speaker Hon Norman Makin H I L L W C Ward E J

236,Mr Martens (Herbert) [9.29],"Ioperation, the High Court declared that certain clauses were ultra vires of the Constitution. I believe that the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) was right in saying that the Commonwealth Bank Board was prepared to advance 2s. 6d. a bushel, but it might have found itself in the same difficulty as in regard to the 3s. The Government decided not to fool the growers by promising to pay them 3s. a bushel, but to adopt a better method of assisting them. The Leader of the Opposition stated twice before the dinner adjournment to-night that the Opposition was opposed to the action of the Government in regard to the 1930 act, and he suggested that the Country party was not part of the Opposition. I am sure that the present measure will be carried, and I hope that the relief expected will be made available to the farmers at an early date. I am personally aware of the terrible plight of the farmers, and I realize that the Government has a genuine desire to help them. If the effort now being made is frustrated, the fault will not lie with the Government. [9.35] -B y this clause the Government proposes to repeal a measure that was supported in another place as well as in this House, particularly by the Country party. I object to the Government throwing out one of its own measures, which was to have been of great advantage to the primary producers. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane), and other honourable members opposite, expressed determination at the end of last year that the House should not adjourn until the Government had done something for the wheat-growers and the unemployed. They even held up the Labour caucus, and the outcome was that the act of 1930 was passed. The bill was introduced on the 12th December, and it was accepted by both Houses, but we are now invited to repeal it. The Government must have hoped that it would be thrown out, so that it oould tell the country that the Opposition would not do anything in the interests of the farmers If that was not the reason for its introduction, what good reason for it can be advanced? the desired relief, bas given no relief, and it has blocked every other scheme. On the 12th December last the Acting Minister for Markets( Mr Forde) said that the Government had had under consideration the many schemes put forward by the wheat organizations, and had come to the conclusion that the only practicable method of helping the growers was to guarantee them 3s. a bushel. The Acting Minister used these wordsThe Government has examined a l l the proposals that have been made for assisting the wheat-grower, and has come to the conclusion that the only practicable method of helping him is to guarantee him a fair price for his wheat, having regard to the present price of wheat on the world's market. It has decided, after very careful and serious consideration, to guarantee the grower 3s. per bushel f.o.b., equivalent on the average to about 2s. 6d. at country sidings for f.a.q. wheat of the 1930-31 crop. That promise became operative, and the Government should have proceeded to carry it out. I object to the innuendoes of honourable members opposite, in referring to the action of another place in opposing the 4s. guarantee, when the Government now proposes to repeal a measure guaranteeing 3s. that has become law. Whether private members supporting the Government thought that it would be possible to make the advance of 3s. I do not knoAv, but it is apparent from the statement that I have quoted that the Cabinet knew that the Commonwealth Bank would not advance that amount. In December last the Acting Minister, the honourable member for Capricornia, saidAlthough the representations made to the Commonwealth Bank, first by myself, as Minister for Markets, and, secondly, by the Cabinet, to grant additional assistance to the wheat-growers, were not successful, it is felt that if this request is backed by honourable members of a l l parties, as it will be if this bill is carried unanimously, the bank w ill be prepared to make the necessary advances. The Acting Minister said that the bank had rejected the proposal embodied in the 1930 measure, but he felt that if all parties were unanimous the bank might be induced to grant the assistance for which that bill provided. That shows conclusively that the Government was aware of the fact that the bank would not make the advance, and had refused to do se before that measure was brought down on the 12th December last.",50,Speaker Hon Norman Makin H I L L W C Ward E J

239,Mr Bernard Corser,"But itbill would be rejected in another place. that was so or not, the fact is that it was passed by both Houses. It was the means selected by the Government to assist the farmers. The farmers asked for a sales tax on flour, but the Minister said, "" We have chosen this means of assistance, and we are going to guarantee the payment of 3s. a bushel to the farmers."" was conditional on the Commonwealth Bank finding the money. Minister's statement has just been read by me. He claimed that the Government representations to the bank had failed. I do not propose to support the repeal of a measure that has been passed in both branches of the legislature in the interests of the primary producers. The Government and all members should stand to what has been secured for the farmers. We should see that the Government finds the money promised by the Minister, and provided for in the 1930 act. for Markets-Hume) [9.43] -It is difficult to believe that there is much sincerity in the protestations of honourable members opposite. Up to the present time they have apparently never been in doubt as to why an advance of 3s. a bushel could not be made, but to-night they see an opportunity of indulging in mock heroics which they think will deceive the growers. It would be more creditable on their part to do something tangible, instead of wasting the time of the committee and causing further delay. I do not believe that the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) is unaware of the difficulty that made it impossible to provide an advance of 3s. a bushel. All the talk in the world will not enable us to escape from the simple fact that, when the Commonwealth Bank was asked to make the advance, its reply, as has been stated many times, was that it had been informed by its legal advisers that it could not constitutionallv make the money available. If it is suggested that legal advice should have been obtained before the measure was presented to Parliament, my only comment is that it is easy to be wise after the event. It is time that honourable members opposite ceased jumping in the air and coming down again in the same place. The wheat growers of Australia want help, and the Opposition should help the Government to render it to them. I direct the attention of honourable members to the following provision in the Wheat Advances Act:The Minister m.ay arrange witli the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, or a prescribed authority, for the making by tliat bank or authority, either directly to growers of wheat or to any prescribed co-operative organization accordance with this act, and may guarantee to that bank or authority the repayment of any advance made by the bank or authority in pursuance of the arrangement. The Acting Minister for Markets endeavoured to obtain the money to make the advance in accordance with the provisions of that section; but the bank intimated that its legal advisors were of the opinion that Parliament could not constitutionally guarantee the repayment of any loss that might be incurred. draftsmanship of the bill. with it. is the only argument the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) can use he may be satisfied when I tell him that the bill was drafted by the parliamentary draftsman and that the Government, naturally, accepted his advice. The whole trouble is that honourable members opposite are now doing their utmost to make political capital out of ihe misfortunes of the farmers. Afarkets did well under the circumstances which prevailed at that time. the only fair way to look at the position. I am not addressing my remarks to those honourable members opposite whose mam object is to make political capital for themselves. What did the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) do this afternoon when the vote was about to be taken on the amendment of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), which provided for the withdrawal of this bill and the substitution for",51,Speaker Hon Norman Makin H I L L W C Ward E J

In this circumstance it is disgusting to hear them speak as they have done this evening. The plain fact is that the Board of Directors of the Bank accepted the advice of their legal advisors to the effect that the Government could not guarantee the bank against loss. nished to the Bank Board after the bill was passed? so. The legal advisors of the Government were of the opinion that the Government could guarantee the bank against loss, but the bank, naturally, preferred to accept the advice of its own legal authorities. that this advice was given after the bill had been passed. given after the passage of the bill. us to retain the act? no use at all. We are only wasting time in discussing this clause. still maintain that their view is correct and the view of Mr Menzies, K . C , incorrect. Board of the Bank naturally accepted the advice which its own counsel gave it. I now come to the point raised by the honourable member for Angus( Mr Gabb). He said that the bank was prepared, some time ago to guarantee the farmers 2s. 6d. per bushel for their wheat. But I point out that that undertaking by the bank wasSubject to conditions meeting the banks requirements as to proper security to the bank, marketing and other necessary provisions safeguarding the banks interests. It was felt at that time by honourable members on this side of the chamber, as well as by some honourable members opposite, that as 2s. 6d. per bushel was only equal to the ruling price for wheat there would be no advantage to the wheat growers in accepting the bank's offer. In good faith my colleague, the Acting Minister for Markets, did his best to provide 3s. per bushel for the farmers, and it was not his fault that this amount was not paid. why this bill should not be dropped and the printing press used to finance the scheme laid down in the Wheat Advances Act? per bushel were paid, the difference between that figure and the ruling price of wheat would amount, on the season's crop, to about £6,000,000. In all the circumstances the Government felt that it was advisable to adopt the means set out in this bill, rather than some other means, of assisting the farmers, and it is deplorable that some honourable members opposite should persist in arguing that some other plan should be adopted. The committee is becoming accustomed to tirades such as we have just heard from the Minister for Markets. Every honourable member on this side of the chamber who opposes a proposition made by the Minister is charged with trying to make political capital for himself. It is remarkable that such statements should be made by the Minister for Markets of all honourable members, for he is the most extravagant and extreme political partisan in the chamber. No man seeks so consistently as he does a petty political advantage. What has the lecture by the Leader of the Ovmosition to do with the clause before the Chair? I question the relevancy of the honourable member's remarks to the subject-matter under discussion. shall expect the Leader of the Opposition to connect his remarks with the clause. Markets is almost incessantly charging members of the Opposition with trying to make political capital for themselves, and we are about sick of his lectures. The honourable gentleman has only one speech on the subject of wheat, and he repeats it over and over again. I am in the unpleasant position on this occasion of having to support the Minister and the Government, for I regard this clause as sound; but I feel my position keenly.

263,Mr Latham,"The Minister forfor Swan( Mr Gregory) also created a difficult position earlier in the discussion. ineptitude on his part contributed towards I found myself in cordial agreement with the first part of his amendment, which provided for the withdrawal of this bill; but I was totally opposed to the second part of it, which provided, in effect, for the substitution of the Wheat Advances Act for the bill. We should like to hear the Minister for Markets deal with some of the voluble arguments advanced by the Acting Minister for Markets( Mr Forde) last l>ecember in favour of the Wheat Advances Act. That honourable gentleman spent a considerable, although I do not say an unreasonable, time in extolling the merits of that measure, and it would be interesting to hear ihe Minister in charge of this bill discuss that speech in conjunction with this clause. I have heard at least four times the statement that advice was given to the Government concerning the legal aspect. The Minister might frankly admit that the Commonwealth Bank was not prepared to find the money. We all know that was the real reason for the failure of the Wheat Advances Act; so why waste the time of the committee in trying to disguise the fact? In connection with the passage of the Wheat Advances Act of 1930, the Government has been charged with having been insincere and with having attempted to fool the farmers. I was in close touch and co-operation with Ministers in the preparation of that measure, and it is only fair to them that I should declare that, in my opinion, the charge is not true. I believe the Government was sincere. If any criticism of the Government's actions is warranted it is that the introduction of the legislation so late in the session mitigated against that deliberate consideration of it which was desirable. In regard to the handling of the bill by the then Acting Minister for Markets( Mr Forde), having regard to the fact that he was dealing with a measure not directly affecting a department of which he was continuously in charge, and that he had suddenly to deal with a subject with whose past history he was not familiar, he piloted the bill through the House with conspicuous ability. It is unjust to suggest that the failure of the legislation. After listening to the Minister for Markets and Transport ( Mr Parker Moloney) this evening, I came to the conclusion that the Government had abandoned the Wheat Advances Act rather too hastily. He told us that the Crown Law authorities still maintain that the bank's legal advisers are wrong, and that the bank could constitutionally pay the 3s. bounty. In those circumstances the Government, might have pursuedthe matter further in an endeavour to test the correctness of the advice tendered to it. For a couple of hours I have been trying to get the effect of this elause in order that I may cast an intelligent vote upon it. To my interjection, while tbe Minister was speaking, he courteously answered that after the Wheat Advances Bill had been passed, when the Government approached the Commonwealth Bank for a payment of 2s. 6d., the bank replied that it was advised by its lawyers that it could not constitutionally mahe any payment to the farmers. If that is so,, what justification is there for retaining the act on the statute-book, unless the Government is prepared to engage in a long legal fight to test the correctness of the bank's attitude?. In the circumstances. I shall support the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) in voting for the repeal of the act. I very much regret that to-night we have seen on both side3 of the chamber evidence of the party politics against which the people throughout Australia are protesting. Constitutional risings and protests are occurring all over the Commonwealth, but the farmer is still without assistance, and can expect none under the Wheat Advances Act. I shall vote for the clause. [10.5] I am astounded that, after the explanation given by the Minister, members of the Opposition should want to retain an act that cannot be operated. They carefully skated over the attitude of the Commonwealth Bank, although they well know that it is the real culprit. Had the Wheat Marketing Bill been passed, the bank would have found the money",53,Corser Th E On Behalf Of Such Growers Of Advances In

Many wheat organizations, however, .pointed out that if that were done quite a number of wheat growers would not benefit, because theiT wheat was not exported; that it would apply only to about 75 per cent, of the wheat produced. Their representations were considered, and were found to be genuine. After consultation with them, and an examination of the matter, it was agreed that it would be more equitable, seeing that the bounty of 6d. a bushel would involve an expenditure of about £3,500,000, of a share of which many wheat-growers would be deprived, to divide the proposed bounty in the proporgrowers in Queensland, from which no tion that the exportable surplus bore to the total production. some of the States is 75 per cent, or less, a bushel. whereas in ""Western Australia it is about 90 per cent. of this character, it is not competent for especially in Western Australia, which has us to differentiate between States. We -are dealing with this matter in the interests of the whole of Australia and cannot make an arrangement to suit a particular State only. Assuming that the exportable surplus is 75 per cent, of the total production, we must take that figure for all of the States, not 90 per eent. for Western Australia, and 85 per cent, for South Australia, as the case may be. In order that all wheat-growers may benefit equally, it has been arranged to make advances in the manner proposed, instead of paying 6d. a bushel on the exportable surplus. -Everythin g the Minister has said justifies the statement of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory).

This arbitrary method of regarding 75 per cent, as the exportable surplus is unfair to those surplus. The amendment of the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , providing for the payment of 6d. a bushel on production, was ruled out of order because it exceeded the order of leave for the bill. A message should be obtained from the Governor General to cover the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca, or the Minister might himself bring in such an amendment. proposal of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory} has the .advantage of simplicity.

If the proposal of the honourable member for Swan is accepted, it will not involve the payment of more money.

I ask the Minister to have it stated clearly in the bill just what the farmers are to receive. has been drafted in this way on the advice of the Crown Law Department. According to the Minister, on the advice of the Crown Law Department the clause has been drafted in this way to provide for the payment of the bounty on the export of wheat, yet the bill itself provides for its payment on the production of wheat. How can the farmers accept the Minister's explanation? Why is the amendment of 6d. mentioned when it has to be split up into percentages unless the object is to give the measure a more attractive label? The payment is to be 4-Jd., yet the Minister tries to make out that it is a bounty of 6d. I cannot accept the constitutional difficulties to which allusion has been made. If a payment of 4-Jd. only is meant, there is every chance of a provision making that clear being found to be constitutional, and the farmer may possibly get something more than the smell of an oil rag out of the proposal. I certainly endorse what the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) has said, and I also would gladly contribute to the funds of the Canberra Hospitali f the farmers could be present here to hear the Minister's quibbles and tergiversations. I support the amendment, and if it is not agreed to, shall persevere with the amendment of which I have given notice. ing to a summary of the Commonwealth Government's activities issued to-day, a bounty is to be paid on wheat at the rate of 6d. a bushel on the exportable surplus produced in Australia during the 1930-31 season and it is estimated that and 150,000,000 bushels comprising wheat as such and wheat the equivalent of flour exported. Already over 50,000,000 bushels of wheat have been shipped overseas. I think 153,000,000 bushels. If the Minister will say that the bounty of 6d. is to apply to the whole of the exportable surplus it will automatically raise the price of wheat as yet unsold for local consumption by 6d. a bushel. Of course there will be many difficulties in that connection because of the wheat already held by millers, and the wheat that has already gone into conclause sumption. A t any rate those who have wheat still on their hands would be able to get an extra 6d. a bushel. According to the Minister we are to pay bounty on 75 per cent, of the total production. But our exportable surplus is actually more than 75 per cent, of the total production. The summary of Commonwealth Government activities says that the bounty is to be paid on the exportable surplus at the rate of 6d. a bushel. I suggest again that the price all round should be raised by a bounty of 6d. or, if that is not possible, the bounty should be paid on the exportable surplus, which would help the wheat growers by securing for them an increased price for wheat yet unsold for local consumption. A bounty of 6d. on an exportable surplus of from 140,000,000 to 150,000,000 bushels might mean a payment of £3,750,000, but if the exportable surplus is found to be 153,000,000 bushels, as I think it will be, the payment will amount to £3,825,000. If , agaiu, 6d. a bushel is paid on all wheat exported or sold locally, payment of £4,750,000 will be required. If the Minister cannot see his way to pay 6d. all round on the exportable surplus, I suggest that he pays an all-round bounty of 4£d. a bushel. what the bill proposes.",58,Pairs

302,Mr Stewart,"That is the effect ofsimpler distribution of the money if that were explicitly stated in the clause under consideration. There is confusion in the language employed. For instance, we are told in sub-clause 1 of clause 4 that the bounty is payable on the "" production of wheat"". In another part of the bill we are told that it is payable on the ""export of wheat"". A lawyer has informed me that before I can secure the bounty I shall be expected to produce my wheat either in the stack or in a barn. I do not know how I can produce it after I have sold it unless I follow it up until some one in authority has seen it. I know what the clause means, but I do not think that the real intention is clearly expressed. I sympathize with the endeavours of honourable members who are proposing amendments, but I think that it is better to leave the bill as it stands, because the Minister has informed us that those who advise the Government on constitutional points have suggested the drafting employed, because they consider it best gives effect to the desire to pay a bounty of 4£d. a bushel. I shall gladly support an increase, but that would entail the bringing down of another message from the Governor General which the Government might refuse. If the Minister insists on a limit of 4£d. it is better to accept the clause as already drafted, because an amendment might eventually be found to be constitutionally out of joint. already warned honourable members of that danger. Amendment negatived. -7-1 shall move the amendment of which I have already given notice. Clause8 is designed to prevent interstate trade in wheat, no doubt for the purpose of enabling the Governments of States with large populations to increase the local price of wheat, thus giving the wheat growers of those States a special advantage. provides for a uniform bounty of 4£d. a bushel to apply all over Australia whether the growers are in the fortunate position of the Queensland growers who can get a specially manipulated local It would lead to a much consumption price for all the wheat they grow or whether they are in the position of growers in a State such as Western Australia, who can only get a local consumption price for one bushel in every ten. If we make special provisions in this bill to enable the populous States to give their growers special advantages, it is only fair that in the provisions applying to the payment of the bounty a sliding scale should be adopted, so that the assistance would be granted on an equitable basis. I move That the word "" Australia"", sub-clause 2, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, ""the State in which the wheat was grown "", and that at the end of the sub-clause the words "" in that State"" be added. That would make the bounty payable in Western Australia something over 5d., and in Queensland, where the growers already receive a fair price for home consumption, probably no bounty at all would be payable, because wheat is not exported from that State. The fairness of the amendment should be obvious to the committee. I urge the Minister to remember that this is a national Parliament, and that he is not merely a representative of the State of! New South Wales, which has special advantages, by reason of its industrial population, for securing that with regard to a large proportion of its wheat the growers shall have the benefit of an artificially-raised home price. cannot see his way clear to make the amendment in this chamber, I urge him to consider its insertion when the bill reaches another place. The farmers of Western Australia responded to the appeal to produce as much wheat as possible for export, but the local consumption in that State is very small. While in New South Wales 15 bushels is consumed locally for every 60 bushels produced, Western Australia exports 20 bushels for every bushel consumed locally. The clause we are dealing with I ask the Minister to consider whether it will be possible to carry out the suggestion made by the Loan Council regarding the method of granting assistance to growers.

Minister for Markets) [11.6] I have already indicated that, where there is a large exportable surplus, the question would arise whether a State like Western Australia would get as large a sum as States where the local consumption is higher; but I repeat that, under the Constitution, differentiation between the States is not permissible. The Constitution gives this Parliament power to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, "" but so that such bounties shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth."" I am not satisfied that that part of the Constitution referred to by the Minister disposes of the argument of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker). Could it be regarded as differentiation between Statesi f we carried the amendment of the honourable member for Wakefield, which would have the effect of giving a bounty to each and all States on a similar basis? Under the amendment the bounty would be paid on the actual export of each State. That would mean that the growers in Queensland would not receive a bounty, and they do not require it, because they have a local consumption price. Thus there would be no discrimination against Queensland. It could not be said that it was discrimination against a Statei f it received a smaller amount of bounty than was received by another State because its exportable surplus was lower than that of another State. It does not seem to me that the section of the Constitution which the Minister quoted effectively disposes of the argument of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker). The Minister has rather strengthened the case made out by the honourable member. I sympathize with the objective of the honourable although Victoria, I feel that the amendment, if adopted, would not be in the interests of that State. There is a constitutional difficulty that is fatal to the amendment. If it were adopted, the wheat-growers in Queensland and Tasmania would not receive any bounty, the Victorian growers [33] 3.8d., New South Wales 2.4d., South Australia 4.7d., and Western Australia 5.2d. Whereas, under the bill, the wheat growers in all the States would receive 4-Jd. That shows a decided discrimination as between States. The Commonwealth would, in effect, be saying that the wheat-growers in Queensland and Tasmania could not receive any bounty, and, therefore, they would be discriminated against. As the Minister has stated that the Crown Law authorities have advised that the clause has been drafted in its present form in. order to avoid any constitutional difficulties, I trust that the amendment will not be adopted. not opposing this amendment because, as the honourable member for Wakefield suggested, there would be a differentiation against Queensland growers who are doing well under their own scheme, but on the ground that, so far as possible, the bounty should be paid according to the growers' needs. If the figures just quoted by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) are substantially correct, it.would mean that, on a 4£d. basis, the growers in Victoria would receive 3.8d., New South Wales 4.2d., South Australia 4.7d. and Western Australia 5.2d. As wheat is produced more cheaply in Western Australia than in any other State, there is no reason why those able to produce wheat at the cheapest rate should receive the highest bounty. No wheat growers have suffered more severely in recent years than those in South Australia, where some have not even seed wheat. That is also the position in part of the electorate represented by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart). Why then should those who have been confronted with such adverse conditions be paid at a lower rate simply because the exportable surplus in the State in which they are conducting their operations is less than that in Western member for Wakefield, Australia, or some of the other States. I as a representative of do not think anything would be gained by adopting the amendment, and a grave injustice would be done to certain growers.

Question so resolved in the negative. is now within half an hour of midnight and the Minister has introduced practically a new clause, the object of which is to secure that moneys paid to farmers by way of bounty shall not be available by any process of execution. Of course, the farmers who receive the money should be at liberty to spend it, and they will spend it in the discharge of liabilities or in the buying of goods or services.

328,"Mr Stewart (""Wimmera) [11.37].","the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and the Minister, knows what the proposed new sub-clause means. No one else has been privileged to read it or even to see it . As Leader of the Country party, all night to secure the adoption of certain amendments in the interests of our growers. We have not offered factious opposition to the measure at any stage. The third clause was passed without debate. The fourth clause was discussed, but I think that even the Minister will admit that every word uttered during the debate was relevant. Thef if t h clause was passed without discussion, as also would have been the sixth if the Minister had not raised this issue. It is a scandal that, in a deliberative assembly like this, we should be asked to pass a technical clause before we understand f u l l y what it means or before we even see it. When private members desire to submit amendments to bills, the amendments are printed and circulated for the information of honourable members. On this occasion, for the first time in my experience, the Ministeri n charge of a bill has moved to insert a technical provision without giving members a copy of the amendment. It is not understood even by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), one of the most astute lawyers in this Parliament, or by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) who also belongs to the legal fraternity. Although the Leader of the Opposition offered .to confer with the Crown Law Authorities on the constitutional aspect of the Wheat AdvancesB ill of 1930, the Government spurned his offer and persisted with the bill in tbe form in which it had been introduced. To-night we have repealed that measure because of its unconstitutionality, and now, through the attitude of the Government, there is a possibility of the bill before us proving of no real value to the farmers. This is a scandal that should not be permitted, and I , at any rate, will not take such treatment lying down. support the protest of the Leader of the Country party and trust that the Minister will meet the wishes of the committee by consenting te report progress.
