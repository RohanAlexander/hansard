The Bills before us tonight will contribute back to the date of announcement. Although the substantially to that. the 10 minutes which I have to speak in this debefore the Parliament is that it overturns bate, let me start by putting certain propositions retrospectively the decision in Slutzkin's case. I about this law to this chamber. First of all, there is will give an example as to how it works. First, let the need for certainty in the law. Secondly, there us assume a case in which there is a company that is the need for adherence to the rule of law, and by has two shareholders. It has nil liabilities save tax adherence to the rule of law I do not mean the and has paid all of its past tax. Let us assume that retrospective overturning of a decision of the it has-I will use simple figures so that the High Court of Australia. That is quite contrary to Government can understand-$IG'),OOO of the adherence of the rule of law. Thirdly, there is accumulated revenue profits and $100,000' of the principle which has to be considered in tax capital profits. That would add up, as any legislation, as it must in any other legislation, that Government member could understand, to within the law a citizen is entitled to order his $200,000. Let us further assume that it has $250 in affairs. For those who would say, on the part of current unpaid company tax and a paid up capital the Government, that this is some recent creation of $20,000. Under the formula which is worked of the High Court, let me remind them that in out in this Act the value of the company, minus its 1927 one of the leading justices in England said: paid up capital, minus the unpaid company tax, is to be the deemed dividend. In the case that I gave, It is trite law that His Majesty's subjects are free, if they that is $179,750 which, for each of the two sharecan, to make their own arrangements, so that their cases may fall outside the scope of the taxing Acts. They incur holders, would then be $89,875 on which they no legal penalties and, strictly speaking, no moral censure would pay 60 per cent tax. That tax would be paid if, having considered the lines drawn by the Legislature, in reference to profits, half of which would never for the imposition of taxes, they make it their business to have been taxable in the hands of the company or walk outside them. on a winding up. The fourth point to bear in mind is this: There is a To make the illustration even clearer, let us great distinction between what is legally permissassume that the same company had no ible and socially undesirable. We can all differ on accumulated revenue profits; it simply had the view as to what is desirable or undesirable but $200,000 in capital profits. The result is that the question as to whether, a matter is legally perunder the operation of this legislation each of the missible is one that should be left to the resolution shareholders would pay $56,925 or more. On of our courts. In this case, we have, in the Taxwhat? They would pay it on a deemed dividend of ation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment a capital sum, which is a capital gains tax. This Amendment Bill a proposition which is aimed at amounts to the retrospective reversal of Slutzkin's reversing, retrospectively, a decision of the High case.

After the decision of the High Court in proposed new section 5A (3), of the Taxation Slutzkin's case, one had essentially three courses (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Amendopen toone. ment Bill. If that formula is not as I put it, the Government should amend it so as to make it perMr Robert Brown-That was a shameful defectly clear in the legislation that under no circision. That is the sort of decision you like. cumstances is there ever to be a tax which is to be attributable to a capital element. But as matters now stand, that is how the legislation reads and accumulated profits in a company and where that is how it will operate. taxes had been paid on those profits, one could trade one and use those accumulated profits for It will be irrelevant as to why the company the purposes of business; secondly, one could tax-the sum of $250 that I mentioned-was not wind up the company and distribute the profits paid. It may have been unpaid as a result of fraud and the revenue profits and only the revenue or commercial misfortune. The tax is imposed not profits would be subject to tax under section 47. only on profits on which taxes had already been Thirdly, one could sell on the basis of the decision paid, but also on profits that were never taxable in in Slutzkin's case, and for those ignorant idiots the hands of the company itself.
