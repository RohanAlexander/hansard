But we should not accomplish his desire by inserting the provision in regard to the expenditure in July not exceeding that in the previous June twelve months. surer) [11.25] I cannot understand the argument of the honourable member for West Sydney. The Bill is perfectly explicit. It provides that I f before the close of any financial year no supply has been granted or appropriation made to meet the current expenditure of the Commonwealth for the whole or part of the next financial have to be prolonged. There has to be yearthat is to say, if there has been no Supplythe Treasurer may issue from the Commonwealth public account such sums as are necessary to meet such expenditurehub* there are certain conditions. first is that the authority of the Treasurer under this section shall only be exercised during and in respect of the month of July. The argument that the Treasurer could spend money for six months ahead is not only inconceivable, but absolutely contrary to the terms of the clause. entitled to spend .money that does not exceed the expenditure in the month of June. be authorized to spend money in respect of the month of July. If an appropriation is made by Parliament during July the powers of this Bill cease. The expenditure must be in accordance with the Appropriation Act of the previous year. Consequently the. items must be such as have been'-' approved of by Parliament. We also provide that the aggregate amount of the expenditure shall not exceed the amount expended in the month of June preceding. the precedingfinancialyear. I submit that the words "" in respect of "" bind the Treasurer to the month of July. The words "" in accordance w it h "" bind the Treasurer to the items of expenditure approved by Parliament in the previous year. The words "" aggregate amount of expenditure "" bind the Treasurer to adhere to the items of the Appropriation Act of the previous year as approved by Parliament, and further bind him not to spend more on such items in July than was expended in the preceding month of June. The provision seems to me to be perfectly clear. What is the object of the clause? It is not to allow the Treasurer to spend money recklessly, but merely to convenience the administration of affairs. but the possibilities are greater than the contention. politics is willing to trust the other, why should not the other side trust them?.'

Every day we find Ministers differing diametrically in their statements. TheB ill , as it stands, will permit the Treasurer of the day to spend in the month of July an amount equal to that which was spent during the previous June. Now ifc may happen that the ordinary circumstance's of government have justified an excessive expenditure in June. This may arise from the desire of the Ministry to clear up the accounts before the close of the financial year. That, however, is not the practice of the State Governments. They frequently say, in regard to many accounts, "" Q h ! let them stand over t ill next year."" It depends entirely upon the state of their balance-sheet. We may congratulate ourselves that thab is not the practice with Commonwealth Governments. They are accustomed to sending oufc special requests with a view to expediting the payment of all accounts due before 'the close of the financial year. The ordinary circumstances of government justify an excessive expenditure in the month of June. But that is no reason why in July, and without knowledge of Parliament,' without any supervision and criticism, the Treasurer should be given a blank cheque to do in that month what ifc was. essential and proper to do in June.

The use of the word "" aggregate "" will permit of a manijjulafcioii of the expenditure. Ifc will permit, for instance, of the raising of salaries, and that ought uot to be permitted without a criticism on the Estimates. salaries can only be raised by Parliamentary vote? dinary circumstances increases of salaries are detailed in the Estimates, and honourable members know precisely what is going on, but the inclusion' of the word ""aggregate"" in the amendment-and it is not proposed at present to cub ifc outwill mean that i u ""July the Treasurer, if he so desired, could increase salaries in various directions, and once they had been increased, it would be a very difficult matter for honourable members to fairl y criticise them or to have any check upon what he was doing.

But we do not want to specifically give the Treasurer power to do things of thafc description i u July, when we have no control over hirn. I will give an instance. It might be that a Government was defeated afc a general election. The standard of honour in Governments differs. Indeed, the circumstances in their opinion might really justify them in retaining their positions, eveu though defeated at the polls.

Ministers might retain their positions, as they would have the power to do, and under this B ill indulge in an increase of salaries, of whioh perhaps their successors might not approve. They might indulge in a form of expenditure which would not be acceptable to their successors, but which nevertheless they would be committed to by a defeated Government. Let us retaiu the measure, as was the original intention. Let us put it in such a form as thafc any ordinary inconvenience because of the inability to spend one penny Althoughi t will not be in July shall be met, so that the Treasurer, whoever he might be, could tide over the inconvenience. But do nofc let us, i u this apparently simple measure, give a defeated Government the power to expend money.

The Treasurer tells us he requires the time to ponder over the figures and prepare his Budget Speech.

283,Mr Hughes (West Sydney) [2.55],"Commission. I do nob go as far as to say that, but I can conceive the building up of a Department witli great powers and a stall disproportionately large to the functions it will have to perform. We should sanction the creation of some body that will be independent, and 'have the authority to determine the suitability of supplies and tenders for stores and material required by the Commonwealth, and if the Treasurer will only tell us exactly his intention as to the power he wishes to gefc, much misunderstanding will disappear. surer) [2.57] -The present system of purchase and control pf stores is not under regulations having the force of law. The object of obtaining tlie authority in clause 3 is to make regulations that will have the force of law, so that the Auditor-General's powers under section 41 of the Audit Act will have full play, which I hesitate in saying fchey have at present. Purchases are made all over Australia by different Departments under instructions, but these instructions are not as binding as regulations. utilize the Tender Boards in the different States, and I do not think there is need to rush in to appoint other Tender Boards so soon as we gefc tliis power, because we can utilize the Boards that exist in the different States and their regulations. We owe a debt of gratitude to the different States for allowing the Commonwealth to use their machinery and regulations. When a State Tender Board calls for tenders at the beginning of the year on a long list of hundreds of items the Commonwealth is included, and we have the option of taking our goods from the contractors afc the prices they have submitted to the State Tender Board. General have the power to say what prices should be paid 1 General has nothing to do with the purchases. He comes in afterwards. these Tender Boards to be necessarily officers of the Auditor-General's Department? Tender Boards cost very little. In Victoria, for instance, the heads of fche various Departments compose the Tender Board. General have the right to say whether the purchase is a good or bad one ? can afterwards express his opinion for the information of the House. It is his duty to report whether thefinancesof the public have been properly husbanded. I do nofc think there is much limit as to what fche Auditor-General may do in criticising public accounts and reporting to Parliament. Sometimes Ministers are afc variance with the Auditor-General, but that does not prevent him making his report to Parliament. These regulations, having the force of law, will be binding on the Departments. does the Treasurer contemplate getting the members of the Board? nofc have Tender Boards for some time. VVe are now utilizing the Tender Boards of the States, and we can do ifc for many a day yet, but meanwhile the regulations will have the force of law, and under section 41 of the Audit Acfc they will come The practice has been to underfchepurview of the Auditor-General, which is not now the case.

297,Mr Hughes (West Sydney) [3.4],"violently accused by the Prime Minister of obstructing necessary legislation. We learn now that there is to be not one Tender Board, but many. I can understand that one Tender Board would be of no service. If something is required in Perth we can conceive the utter in ability of a Ministeri n Melbourne expressing a reasonable and measured opinion concerning it . The right honourable gentleman possibly contemplates boards being appointed in the various States. To that I have no objection, but I ask honourable members to consider for a moment that the door will thus be opened to all sorts of possibilities. Here are boards whose functions are extremely vague, and the sphere of whose operations is obscure and apparently unlimited. What they are to do, and why they are to do it , we are not told, but we are led to understand very clearly that the Treasurer does not want them to do anything at all for quite a long time. cumstances I think we might fairl y ask him to withdraw this part of the B ill until the need should arise for the creation of a body of this kind. point. The other point, as to which I am afraid the right honourable gentleman did not permit himself that measure of perspicacious utterance which it certainly requires-the question as to where the persons who are to constitute these Tender Boards are to come from-w e should have more information. The Treasurer says that they are not to come from the Auditor-General's Department. from what Department are they to be selected, or are they to be persons now outside the Public Service? As I said on a previous occasion, I have no objection to the right honourable gentleman constituting ,a departmental board when and how he likes. there shall be some responsible and independent authority to review the actions of these Tender Boards, just as the actions of all other officers are reviewed. That was the point made .bj' the honourable member for East Sydney. Thc Treasurer knows that if he wishes to create such boards he -does not require an Act of Parliament to enable liim to .do so. I am utterly at a loss to understand why he is taking the power under this B ill to create a Supply and Tender Board, which, he admits is not to be recruited from the .staff of the Auditor-General. The Auditor General himself is not to .bo the head of this Department, but is to have the power to review its actions. When we ask who are to constitute the board, whether they are to come from the Department of Home Affairs or from some other Department, we are not told. ourselves yet. They will bedepartmental officers. The selection will be something like that made under the Victorian law, a copy of which I hand to the honourable member. right honourable member has handed to me shows that the Victorian Supply and Tender Board comprises, amongst others, the Secretary of Public Works, the Inspector General of Public Works, and the In spector-General for the Insane-a n oflicer whose most appropriate appearance in this connection seems to mark a new era in the debate. There has been hitherto an air of confusion, doubt, and difficulty about it , which is most regrettable, and the In the cirreason for which was not quite clear; but we now learn that tlie Victorian Government, wiser than ourselves, have provided that the Inspector-General for the So much for that Insane shall be one of the officers charged with the important duties in connection with a Supply and Tender Board. officer named in the list Neglected Children! This is, indeed, a refreshing sight. Politicsi n these days are essentially vev/y dull, and the Then prospects before us are not calculated to rouse us to much jubilation. I should welcome with almost a transport of delight tbe possibilities for opera bouffe and unadulterated humour afforded by a board of this kind in which the Inspector General for the Insane's vagaries are, so All that we ask is that to speak, counterbalanced by the efforts of the Secretary for Neglected Children to see that nothing was done that ought to be done. There are on the Victorian Board a number of other gentlemen,-some of whose functions bear a very sinister appearance. One of these is the Inspector General of Penal Establishments. This is introducing into the discussion a note against which I protest, aud the Attorney-General, as the representative of the law, should be called upon to rise in his place, not as a matter of privilege, bufc by way of personal explanation.

The Prime Minister, in discussing the preliminary stages of the measure, asserted that it was the intention of the Governmeut to establish such a board. Attorney-General yesterday, when unacquainted with what was in the mind of the Treasurer, also asserted that it was the intention to establish the board. few moments ago, presumably after consultation with his colleagues, he stated that that is not intended. Attorney-General spoke, the Treasurer informed the Committee that it was not the intention of the Government to establish such a board at present; that he did not want it ; and that it was intended to continue the practice at present prevailing. I s it any wonder, in view of these differences of opinion, being established under a mere regulathat honourable members on this side should display a little apprehension as to what really is the intention of the M in istry?

A f t e r listening to the Prime Minister, it member contend for a moment that the would appear that the Government propose to take advantage of it ; but, after listening to the Treasurer, it is clear that they do not intend to take advantage of it.

We have a right to be apprehensive and to ask for information, in view of the contradictory statements made from the other side.

We are extracting, occasionally and with pain to the person from whom it is extracted, little bits of in formation. The Treasurer has divulged something of what is in his mind.

Honorary Minister has distributed today a reprint of thc Electoral Act, showing the proposed amendments in block and erased type, which, of course, is a very commendable proceeding. Regarding the provisions for voting by post, I would like to know from the honourable gentleman, by interjection, or even in his second-reading speech, or from a Minister who has not spoken, whether those provisions vary from the repealed provisions. It is most important, I think, to have that information. I have not had time to compare the clauses in this Bill with the former provisions for postal voting. Eight or a dozen provisions appear to have been taken en bloc from some Act. I want to know whether they arc the same as our original provisions, or whether any alterations in the text have been made. Information on that subject will help honourable members on this side and facilitate discussion. Thc Honorary Minister has told us that we have nearly four clays in which to digest a subject about which he knows very little. Does he mean to suggest that in the two days we shall be travelling by train we must study this measure? Does he mean to suggest that wo must give up our Sabbath to that work? Are the Government so depraved in their conception of their duty, not only to the people of this country, but to the Higher Power, as to force honourable members to study matters of this kind on the sacred day of the week? The suggestion of the Acting Leader of the Opposition, that the debate should be adjourned after the Minister has concluded his second-reading speecli, is one which, I tliink, the Prime Minister would be very wise in adopting. which, if extended to honourable members on this side, will be returned with interest, but if the Honorary Minister, who makes these sneers and jibes, and ridicules men who are old enough to be his father, and more enlightened than probably his father ever was, is to prevail, such conduct self would bring about. In his reply to a will be returned with interest, with a certainty. I advise this young stripling opposite to take a little advice, and not start to dictate and dominate the House, superior way to indicate what should be done. you castigating him. I can do no good with him. honourable friend cannot, as he will find out as he goes along; he will discover that his colleague belongs to the worse specimens that this country has produced. This morning I received from the Prime Minister a reply to a question regarding the escapees from the quarantine station at Manly. I have to complain about the nature of the reply. It was to the effect that five men had escaped from the quarantine area; that they were not in a highly contagious condition; in fact, that they were convalescent, and, therefore, there was no danger to the community. All authorities that I know of have laid it down that the most contagious stage of this disease is that of convalescence. Por the gentleman who is at the head of a big Department of this kind, and who is responsible for the whole of the business in connection with the scare in Sydney today, to send such a reply to this House, as though we were a lot of school children, is so much bluff, unworthy of an oflicer of a Department. Further, if his statement is correct, and these persons were wholly convalescent, they had no right to be in the quarantine area. They should have been discharged if they were what he calls wholly convalescent. On the other hand, the newspapers of Sydney, with scare headings, reported the escape of the men from tbe quarantine station, and stated that they wore mixing with the people of Manly, and had the disease in a contagious form. That is absolutely contrary to the statement of Dr. Cumpston. The newspapers used the incident, as they have been doing There are considerations from the beginning of the epidemic, to scare people into being vaccinated. It is a scandalous thing that every little point that can be taken with regard to the position of small-pox patients is used by the newspapers of this country to drive people into a worse condition than small-pox it question on a matter of great importance to the people of New Soutb",39,Honourable Members Oh Ister Asks That Question I Will Under

355,Mr Webster,"I know that myWales, D r . Cumpston docs not indicate that he has a comprehension of the responsibilities of his office, or, if that is not so, that he has the knowledge which -should be possessed by u man who is administering a Department of that kind -sufficiently to w in the confidence of the people. I clo not wish to further dwell o n the matter, because I understand that the Prime Minister is prepared to give me an opportunity, as soon as he can, to -discuss it . That being so, I clo not want to sacrifice that liberality on his part. He realizes the importance of the matter. It is of primary importance to the people in this country that we should know wliether the action of the Government is warranted by the experience of other countries, ancl by the knowledge of the highest autliorities. I u my judgment the Government are making a serious blunder, and spreading the disease day by day, as has been done in epidemic after epidemic, by vaccination. people day by day into being vaccinated the newspapers are doing nothing more or less than continuing thc epidemic, which is practically the outcome of vaccination. We had evidence of that through the press when the Health Officer said that the disease was only attacking people in a very mild form , but that it was very probable that in a few days, or a week or two, it would appear in a malignant form . T h a t statement has not been borne out by the course of events. The fact that weeks and weeks have gone by without any very serious cases having been reported, and without any deaths having occurred, only bears out fny statement as to the experience of all other countries during an epidemic, and that is that it is suicidal to introduce wholesale vaccination, because it spreads the very disease it is in lated fco spread fche disease which ifc is astended to check. This is going on right along the line, and the Ministeri n charge of the Department evidently takes no notice of it . Where is he now? What cares he for the loss incurred by the people of to-day! What cares he for the r u in which is staring them in the face, in many cases by reason-of the loss of business and the paralyzing of industry! What cares he about the lives which are being sacrificed day by day by vaccination and the effects of it ! DOW. been in Sydney all the time. To a Minister who is in charge of a Department of State like this, when the lives of the people are at stake, which is the more important? The business interests of the community are also at stake. It is not his place to be away from the scene of action. He should be there, watching closely every move, to see if he can bring relief to these people who have been scared by the action of the Government, which had no warrant or justification, but must be regarded as a calamity such as I hope will never occur again in the administration of the affairs of this country. The newspapers are making capital out of the disease, and are doing more in j u r y by what they publish in the city of Sydney than could be done in any other way. They have done everything to inculcate a haunting fear of small-pox, with a view to driving the people to vaccination. By scaring Everything that can be put forward to bring about wholesale vaccination has been published, but nothing to enlighten the people as to the folly of it is given publicity, although the newspapers profess to be the great public educators, and fche guides of the people. For the in formation of these persons, who could sit, I presume, afc the side of the grave laughing, in their ghoulish delight, at the tears shed by the relatives of those who have been called away by the effects of vaccination, I shall produce in this Chamber, not' theory, bufc practical exjserience, and the judgment of men in every part of the world of far liigher standing than D r . Cumpston, proving that the action of the Government is suicidal, and destructive of the besfc interests of Australia, being calcuserted they are trying to stop. I suggest to the Prime Minister that when I again ask a question i u this House, he will intimate to his ofiicers that questions are asked seriously, with a view to getting information, and that members are not to be treated as children. We have no right to be told that a small-pox convalescent is not a contagious subject, because it is well known in connection with all scrofulous diseases such as measles, scarlet fever, small-pox, and the like, that those who are in the convalescent stage are most likely to spread the disease.",40,Honourable Members Oh Ister Asks That Question I Will Under

357,Mr Webster,"Yes, but he has notdraw the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to a matter that has already been brought before the House by me once or twice, and upon which I have asked questions, the giving for political purposes of £ 5 0 0 by Mr Herbert Brookes to the honourable member fbr Perth. Perth has admitted that he received that inoney, and that it was received for political purposes; but he said that he did not know exactly the date when it was received. I should be glad if my banking account were in such a state that I could not remember exactly when I had received a sum like £ 5 0 0 . However, the honourable member for Bourke stated in this House that it was on the 26th A p r i l that the cheque was given. I raise no objection to the giving of the cheque, because I think that persons should be allowed to devote money for political purposes in aid of whatever party they may be associated with. But T bring the matter under the attention of the Minister of Homo Affairs because the Electoral Acfc provides that an account must be given of any money sent for political purposes to any organization. I have asked whether the Home Affairs Department has received an account of how this inoney was spent, and have been informed that the Department has no information about it . The honourable' member for Perth was good enough to say that Mr Brookes informed him that I could go to liis office, and see a statement of how the money was spent, but that is not my business. The matter would have been no concern of mine, but for the fact that section 172 of tbe Electoral Act says that a statement showing how much money is spenfc must be sent to the Chief Electoral Officer. As fche money left Melbourne on fche 26i.li A p r i l , ifc was inoney spenfc in connection parently, the people do not wish us to with the elections, and I ask the Prime Minister to ascertain whether steps have been taken to see if the Act has been complied with. question some .time ago, the honourable gentleman said thafc he was nofc a detective. I do not ask him to be a detective, bufc ifc is hia business to see that administration entrusted to him is properly performed. During the electoral campaign, we heard a great deal about the need for pure administration, and about the need for purity of elections. I ask, therefore, whether an attempt will be made by the Chief Electoral Officer to give effect to the provisions of the electoral law in respect to the donation to which I have referred. Mi-.

When his measures are introduced, they will meet with the keenest opposition. During this week, we have been kept here every night u n t i l nearly midnight, bufc I submit that, in the interests of the honourable gentleman's physical condition, as well as for the sake of the health of other lionorable members, our proceedings should close by half-past ten. It is nofc merely the hours that we sit here that have to be taken into account; the time occupied in attending to our voluminous correspondence musfc also be reckoned in . I have to answer letters from all parts of a constituency which is larger than Victoria. The Prime Minister can do a fair thing to the country and to himself only by setting apart a certain number of hours each day for the discussion of public business. He should not try to wear down his opponents physically. Such attempts only meet with retaliation and reprisals, and that we do not want. We want a fair fight, and should be permitted to get to our homes at a reasonable hour at night.

In the Age of to-day there is a report of a speech delivered by Mr Herbert Brookes last night at a social function tendered to the defeated candidate for Bourke.

359,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [4.5],"during last week it was. said in the House of Representatives that he had been responsible for willing to send the honourable member passing on a certain sum of money to a member in another State. He wished to say that this was fortable that his health need give us no absolutely true. He was proud of it, nnd hoped to be uble to do it again. He hardly understood why such a disturbance had been raised in the House over the matter, when the secretary of the Political Labour League in Sydney admitted that a straight-out payment was made for political purposes. But how had Mr Anstey received this information? Apparently the whole of Australia was ridden with a nefarious system of spies. This was not playing the game. A t that social gathering a member of the Government, Senator McColl, was present; but I do not know whether or not, as the report of his speech is exceptionally brief, he complimented Mr Brookes on the financial efforts he had made to assist his Liberal brethren. However that may be, Mr Brookes made a very definite statement; and, as the honourable member for Barrier has said, the Electoral Act requires all persons and associations to send in returns as to political expenditure at election times. That section of the Act the Government do not propose to amend, and we may take it that they approve of it . made by the honourable member for Barrier is a very modest one, and Mr Brookes practically invites investigation. orable member wish me to do?
