In view of the keen interest which the general public has evinced in them in the past, and in the light of the improvement of the defence position, I ask you, Mr able members that the establishment of Speaker, whether or not you -will consider the precedent of moving for the alterahaving them returned? I have not exact knowledge of who are tin? custodians of these exhibits. I agree with the honourable member that they were a matter of very keen interest to visitors to Parliament House.. I shall consult with the proper authority in order to determine whether or not they may be returned. Speaker, each day _ a document entitled Totes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives is circulated. I ask you what procedure is available to an honourable member who desires to challenge the accuracy of any item, in that record. May he raise the matter on a question of order, or must he submit a substantive motion in order to deal with it? the Clerk of the House to compile and issue from day to day the Votes and Proceedings. Unrevised proofs of them are issued on the morning following the sitting to which they relate. Should an honourable member desire to challenge their accuracy, I suggest that he should mention the matter to me so that I may consult With the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk, both of whom keep records. If , as I anticipate might be the case, p. ruling given by a Chairman of Gonvmittees were involved, that gentleman also might bo consulted. The question is not one of order. A substantive motion, of which notice had been given, would be necessary if the matter were to be dealt with otherwise. would not be out of order in submitting a J. S. Rosevear) substantive motion, if the procedure which you suggest did not suit him ? the best safeguard. If a mistake had been made, It might be adjusted after a praper inquiry. On the other hand, the submission of a motion might have very fnr-roHnhing consequences, one of which might lie that whilst an honourable member might have a perfectly legitimate complaint he might be over-borne by a majority of the House.

I bring under notice an inaccuracy in the official printed Votes and Proceedings of the House of Bepresetntalives. No. 28, dated the 15th March, 1944. I personally know that this record is in correct, and contrary to the Standing Orders. I quote this passageMember named -The Temporary Chairman( Mr Martens) named the honourable member authority of the Chair. Question-That the clause be postponedput and negatived. having returned and expressed his regret, the matter was not further proceeded with. L was present during the proceedings, and did not hear put such a motion as "" That the clause be postponed"", nor did I see any evidence of the Temporary Chairman putting any motion to the committee. Under the forms of the House, it could not have been put between the period when the member was named and the committee had dealt with such an order of the Chair as would alone finalize the incident. It was finalized when the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) urged the honourable McEwen) to explain the episode and said that otherwise it would be his, the Prime Minister's, duty to uphold the authority of the Chair by moving that the honourable member be suspended from the siM-vice of the committee. The records of the House claim that between the naming of the honourable member for l n d i and the finalization of the matter, the question, "" That the clause be postponed "", was put and negatived. If , Mr Speaker, you are not satisfied with my explanation, I urge that the Hansard reporter who was on duty at the time he called by you to the bar of the House and directed to furnish a translation of the official report that was taken at the time, together with any check report which may have been made by the Principal Parliamentary Reporter. Standing Order 39, which appears under the heading "" Orderi n DebateSuspension of Members "", readsWhenever any member shall have been named by the Speaker or by the Chairman of Committees, immediately after the commission of the offence of disregarding the authority of the Chair; or of abusing the rules of the House, by persistently and wilfully obstructing the business of the House, or of disorderly conduct, or otherwise disregarding the authority of the Chair, then, if the offence has been committed by such member in the House, the Speaker shall forthwith put the question, on the motion being made the motion being made. order continuesnoamendment, adjournment, or debate being allowed, "" That such member be suspended from the service of the House""; and, if the offence has been committed in a committee of the whole House, the Chairman shall, on a motion being made, put the same question in a similar way, and, if the motion be carried,, shall forthwith suspend the proceedings of thecoinmittee and report the circumstances to the House; and the Speaker shall thereupon put the same question, without amendment, adjournment or debate, as if the offence had been committed in the House itself. My point is that the Temporary Chairman claims that, in the period which intervened between the naming of the honourable member for l n d i and the closing of the incident-and the remarks which the Prime Minister made last night show that it had to be closed, otherwise he would have to move for the member for lnd i ( Mr suspension of the honourable member-h e put the question, "" That the clause be postponed "" , and that it was negatived hy the committee.

I have allowed the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) to state his case in his own way. I point out to him that he is not assisted by the standing order which he has cited. There is nothing in the Standing Orders which would prevent the House from proceeding with business between the naming of an honourable member and the subsequent submission of a motion for his suspension. The honourable member seeks some assistance from his submission that during this interval no business should be transacted. That is not borne out by the standing; order.

It would appear from your interpretation of the Standing Orders that an interval could elapse between the naming of a. member and the taking of subsequent action, and that during this interval the business of the committee could proceed. If that be so, then no restriction could be placed upon the named member participating in the business of the committee, and this, I submit, would be a negation of the intention of Standing Order 56, which is disciplinary in Character. ber, I presume, has in mind the naming of himself as a particular instance. hut your interpretation of the standing order was not related to any incident in which I was involved. Yours was a general interpretation. that my ruling is sound. The honourable member was named, and left the chamber. He might have gone outside tlie precincts of the House. He might even have got into a fast motor car and gone elsewhere. Is it contended that the entire business of the committee should be suspended until he could be captured and brought back to the building?

During question time yesterday the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr do not know whether he misunderHarrison) referred to a matter which I had raised in the House by way of questions and on motions for the adjournment of the House. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) interjected that the honourable member surely did not believe that Ministers wished to hide anything. I want to make it clear that I have not at any time suggested that the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr received them. A little while ago, we Dedman) or any other Minister desired to hide anything or to suppress the facts. There has been dereliction of duty on the part of some one associated with the Department of War Organization of In dustry. For three months I have been trying to have this matter thoroughly sifted. By letter and personal interview, I have placed before the Minister for War Organization of Industry facts which have been brought to my notice by my constituents. As far back as the l4!tn December last I sent to the Minister a copy of a letter setting out the facts sent to me hy a body in my electorate in regard to a number of buildings already constructed in the Bankstown district by a man named Fitzpatrick. Since then, I have sent the Minister further letters and seen him personally. His answer has always been that he is having the matter investigated and is awaiting the report. In view of the delay and the lack of action, I now consider it to be my duty to seize the opportunity provided hy the presence in the House of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and all the other Ministers to make the facts known to them as well as to all other honourable members. Apart from the fact that there has been a definite dereliction of duty on the part of some officer of the Department of War Organization of Industry, there has also been lack of collaboration between that department and the Attorney-General's Department. I dealt with this matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House last week, and in his reply the Minister for War Organization of Industry said that certain aspects of the matter did not come under his jurisdiction. I then asked him whether he would confer with the Attorney-General on those aspects, and he said that he would. On Friday, I asked him whether he had conferred with the Attorney-General. I stood m.y question, but I did not misunderstand his answer. Again, yesterday, I asked the Minister whether he had received the report of the investigation. He said that he had, but that he had sent it to the Attorney-General. I inquired of the Attorney-General whether he had received the papers. He had not. Perhaps he will say now whether he has had a similar illustration of the lack of collaboration between the two departments, in the matter of a certain swimming pool.

34,Mr Morgan (Reid),"h y leaveOrganization of Industry said that no breach of the regulations had been committed in the construction of that swimming pool, but soon afterwards the Attorney-General, through the Department of Labour and National Service, instituted an investigation in the wake of which followed a prosecution and the imposition of heavy penalties, it being successfully contended, on behalf of the Attorney-General, that not merely the construction of the pool, hut also the use of vital labour and materials, constituted the offence. The case with which I am now dealing is similar, in that labour end materials have been used. Yesterday the Minister told me that he had received a report. His words were1 have received a report which shows that -certain building operations which the honourable member has alleged constitute breaches -of National Security Regulations were underwhich T sent to the Minister. Everybody taken before the building regulations were given effect. I have referred the whole matter to the Attorney-General. Yet, two months ago, I was told by the officials of the Department of War Organization of Industry in Sydney that they regarded this as a flagrant breach of the National Security (Building Control) Regulations under four headings. What has happened in the meantime? The Minister now says that his advice is that the NationalSecurity Regulations do not apply, and were not in operation when the buildings were in course of construction. I know that in local government circles, and in the Allied Works Council, influences are at work to prevent this matter from being brought to light. I quite helieve that in the Bankstown Municipal Council obstructions would be raised to prevent a successful investigation of this matter, but there are other sources of information which could he drawn upon ,by tlie department's investigators. ber has not told us what it is all about. Perhaps the honourable member was not present when I raised this matter on able member .say is wrong with my adminformer occasions.

I said yesterday. for the report of what the Minister said. He says now that apparently there is no breach of the regulations, whereas two months ago there was in the opinion of the Minister's own officers a breach under four headings. There is the additional fact that if the Minister was relying on information from, the local government bodies, perhaps the officials were precluded from getting the full facts. But I made it clear that there was definite collusion with officials of the council in regard to the matter, and the departmental officials have not interviewed the people who supplied the information in Bankstown knows about this matter. honoraible member received leave to make a statement; but he has not told us what it is all about. of buildings constructed at BankstoTvn by a man named Fitzpatrick. able to tell me whether a prosecution ia pending in connection with this matter ? is just the trouble. In order to illustrate my point, I will show the Prime Minister some photographs of the buildings. My information is that some time ago Mr Fiticpatriek able gentleman was given leave to make -a statement, hut it seems to me that he is taking advantage of that leave to repeat a speeeh he made here the other night, and that is not fair to the House. ter and other honourable members have just asked for particulars.

Council gave permission, and I understand that similar permission was also given by the Department of War Organization of Industry. The Minister can check me in that regard. The galvanized iron structure has disappeared, and in the place of additions that were to cost £100 a cottage and a large building have been erected,. The dimensions of the building are: 160 feet by 60 feet by 40 feet. It has 24 skylights, fibrolite walls, steel girders and expensive electric light fittings. The floor and a huge yard, involving many thousands of square feet, are of concrete. that the estimated cost of the building was between £2,00-0 and £3,000. This is a flagrant breach of the regulations. The structure is big enough to house aircraft. short account of what the honourable gentleman desires to bring before the House. Is there some scandal in connection with this matter? the regulations has been committed in regard to the utilization of man-power and materials. The Minister informed me yesterday that the departmental report stated that the National Security Regulations did not operate when the construction of this building began. regulations did not operate. formation, this building was constructed within the last six or nine months. During that period I brought the matter to the notice of the department. My in formation is supported by a letter that I received from the Minister for Labour andNational Service( Mr Holloway) yesterday. I ask honourable members to note the contrast between the inquiries promised by the Department of War Organization of Industry and the expeditious investigation by the Department of Labour and National Service. On the 9th March, I expressed to the Minister for Labour and National Service my disappointment with the slow progress of the inquiries, and he asked The Bankstown Municipal me to put my complaint in writing. I did so. He immediately communicated with the Deputy Director of. Man Power in New South Wales( Mr Bellemore) who received the letter on the 10th March. Within the next 24 hours Mr. Bellemore submitted to the Minister a f u l l report of the results of his inquiries. I ask honourable members to compare the information obtained by the Department of Labour and National Servicei n 24 hours with the inactivity of the Department of War Organization of Industry. Mr Bellemore saidWith reference to your inquiry relative to the labour used by Mr R. Fitzpatrick, of Bankstown, for the construction of a large shed, garages, &u., and for tlie construction of My information is a concrete road in Marion-street, Bankstown, in front of Mr Fitzpatrick's premises, I wish to inform you that inquiries have now been made into this matter. It appears that Mr Fitzpatrick is a contractor for grading, drainage work, and carrying, and that he employs a staff of between 20 and 25 persons as lorry and tractor drivers. I am eager to hear a Mr Fitzpatrick has informed this directorate that he employed his staff on tlie work of constructing the shed and garages for the last six months during periods when they could not bo employed on their normal work because of wet weather, aud that the roofing, A flagrant .breach of electrical installation and steel frame-work construction was carried out by three separate firms on a contract basis."" Whilst .it is not known whether his statement relative to the employment of his own staff only during wet weather, is correct, this directorate has no evidence to the contrary. Honourable members can use their own judgment as to whether work of this I said 'that certain nature, including a concrete yard and the transplanting of a residence, could have been undertaken in wet weather? The cottage in f r o n t of the building cost between £400 and £500, although the cosi of the entire job was not to exceed £100. The double garage has a tiled roof and texture bricks-material s required for vital defence works-and two steel shuttered doors; the cost must have been between £200 and £300. The amount originally allowed was £27. The local government authority is involved in the construction of a concrete road past this residence.

I have asked the Attorney-General to intervene because materials urgently required for defence work have been used in the construction of this building. This, be thoroughly sifted elsewhere. NowI man had not obtained a priority for the erection of this structure. My information is that these materials were intended for vital defence work and were dumped on the Bankstown aerodrome. This man has carted materials for these defence works. Certain of those materials were put aside one afternoon and his lorry carted them away to the site of his garage. That is why the building resembles an aircraft hangar more than a garage. The steel girders and walls are cut to certain standards.

The people of Bankstown want the law to take its course in this matter. I have endeavoured to prevent the calling of a public meeting to discuss it, because I helieve that it can have brought it to the attention of the House. The Attorney-General should make a full investigation of the circumstances. These materials were supplied from the Allied Works Council, and certain officials are very restive about the whole matter.

For example, concrete work was not covered for a variety of reasons, nor was the erection of fences. swimming pools?

One avenue through which we usually hope to obtain information of any infringement is the local municipal councils. The. honourable member for Reid has made the allegation that the Bankstown 'Municipal Council is involved in this business. I do not know whether there is anv substance in that allegation or not.

87,Mr Morgan,"I have said that.on the 14th December and an investigation was instituted immediately. As I have said previously in the House, it is not always easy to obtain information concerning the infringement of building regulations. First, evidence has to be obtained that a particular building now in existence was not actually in existence when the permit was given. which it should not be difficult to prove. If a building was not in a certain place on a particular date people would know of it. ber for Warringah ( Mr Spender) may say that it should be easy to prove such a fact; but in such an instance as this, of insinuation and allegations, it may be quite difficult to prove it. The point is that my departmental officers began their investigations at the end of December, just before the Christmas festive season. Sir drag Father Christmas into it was done until after the opening' of the new year. As I have said, we have not a large staff of inspectors. With the limited staff at our disposal we have been doing our best to obtain information as quickly as possible. .During the last three weeks, the honourable member for Reid has asked me a series of questions. I have assured him that I was having a report made to me, and that I would expedite it as much as possible. I took steps to have the deputy director in Sydney informed that I desired to have it at the earliest possible date. Two days ago, ihe honourable member for Reid again asked me whether or not the report was available. I replied that, so far as I understood the -position, it would be in my hands on the following day. Last week, the honourable member asked me whether or not I would refer the matter to the Attorney-General. In a statement that he made on a motion for the adjournment of the House, he raised a nnmber of questions which did not come within my jurisdiction. I am concerned only with infringements of the building control regulations. The honourable member referred to the building of a road by the Bankstown Council. This matter has nothing whatever to do with either my department or any, other Commonwealth department. gentleman control man-power and materials? man-power and materials. The honourable member made the allegation that certain material had been stolen from an aerodrome. ter of the Crown, is not the honourable gentleman interested in such an allegation? I was not interested, but have merely claimed that the matter does not come within the jurisdiction of my department. The honourable member asked me whether or not I would confer with the Attorney-General. I did so, and that matter in hand. The honourable member knew that when he rose to speak. the Attorney-'General yesterday. this House, the honourable member asked me whether or not I had conferred with the Attorney-General, and I replied that I had done so. I believe that it was at the end of last week that the honourable member asked me whether or not I would confer with the Attorney General. I wish to make it clear that the investigations have occupied some little time in order that the matter might be properly covered. I received the report yesterday, and advised the honourable member to that effect. I also stated that certain of the allegations which he had made were in relation to buildings which had been begun and completed long before the building control regulations had come into operation. that was the position in respect of all the allegations of infringement of the regulations which he had made. In connection with certain other buildings, it_ appears that there has been an infringement of the regulations.",18,Buildi Ng Restrictions Alleged Breach Of Regtjlations

I have been a and passed by the member who had made the speech. permission, that was never done. permission, it was never done. I have myself asked for "" pulls"" of speeches. I have asked for a "" pull "" of a Prime Minister's speech when it dealt with a matter in which I was peculiarly interested or in respect of which I had to deliver an address in this House. I have asked in special circumstances the permission of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General or individual ordinary members as the case may be, for that permission, and permission was usually granted. I am frankly disquieted to learn that a speech, with all its imperfecasked to consent to my speeches being tions awaiting correction, has been made available to other members -A speech to-day and I do not get a proof Mr ""WHITE -And to departments. ments! If that is so, of course all I can say is that, in my view, it is grossly improper. My experience is that the Hansard reporters,' being hampered by interruptions in the chamber and by the the Opposition parties. It is grossly fact that they necessarily mishear or fail unfair. to hear some things that a member has said, being human, cannot do a job that is 100 per cent, accurate. In. those made the speech. circumstances, it is disturbing to know that a speech which requires to he corused. rected, because it is not what the member has said, or in some cases intended to say. at the Australian Labour party conis handed to chosen leaders in this House ference. The fact remains that they as being in fact what, he did say, when could be used. Like the honourable memwe all know from common experience ber for Batman, I desire to know when that it is perhaps what he did not say. I should like to know when this practice originated. in force ever since I have been here. know when the practice was abandoned by virtue of which a member was required to give his consent before an uncorrected proof could be used in that way. It is quite improper that incorrect representations of what a member has said should be supplied to any privileged few in this House and I hope that the present practice will be immediately discontinued. member of this House for several years, and I know that what the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has said is perfectly true, and that before anybody could get a "" p u l l "" of a member's speech he first had to get the consent of that member. I do not know when this new practice came into being, but I am certainly opposed to it. On one occasion I had an argument in this House with my own party, and a "" p u l l "" of my speech was used at the conference of the Australian Labour party, before I had even seen it myself. How that came about I do not know; but, when I complained that I had not given my consent to anybody but myself seeing it, I learned that it was actually purloined by some one.

The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) made it clear that the innovation has not been made since he took office, because he was receiving the "" flats "" when he was Leader of the Opposition about three years ago. The House should be told who was responsible for the change. In my opinion we should immediately revert to the former practice under which no honourable member could see the "" p u l l "" of another honhonorable members being misreported orable member's speech unless he had first obtained the consent of the honourable gentleman who delivered the speech. Minister and Minister for Defence) |o.'51] I have no feeling whatsoever about this matter. So far as I can recall, I was appointed Leader of the Opposition in 1935. Whether ""flats "" were available then, I cannot say; but they certainly became available to me because for some time, while I was Leader of the Opposition, I received "" flats"" each morning. I understood that "" flats "" were issued to Ministers and to the secretaries of departments. To that practice I raised no objection. I knew that they were confidential. I considered that whoever had been responsible for asking for the "" flats"" to be made available early to Ministers and departments did so only to expedite public business by enabling matters that honourable gentlemen had raised in the House to be promptly investigated by the departments. Otherwise, every Minister would need to have his private secretary in the House to take a note, independent of the Mansard report, of what honourable gentlemen say. If that course be insisted upon, we shall have to increase the accommodation of this building for the note-takers. If , on the other hand, the leader of a party or a Minister is not to be permitted to learn without delay what an honourable member has said except with his consent difficulties will arise. It is not always practicable to obtain that consent. If a speeeh is made on Friday, one cannot obtain the consent of the honourable member who delivered it until the following Tuesday or Wednesday. In any case, the member himself does not correct his proof for three or four days. I have had some experience in this Parliament. It is many years since I attempted to correct a Hansard proof of any speech that I made. I have found the reliability of Hansard beyond question. In fact, I believed that sometimes I did not speak so clearly as Hansard recorded me as having spoken. of us. may arise, the public ought to be told, at least, my experience of the high degree of accuracy that marks the work of Hansard. (Fremantle Prime This matter under discussion is outside my province. The parliamentary reports are under the direction of Mr Speaker. I have no doubt that a Minister or Prime Minister made representations to a former Speaker years ago for the issue of these ""flats "" in order to facilitate public business. If the House considers that the ""flats"" should not be issued to Ministers and leaders of parties, it will have its way; but the consideration of many matters which honourable gentlemen themselves are eager to have dealt with promptly will HP. delayed, because they can only be handled expeditiously if the "" flats "" are made available. [-5.55] -Hansard proofs and their distribution is not a new subject in this House even within my memory. Not long after I became a member of this chamber, some nine years ago. a fairly long debate occurred on the whole question of the availability of Hansard proofs to Ministers, leaders of parties and private members. Having come straight from the Parliament of South Australia, I pointed out that the practice of the State House was to issue to every honourable member a copy of the whole of the proceedings of the previous day. If any corrections were made by speakers, other honourable members were able to compare them with the original Hansard report. During the debate to which. I referred, allegations were made that certain vital words or passages had been excised from speeches made by honourable members in this chamber.

We have witnessed the sale and dispergal of numerous dairy herds in the last year or two; the area put under fallow has been greatly reduced and fencing and maintenance of farms have not been maintained at anything like the required standard. All this has been due to the fact that the supply of man-power and materials has been inadequate. Of course, we all realize that man-power and materials are closely inter-related. Another stultifying factor in agriculture has been the reduced supply of artificial manures available to farmers. The combined results of all these handicaps may be staved off for'a time, but ultimately the situation will have to be faced and grappled with courageously. When manpower and materials are not available for use in secondary industries, those industries are quickly brought almost to a standstill. Primary industries are not affected so rapidly. Nevertheless, the lack of man-power and materials gradually assumes a snow-ball effect, and 1 am afraid that unless something is done promptly to meet the situation that is developing, disaster will overtake the food production programme of Australia, and the productive capacity of the various classes of land which we farm will be seriously reduced. Perhaps the most serious problem is the lack of man-power. Most honourable gentlemen who were members of the last Parliament look upon me as one who was in favour of the greatest possible military participation by Australia in the conduct of the war gentleman would have had us send, division after division abroad. when honourable gentlemen opposite did not want fo send even one division of Australian troops abroad, I was in favour of sending at least five divisions. Many more divisions have been raised for service outside Australia since that time. you said about Russia. not. qualify a single word that I have said about Russia, and honourable gentlemen will realize, when the peace conference is being held, that I have no need to do so. gentleman said that the Russians would not last six weeks against the Germans. Russian showing against the Finns in the early days of the war justified that view. I do not want to discuss Russia at the moment, but I shall be happy to do so on an appropriate future occasion. I am not in the habit of qualifying statements which I make in this House. I stand by what I say. If some honourable gentlemen opposite would adopt the same practice it would lead to an improvement in the political life of Australia. If honourable gentlemen opposite are as ignorant of the trends of agriculture as they appear to be of the trend in the relations of certain Allied countries and Russia, it is a poor outlook for the agricultural industries of Australia. The distribution of man-power in Australia, as I have always said, should be such as will lead to our making the greatest possible contribution to the successful conduct of the war. Some people, including some members of this House, seem to think that advocates of conscription, of whom I have always been one, believe that conscription means grabbing people by the scruff of the neck and putting them into a uniform. That is not conscription. The essence of conscription is that every person shall do the job that he is best able to do> in war-time. This country is organized: on a basis of compromise. Unfortunately, that policy has dominated Aushonorable tralia throughout the war period. In my opinion, too many men have been called up from the agricultural industries and put into various services, and I do not confine that term to the three fighting services, of which the Navy is very small. not because of the call-up of men from the land, but because so many volunteered in the early days of the war. connection, I am totally opposed to the policy that is now being followed.

172,Mr Archie Cameron,"In that have never believed in the voluntary system. It was the policy of the Australian Parliament at the outbreak of this w.ar, and I was obliged to accept it, but latterly it has not been the policy. To-day, we have a system under which the Government retains and exercises the right to call up every man and woman in the community for whatever work it considers that they ought to do. I am satisfied from past observations that too many men arc in the different services, including the Allied Works Council and munitions establishments. An investigation by competent persons would easily prove that tens of thousands of the men who are attached to the Army, the ground staff of the Royal Australian Air Force, the Allied Works Council, and the Munitions Department, would be better employed if they were transferred to some other avocation. Among the avocations to which they might be* transferred, I should certainly give to agriculture the highest priority, as being the most important and the most deserving of having additional man-power allotted to it. on the land, what would the honourable gentleman do? declared myself a conscriptionist, who says that the Government should have the right to tell every man what he should do in the best interests of the country. honourable gentleman last night objected that under certain of the powers which the Government seeks to have conferred on the Commonwealth it could obtain the authority to instruct all persons as to where they should be employed. no need for a referendum of the people to enable the Government to exercise such a power in time of war. During the 1914-18 conflict, there was no need for the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hughes) to have a referendum, on the question of conscription; all that he lacked was the courage to put it into force. He took the meek, mild, and middle course of appealing to the country to give to him the authority to do something which he already had the power to do. Conscription in time of war is the only possible policy, and the Government is not prevented by constitutional limitations from giving effect to it. There is no lion in the path, if the Government wishes to proceed along it. It can do that, and it is doing it every day of the week. Thousands of men in this country, with or without their consent, have been called up and have been allotted to the Allied Works Council; they have been -=ent to the Northern Territory, north-western Australia, Cape York Peninsula, and even New Guinea. That is just as much an act of conscription as would be an instruction to men to dig potatoes, repair fences, or sink wells. would not keep a man on his property for five minutes if he were an unwilling worker. know anybody who would. I have been brought up on the gospel not of loafing, but of hard work. We hear too much in this country of the beautiful heaven in which we are to live after the war, with nobody working and everybody being well off. Viewing the agricultural position as I know it, I can say that when this war is over a very hard task will confront every agricultural industry, in the restoration of normal conditions in respect of repairs and facilities. That task will also confront the transport industries. Every one is the aware of the deterioration of the railways system. There is only a limited volume of man-power and resources for employment in repair work. That will apply also in a certain degree to sea transport, and in very great degree to road transport. One of the things which I have noticed is . the refusal of the Army Department to release certain vital tradesmen. A certain degree of success is being achieved, although I have not participated greatly in it, in securing the release of men from the Army for return to the land; but there seems to be reluctance by the man-power authorities to release men for saddlery establishments, blacksmith shops, and licensed road transport.

These things are essential. I have a strong feeling that tlie proper degree of attention is not being paid to them. I fully appreciate the difficulties with which the Government is confronted. With a huge majoritya very large tail on the doga rid several big problems, it may not be having an altogether easy time. Nevertheless, I put it to Ministers that the agricultural position must be investigated. A long-range view must be taken of some of the problems that may be likely to arise, and a somewhat shortrange view of the problems with which we are immediately confronted. Repairs and maintenance of the equipment of the farmer and the capacity of the Australian transport system, are very important. If these are to be maintained, man-power and materials must be released. I could take the Australian, agricultural industries one by one, and, as the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) will readily admit, disclose certain weaknesses in them, but 1 do not want to do that to-night. My object has been briefly to deal with the question generally, and once again to endeavour to impress on the Government the necessity for taking a fairly firm grip of the situation immediately, in order that we may not be faced with rather more acute situations than those with which we have had to cope in the not-far-distant past. not know that I have any very great grievance in which to indulge myself for a little while, except that I am experiencing a certain amount of fatigue from the fluctuations between last night's ideal jurisprudence and the occasional tnterspersion of jungle law, during which we witnessed some examples of misanthropy. I should not be riding my hobby-horse with characteristic enthusiasm, were it not for the fact that the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) is, I believe, about to go abroad, and there are certain matters relevant to the future of Australia to which his attention might well be drawn so that he may give adequate consideration to them upon his return. SinceI last spoke upon the population problem in this chamber, the British Government has taken advanced action in the form of the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the subject of population. I do not participate often in the debates which take place in this chamber; I leave it to experienced members to discuss in their own way the problems that affect the wider aspects of Australian life. I am interested in their contributions, but am not altogether sure as to how accurate their observations may be. Probably that applies also to my riding of my particular hobby-horse. But I have devoted a .considerable number of years to an investigation of the Australian _ population problem, and am perfectly convinced-and could advance an abundance of reasons to prove-that the Australian flag could be hauled down within 50 years. It is all very well to pave our cities with marble. The first requisite in all our schemes is to have an adequate population for the protection and development of our country. During the last few weeks, I have caused some investigations to be made by the appropriate authority, in order to ascertain what has been the actual position during the last few years in relation to our population drifts. Yesterday, I received a graph which I shall ask leave to have incorporated in Hansard; it clearly illustrates just what is happening to the Australian population problem. One side of it shows the variation of the death-rate. In 1S60, the death-rate was approximately 20 per 1,000, and by 1940 it had dropped to approximately 10 per 1,000, the decrease having been gradual. The top line on the graph shows the birth-rate during that period. In 1860, it was approximately 43 per 1,000, but in the last year before the war it had dropped to 17 per 1,000. A rapid downward tendency has been manifest, and if it be continued the death-rate will exceed the birth-rate before many years have elapsed. The problem is a tragic one, and should engage our serious attention. If my friends opposite are earnest",28,Supply Grievance Day
179,Dr. Gaha (Denison) [8.23],"I doin their desire to expand and develop this country as our fathers wished it to be developed, we must first ensure a population that will be capable of developing and defending it. It is conceivable that within the next forty years we may have a population of about 9,000,000. I am speaking purely of the internal problem, because I see no reason why we should have an immigration policy; there are plenty of reasons why we should have immigrants, but there is no possibility of getting them. I am also actuated hy a remark, made only last week by one who occupies a. very high place in Australian public life, in which he appealed for a White Australia. I am in entire accord with the idea; but so as not to lose Australia, we may have to turn our attention to other matters. The Department of Health -only yesterday supplied to me very interesting figures which are indicative of population trends. Between 1881 and 1890 there were 43,483 persons who reached the age of 60 years, whilst between 1932 and 1934 the number was 69,950. From 1881 to 1890 the number that reached the age of 80 years was 10,438, whereas from 1932 to 1934 it was 22,223. We are maintaining our population purely at the expense of longevity. This graph clearly shows that if the birth-rate goes steeply down, if the deathspiritual side, and I do not know the rate is maintained, and if the longevity rate rises, eventually a very considerable proportion of our population will be in the old-age group. We have set out to build up an ideal social State. We are not the only people in the world whose aims are in that direction. If any one is prepared to inquire into what Great Britain is doing at the present time, he will find that whilst 40 years ago we probably led the world in our approach to social security, today we are lagging very considerably. I suggest, that while the Prime Minister is in Great Britain, he should inquire into what is being done in this direction. The second report of the Director General of Social Services contains figures at page 12 which show that in 1939, out of every 10,000 of the population, 128 were in receipt of invalid pensions; and I point out that, in order to get an invalid pension, a person mustobtain a. doctor's certificate showing that he is incapacitated. In 1940, the year after war was declared, the number of persons in receipt of invalid pensions suddenly dropped to 84 per 10,000. The following year it dropped to 83, then it returned to 84, and this year it is down to 80. What conclusion are we to draw from that? for them. In order to show that the figure of 12S for the year in which war broke out was not abnormal, I mention that, in the previous year, the figure was 125, for the year before that 122, and for the year before that 119. Those figures show that either the doctors' certificates were entirely wrong-and I have no desire to cast reflections on the members of my own profession-o r that people notwithstanding their disabilities, are prepared to work in order to support themselves if suitable employment is offering. That is another matter to which we must' devote our attention after the war. I have discussed this problem of population with a great many people, and I have always been amazed to find that most, of them are firmly of the opinion that they know all about it. I have studied it from the biological, the economic, the social and even the cause of our declining birth-rate, nor its cure. Having regard to scientific achievements since the outbreak of the war, and their effect in annihilating distance, I do not believe that 7,000,000 people can hold Australia. It is our duty as persons concerned for the welfare of our country, to ascertain if possible the inherent reasons responsible for our unsatisfactory birth-rate. We would do well to follow the example of the Government of Great Britain, and appoint a royal commission to examine the problem and endeavour to find whether the cause is social, economic or genetic. Some say that the low birth-rate is due to the lack of social security, but I remind honourable members that the people with the highest measure of social security are the most infertile. I believe that the low birth-rate is due to a combination of factors. If Ave do not solve this problem we shall pay the penalty in the loss of our country. If Sir Walter Kinnear'E",29,Supply Grievance Day

181,Dr. Gaha,"That is perfectly true.figures are correct, and it is true that in 1972 40 per cent, of the population will be in the old-age group, and 20 per cent, in the child group, then 1 am convinced tliat the remaining 40 per cent, will not beable to carry on the economic life of Australia, and provide for its development and defence. I say emphatically that it cannot be done. The lower animals are able to reproduce their kind in a few years. It does not take long to breed a herd or a flock, but the human being takes a couple of decades to grow to maturity. Already, the gravest damage has been done, and remedies, even if applied now, could not take effect for a considerable time. Statistics collected in Great Britain show that, since 1918, the number of persons in the old-age group has doubled; the number over 45 has increased by 75 per cent.; whilst the number of children of school age is the same as in the nineties, when the population was only 23,000,000. It is of no use splitting hairs over problems assorted with democracy, fascism or totalitarianism if we allow the population simply to destroy itself. The problem of population is not a new one in Australia, and I believe that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr away to the seaside, he will feel better. .Hughes) has even written a book on the subject. It takes a long time to get anything done here, and I need only cite our experience in regard to housing in support of that statement. In 1927, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) was responsible for having passed by Parliament an act providing for the inauguration of a £20,000,000 housing scheme. I am certain that if the Australian people were given an opportunity to express an opinion through a referendum, 99 per cent, of them would favour a national housing scheme; yet, although that act has been on the statute-book for seventeen years, not one house has been built as a result of it. If seventeen years the barbaric atmosphere in which we is not sufficient time in which to make a start on something urgently demanded by the people, and for which there already exists legislative sanction, how long will it take us to awaken the people to the danger of their own self-destruction? ber any figures from 1860 onwards showing the average age of marriage? Dr. Oaha. able, and that is an important factor affecting the birth-rate. It may be said, for general purposes, that the fertile life of the human female is the period between 18 years and 38 years. Our mothers married at 18, whereas the average age at which females marry to-day is about 28. Thus they have only ten fertile years of marriage, and they have already lost ten best years. However, the declining birth-rate is not due to any one thing. It is due to a multiplicity of factors, including urbanization, genetics, and biological, social and economic considerations. The tendency of men right throughout history has been to become urbanized, and, by achieving urbanization, automatically to exterminate themselves. How otherwise are we to explain the extinction of all the great nations of the past? In the beginning, nil peoples were rural dwellers. Later, they herded in cities, and the result was always the same. We call ourselves civilized people, but having regard to our mode of national life, it is a grave misuse of the word to apply it to ourselves. If a man falls sick he goes to a doctor, who tells him that if he takes plenty of fresh air, and perhaps goes The patient pays the doctor liberally for telling him what he knew quite well before, but he probably takes the advice. However, our economic system demands that when the sun rises people shall go indoors, and remain there almost until the sun sets again. We do even worse than that. We say that the population must be increased, but we expect young married couples in their twenties to bring up children while the husband is on the basic wage; then, when the husband is 50 years old, and the children grown up, we pay him twice as much, on the ground that he is experienced.

The Government cannot allow the position to remain as it is. The charges that have been made by the honourable member against an unspecified person and unspecified departments are such that in other conditions a royal commission would have been set up before now. taken by the Government, although three months have elapsed since the matter was first brought to the notice of' the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) by the honourable member for Reid. We have been told that the matter is now in the hands of the Attorney-'General (Dr. Evatt), but this House should not be satisfied with that statement. In the interests of the country, it should require much more information as to what the Attorney General proposes to do and. what will be the result of the inquiries into the matter. Honourable members representing Sydney electorates know that that city is seething with rumours which, if founded on fact, would appear to reflect grave discredit on the Government, and the charges that have been levelled by the honourable member are of such a character that the country will not rest satisfied until they have been thoroughly investigated. honourable member talking about? for Transport had been present when the honourable member for Reid made his charges, he would know. From time to time, we hear rumours of rackets associated with many war-time Commonwealth departments. I have many instances brought to my notice, but when I ask my informants to make sworn affidavits on which I can bring the matters to a head in this House, they decline, lest they should be victimized. For the prestige of Parliament, something must be done to pin down these rumours and to establish what foundation they have, if any. Certainly, the case brought forward by the honourable member for Reid must receive the closest attention. Apparently, a permit was issued for £100 worth of work, but the honourable member displayed photographs proving conclusively that the buildings could not have been erected for less than £3,000 or £4,000, whilst the surroundings must have cost many thousands of pounds more. It is pertinent to ask whence came the labour and materials used to erect those buildings. The honourable member said that some of the materials closely resembled those used in But, so far, no action has been the erection of the Bankstown aerodrome. I have heard rumours to that effect in Sydney, and I hope to be able next week to bring to the notice of the Government something more concrete which will cause the Government to do more than it apparently proposes to do in relation to the disclosures made by one of its supporters. We want to know, if the material is identical with that, used in the construction of the Bankstown aerodrome, how it came to be used, because we all know that such material must be either purchased legitimatelyand I do not believe that war materials have been offered for private purchase except on the issue of a permit-o r acquired by some method that is not legitimate. Whence came the labour? Who authorized it to be made available? Were permits granted to employ men on the work? These are questions of more than passing interest. The charges of the honourable member would appear to give point to many of the rumours that rumours is the one hears in Sydney, and it seems that at long last matters are coming to a head. Ministers and departments are involved. The Allied Works Council is involved. The Minister for Supply and Shipping( Mr Beasley) and his department are involved. The Minister for War Organization of Industry and his department are involved. The member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for the State electorate which embraces Bankstown was asked to do something in respect of sand leases on the St. George's River.

188,Mr Harrison,"If the Ministersomething to establish the facts and not indulge in intimidation in order to sidetrack the matter. I say that because the Minister for War Organization of fndustry, when the honourable member for Reid was making his charges this afternoon, attempted to intimidate him by describing him in most unparliamentary language, such as would not be permitted to be used on any theatrical stage in Sydney. It is astounding that such language can be used in this Parliament by a Minister in order to browbeat a Government supporter. That is the sort of intimidation which makes citizens afraid to make disclosures. I support the remarks of the honourable member .for Reid and demand a full inquiry into something of which everybody in the Bankstown district knows, but which is unknown, apparently, to the departmental officials who were sent to investigate it. I am doubly interested in this matter, because of the disclosure by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) that only fifteen war service homes, thirteen for men returned from the last war, have been built during this war. The reason given for failure to build more is the lack of materials, but it would appear that that lack did not prevent the erection of the structure to which the honourable member for Reid referred. Whatever materials and labour are available ought to be diverted to the construction of homes for men discharged from the fighting forces. That aspect, of the matter gives added weight to the demand that, instead of trying to intimidate a member of his own party by using foul and abusive epithets that count as insults in any company, the Minister for War Organization of Industry should do everything possible to ensure full inquiry into the honourable member's charges. I put it to the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) that, if honourable members, in the discharge of their duties to their electors, are to be intimidated by Ministers, the general public must feel that their welfare is insecure. In these circumstances nothing less than the closest inquiry, by a royal commission if necessary, will suffice to meet the or at the instigation of the Government. requirements of the people and, I suggest, every honourable member of this Parliament. not wish to add anything to what I said earlier in regard to the matter which the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) has just debated. I have said sufficient for one day on that matter. I hope that when honourable members rise to speak on "" Grievance Day"" they do so to bring forward real grievances and that the Ministers concerned will pay heed to what is brought to their notice. I say that because, on last "" Grievance Day "", I raised matters concerning the Department of the Army, but so far without result. I was.very interested to hear the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Eraser), when delivering his maiden speech on the Constitution Alteration (Post-war Reconstruction) Bill 1944, suggest the setting up of an auditor-general of civil rights. WhilstI agree that some independent authority like that should be set up, I think that it should be an authority subject to the will of Parliament. I still advocate, particularly in connection with Army matters, a standing committee to deal with grievances referred to it, in order that full .justice may be done to the members of the fighting forces. Certain cases which have come to my notice show that is vitally necessary. When Parliament re-assembled in February, I directed the attention of the Minister for the Army to 70 B class men who had been sent from northern units to Sydney to be discharged from the Army for the purpose of engaging in the production of food. Instead of being discharged in accordance with the recommendation of their officers, these men were sent to other parts of the country. Comparatively few of them were released. When I raised this matter in the House, the General Officer Commanding Lines of Communication, Sydney, admitted that for three weeks during last December, the policy of the Government to release B class men for the purpose of enabling th'.m to engage in the production of food had. been suspended. I asked the Minister to inform me whether that action was taken on the initiative of the ArmyI have not received an answer. Three weeks ago, I referred to the treatment of other B class men.

Instead of being released, the men were given hard navvying work on the wharfs. When their health failed, they were court-mar ti ailed and fined.

Speaking upon the Government's constitutional proposals last week, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro stressed the necessity for preserving civil rights. Two instances have come to my notice that add weight to the conPROVOSTS tentions of the honourable gentleman. Indeed, this matter should be investigated by a parliamentary committee. Edward William Keating, formerly of the Merchant Navy, was rejected on medical grounds when he attempted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force. He is now a greengrocer in business at Dee Why, New South Wales. On the 26th February two military policemen accosted him and pulled him roughly him. from his cart. They forced him to enter a military wagon and demanded the production of his identity card. He explained that it was either at his home or at his place of business, and asked the provosts to drive him there.

I was transferred to X.S.W. L. of C, where the discharge was confirmed. I ask the Prime Minister to take special note of the next paragraph in the report which readsReason for my discharge, I understand, is neiiro-dermatitis and psycho-neurosis; and I understand further that it is ""not due to misconduct"". But I am to be discharged as a private, and not as a warrant officer, although in its reason for my discharge, Army itself confirms my defence at my court-martial, that my disease was not self-inflicted. My medical history, both before and after the court-martial, is, of course, a complete denial of the charge. I should mention also that at my court martial no evidence was called that I had been seen rubbing myself with a towel, although that was the main charge to be proved. is still merely reading fro m a newspaper report. to j u s t if y a complete investigation. The article concludes as follows:My trial was reported in the Sydney Sun with a heading "" Plan to Outwit Doctors"", jind my name and rank. It is hardly necessary to point out how my wife and children will suffer equally with me from the publicity, unless the injustice is righted. Of course, all my pay was forfeited from April 7th, when I was sentenced, until July 15th, when I was released on suspended sentence. Thereafter I was paid as a private instead of as a warrant officer; and I was reduced to a drawing rate of Is. a day to make up the amount which Army had continued to pay my wife after I was sentenced. My wife also suffered from the reduced rate of pay, from W.0.1 to private's pay. 1 understand that because of these deductions, I was still £45 in debt in my Army account on my discharge, so that I shall receive only £20, if that, from my deferred pay of about £65. In my seven years in the Militia and two and a quarter years in the A.I.F. my name lies never been on a charge sheet until I was eourt-martialled this year, and I had never reported sick until June of last year. I claim that Army has treated me unjustly. I feel I have every right to demand to be discharged as W.0.1, to have this acknowledged in the press, and to have all moneys involved made up to me. If Mr Forde has not inquired already into this case, he must institute an inquiry immediately, and if the facts are as Vowles has stated them, Mr Forde can have no just reason for refusing his simple demands. The facts of this case were brought to the notice of the Ministerf o r the A r my by tlie honourable member for ""Warringah who, on the 8th February, received the following reply to his representations:With further reference to your representations of 10th December, 1943, on behalf of NX42262 M. J. Vowles,2/14th Lt. Fd. Amb. (private address 28 Frampton-street, Lidcombe) regarding his reduction in rank prior to discharge, and the amount of pay which he lost thereby, I desire to inform you that inquiries concerning this matter have now been completed. Investigations show that ex-Pte. Vowles was, on 16th April, 1943, as the result of conviction by court-martial of a number of serious military offences, sentenced to be reduced to the ranks and to undergo detention for six montlis. The sentence of detention was suspended as from loth July, 1943, and the soldier, having subsequently been medically boarded and found unfit for further service, was discharged on 9th November, 1943, medically unfit and granted fourteen days accrued leave with pay. It will be appreciated that the loss of pay of which the ex-soldier complains naturally followed upon his reduction in rank. Having regard to the serious nature of the offence it is not considered that the sentence was excessive, and it is regretted that no further action can be taken in the matter. I submit, in all earnestness, that this case, and others like it , should be referred to an independent tribunal which hat. no association whatever with military courts martial, so that persons who have been treated in this way may be sure that f u l l justice w ill be done to them.

Without any doubt, the honourable gentleman has brought into question the administration of certain Commonwealth departments. I look at the subject chiefly from the point of view Bankstown Council would require plans of the primary producers, and I ask why a structure of this description has been authorized in a suburban area simply to house a couple of motor lorries, whilst farmers, who are desperately in need of building materials for repairs on their properties, cannot obtain the necessary permits! requests for an investigation have been side-tnacked on every occasion, and I should like to know the reason why. I do not suggest for a moment that the Minister for War Organization of In dustry, or any other member of the Government, is involved in the charges that have been made; but the administration of certain government departments is definitely in question. The Government of New South Wales is also involved, because serious allegations on this subject have been made in the State Parliament. In the interests of government prestige and the honour of public administration generally, I urge the Prime Minister to order an immediate inquiry into the charges. for Reid( Mr Morgan) will make a specific accusation to me that the law has been broken, I shall institute an inquiry immediately; but I am not prepared to accept wild general statements, nor am I prepared to fish in any muddy pond in the hope of finding something. member for Reid has made the charge that a building 200 feet by 60 feet, 30 feet high, of steel girder construction throughout, with concrete floor and corrugated fibro sheet roofing, and with 24 windows in it, has been erected in Bankstown on the authority of ' the Bankstown Council for the construction of a building to cost not more than £100.

When the honourable member for Wentworth referred to the subject yesterday, he was ruled out of order by Mr Speaker, who said that the occasion was not appropriate for the discussion of such a subject. If the Government is prepared to shelter itself behind the contention that there is no responsibility upon it because certain offences have not yet been proved, then the public will clamour for the appointment of a royal commission, or the provision of some other means which will enable the truth to be arrived at. If it be suspected that a proper examination is being prevented, the demand for the fullest publicity will be widespread I am not in a position to express any opinion on the facts of the case, and can he guided only by the statements that have been made in this Parliament, which is the proper place for the discussion of such matters.

A letter which the Minister wrote to the honourable member for Wide Bay readsI acknowledge your personal representations its terms. regarding the growing of rice in Queensland. This matter has recently received detailed attention by my department, and for your information I would point out that for some years there has existed a gentleman's agreement between New South Wales and Queensland to the effect that New South Wales will specialize in the production of rice and would leave sugar-growing to Queensland. I represent one of the most important sugar-growing areas in New South Wales, if not the major portion of the sugar industry in that State. production in that area been interfered with? ever, within the last year or so, representations have been made to me by sugar-growers, particularly on the Richmond Eiver, and I believe that practical representations have been made to the Minister personally, for the right to expand the acreage which they have under cane. thing to do with the expansion of sugar growing areas. That matter, as the honourable member knows, is entirely one for the States. on the Eichmond Eiver have been under -the impression that they were prevented from increasing the acreage of oano planted, and even from harvesting cane already planted, because of restrictions imposed upon them, not by the Government but by the Colonial Sugar Eefining Company Limited; but it would appear from this letter which the Minister wrote to the honourable member for Wide Bay that there is a different explanation. I shall read the balance of itYour State is quite agreeable to this proposal, because it gives Queensland a practical monopoly in the production of sugar cane. Under the circumstances, it seems undesirable from the point of view of your own State to encourage the production of rice in Queensland as this would no doubt cause a breakdown, in the agreement mentioned. If there is in existence an agreement between the Ministers of Agriculture in New South Wales and Queensland, under which the growers of the Northern Eivers District of New South Wales are to be limited in respect of the production of cane, I want to know something of me to find out.

These soldiers have seen little of their homeland, or of their homes. I ask the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) to give the definite assurance that they will be permitted to enjoy to the full the leave that was granted to them.

RecentlyI asked a question, upon notice, with a view to dispelling doubts as to who were eligible for this decoration. I found that a member of the ground personnel of the Royal Australian Air Force who went to New Guinea was eligible for the 1939-43 Star, and that an administrative officer or a non-commissioned officer of the Royal Australian Air Force ground staff in the Middle East was eligible for the Africa Star, whereas personnel of the Royal Australian Air Force, including the whole of the ground personnel of some famous squadrons which had been abroad for over three years-on e squadron flew to Russia and with others has suffered casualties-'ar e not eligible for either decoration, although they are the first Australia before Japan came into the war and troops were sent, to New Guinea. The anomaly is .an extraordinary one, and can have been decorations have been granted in Britain, naturally they do not apply to service in the United Kingdom, because that is not regarded as overseas ' service there. But Britain is definitely "" overseas"" to dominion troops. Many Australians who have been wounded, killed or drowned have not been able to qualify for either of those decorations. I can cite a few instances. A ship on which there was ground staff was toripedoed in mid-winter in the Atlantic, and one of the few survivors was picked up from the sea 48 hours later. He does not possess the necessary qualifications to receive one of these decorations. Yet, an administrative officer in Cairo may qualify for the Africa Star and a member of the ground personnel or Army who has seen no action in New Guinea is able to qualify for the 1939-43 Star.

All of the men for whom I am speaking have passed through Personnel of the Royal Australian Air Force in Britain have been killed by machine-gun fire, bombing, or cannon shell. The anomaly is so extraordinary that I am astonished that I have not received a much larger number of protests. When the position becomes more generally known, there will be an intense bombardment of the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford). The troops affected belong to that section of the Australian Imperial Force which was left in Britain when the Australian Imperial Force went to the Middle East, and approximately 2,000 members of ground crews of Australian squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force in Britain. No. 10 Squadron-a n Australian squadron-ha s served in Britain from the outbreak of the war. Crews which were sent to bring back Sunderland flying boats immediately entered into service in Britain, and have since flown millions of miles in that theatre. Some ground personnel of that squadron have made numerous flights. Within the last week, some of the Sunderlands have been brought to Australia. The ground staffs of that squadron, as well as squadrons Nos. 455 and 456, which have Australian personnel, are not eligible for tihese decorations, or if the personnel of No. 10 squadron qualify and others do not, the anomaly becomes more extraordinary. As the Prime Minister is going abroad, I hope that he will get all the facts he can to strengthen his argument in support of the claim for decorations for these welldeserving men, who have no opportunity to speak for themselves. The decorations should have been given to all men who served overseas, as was the 1914-15 Star. Unless this matter is adjusted some men, whose military service has been comparatively trifling, will receive the decoration, while others, much more deserving, will be overlooked. I wish the Prime Minister success in the representations which I know he is making. I also wish to refer to a matter connected with the Volunteer Defence Corps. The members of this organization give their services voluntarily throughout the year, and undergo a great deal of training. At Christmas time they go in for six days and are paid, but the Easter camp submarine-infested waters. this year is called for only five and a half days, and for this period, according to the regulations, they are not paid. All are old soldiers, who are relieving more active men for service in the firing line. This practice of calling them into camp for only five and a half days looks like a miserable evasion of payment to a handful of enthusiastic men. In an effort to save a few pence they are being denied justice and are being discouraged from undergoing training. This is a bad policy, just as is the policy of refusing leave to men of the Australian Imperial Force after it has been promised to them. This refusal of leave is causing great indignation among soldiers-me n who do not go on strike, and who obey orders at no matter what risk or inconvenience to themselves. The Minister for the Army should give an undertaking that the leave will be granted. Once more I call the attention of the Government to the inadequate prices offered to the owners of land resumed by the Government for Government purposes. I raised this matter some weeks ago, and the views I then put forward were supported by honourable members from both sides of the House, including the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) and the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard). The Prime Minister was so impressed with the case made out that he promised that an investigation would be made. The Government has acquired some 600blocks of land for the extension of the runways at the Essendon Aerodrome. Land has also been acquired for Government purposes in other States. Under the Lands Acquisition Act, the Government is empowered to acquire any property, but it is expected to do a fair thing by the owners. I do not know any of the people whose land has been acquired, but I have received sheaves of letters from them protesting against the way in which they have been treated. Now, the Prime Minister, after having promised an investigation, says that he drawing his promise to have the matter was not aware at the time he made the investigated, statedpromise, of the system followed in arriving at valuations, and he now thinks that matter the system is satisfactory. I maintain Minister, the Department of the Interior does that this is not the proper way to treat not determine the assessed value of properties people who believe that they are suffering compensation an injustice, and whose resources are valuations assessed by valuers of the Federal limited. Some of them may have bought Taxation Department and by sworn valuers in the land in the expectation that it would private practice in the district where the proincrease in value, but, in the main, they crepancy between the taxation valuation and bought the blocks in order to build homes that of the private valuer, arrangements are on them. One block holder, a returned made for the two valuers to confer with a view soldier from this war, and a demobilized submitting soldier from the last war, writesThe actions of the department savour very much of the actions of the countries against which wo are fighting, and I do not intend to constitute an equitable method of dealing w it h let my block go at the price offered. This man was offered only £15 for his land, and there are numerous instances of blocks being purchased at £100, whilst the department has offered only £15 for them as compensation. The owners of the blocks were so indignant over the letters which they received from the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings) saying that that was the price and they would have to take it or, at most, offering an increase of a pound or two, that they formed themselves into an association, and appointed a deputation to wait upon the Minister in Melbourne. Honourable members from both sides of the House were invited to attend, but the Minister for the Interior, in a most cavalier fashion, admitted only those of his own political persuasion. later. Mr ""WHITE I understand that the Minister for Labour and Social Services( Mr Holloway) was present. I have received letters complaining of the rudeness of the Minister for the Interior to members of the deputation. I maintain that citizens, in -such circumstances, are entitled to a courteous hearing. I was a Minister for six years, and I cannot remember ever refusing to hear a deputation, although I was called upon to hear many more than wait on the Minister for the Interior. I again ask that this matter receive the attention of the Government. The Prime Minister, in withWhenI made my original statement on this I was not f u l ly aware of the detailed procedure followed. As was indicated by the without independent advice. The amount of decided upon is based upon the perty is situated. If there is any large disto discussing their respective valuations and a final valuation to the Department of the Interior. In many instances, additional valuations arc obtained from other qualified valuers. This system of valuation does, I consider, the acquisition of land. Let us see how the system works in practice. Various offers are made for a block, sometimes as many as four, and a sort of bargaining goes on between the department and the owner. In some instances, the amount offered was not sufficient to meet the unpaid instalments on the land. In one instance, a woman received from the department an offer of £55 for her two blocks, on which she still owes £80. In another case, the purchase price of the block was £100, and the owner was offered £45, although he still owes £45 15s., so that he may receive 5s., while the amount of £55 already paid will be a complete loss. A later case, since the matter was first dismissed was that of a Miss Malone who paid £150 for her block, plus £30 for roadrmaking, plus rates and taxes since 1928, and she was offered £68. She was originally offered only £54, but when she declined to accept that amount, the offer was raised to £68. This is the sort of unfair letter that is sent to owners in such circumstances by the departmentI n an endeavour to arrive at an amicable settlement in this matter, however, I am prepared to recommend to the Minister provided you w ill intimate your acceptance thereof an increase in the offer already made to £68 for an unencumbered estate in fee simple free from all mortgages, charges, liens and interest over or upon the land in f u l l satisfaction of your claim.

The lowering of the rate of front-line wastage assists in many ways: in fewer reinforcements being necessary, in fewer enlistments, and in the release of more men for the production of essentials. On the Army supply side, the present system involves great delays in requisitioning and securing material available, especially lend-lease. On the food supply side I have been informed that the American commissariat arrangements frequently permit of much more fresh vegetables and fresh food on the f r o n t line than apparently our men are getting in similar situations.

I have received correspondence on this subject from all the principal industries in .the district. The Associated Country Sawmillers of New South Wales, which operates no fewer than 70 mills, handles 8,000,000 superficial feet of timber a month-nearly feet of timber a year, or one-third of the total quantity of hardwood produced in Australia. The City Garage (Grafton) Proprietary Limited services the trucks and tractors of these mills. As Grafton is situated 450 miles from Sydney, the importance to them of the appointment of an intermediate parts distributor in the Grafton district requires no emphasis. The two big butter factories at Grafton and Ulmarra support this application. They each have 700 suppliers, and nearly all the cream is carried to the factories by motor truck and motor lorry. They point out that the City Garage (Grafton) Limited, distributor, would be in a position to carry a comprehensive range of parts that would be of great advantage to the carriers. The garage operators in the Clarence River district, who maintain the motor transport of this district, believe that the difficulty of obtaining replacement parts could be overcome by the registration of an intermediate distributor. Tho principal 'bus operators in the Clarence River district also support the application. point out that the essential services which they operate, depend upon the maintenance of costly vehicles on the road and that, in turn, depends upon the availability of spare parts. members are aware only one railway Sir Earle Page. line serves this area. Twenty-five 'buses are operated and are extensively used by persons who are unable to obtain tyres for their private motor vehicles. Finally, the Clarence River City Council has submitted to me important data in support of the application. The council, which conducts an electricity undertaking serving 10,000 customers, of 26 Fords, 10 Chevrolets, 1 Bedford, 1 Plymouth and 1 International. Apart from normal running repairs, the whole of the council's fleet of vehicles is overhauled in the council's garage in South Grafton. The necessity for maintaining these vehicles in good order requires ho emphasis. In the past the council carried a comprehensive range of spare parts, but since the introduction of parts control, has had considerable difficulty in 100,000,000 superficial purchasing replacement's. It supports the application of the City Garage (Grafton) Proprietary Limited as an intermediate parts distributor. The Government should decentralize the existing reserves of equipment. Whether the spare parts be kept at Sydney, Newcastle or Grafton, they still form a reserve supply. The officer responsible for the control of road transport on the north coast has his office at Grafton. The establishment of a reserve pool in that centre would obviate the long delays that occur when essential services require spare parts. Proprietary A few weeks ago, I emphasized the as intermediate dealer or necessity for providing in country districts ample supplies of ammunition for the destruction of vermin. Primary producers experience great difficulty in keeping their fences in proper order because of the ravages of dingoes, rabbits and hares. Although primary producers are able to obtain permits to purchase ammunition, they are unable to secure supplies of cartridges. S. Hoffnung and Company Limited, merchants, of They Sydney, advocate the decentralization of supplies. Reserves of ammunition sufficient for three or four months' requirements should be established in various parts of the State, and farmers should As honourable be permitted to purchase reasonable quantities. In that way, they would not be obliged to use petrol 'unnecessarily in . returning to the town at short intervals. to replenish their supplies. -The -Government should seriously consider the advisability of constructing without delay an electricity transmission line between Brisbane and Newcastle in order that existing generating stations may be linked up, the intervening country served, and the maximum use made of tbe power. This scheme would enable us to stave off the disaster that will otherwise occur because of the difficulty of obtaining new generating plant. Although some-of these mammoth machines have been ordered, four or five years will pass before they can be installed. In some instances, Great Britain and the United States of America have not been alble to accept orders. If these various undertakings could be linked up, primary producers and the residents of small towns would be able to oveixsome difficulties arisTreasury in Sydney. The departmental ing from the shortage of man-power by utilizing the electrical po-Wer at their disposal. Although this is "" Grievance Day"", the Government must ibe very gratified that the debate, after extending over several hours, has not produced one complaint against the administration of any Minister; The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), who will shortly leave for Great Britain, should be particularly satisfied with this evidence of the ability of his Cabinet colleagues. It is just as well to remind the people of Australia that they have a good deal for which to thank this Government. Two years ago, it saved this countiy from invasion, and the people demonstrated their gratitude by returning the Labour party with an overwhelming majority. The Government is doing an excellent job on behalf of Australia and the Allied cause generally. This debate affords me an opportunity to direct attention -to several matters that should be rectified. In my electorate, as in other electorates in the metropolitan areas of Sydney and Melbourne, the housing shortage is acute. People who desire to erect homes discover that the Department .of War Organization of Industry is unable, because of the exigencies of war, to release the necessary materials. I am. hopeful that existing regulations will soon be relaxed, and that people who urgently require accommodation for themselves and their families will have an opportunity to build their own homes. Last week, a man employed in a munitions establishment was ordered by tbe court to vacate the premises that he was occupying. He has a wife, three daughters and two sons. As the result of the magistrate's order, the father and the two sons have gone to Bondi, the mother and two of the daughters live in the city, and the third little girl is staying with friends. Those conditions cannot be permitted to continue indefinitely, because they will do a great national disservice. Many servicemen and their wives have been saving their money with the object of purchasing homes after the war. The wife of a soldier who is serving in New Guinea entered into a contract to buy a home, sulbject to the aipproval of the Subreply was that, unless she could'get vacant possession and contribute £100 or £200 to the war loan, the sale would not be permitted. These restrictions should not be placed upon purchases of this kind. They are not investments. I urge the Treasurer to give sympathetic consideration to these genuine applications. The persons concerned have no money to invest in the war loans, after they have .paid a deposit upon the purchase of a house. Usually, they have to borrow to finance the transaction. The particular application to wbich I referred has been forwarded to the Treasurer for review, and I hope that he will give it favorable consideration. I trust that the War Service Homes Commission will lose no time in making preparations to resume the construction of homes on a big scale for servicemen who need them. There is no need to wait until men are discharged before putting such work in hand. I realize that the shortage of man-power and materials is a great difficulty, but it should be possible to do something effective in war service home construction even under present conditions. I hope that the Government will prescribe conditions of purchase that will make it practicable for men to complete the purchase of homes within a reasonable period. Recently we have been informed that some returned men who bought homes 25 years ago, after the end of the last war, owe more on them to-day",45,Sydney
245,Mr Mulcahy (Lang) [10.25],"than they owed when they signed their contracts of purchase. This is due, of course, to the depression, but high interest rates have also been a contributing factor. The interest rates on the homes erected for returned soldiers after this war should be such as will merely recompense the Government for keeping the accounts. The provision of war service homes on this basis would be real repa triathe release of Italian internees. It tion work. I offer a protest against the call-up for under Army control and employed Army service of men with five or six young children. Such men are still being called up, and it is a wrong policy. 1 know of one young man with four children, and expecting another, who was called up a few weeks ago, and recently we read reports in the press to the effect that one man with nine children and another with eleven had been charged with ,-ibsence without leave. Such men should not he in the Army. If they volunteer for service they evade their proper responsibilities to their wives and families, and if they are called up compulsorily persons responsible for their call-up should be brought to book. Such men can do far better work out of the Army than they can do in it. I trust that the appropriate Ministers will give careful consideration to these matters over which I ""grieve"". On several occasions recently I have raised in this House the subject of the release of Italian internees and their employment to the detriment of Australian nationals. I do so again without apology, because I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the attitude of the Government towards my representations. This subject has caused intense feeling in Queensland, especially among the members of returned soldier organizations, and I direct attention to it again as a returned soldier memthey should be paid army rates of pay and ber of this Parliament representing a '-i.Queensland constituency. When I spoke on the subject previously the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) was in the chamber. I informed him that feeling in Queensland was at white heat because of the failure of the Government to take effective steps to deal with this situation, hut. although the Attorney-General interjected while I was speaking, he failed to take an opportunity to address the House on the subject. I have since written to him about it, but his reply is quite unsatisfactory. The subject was discussed on the. 19th February at the conference of the Western District Branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia and strong protests were voiced against was requested that they be placed at Army rates of pay. Mr Knight, representative of the Toowoomba sub-branch, declared that Italians, who had been interned when Italy entered the war, had since been released and employed to the detriment of Australian nationals. He described the whole procedure as the work of politicians looking for votes, and emphasized that those responsible for the release of the men were not fit to be politicians. He asserted also that union organizers were aware of what was being done. That conference represented 3,000 returned men and its request that such internees should be released only under Army control and employed only at Army rates of pay should be granted. I have received letters from 27 sub-branches of returned soldier organizations in Queensland on this subject, and I propose to quote extracts from some of them. The Manly-Lota sub-branch of the league wrote to HIP tis follows:Dear Sir, I am instructed to bring before your uuiii-c tlie following:1. This sub-branch strongly protests against, tbe policy and unfairness of the release and employment of Italian internees .and allowing t'liem to be employed in.civilian jobs at award and higher rates of pay, award condition-;, overtime, &c, when thousands of Australian men are kept in the Army in employment, battalions, base jobs. &c. at army rates of pay with no award conditions, overtime. &K. 2. There is no objection to these ]H!opic being put to work iu the national interest, but conditions. If men are needed in civilian employment, then let them release men from employment battalions, bases, & c , and give them the opportunity of obtaining the award rates, aud replace them in the labour battalions with the aliens. 4. This sub-branch considers that the Government are simply giving preference in civilian employment to Italian internees, and that this policy is deliberately allowing ex-intcruees to re-establish and entrench themselves in cushy jobs before the men in the force? can get a chance. . .",48,Sydney
246,Mr Francis (Moreton) [10.35],"I might add that there is a growing feeling ot resentment among the Diggers, young and old, at this unfair policy in treating ex-internees and discrimination between them and old Diggers, whose age prevents them serving in the front line, but are unable to get these jobs. The reply that I received fro m the Attorney-General was unsatisfactory, and I again bring the matter to the notice of the Government. In a letter which I received from him, the Attorney-General saidAll medically fit Italian aliens released from internment have been called up by the Allied Works Council for employment in the Civil Aliens CorpB, where they receive soldiers' rates of pay or the award rate, whichever is the less, and where they are subject to adequate disciplinary control. Italian aliens found to be medically unfit ' for the Civil Aliens Corps have been sent to the man-power authorities for direction to suitable employment. It is obvious, therefore, that the alien ex-internees who have been placed in civilian employment are those uot medically fit for the Civil Alien Corps. That means that only medically unfit Italian ex-dnternees are put into the Civil Alien Corps. F it It a l i an ex-internees are placed in civilian employment at award rates of pay and are paid for overtime. I have addressed questions on this matter to the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior, but have received no replies. were1. In the case of medically fit Italian aliens, released from internment for employment in the Civil Alien Corps, will the Minister state (a) the award rate for such aliens, and (6) the soldiers' rate of pay applicable to them? 2. In the case of aliens sent to the manpower authorities for direction to suitable employment, what conditions govern their rates of pay and what pay do they receive? I think that on an important matter of that kind the Minister should have obtained a reply to my questions without delay. It is utterly wrong to employ It a l i an ex-internees at award rates of pay, with provision for extra pay for overtime, when our own soldiers receive only army pay for doing the same work. We should not give preference to It a l i a n ex-internees over our own soldiers. When our men are released from the forces, this policy w ill increase the difficulty experienced in restoring them to civil employment. Mr Kennedy, of the Toowoomba branch of the league, suggests that all of those Italians who have been released from internment and have been returned to their ordinary civil employment should be placed under army control and granted army rates of pay. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) pointed out that this was not considered practicable. A terse observation of that kind is an insult to the members of our fighting forces, and I renew my appeal for proper treatment of Australian soldiers. It a l i a n ex-internees must be employed, as f a r as possible, but they should not receive greater advantages than the members of the fighting forces. The resentment at the action of the Government has spread to North Queensland. It is not confined to the electorates represented by members of the Opposition. The latest issue of Smith's Weekly contains an article headed: "" Preference for Italians "". It states, inter alia"" One has only to live in the North, in these semi-Italian communities, to realise the resentment that is growing, particularly among those mothers whose sons are serving with the forces; and we feel that the present policy should be discontinued."" Above is an extract from a protest by the Tully (N.Q.) branch of the Returned Soldiers' League to G. W. Martens, Federal member for the district, regarding some Italians in North Queensland. Attitude at Tully is wholly in keeping with The questions which I asked tlie stand taken by the Leagues at Ayr and Toowoomba as reported in the March4 issue of "" Smith's."" View expressed by the Tully League in its protest is:"" The unfairness of releasing these aliens and allowing them to be employed at award conditions and higher rates of pay-overtime , &c -whe n thousands of Australian men called up under proclamation (practically conscripts) are being kept in the Army in employment ' battalions, base jobs, &c, at Army rates of pay, with no award conditions, overtime, &c. "" This policy, we consider, amounts to preference to enemy aliens, who have nothing to lose and everything to gain-who , in short, are being granted preferential treatment at the expense of natural-born Australians."" Among the instances of preferential treatment cited by the League is that of an Italian, who had been living in the north for 30 years, and was one of the earliest batch from the district to be interned. ""This man,"" it is stated, ""has two wellgrown sons, both of military age. "" They were granted exemption from military call-up, because of the father being interned, and it was thought necessary they should remain at home to work the two sugar farms owned by the father. Since the release of the father neither of the sons has been called up. "" On the contrary, one is contemplating early marriage, and ia endeavouring to buy a sugar farm in this area."" tu contrast with this and the consideration shown to other Italians, the League givesamong other instances-the case of the proprietress of a registered dairy, supplying 50 por cent, or more of the milk needs of Tully. "" Her husband,"" it is explained, "" is a returned soldier from World WarI . , and is suffering from the effects of war service. "" The husband does most of the work on the dairy, assisted by members of the family not yet of military age. "" One son of military age has been called up mid bus been serving for some time. "" Owing to the shortage of man-power and her inability to obtain assistance to carry on an essential industry, the mother has, we understand, made application through the proper channels, for the release of the son from service to enable her to keep up Unnecessary milk supply to Tully. "" T h is application has been refused."" Tully League requests Mr Martens to bring "" this very urgent question before the Hous*-,' 1 and, if possible, the favour of a direct report by him as regards his presentation of the matter to his fellow parliamentarians. That is a glaring instance of gross injustice to a woman and an old soldier husband who is trying to supply milk to the people of Tully. The mother and father made application for the release of their son, but the request, was refused, although an ex-interned It a l i a n alien was allowed to have his two sons to carry on his sugar farms.

Mr Ji'raneis. Minister for Works( Mr H. A. Bruce) to-day. He has just returned from Canberra where he made representations to the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) that those men should lie released. He said the release of Italians would be instrumental in increasing the production of butter, sugar and tobacco, and thus provide foodstuffs that were urgently needed by Allied troops and the people of Great Britain. He added that they would be much more happy in their homes and Australia would be relieved of the cost of their maintenance. It is obvious that the intention is, not to assist rural industries but to obtain the votes of these Italians with a view to eusuring the return of Labour members to the State Parliament. The attitude of the Commonwealth Government is indefensible; it is prepared to sacrifice our own fighting men, by allowing Italian-; to obtain a footing in industry to' the disadvantage of our fighting forces. I regard the whole matter as a scandal. This preference to exinternees, to the disadvantage of Australian servicemen, will be resented by everybody in Queensland.

250,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"Owing to heavy military traffic, the roads in many districts in my electorate have been practically cut to pieces, but the local governing authorities cannot effect urgent repairs because their plant and machinery have heen impressed, hy the Allied Works Council. I have received a letter from the Maryborough District Local Authorities Association, which represents six local governing bodies, asking me to make representations on this matter. They point out that at least one grader should he made availaible immediately in order to enaible them to effect very urgent repairs. I have already made that request to the Government, but I have not yet received a reply. The only council in the association with a decent machine is the Biggenden Shire Council. The Tiaro Shire Council has no machine in working order. The Woocoo Shire Council does not possess a machine at all, and the Burrum Shire Council has to make shift with a machine which is always breaking down. The Isis Shire Council has a machine which has to be very carefully looked after, and the Maryborough City Council has no machine at all. Those councils formerly employed nine, and sometimes ten, good machines continuously on road repair work. In the Maroochy district, local farmers have repaired roads with shovels in' order to make them passable. These councils contend that, as the roads have been cut up by heavy military traffic, the Government should provide them with financial assistance to enable them to effect repairs, and that the Allied Works Council should make road-making machinery and ex Civil Constructional Corps workers available to them temporarily. In many districts, farms are still being the Government^ 22 aborigines were worked by aged people and youngsters. Owing to the strain under which they have been working so long in the absence of their able-bodied men who are now in the armed forces, they now find that they can barely carry on. I have in my hand a newspaper advertising the sales of. five farms in the one locality. In many districts, dairy cattle are being butchered. In view of the necessity to increase production on the food front, I ask the Government .to review the categories of Army Service personnel from Sir, Bernard Corser. which discharges are not permitted. These categories are(a) Personnel medically classified A in units serving outside the Australian mainland. (6) Personnel medically classified A .in reinforcement training units. (o) Reinforcements en route to operational units. (d) Certain classes of skilled tradesmen. (e) Personnel medically classified A attached temporarily as instructors to units on the mainland. I suggest that the present prohibitions applied in respect of classes 6, d and e could be relaxed with a view to transferring more men to primary industry. In one district in my electorate an aged blacksmith was advised that his son would be released by the man-power authorities, but that advice was cancelled. I point out that blacksmiths perform an indispensable service to primary producers. I again draw attention to the. serious effect of the shortage of motor tyres on primary production, and appeal to the Government to make more tyres available to producers. I need only cite the case of a farmer who has been obliged to place his motor vehicle on blocks because he cannot obtain tyres, and has now to convey his cream to the rail siding by other means, leaving his home to catch a train at 4 o'clock each morning. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) was good enough to inform me that all labour required by the sugar industry in the Nambour district during the coming sugar season would be made available. However, growers doubt the earnestness of the Minister in making that promise, because last season the Nambour mill was unable to obtain anything like the permitted labour it required, and when an appeal for additional man-power was made to sent to the mill from BrokenH ill. Those aborigines proved to be useless, and their services had to be dispensed with within a fortnight. On their arrival at Nambour they were in need of clothing; and the management of the mill found it impossible to teach them the work which they were required to perform. In view of that experience I ask the Minister to give an assurance to the sugar-growers of Queensland that he will honour his promise to provide sufficient labour during the coming season. Last season thousands of tons of sugar w as lost, following a heavy frost, because sufficient man-power was not available for cutting.

The honourable member's remarks were brought to the. notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has advised that following instructions given by him, a special investigation squad was created to deal with the black marketing, of .liquor in Sydney. This action has met with a large degree of success and many-successful prosecutions have been launched as a result of the squad's activities. With regard to the honourable member's specific reference to bottled beer, it is pointed out that there is no objection under the.Control of Liquor Order to . the sale of bottled beer, and, with the exception of price-fixing, the Commonwealth at present possesses no powers of .'control over its sale. The prohibition of the drinking of bottled beer in parks and other public places is a matter which comes within the province of the State authorities concerned. honourable member for Cook( Mr Sheehan), asked the following question without notice:Is it a fact that a big percentage of doctors are practising in the city of Sydney? Is the Minister aware that because suburban doctors are overworked, many people taken seriously ill at night are unable to obtain medical attention? Will the Minister examine the position ? The Minister for Health has supplied the following answer:I have looked into this matter and desire to inform the honourable member that a considerable proportion of doctors practising in the city of Sydney are specialists,, fully occupied with hospital and consulting work and with the teaching of medical students. Suburban doctors are overworked. This is well recognized by the State Medical Coas ordination Committee whose function, under National Security Regulations, is to watch the distribution of civilian practitioners and to ensure an equitable distribution of the available pool of medical men. With one-third of the youngest and most active, practitioners on service, civilians cannot expect the same ready availability of doctors as in peace-time. In' Sydney,' however, with reciprocal arrangements between doctors, the .ambulance the services, the suburban ring of hospitals, and the Hospital Admission Depot, it is not true that many people taken seriously ill at night are unable to obtain medical attention.'
