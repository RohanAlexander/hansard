Mr ""WATT I know nothing of the matter, beyond what has appeared in the newspapers. honourable member for Maribyrnong asked for information respecting a large quantity of butter, which has been in store for a considerable period. The butter in question is privately owned, and consists of 24,220 boxes. Of these, at the time of storage, 11,550 were first grade, 3,202 were second grade, 570 were third grade, and 8,898 were unknown. On being regraded recently, out of the 11,550 boxes of firstgrade, only 1,08S were graded first grade, the balance being classed as seconds and thirds. As the regrading took place about two and a half months ago it is estimated that at present less than 1,000 boxes would be fit for the Australian market. Owing to the price paid for the butter and the accumulated storage charges, it is doubtful whether the butter could be sold at the existing proclaimed price without incurring a loss. The butter was not taken out of store, because those who owned it refused to put it into the Imperial Pool. They wished to export it, and get the ful l profit of the English market. The Government refused to allow them to do that, and the butter has remained in store ever since. a number of letters from country merchants who have hitherto had the handling of cornsacks, and I desire to know whether the Minister will make a statement of a general character as to how the distribution is to be carried into effect, and how these merchants are to be treated ? in the House a little while ago in relation to this matter, saying that, so far as authorities upon the premises of the Italian the distribution was concerned, it will be through the ordinary channels, in exactly the same way as heretofore In regard to price, I was unable to say exactly what would be done. Negotiations are still going on with the Indian Government, and I hope to finalize the question of price within the next few days. COAL DISTRIBUTION. Acting Minister for the Navy whether representations have been made to him, on behalf of some colliery proprietors, to apportion the supply of the coal necessary for Australian requirements between the respective mines, and thus provide equal employment for all collieries and employees? If so; in view of the fact that the Government have appointed Boards to control wool and wheat in the national interest, will he act similarly in regard to coal, which is so essential to the national welfare? presentatives of the coal-owners waited on me this morning, and, as a result, a deputation from Newcastle will meet me on Tuesday next.

Por this year prices will follow the usual course, subject to control, each State beardirected that it must go to Sydney or ing its own cost of importation, and Victorian prices w ill come back, as soon as she has au exportable surplus, to the summer level. Negotiations are now in progress for the sale of next year's exportable surplus to the Imperial Government, and as our dairymen are evincing a desire not to follow the example of New Zealand and ask for 175s. per cwt., but to be content with the price given last year, viz., 151s., f«o.b., I am very hopeful, if shipping is available, that the Imperial Government will close with our offer. In the Spring of last year the Imperial Government notified us that they were prepared to purchase Australian butter up to 30,000 tons, promising, as the butter was urgently required, to make the necessary arrangements as to freights. In every State, after providing for local requirements, all surplus butter, except a curtailed and strictly limited supply to enable the Eastern trade to be kept together, was purchased on account of the Imperial Government, whose needs were very urgent. The Imperial Government placed butter first on the priority list, even above meat, and subsequently instructed us, irrespective of quality, to ship every pound available. were their requests that some time ago the question was raised that, should sufficient shipping be available, it might be necessary to ration the Australian people for this article to enable a f u l l forecast the probable production from the supply to be sent to Great Britain. It must be borne in mind that, with the exception of the small quantity of put of which is subject to the most rapid butter shipped to the East, all the surfluctuations. plus output was purchased by the Commonwealth Government, and the whole Victoria was 6,048,000 lbs., and in Febhas been consigned to the Food Conruaryi t fell to 3,653,944 lbs., roughly troller in England.

It w ill be vate account, but the Government declined to sanction such export, and has never given way on the point. As the butter was purchased it was not the sole reason. It has already been placed in cool store, awaiting jn the original State of production. question as to which State the butter standard, and I regret to say a very large should be shipped from was conditioned proportion of the Victorian surplus has Afr.

It would have been quite impossible, for in stance, when we were informed that a vessel would load at Melbourne, to have Brisbane merely to pick up butter. It became apparent towards the end of February that shipping would not be available to l if t the whole of our surplus production, and the Government at "" once called a conference of representative men engaged in the butter trade to make arrangements to store sufficient butter of a high grade to supplement our winter supply, and prevent an acute shortage. There is always a shortage of supply in Australia during the winter months, prices never remaining at a sufficiently high level for % a period long enough to induce farmers to go to the expense necessary to maintain the supply. In pre-war times this was provided for by merchants and others, who relied upon a natural rise in price during the winter months to pay for 'the cost of storage and furnish a profit on the transaction. Arrangements were made to store butter in the three principal producing States-Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, which graded 92 points and over. This standard was chosen to permit of a certain amount of deterioration, as butter grading less than 90 points is practically useless for the grocers' trade So urgent in Australia. Hencei t was no use storing butter grading 90 points, which would come out of store at a lower grade. It is, however, extremely difficult to soil of any product, and with none is this more difficult than w i th butter, the outI n January this year the production in seen, therefore, that the total surplus available for storage in Victoria rapidly reached a very low ebb.

It may be urged that steps should have Of course, this is not a fair reout that, as it is a perishable product, the prices would have to be lifted to pay the storage charges when it is brought on to the market. There is also the factor of uncertainty of the season. If the supply kept up, butter stored for a long period could only be sold at a dead loss.

With the recent rains, granted normal conditions, Vietoria will probably have an exportable surplus early in August to meet any shortage in the eastern States, which generally reach their lowest point of production about that time, in which case the Victorian price would be lowered to permit of export over tihe short period until all States are producing enough for their own consumption, aud we revert again to 149s. 4d. for export, assuming that the Imperial Government purchase our surplus on the same terms as last year.

I should like to explain that it often happens that a soldier on being wounded is sent to England, with the result that a parcel addressed to him at the Front does not reach him; its contents are distributed among the members of the unit to which he belongs. By allowing parcels to be addressed to the care of a relative in England, and giving the unit to which the soldier belongs, this difficulty has been overcome, and I desire to know whether the practice is still allowed. long as tlie units to which they belong are clearly set out.

As the result of inquiries, I have now ascertained that the replies to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1.

I told the honourable member that it was not competent to move for the reduction of any item in an Appropriation B ill , as the votes had already been dealt with in If it is impossible for Committee on the Estimates-in-Chief, and the report submitted to the House had been adopted.

99,The Chairman (Hon. J . M .,"Mr Speaker also quoted Jfroni M-ay, page 562:The principle of relevancy is also strictly applied to debate and amendments in the Committee on the Appropriation Bill. No grant of supply is effected by the Bill; its provisions are solely administrative; the sole subject of the Bill is to ensure the application of the grants made by Parliament to the objects defined by the resolutions of the Committee of Supply. Accordingly, debate or amendment must be restricted to the matter of appropriation; and the conduct of the officials or of thc departments who receive the supply grants cannot be challenged in tlie Committee on the Bill; nor can amendments be moved to omit clauses, or to the schedule, to effect the reduction of thc amount, or an alteration in the destination of a grant. Nor are the enacting words of the Bill open to amendment. I do not wish to weary the Committee by quoting other decisions that I have here, but on those I have read I now rule that the proposed amendment of the honourable member for Yarra is not permissible.

May I address myself through you, sir, to the Leader of tbe Opposition. That honourable member seeks some assurance from the Government, indirectly, of an -opportunity to deal with this question. He desires an opportunity on one of the money Bills on the notice-paper, which, however, in our judgment, would be neither in order nor appropriate. Mr TT/DOR I could do what I desire on a clause of the Bill. I tell the honourable member plainly that he may do what he desires either on the DefenceB ill , which we shall attempt to> pass before we rise, or on the Defence Estimates, which we w ill pass before we rise. I have assured h i m four or five times that there w ill be no sudden rising of which the Opposition is not apprised. The honourable gentleman w ill have ample opportunity also to deal with the question on the Estimates as a whole, because before we rise we intend to pass the Appropriation B ill ; and the honourable member will appreciate what that means.

However, I only desire to point out, in fairness to myself, that I am not responsible for the delay that has taken place. is about a fortnigh t since a question addressed to the Acting Prime Minister elicited from him a promise that honourable members would have an opportunity to discuss the question of the enlistment of minors at an early date. The honourable gentleman and his Government have waited patiently in the meantime to ascertain the trend of public feeling, which has so far developed that, as we are pleased to see from the newspapers of yesterday and to-day, the Government have decided to reconsider its position. That is an advance for which, I suppose, we should be devoutly thankful . But it is not sufficient, because we recognise that while the Government is gauging public feeling, we are setting dangerously near to the close of our present sittings. I have not sufficient confidence in the Government to depend on what they say during the currency of these sittings as a guarantee of what may take place after the sittings close. Honourable members, I think, know that inside and outside I have.expressed my strong disapprobation of the inducement that is being held . out to. mere, youths in this country to"" disregard the wishes of their parents, while they themselves are still under the age of nineteen A f t e r the year had closed, years, in this important matter of enlistsaid. ment. I have acquainted myself witb some of the speeches delivered previously on this subject in the House.

Sir William Irvine was not the only honourable member who spoke in strong conD o you mean to say that demnation of that proposal. I do not think he was supported by the honourable because I judged from an interjection I was assured by the that he thought youths of eighteen might be safely enlisted. I do not know what was case, I do not think they ought to be. taken without the consent of their parents. the honourable member say so. Amongst those who spoke at that time against that policy was the present Minister for ReI wonder! I really cruiting ( Mr Orchard), who made a strong appeal to the then Government not fco enlist youths of eighteen years of age for active service abroad. A t that time there was no question of their enlistment without the consent of their parents. It was merely a question of whether or not boys of that age should be allowed to serve abroad, and the strongest speech in opposition to that policy was made by the honourable member for Nepean. The Government are still undecided; popular indignation is yet immature; the Government are not quite satisfied as to the volume of public opinion in condemnation of their policy, and so we are not clear as to whether or not the Government will insist upon calling for boys to do what is more than man's work. A parent came to me, and said that one of her sons had been wounded at the Front; and a younger son, eighteen years of age, wished to enlist. He presented himself at the TownH a l l and was rejected', on tbe ground of physical unfitness. After this new regulation was promulgated, he presented himself before another medical officer, and was accepted for military ser-. vice abroad, without the. consent of his parents; and in opposition to their wish, lie entered camp.

I desire to say something about enemy trading, with special reference to the Standard Woollen Company, which has had rather an interesting history. Originally, the company traded under the name of Johann Wulfing, of Lenep, Germany. Later, the name was altered to the Wulfing Woollen Company. on its affairs under that title unti l one of the Hardts, of Hamburg, came out and assumed control, and changed the trading name to G. H a r d t and Company. A fte r the commencement of the war, this firm was declared an enemy firm. Immediately that was done, a transfer of the business to E . Schroeder took place, and the title was altered to the Standard Woollen Company. the honourable member are not applicable to the Bill which is now before the Committee. that on this B ill nothing but what is contained in it can be discussed? parently the honourable member does not see the distinction between the Estimates and the. Appropriation B ill . When the Estimates are before the Committee it is permissible for an honourable member to discuss each and every item, and the Government policy in relation thereto, in any way he thinks proper. But after the If the Committee of Supply have approved of them, and dealt witb the Government policy in regard to them, and after the Committee has reported to the House, and the House has adopted that report, there follows an Appropriation B ill , which, for administrative purposes, appropriates the money which has been already voted by the Committee of Supply. I have no desire to curtail debate, biit it is my duty to point out that the honourable member's remarks are in no way relevant to the appropriation measure. that your ruling is that, though the""ComI have already mittee may discuss the Government policy when dealing with the resolution of Supply, we cannot discuss it oil a B ill such as that now before the Committee!

It was necessary, therefore, to bring forward this Bill to legalize that extra payment amongst others.

On page 4 of this Bill, there is an item in respect The House of ""Naval Bases, Works and establishments, labour and material,"" representing an appropriation of £194,801, which has to be read in lieu of an item of £200,000 for the same works in the Estimates agreed to by us some time ago. In that case there is a reduction on the amount originally passed. The point that I wish to make, however, is that where an amount agreed to in the Estimates has been exceeded, and this Bill is brought forward to legalize the extra payment made in respect of it, the Committee ought to have an opportunity to say whether that extra payment should be made. I fear that an important, precedent may be established by the ruling you gave a few minutes ago, that we may not amend any items in the schedule to a Bill of this kind, since they have already been I hold that they have not been passed; otherwise it would not be necessary to For instance, the item bring forward this Bill to legalize the additional payments made in respect of certain items in the Estimates for 191516. Chanter) It has probably escaped the honourable member's memory that it is only some four weeks since we dealt with the very Estimates to which this Bill relates. I did not rule that there could be no discussion upon tbe items. My ruling was that there could be no amendment of items in the schedule, nor could there be a discussion on any matter of policy, since honourable members had had an opportunity to deal with the items and to discuss questions of policy when the Estimates were submitted in Committee of Supply.

Some honourable members were going to make serious complaints about the way in which money has been expended in tbe past, and it was their intention to warn those who are in charge of the public purse today that they must be exceedingly caref u l in future. However, we are denied the opportunity of doing so. Estimates on which this B ill was founded were dealt w i th on the 19 th A p r i l , when I was attending a Conference convened by the Governor General. I am sorry that promises made at that Conference I was endeavouring to by the Premiers of the States have not been kept. other promises? pledges that I have made.

We do not know why a certain case was settled out of Court, or why the Prime Minister paid the costs. I should like au opportunity to deal with several matters in which the public is still in terested, notwithstanding the disinclination of Ministers to give information. When the DefenceB ill comes before us, I shall move an amendment that w ill enable us to discuss the regulation which allows boys of eighteen to enlist without the consent of their parents.

In many of the A.cts of Parliament the word "" M in is t e r "" is used as meaning generally the Minister of State administering the Act, as in the case of the Naturalization Act, the Electoral Act, ancl so forth .

He to, such reference shall, unless the contrary inhas now no authority to act for or on betention appears, be deemed to include any Minister for the time being acting for or on behalf of any Minister, though in the half of such Minister. The effect of that is that where in an Act the Treasurer, for instance, is mentioned, the expression includes also any other Minister of State who is acting for him.

On the other hand, if this amendment of the law be made, the five Honorary Ministers will be authorized to discharge the duties of any responsible Minister, and I do hot think the result will be beneficial to the administration of our public Departments. the Government say that this B ill is necessary, I shall vote for it . ber say that if an Honorary Minister were acting for the Minister for Defence for a week, he could not sign papers as a Minister? certain matters shall be dealt with only by the responsible Minister. sent only a small section of the work of the Minister for Defence. particularly to the provisions of the Customs Act. I fear that we shall create a very dangerous precedent by giving this authority to Honorary Ministers, and I wish it to be clearly understood that, although I shall vote for tbe B ill , I have no idea of supporting any proposal to increase the Ministerial allowance on the ground that Honorary Ministers are doing f u l l Ministerial work. They will not be doing anything of the kind, and consequently I shall not support any increase in the Ministerial allowance. ThisB ill should be passed. The object which the Government have in view is perfectly clear, and I do not think it will have the dangerous effect suggested by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor). . If I thought it would, or that the B ill was being put forward merely as a stepping-stone to the creation of new Departments to be placed under tbe administration of the HonoraryM in isters, so that an increased Ministerial allowance might be obtained, I should certainly oppose it . the assurance of the Government that it . will be used only in the way mentioned by them, and I regard it as a perfectly innocent measure. Minister( Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy( Mr Cook) were about to leave for England, we were freely led to understand that, on their return, two of the newly appointed Honorary Ministers would retire. That is an understanding which I intend to see honorably fulfilled. If the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy do not return, the position will be different, but if ithey resume their Ministerial work here, I shall certainly expect this understanding to be carried out. I have no fault to find with the personnel of the new Honorary Ministers, and 1 If , however, certainly believe that they will do effective and honest work for the Commonwealth. I object to this B ill , because of its patch-work character. We have obviously to make provision of a temporary character to meet a temporary expedient. A number of Honorary Ministers have been appointed for certain governmental purposes during the absence of the But those matters reprePrime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, and the Government think it necessary to give them f u l l status as Ministers. I am quite prepared to believe that there should be an increase in the number of statutory Ministers. Parliament agreed to -the principle last year, when it passed a Bill providing for the creation of the Repatriation Department and the appointment of a Ministerial head of tliat Department. But the appointment of five or six Honorary Ministers, in order, to cope with what the Prime Minister, before leaving, said were the enormously increased activities of the Pederal Government, does not seem to require that they should be given f u l l status. If it is necessary to create a number of new Ministerial positions, then there is a constitutional and permanent^ way of doing it. I think the House recognises thafe there are some very strong reasons for the appointment of new Ministers, but the objection that I have to this B ill is that it will give Honorary Ministers such a status that two of them, with the Governor General, will constitute a meeting of the Executive .Council, and will be able to pass regulations.

This regulation was drafted by the Prime Ministeri n Sydney, and sent by him to Melbourne, where it was put before a meeting of tlie Executive Council attended by the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Jensen), the then Treasurer ( Mr Higgs), and the then Assistant Ministerf o r Defence (Senator Gardiner).

It is ludicrous to amending B ill for the purpose. In the Ministerial statement presented to this Housei t is stated that the Attorney-General is to become the Minister for Labour. We have heard nothing more, about that matter. We have iio indication as to whether there is to be a new Minister or whether the position of Attorney-General and the position of tlie Ministerf o r Labour are to be associated in the one Minister. However, we have a clear statement that it is proposed to create an entirely new Department, although we are informed that it is to be a branch of the Department of the Attorney-General. The time has arrived when the Government, and, indeed, the House, should determine how many additional Departments it is necessary to have, An Honorary Minister wncl how many full-portfolioed Ministers are required, with all the responsibilities attaching to their positions.

A great deal of the time of our Ministers is taken up in affixing forma l signatures to pieces of paper. instruction of their own officers. administration? Contrast that course of action with the way in which a large business is run.

ThisB ill aims at making the Honorary Minister responsible for the work delegated to him. The bulk of the work done by an Honorary Minister does not Minister of State. there would probably be not more than one document in 200 requiring the signature of a Minister of State. In the, case of the Works Department, which I controlled as Honorary Minister, the documents requiring the signature of the Minister were usually concerned with the extension of the service of temporary employees, or matters of that sort, which, through the folly of a previous Parliament, required the signature of a Mini=ter of State. If that Minister investigated all these things, or even made a pretence of investigating them seriously, the whole of his time would be taken up in considering John Smith's claim, and he would not have a moment to spare to give attention to the business of the country. I hope that there will be no cavilling at this B ill . The Government might very well consider the possibility of getting closer to the Britisli idea of Cabinet organization. My own idea is that Cabinet should not, consist of Executive Ministers in the Australian sense, who all the time -are bothered with details concerning their Departments. The men sitting in Cabinet should be free to think out broad problems and new problems; they should constitute the brain of. the community as a whole. So far, since the Pederal Parliament has met, Cabinet has not been in that sense the brain of the oountry as a whole. W h a t happens at a Cabinet meeting ? not allowed to tell. away any secrets. I propose to deal with broad phases of human nature. In every Of course. Isi t wise Department you hear the remark, "" This is an important and difficult subject; we will refer it to the Cabinet""; and the weaker the Minister the more matters he refers to Cabinet. Ten or twelve honest men get together once a week, and the whole object of those ten or twelve men His is to get their difficulties solved by the others, and the Minister who has the loudest voice is the one who gets his difficulties solved. When a Minister cannot make up his mind to take a wild plunge on some trivial subject, he says, "" I am going to have a talk with my colleagues about t h is . "" That means that he is going to Cabinet. And as every one has trivialities to bring before Cabinet, the rerequire the signature of a sult is that that body never does consider I suppose that broad policies] and never does look to the future. The only occasion on which it really does consider the future is just before it is going to face an election. sion : that is, when the Address-in-Reply has to be framed. is correct. There are two moments in the lifetime of an Australian Parliament when the Commonwealth has a brain, and that brain is in Cabinet, one when it is sitting immediately after an election, and the other when it is sitting immediately before an election. In the intervening time, Cabinet is merely a registration place for the weaknesses of various Ministers in matters of departmental triviality . The sooner Ministers become Ministers of Statei n the British sense, and trust other persons with control over the mere details of departmental administration, the better it will be for the country. AsT feel very strongly on the point, I welcome this B i ll as a change in a sound direction. I have only one word to say in con elusion, and that is in reference to what I thought was an unnecessary statement from the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson).

281,Mr Kelly,"The honourable memberdeprecate the raising of it : that is the problem of whether any Honorary Ministers are to retire in due course. In my opinion, some of our Honorary Ministers are the best men we have in the Cabinet. Perhaps it is due to the fact that they have not been in office long enough to be found out. We have considerable brain power and enthusiasm Honorary Ministers, and I hope that a place can be found for them in the future as well as at present. However, if we give work to Honorary Ministers, let us give them the responsibility also. It is the only sound way of dividing labour, and it is the best way of getting the best out of a good man. I am quite satisfied that the proposal of the Government is not shown on the surface of the Bill. It is their intention to increase the number of Ministers. Once Ministers get into office it is impossible to remove them. Some years ago Sir Henry Parkes received a deputation, of which I was a member, and which asked for the establishment of a Department of Technical Education, and in reply to a suggestion that it was merely a matter for an Honorary Minister, and would not entail any great expenditure, he said something to. this effect: "" If we appoint a Minister he cannot open his office door, or hang up his coat without a messenger, and it would be infra dig. for him to write a letter or cut open an envelope. staff of clerks to assist him in doing the work. member of Parliament to perform any work without some emolument. Consequently in less than four or five weeks there would be a staff of servants and messengers attached to the Minister and a nnmber of messengers attached to the staff as well."" I know that we want to find employment for returned soldiers. be employed as messengers. I recognise that, if Ministers wish to carry the dignified title of "" Member of the Executive Council,"" it will be necessary to have additions to the office staffs, which means the erection of buildings. This will create a certain amount of work. If any honourable member thinks that, on the return of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, those who are now in office can be shifted, he is making the greatest mistake he has ever made. We will still have those Ministers in office. We will be told that certain staffs have been created, and that it will be necessary to retain them in order to maintain the dignity of the various positions which have been created. among our Like the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) I am afraid that there may be some confusion in the matter of"" the signatures to be attached. If more Ministers are needed, the Government should have the courage to say so, and propose to increase the number, making arrangements for their proper payment. If all the Ministers had the same dignity and position, there would be no dispute as to the validity of a signature. On one occasion, I referred to the honourable member for Wentworth, who was then an Honorary Minister, as the lap dog to another Minister. I did not mean to be personally offensive, but it seemed to me then that.responsibility in connection with the Teesdale-Smith business, and other troubles, was being thrown on him which an Honorary Minister should not have to bear. Men should not be in such positions. The labourer is worthy of his hire, and if extra Ministers are needed, they should be appointed, and properly paid. But the public should not be misled in a matter of this kind. I am certain that, before long, provision will be made for He must have a extra Ministers. Why is not the position met now? The country would be willing It it utterly impossible for a to pay whatever may be necessary to provide for tbe proper administration of its affairs. I hope that the time will come when the Australian Parliament will be the only Parliament in Australia. Other parliamentary institutions are mere shams. There should not be two Parliaments doing the same business. While I have been a member of this Parliament, I have tried to keep this position to the fore. They can This Parliament sbould have the respect of every citizen of Australia, and I have based my conduct on that view. ""It is because Ministers lack courage that we are not asked to provide for new appointments. At the same time, I have no hesitation in saying that the Labour Government which preceded this did more work than this Government have done. It established various factories, sent away",50,Appropria Sidered But Not A Word Was Said About

The addition to the number of Ministers of State seems to me to make the Cabinet too unwieldy, and to account for much of the delay in attention to public busiwho receive salaries ness, of which we have continually to complain. I understand that at present there are fourteen gentlemen entitled to take -part in the deliberations of the Cabinet, and if that be so, I can hardly imagine bow, under such conditions, they get through their business at all. It can but. up to tbe present, tliese gentlemen only be by their taking a great deal for granted, and by weakening the responsibility that ought to attach to the various citizens, who render their country service offices. I hope to see the time when the Commonwealth will be governed by a Departments administered by gentlemen the Old Country, or holding the positions of the Assistant Ministers here, with salaries and duties defined, and responsible directly to Parliament for the administration of their offices, but without With regard Ao most of the criticism of this proposal, one has to bear in mind that it is not intended that the system shall continue. The position of the Commonwealth is a temporary one, and we have to contemplate the day when peace will be declared, and when suddenly the greater portion of the powers it now possesses and exercises, by reason of the war. When that day comes, six months after the actual declaration of peace, there will be no work for most of the present Ministers to do, for Departments that are now very extensive will practically disappear. Mr J. H . CATTS -You will find that their numbers will never grow less. Parliament wills. I am little impressed by the argument that because Ministers are appointed now they will continue for ever, for that is as the people themselves may direct.

I think that tbe Government, having found work for a numbei of gentlemen, should have come down to the House and asked for money with which to pay them. salaries of the Assistant Ministers are being paid by the Ministers of State; and it is quite unworthy of the Commonwealth that, in present circumstances, we should tax our Ministers to pay the Assistant Ministers, whose services Parliament recognises are required for the proper conduct of the business of the country. mentary expenses are always going up. Ministers, there are three Whips paid out of the same f u n d. different matter. The Government saw that it was necessary to create an additional office, and it seems to me that if that be so, an additional salary should have been provided. As to a Minister for Recruiting, I take that to be a purely temporary office, and the sooner it comes to a termination the better we shall be pleased. I have not heard the reasons why it was considered necessary to have a Minister for Recruiting, and, in any case, it does not seem to me to be an office that ought to carry Ministerial rank. I shall vote for tlie B ill , but I hope a time will soon come when we shall have a smaller, more responsible, and better-paid Government, and when the junior offices will be filled by men directly responsible to Parliament, and paid in accordance with the importance of their work. The honourable member who has just resumed bis seat was corrected by the honourable member for Denison( Mr Laird Smith) when he spoke of these Assistant Ministers as "" H o n o r a r y Ministers,"" and was told that they are called "" Assistant Ministers."" known as "" Assistant Ministers."" isters attached to Hansard, I see that these gentlemen are all described as "" Honorary Ministers."" rary so far as the country is concerned. but I am sure the honourable member would not say that the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) was wrong in contending that "" honorary "" can hardly be applied to any office which carries salary! not informed ' how much is paid to these Assistant Ministers? For aught we know, they may be paid £1,250, £1,500, or £1,000. I take this opportunity to enter a protest, which, I think, will be voiced outside by tbe public generally. In these days not only the newspapers, but honourable members, are preaching economy in every sense of the word. Speaking with over a quarter of a century of parliamentary experience, I T h a t is so. know of nothing that causes ill-feeling so much as the difference between the remuneration of members and that of M in isters, and from this time forth I shall T h a t is a advocate that the salaries shall be the same. I consider that £60 0 a year is good enough for any man, no matter what his services to his country may be. If patriotism swells the breast of young men who enlist for 6s. a day, and are prepared to offer the supreme sacrifice, I think a minimum wage of £ 1 2 a week is a very fair one, for which men ought to give, not the f a g end, but the best, of their time 'to their country. members' salaries ? have to face their constituents, and are elected, I think the salary paid to them should be the highest in the whole Public Service. I suggest that if , for instance, the salary were £1,000 a year, the member might be paid £ 5 0 0 , and the other £500 retained., and in case of his failure to be returned, or of his becoming incapacitated, like an old-age pensioner, paid out to him on an actuarial basis.

New South Wales is noworse than it u here. I have seen the same sort of thing in this Parliament. ing that New South Wales was singular in that respect, but knowing that the honourable member had been a Minister and a member of the State Parliament of New South Walesf o r many years, I thought he would naturally know more of New South Wales politics than I do, just as I know more of Victorian politics than he does. just as questionable are done in this Parliament as have been done in the Parliament of New South Wales. sorry to have to agree with the honourable member. I know the intrigues that took place in the Victorian Parliament whenever there was a likelihood of a Ministry being defeated. Men who had the support of the daily press could always command a position in the Cabinet. I hope that some day this Parliament, in its wisdom, w ill elect its Ministers. I haye been an advocate of elective Ministries ever since I entered Parliament, but I hope that such Ministries w ill be controlled by the power of the initiative, the referendum, and the recall, and then only w ill that suspicion of bribery and corruption which is rampant outside be removed. that the wage of £ 1 2 per week ought to be sufficient for both member and M in ister, and the only additional reward of Ministers should be the honour of representing the people in the Cabinet. That should be sufficient to induce men to offer their services as Ministers, for the benefit of their country. -The Government having introduced this measure, the responsibility for it should be upon their shoulders, and unless the House has very good reason for opposing it , the B ill should be supported. intend to vote for the second reading of the B ill . The debate, so far, has illustrated the misfortune which Australia suffers at the present time through having an active and strong Opposition of a party character. If this measure were being considered in England, or in any other part of the Empire, or in any allied country, there would be no debate of this character, because in all those other countries there is a Government representative of all sections in politics, and commanding the united support of ParI was not suggestliament and the country. It would be recognised that it is essential for the proper conduct of the war, and the efficient government of the country, to have an extension of M i nisterial responsibility. That development has taken place in England. Can any lionorable member say what is the strength of the Imperial Cabinet to-day? It must be nearly double the size of the original Cabinet. Since the war, there I think that things have been created Ministries of Munitions and Pood, and other additions to the Cabinet have been made. The Government thought those increases necessary, I am a little bit and the House supported them without question. The salaries attaching to the new portfolios may not be as high as those received by the members of the original Cabinet, whose emoluments in some instances amount ""to £5,000 per annum. Australia suffers every week and every month by reason of the continuance of party warfare. There should be no wrangle over a measure of this character. In these times, the only opposition should be of a constructive character-no t of a destructive k in d ; not for the purpose of delaying the business of the country, and, not for the purpose of harassing those who are responsible for its government. I repeat again I have never been strongly in favour of the practice of appointing HonoraryM in isters. A member sliould be eitlier a Minister of State or a private member. If the efficient carrying on of the Government necessitates the creation of a new portfolio, it should be straightforwardly created, and a salary should be openly attached to it . Honourable members on the Opposition say to us, "" Why do you not d o ' t h a t ?"" What would be the result if the Government did make such a proposal ? They would provide an excellent opportunity for the Opposition to block the B ill °for a week, and to I wander all over the country talking about extravagance and waste of public money.

325,Mr Archibald (Hindmarsh) [8.5].,"portfolios should be created. Australia is not so poor as to be unable to pay for the efficient government of the country. My experience has been that cheap labour is bad labour; I do not care whether it be the labour of a Minister of the Crown, or of a working man. Cheap labour is dear, because it is not worth even the price that is paid for it . Therefore, I have always advocated that a man should be paid according to the competition for the services lie is able to render. salary is paid a bank manager, or an in surance manager, or the head of a mercantile business ? The standard fixed by those concerns represents the salary that should attach to one of the most responsible positions in the country, that of a Minister of the Crown. I think the Government have been making a tactical mistake. The Opposition have no responsibility for the war, but that does not absolve us on this side from feeling our responsibility. rather than face the turmoil of party conflict, prefer to create honorary positions, and pay the additional Ministers out of the Ministerial pool. Ministers are not getting more than half the salary that we pay the. manager of the Commonwealth Bank. to the manager of the Commonwealth Bank is high, because the Government, when making that appointment, had to go into the market and secure the best man. That man was eutitled to certain pensions and privileges in his then employment. The Government had to make it worth his while to enter another service. The world is not conducted on benevolent lines; and, having regard to the high position which Mr Miller occupied in the bank in which he was formerly employed, tlie salary that is paid to him by the Commonwealth is not extraordinary. Let us consider what has been tlie practice of the Imperial Cabinet for the last twenty or thirty years. I can recollect tliat in my youth the Imperial Cabinet numbered eleven, and was extended to thirteen only on one occasion, about fifty years ago. A t that time, there was a feeling among leading statesmen on both sides of the House of Commons tliat big Cabinets were undesirable. The Government have overcome that objection. To-day there is an inner Cabinet of four or five men, and practically the whole responsibility for the government of the country is on their shoulders. Very seldom is a meeting of the complete Cabinet called. Our Cabinet system of government has grown up according to the requirements and exigencies of Australian political life, and that fact makes our Constitution, in my opinion, one of the best in the world, because the unwritten portions' of it are probably better than What those portions wbich are laid down in black and white. If there is a Cabinet of fifteen or sixteen members, circumstances will force the creation of an inner Cabinet. In fact, I should not be surprised to hear that tbere is an inner Cabineti n connection ""with the Commonwealth Government; and I am inclined fco think that fchere was an inner group in the earlier Australian Gabiuets that largely controlled the Government at that But the Government, time. The Government are responsible for t h e ' B ill that is before us. Thev are of opinion that this amendment should he passed, and, placing the responsibility on them, I propose to cheerfully support the measure. W ill any one say that the tion was unnecessary? I have no desire to reflect on any one, for we know that yeoman service in the cause of repatriaT h e salary paid tion was rendered throughout the country by many voluntary workers, but there can be no doubt that since the work has been placed under the control of a responsible Minister there has been an immense i m provement. Then, again, take the one hundred and one questions with which the Government have been called upon to deal since the outbreak of war. We are now largely governed by war.regulations, and, while the war lasts, must continue to be so governed. Price fixing, for instance, is a most important matter, and cannot be completely dealt with by any one Government. The Honorary Minister( Mr. Greene), who is in charge of it , seems to have a good grip of the question, and is doing his best. Some say that price fixing w ill not last, but I am sure that it has come to stay. We have to build on a sound, scientific basis, and we ought to display a little more charity in our criticism of Ministers and officers who have to deal witb such questions. P r i o r to the appointment of the additional Honorary Ministers, two-thirds of the time of the Prime Minister was taken up",55,Appropria Sidered But Not A Word Was Said About

327,Mr Archibald,"iii dealing with large and extraordinary questions which arose as the result of the wa r. By means of regulations under the War Precautions Act we have done much in the way of organization, but after the war is over we shall return to the glorious days of disorganization and the sovereign rights of the States. When that day conies we s'hall probably regret that we have not the opportunity that we enjoy to-day to deal by regulation with many questions of great public importance. Honourable. members opposite may take a different view, but Ave shall probably pine for regulations of the kind in force to-day. At present, by means of war regulations, we can clo much in the way of the organization of industry. The future of Australia depends, not on disorganization of the kind that prevailed prior to the war, but upon the complete organization of the whole country so as to secure the proper development of its resources. It will be a sorry day for Australia when the people fail to appreciate that fact, but I have faith enough in them to believe that they will always be equal to the occasion. We are told that the war regulations have deprived many people of their liberty ancl their freedom. I have never felt them irksome. opposite .and their supporters have every freedom. is not freedom, but unlimited licence, to say and do what you please. When.

I have'only to say, in conclusion, that since the Government tell us that this Bill is necessary in the interests of the country, I throw upon them the responsibility fbr it. and intend to support it. I have considerable doubt as to the wisdom of inserting in section 19 of the principal Act the words "" or member of the Executive Council,"" as proposed in clause 2 of this Bill. I understand that the Governor General and the Ministry of the day constitute ' the Executive Council. presides over the Council. part in its deliberations ? Some time ago certain, proposed regulations relating to the voting at the first conscription referendum were approved at a meeting of the .Executive Council, consisting of the Governor General, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), and the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Jensen). May I ask what objection there is to the insertion of the words "" or Assistant Minister instead of' "" or member of the Executive Council,"" as proposed in this Bill? terms of the Constitution. ex-Ministers are also members of the Executive Council. to it while a Government: is in office.. that if we amend the principal Act, as proposed by this Bill, it is quite possible that an ex-Minister will beable to act on behalf of a Minister as a member of the Executive Council. accordance with the constitutional practice of the Commonwealth. in days when constitutional, procedure is not always strictly adhered to. We know that the meaning of certain Acts was strained in order to get certain men into camp when it was thought the people are would vote for conscription. Whilei t may not be the intention of the present Ministry to avail themselves of this amendment of the principal Act in the direction I have indicated, Ave do not know what a future Ministry might do, and I want to be sure that we shall not give to ex-Ministers a power which they should not possess.

The statement which I had the honour to 'make in Committee, when the Governor[9.1] General's message was before us, was deemed by some honourable members sufficient for general purposes. I explained so far as I was able what loan expenditure we had incurred,and what authority for raising money we had from Parliament. But the ex-Treasurer ( Mr Higgs) suggested that I might, at some stage before the Bill disappeared, give a fuller explanation of the indebtedness of the Commonwealth and of the States; and, without overburdening honourable members with information, I desire to give some figures showing the public indebtedness in some cases up to the 30th April this year. I shall deal first of all with the figures relating to the Commonwealth, and then, in general terms, with the figures relating to the indebtedness of the States; and I shall be glad of the attention of the honourable inember for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), because he is, perhaps, more especially interested than any other member of the Opposition. cial year ?

Andrew Fisher, when Treasurer. T myself then directed attention to a misunderstanding which might easily arise owing to the fact that the Commonwealth had raised £18,000,000 for war purposes in London, and almost simultaneously had lent the same amount of the note issue to the States: but on due consideration, and after inquiry, I was convinced that tbe British Government understood the whole transaction. The only danger was that the British Government might be misinformed and mistaken as to its nature, and I am now satisfied as to that. States are there loans for silos? mised to all States that desired it . but as to how many have taken it up for actual silo construction. I cannot say, further than that New South Wales and Victoria are going on with the work. As to South Australia and Western Australia, I am not in a position to inform honourable members. on. toria is that when the money hypothecated by the Commonwealth is required, it will be available. That represents for silo construction £2,850,000 by the end of the next financial year. for land settlement a loan to the States? nexion with land settlement for repatriation purposes will be loaned to the States. The money advanced for silo construction also is loaned, but the arrangements made at the Repatriation Conference, in which the Governments of the States concurred, was that the Commonwealth, when it advances money for the settlement of soldiers on the land, shall treat it as a loan to the States, and -the Statesi n t u r n shall lend it to tbe soldier settler. ir..oney to be repaid by the States? into which I need not go at tbe present time. that any of us will be here when 'the States commence to repay the money ? think on that question, but am going straight ahead. pare with the large sums mentioned at the Repatriation Conference?

We are dealing now with the provision for the first three financial years-.£20,00 0 for the first year, £100,000 for the second year, and £2,000,000 for the third year.

Where Crown lands are applied by j h e States to this purpose, they do not pay for the l a n d ; they merely allocate it for soldier O u r commitment to Vicsettlement .purposes. I u addition to the requirements for ordinary . war purposes, consideration must be paid to the Commonwealth commitments in connection with ship construction, as well as advances to the States, for the erection of silos, and for repatriation. In 1916-17, £2,302,477 was provided for the purchase and conA l l advances in construction of ships. During tbe current year, it is expected that £788,000 will be expended, and t h a t, in the financial year 1918-19, tbe sum of £2,657,000 will be expended. The Commonwealth is committed to advance altogether to the States for silo construction £2,850,000 .

419,Mr Watt,"No ; for improvementswill probably have to be provided in the financial year 1918-19. The settlement of. returned soldiers on the land has been undertaken by the States, who will provide the land while the Commonwealth will make loans to the States to provide for advances to soldiers to cover stock, seed, plant, and implements as well as fixed improvements. It is estimated that, at the 30th June next, only £120,000 will have been advanced to the States, but it is expected that at least £2,000,000 will be required, to cover this expenditure in the following year 1918-19. The repatriation activities for which the Commonwealth is directly responsible, as distinct from the land settlement in regard to which the Commonwealtli operates in conjunction with the States, cover the erection, maintenance, and conduct of homes, sanatoria, hospitals, workshops, Sec-., the payment of sustenance allowances, vocational training, transportation, and advances by way of loan for the purchase of approved businesses, plant, and stock. It is impossible to forecast the extent of the Commonwealth's commitments in this direction, but"" it is certain that a very large amount will be involved. A grant of £250,000 was made for this purpose in 1915-16, and the expenditure for the current year will be about £200,000. A further amount of £1,500,000, if not more, will probably be required to meet this expenditure for 1918-19. The repatriation expenditure for which a net indebtedness df £609,612,933 as at the Commonwealth is directly responsible the 30th June last in the case of the will be paid from revenue, and the ad States, and at the 30th A p r i l, 1918, in vancesto the' States for settling returned the case of the Commonwealth. soldiers on the land will be provided from the War Loan Fund.

Both authorities have to be financed by the one set of taxpayers, and tbe credit of the same people is pledged when either the Commonwealth or the States operate. The public debts of the States were estimated by the Commonwealth Treasury to be as follows on the 30th' June last£ New South Wales .. .. 138,138,347 Victoria 80,213,336 Queensland 61,825,013 South Australia .. 30,616,280 Western Australia .. 40,947,297 Tasmania. . .. 14,672,714 Total .. .. .. £375,412,987 Of that total, £245,461,621 is owing to the British lender, and £129,951,366 to the Australian lender. I should like honourable members to keep those figures and in mind, because I think they have altered substantially during the last decade. A t one time the State indebtedness, though much smaller, was relatively larger to the British lenders, and smaller to the Australian lenders. Adding the £246,199',946,. which the' Commonwealth owes, to the £375,412,987, which the States owe, we have an. apparent national debt of £621,6.12,933. But a close examination of the figures will show that the moneys which the Commonwealth borrowed for the States in London appear in both sets of figures.

If we add the in terest bill of the Commonwealth to that of the States, the grand total to-day on the figures I have stated, is £25,062,383 per annum. As the Commonwealth interest bill includes £650,000 which is repayable by the States, the net interest bill of the Commonwealth and States may be set down as £24,412,383. It would, of course, be unfair if I were to allow the public to assume these figures represented the national interest bill no assets. Honourable members, probably, will make their own discriminating selection of the facts bearing upon the matter; but Australia does well to recognise, and will do well to tell her lenders, that, i u the ordinary European sense of the word, the whole of this amount is not a national debt. £375,412,987 which the States owed to tlieir lenders on 30th June last, there are very substantial .assets, reproductive and interest-bearing. It might be safely said that, in good and bad seasons alike, considerably over £300,000,000 of that amount will pay its own interest bill and provide its own sinking fund . The balance, namely, that which must lie met by taxation, is the true national debt of Australia in the sense in which the It represents the actual arrears, is not included, and is not regarded as a bonded debt. As a matter of fact, we are paying it off. In introducing the Governor General's message, I It would confuse informed honourable members that, on behalf of the Government, I had taken the responsibility of assuring the British Exchequer that henceforth Australia would promptly meet its indebtedness in that respect; and apparently the British Exchequer is satisfied with that assurance. The following table shows the annual interest charge on the public debts of the States at 30th June, 1917: 1917. New South Queensland. South Western Tasmania. Total. Victoria. Australia.

It is but fair to the States to make that acknowledgment. The bulk of their raisings has gone into vast public undertakings, which are more or less reproductive, and to the extent to which they meet interest charges and cost of raising and conversion, they must be omitted from any comparison of the national debts of the nations. that One of the most important features of the study of these figures is as to what for which there are lies ahead of the States in the way of conversion operations during the next ten years. None of us would venture to predict when hostilities will cease, or what the money market of Great Britain and Europe will be in the period that imme' diately supervenes. Honourable members will find the financial judgment of the For instance, as against tbe Old Country as far asunder as the poles in regard to the question of whether in terest is to be low or high, and as to whether inoney and credit is to be plentif u l or contracting.

I am not a lawyer, and I do not pretend to know whether a parent is or is not responsible for the acts of his children who have not reached the age of twenty-one years; but I understand that youths until they are twenty-one years of age are regarded by the law as infants. Seeing that parents are responsible for the actions of their children who have not attained the age of twenty-one years, it is a wrong principle for the Government to say to these youths, "" Defy your parents, although you have just turned the age of eighteen",68,Public Debt Of The States At 30th June

We all know that there have been cases of bovs who have been taken out of camp because they had enlisted without their parents' consent, and who have re-enlisted underother names. Others have forged their parents' consent. One boy walked to Ballarat and adopted a father up there. Having ascertained the name of the person livin g in a certain house, he enlisted, stating that his father lived at such and such a number in such and such a street, and on being told to bring back his father's signed consent, he returned with a document bearing the alleged signature of the person whom he represented to be his father. He was accepted, and embarked before he was seventeen and a half years of age. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) said to-night thatr the Goverument are giving a new reading to one of the Commandments. Instead of "" Honour, thy father and thy mother,"" the Government say, "" D e f y thy father and thy mother, and volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force."" I stand for voluntary recruiting, I will not stand for that form of it . bitterly opposed to it . One of the strongest speeches ever made in this chamber was that made by the former member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine), when he denounced the Government for accepting the servioes of any youth, and urged that the responsibility of fighting should be thrown on men and not youths. He said that the Government should allowno person to go to the Front who'had not reached the age of twenty-one years. That speech was made soon after the outbreak of war, and had no connection with any conscription proposal. A t another time the honourable member for Nepean( Mr Orchard), who is now the Minister in charge of recruiting, made a strong speech condemnatory of the enlistment of minors. The public conscience has been shocked by the action of the Government in this respect, and I hope that the House will by no uncertain voice let the Government know what they think about it . If the matter had been made the subject of a no-confidence motion, honourable members could have taken shelter behind party requirements, and said, "" We cannot vote for this because it will mean dis 7 A nephew of mine placing the Government, and we will do anything on earth to prevent the Opposition from going over to the Ministerial side of the Chamber."" My amendment is not one of no-confidence in the Government. It will merely give to the House an opportunity to express its opinion upon the action of Ministers. One feature of Australian life is the lack of parental control over youths. When the Defence Department were bringing the compulsory provisions of the"" defence scheme into force, the greatest trouble lay with youths of seventeen years upwards who had practically got out of their parents' control after leaving the discipline of the schools. Boys of fourteen years of age, who had just lef t school could be easily disciplined. It was more difficult to deal with boys over fifteen years of age, and still more difficult to deal with those wbo were sixteen years of age, but any area officer will admit that his greatest trouble was with boys who were seventeen years of age, and they caused the trouble with the younger cadets. The action taken by the Government, if it is persevered in , will be something which Althoughi t will be almost impossible to undo. Therefore, I urge them to reconsider their I am decision, and to admit that they have made a deplorable blunder in encouraging youths to defy their parents and volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force. amendment is not in order, as it is irrelevant to the issue presented in tbe B ill , which is an authority for the raising of £80,000,000 as a war loan.

The honourable gentleman's combativeness and belligerency are so well known that I hardly think he will shirk responsibility for the action that has been taken by the Minister for Defence, and of which the Government have approved.

As to the £30,000,000 that I have mentioned, that obligation could be met now only by raising a loan, or by some funding arrangement with the British Government. The Treasurer said nothing about raising money to enable this amount to be refunded to the Imperial Government. I regret that in reviewing the state of our finances the lionorable gentleman did not give the slightest indication of his proposals for meeting our increasing obligations. Our obligations are growing, our interest bill is growing, and our administrative expenditure is growing because of the establishment of new Departments, pensions are increasing, and there is in creasing repatriation expenditure. Treasurer cial obligations in respect of repatriation, outside land settlement, would be met by direct taxation. That will cover at least 90 per cent, of the expenditure on returned soldiers who require assistance, and affords us a basis of calculation. So far as it is a definite statement in regard to the meeting of our obligations, I welcome it . In every branch of administration our expenditure is increasing. Our interest bill is increasing, our pensions bill is increasing, our repatriation expenditure is increasing, and money is being spent on shipbuilding, tbe Science ancl Industry Department, and on other new Departments, so that our indebtedness is getting bigger by leaps and bounds. We are spending money at a prodigal rate, and it will be impossible for the taxpayers to meet the cost of the conversion of over £600,000,000 of national debt if the present rate of expenditure is maintained. deal with that matter in his Budget speech. authorizes the raising of £80,000,000 for war purposes, is part of the financial scheme of the Government, and I hoped that we sbould have from the Treasurer some outline of the Government's financial policy, including taxation and economy in administration; that we should have been told how the ledger was to be squared. We cannot continue to ' meet our increasing debts every half year by raising a fresh £40,000,000 loan. In the midst of prosperity, wliether artificial or otherwise, 'the: time has arrived when we must, tap some of the money as it flows along the stream. This ought to be done before the money gets into fresh investments, and we should at once boldly give the people an indication how much wil l be required i u taxation to meet the needs of the country. This Chamber has not yet set itself the task of facing the financial 2>osition, but I hope that before these sittings close the Governmeut will give some vivid forecast to the taxpayers of what they will have to face. It is no use allowing the present prodigal standard of Jiving to continue ih every city of the Commonwealth, while meeting all our needs by loan. I emphasize here, and shall continue to do so, the opinion that The we are ou a finaucial "" d r u n k , "" and told us that our finanmeeting the bill with IOTJ's. This cannot continue, and we must make a start in paying our way more in spot cash. We will find, shortly, unless something is done, that a great proportion of the money so urgently needed for the development of industries has gone beyond our reach with this huge national borrowing system. WereI sitting in opposition I would never stop talking until a finaucial policy was forthcoming under which Australia would pay her way as she goes. I wish to express my pleasure at seeing the Minister for Recruiting ( Mr. Orchard) present, and I hope he will give close attention to this debate. I congratulate the honourable gentleman on the energy he is displaying, and on the new methods so successfully adopted. I heartily wish he may continue as he has commenced in his very courageous efforts to promote recruiting.

483,Mr Tudob,Some of them think they selves the responsibility for their own,74,Public Debt Of The States At 30th June
484,Mr Pinlayson,"course of Australian history. The action of the Government simply means that the home influence is to be destroyed, and whether the Government mean it or not, the natural effect of their policy will be to practically deprive parents of control over their boys. And if boys are able to do what they like in this respect without reference to their parents, it is only a matter of time when the girls, claiming equal rights and privileges, will also refuse to recognise the authority of father and mother. That would be a tremendously unfortunate development. May I revert to the matter of physical fitness. I previously remarked that it is recognised that boys under twenty-one are not considered sufficiently developed physically to stand the rigours of a military campaign. What has happened within the last few weeks to give the"" Government the idea that boys under twenty-one are physically fit? Has the removal of parental control suddenly enabled tbese boys to become physically fit? Some are fit, but they are in small proportion to the number who are not. officer, viewing these boys for the first time, and seeing them in the f u l l flush of their manhood, would naturally be inclined to say that they were all right, but the medical officer who has merely seen the boys for a short time, and can only form an opinion on expert medical examination, is not so likely to know the real constitutional strength or weakness of the lads as are their parents, who have studied them from birth, and know exactly their natures and predispositions to this, that, and the other thing. ment say that the medical officer is more able to decide the physical fitness of a boy than are his parents. Obviously, the Government are anticipating that, by some magical process, the mere removal of parental responsibility, the dispensing with the parents' acquiescence in their boy's enlistment, will suddenly make a number of them physically fit for military service. That is ridiculous. are not many boys who have such physical fitness as would make them capable of standing for any lengthy period the rigours and hardships of the present campaign in Europe, and I do not think that the Government should set themselves up as an interfering authority between the boys and their parents, and take up the position that they know better than tlie parents whether the lads are fit to go tp the Front or not. There is another aspect of this matter. When the B ill for the first referendum regarding compulsory military service was before the House, and also in .connection with the second referendum, arrangements were made for the soldiers to , vote, and the franchise was extended to every soldier who was over twenty-one years .of age, whether or not his name appeared on the electoral roll. On the first occasion I moved an amendment to remove that age limitation which the Government were placing upon the soldiers, and I urged then, and later, that the mere fact of men having been accepted for military service should be the sine qua non for eligibility for the f u l l privilege of citizenship. But the Government declined to give the vote to men under twenty-one years of age. That is a state of affairs I cannot tolerate, and I hope that When the amending Electoral B ill which the Government propose to bring forward is before the House they w ill accept the reasonable proposition that if A medical eighteen years of age .is to be .accepted as the .age for military service, it should be accepted also as the age for citizen service. If men are physically f it to serve their country m i l it a r i ly at eighteen years of age, they are much more likely to be mentally fit to perform their duties, as citizens. last referendum the soldiers exercised their vote irrespective of age. Yet the Governrefused to give the vote to soldiers under twenty-one years of age, but they propose now to give them the right, not only to undertake military service, but also to defy their parents in that regard. They accept the principle that these boys are sufficiently mentally developed to judge for themselves in regard to military service, but they refuse to admit that, they There are sufficiently mentally developed to discharge their citizen duty. That is such -an anomalous position that one wonders how sane men, such as Ministers are supposed to be, do not realize that the present policy cuts right across the previous attitude of the Government in regard to boys under twenty-one years of age. Many boys who have gone to the Front, especially those who left homes in which there were brothers, went on tbe distinct understanding and arrangement",74,Public Debt Of The States At 30th June

In all probability the aviation that will be required after the war will be mainly for intelligence purposes or for naval purposes, but whether it be for intelligence purposes along our coast, or for naval purposes in connection with our Fleet, undoubtedly the only sort of plane we can use will be one which will be capable of alighting on the water.

513,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [11.5],"Acthe topography of the eastern coast of Australia, they will realize that it is quite impossible to use) land planes for coastal patrol, as they could be used elsewhere, where green fields take the place of the rocks and bushes that are the main characteristics of our Australian coast line. I therefore suggest to the Government that they should consider this matter as a' whole, and give some earnest thought to what is likely to be required after the war is over, and to use every effort now to get a knowledge of what we will want "" when that time is reached. Wc have m i l i tary fliers returning to Australia in considerable numbers, and an effort should be made to see what is required to give these men the additional information necessary to make them valuable for coastal reconnaissance purposes, and to keep their enthusiasm alive. A t present, I am afraid very little is being done with that object. Colonel Reynolds, who is coming back to take charge of the whole thing, however excellent and deserving an officer he may be generally in defence administration, has not bad any flying experience. He had no flying experience before he l e f t Australia,' and I think he wa* too old under the English and Austral/an flying conditions to get that experience on active service. Every inducement and every encouragement should be given to our own flying men, who are returning from active service, and I hope an effort will be made to enrol them in the big organization which I believe the future will require Australia to undertake. I am sorry to have to t r y the patience of honourable members, but I want to refer to a matter that affects a great number of people in my electorate. I have asked the Minister representing the M in ister for Defence to have certain alterations made respecting the working conditions at the Small Arms Factory, and I was given the assurance that the matter would be gone into, but, so far, nothing has been done. where in the vicinity of 600 men unemployed, some of who are practically in a state of starvation. I have pointed out before in this House that a system of victimization has been in operation at the Small Arms Faotory, and I have particulars of about twenty specific cases. I regret that time w ill not permit me now to read them all, but in order to give honourable members some idea of what is being done, and in the hope that the Minister representing the Minister for Defence w ill take immediate steps to have victimized men reinstated, I shall read particulars of one case, though I do not care to give the . man's'name. The following are the particulars :Dear Sir, Re the matter I mentioned to you on Saturday night about black-listing. You have all the facts of my case. They were sent along to you laBt week by Mr Webster. This has taken place since then:I went down to the ironworks to look for a job on Tuesday, 14th, 1 asked one of the foremen for work. He told me he could give me a dozen jobs, but my name had been sent alone from the factory with word to the effect that if I came down for a job I was not to be started. This man held a clean record at the Small Arms Factory, and he furnished me with copies of two .testimonials, the first of which is as follows:Small Arms Factory,' Lithgow, 14th April, 1918. I'o Whomi t may concern, This is to certify that the bearer . . . . has been employed between 20th May, 1912, and 14th April, 1916, in this factory, as a . turret lathe operator, and during that period his character and conduct have been good, and he IB a good workman.
