Response to the schedule tabled by the Speaker of the House of Representatives on 23 June 2005”. 1 The date of tabling is the date the report was presented to the House of Representatives. In the case of joint committees, the date shown is the date of first presentation to either the House or the Senate. Reports published when the House (or Houses) are not sitting are tabled at a later date. 2 If the source for the date is not the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives or the Journals of the Senate, the source is shown in an endnote. 3 The time specified is three months from the date of tabling. 4 The government expects to consider broader reforms to the Act including land tenure proposals and to introduce amendments to the Act into the Parliament. 5 The government response to the report is well advanced with input from relevant agencies being received. 6 Outstanding issues arising from the interim report will be covered in the response to the final report. 7 A draft is in progress. A response will be tabled in due course. 8 Tabling of the response is expected to occur shortly. 9 The response is currently being considered by the government and is expected to be tabled in the near future. Due to the scope of Committee’s recommendations, extensive consultation across government departments and agencies was required. This process, and the Federal Election in October 2004, delayed government consideration of the response. 10 The response has required significant consultation between Australian government agencies. That process was interrupted by the Federal Election and associated caretaker period. It is expected that the response will be tabled in the near future. 11 Since the release of the report the government has introduced a range of measures that have facilitated the use of wireless technologies to deliver broadband services. These measures include reductions in carrier licence fees, improved information for wireless operators and the launch of the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme (HiBIS). Under HiBIS wireless providers are able to compete with other providers for over $100 mill in incentives to improve access to broadband services in regional areas. Given these developments and that in 2005 the government intends to introduce legislative amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 a response to the Productivity Commission Radiocommunications Inquiry and the Radiocommunications Review, the government does not plan to respond further to the report. 12 The government is continuing to prepare a response to the report, which concerns a broad range of issues. 13 The government is considering its response in light of the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and work of the TransTasman Accounting Standards Advisory Group. 14 The government has responded in part to this report through changes to the Corporations Regulations and public proposals to make further refinements to the regulation of financial services. A combined response to this report and other reports by the Committee on certain financial services regulations taking into account this ongoing policy development will be tabled in due course. 15 The government is considering the recommendations in the context of recent corporate governance law reform and a response will be tabled in due course. 16 The government has responded in part to this report through changes to the Corporations Regulations. A combined response to this report and other reports by the Committee on certain financial services regulations taking into account these policy responses will be tabled in due course. 17 The response is being finalised and is to be tabled as soon as possible. 18 The response is to be combined with that for ‘Money Matters in the Bush’ and will be tabled as soon as possible. 19 On 22 March 2005, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the Hon Chris Pearce MP, announced that the government would address the recommendations of the report in the context of developing an integrated set of proposals to improve the operation of Australia’s insolvency laws. The set of proposals will also include responses to issues raised by the James Hardie Special Commission of Inquiry and recent reports of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee in its reports on voluntary administration, corporate groups and the rehabilitation of large and complex enterprises. The government expects to release proposals for consultation with stakeholders by the end of 2005. 20 The response is being updated and expected to be tabled in due course. 21 The government is giving consideration to the recommendations in this report. Since its release, there have been a number of developments in the policy areas relating to the recommendations, including the announcement by the Treasurer that the Australian government will amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to introduce criminal penalties for serious cartel conduct. The response that takes into account these recent developments will be provided in due course. 22 The response will be tabled as soon as possible. 23 A response has been drafted and will tabled in due course. 24 A response is being finalised and is expected to be tabled shortly. 25 A draft response is currently being considered. 26 The Prime Minister made a statement in-principle in July 2004 responding to the report and included an allocation of $397 million over four years in the 2005-06 Budget to support its response. The formal response is expected to be tabled in the near future. 27 All relevant portfolios have now updated their input and a consolidated response will be finalised as soon as possible. 28 A response to the report’s recommendations have been developed and is currently being cleared with portfolios affected by the recommendations. 29 The response is being prepared and will be finalised as soon as possible. 30 The issues raised in the report coincided with those raised in the development of the Minerals Exploration Action Agenda (MEAA). The MEAA has been incorporated into the government’s Resources Exploration Strategy, which was released on 2 July 2004, and constitutes the government’s response to this report. The Chair of the Committee was advised of this in writing on 23 February 2005 by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. The government does not intend responding further to the report’s recommendations. 31 The government does not propose to respond to this report at this time. 32 The response is in the final stages of clearance and is expected to be tabled soon. 33 The response is expected to be tabled shortly. 34 Preparation of the response is currently underway. 35 The response has been finalised and will be tabled shortly. 36 Consultation on the response for this report is underway. 37 A response is being prepared and will be tabled in due course. 38 A draft response is with portfolio Ministers for comment. 39 It is anticipated that the response will be tabled shortly. 40 The government considers that the current procedures for the opening of the Parliament continue to reflect Australia’s parliamentary traditions and democratic heritage. Accordingly, the government does not propose to seek changes to existing procedures at this time. 41 The government considers that the existing arrangements provide the opportunity for a significant debate on legislation and that they remain appropriate. Accordingly, the government does not support the recommendations of this report. 42 The House adopted sessional orders to implement recommendations of committee on 17 March 2005. 43 The government is considering its outstanding recommendations and a response will be tabled in due course. 44 The response is being considered by the relevant portfolios and will be tabled in due course. 45 The government is currently considering its response to this report. It is expected that a final response will be tabled in 2005. 46 The response is being finalised for tabling. 47 The response will be tabled following completion of Australian Transport Council processes. 48 Consultations with relevant portfolios are still proceeding.

Thursday, 23 June 2005 ----Fiji Fiji’s parliament and took the government and the parliament hostage. At much the same time, hundreds of their associates were ransacking the capital, Suva. This obviously had a devastating impact on Fiji’s economy and society and particularly its tourism industry. The government in Fiji has recently introduced into its parliament a bill with the fine-sounding title of Promotion of Reconciliation, Tolerance and Unity Bill. This bill seeks to redefine the criminal activities of the coup perpetrators, to grant amnesties to perpetrators and to provide relief from prosecution and sentence to some of their political affiliates. Needless to say, this bill has received a strong reaction both in Fiji and internationally, including in Australia. The President of the Australian Law Council recently said that the bill risked putting to an end the rule of law and the hopes of Fijians to live in a democratic country. The Fijian Labour Party has talked about the bill’s insidious motives that appear to enable perpetrators of the coup to seek amnesty on the basis that political crimes should not be seen as criminal activity. The American ambassador to Fiji has made his government’s views plain by saying the bill is a risk to investment. New Zealand’s foreign minister said: The last thing New Zealand would want to see is any message given that would encourage some group of armed men ... to repeat what has already happened twice in Fiji. Against that background, it is particularly disappointing that the Australian government’s response so far has been resounding silence. There was further serious news from Fiji just yesterday. There are reports that the government has asked the President of Fiji to suspend the commander of Fiji’s armed forces for making public comments opposing the government’s Promotion of Reconciliation, Tolerance and Unity Bill. Australia has very substantial stakes in the stability of Fiji and in ensuring that the rule of law and democracy prevails. But what have we seen of the government’s fine rhetoric on these sorts of matters, as applied in the Pacific and elsewhere? We have seen resounding silence. That is simply not good enough. We are not in the business of interfering in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries; however, this issue does raise crucial points in the international community and substantial sections of the Fijian community, who are deeply concerned. It seems to me to be crucially important at this critical stage that the Australian government makes its commitment to the rule of law and democracy in Fiji and support for that very explicit and, in serious discussions with the Fijian administration, seeks some way forward in this matter. Drug Action Week am)-I rise today in acknowledgment of Drug Action Week and to pay my tribute to the many selfless and dedicated men and women who work to assist drug and alcohol users in my community to find a more productive, positive and engaging pathway for their lives.

283,Mr Billson (Dunkley,"Parliamentary Secretary (Foreign Affairs and Trade)) (9.33was funded by the Howard government to do stocktake of the kinds of services and support that are available to people requiring assistance with their drug and alcohol use in our region. It revealed some very interesting findings. First of all, it revealed that there was a very strong recognition and appreciation of the quality and the dedication of the men and women working in the services that already exist. Given this week is Drug Action Week, I would like to draw that to the attention of the House. An important recommendation, one that I have been almost evangelically pursuing since I was elected, was the crying need for additional residential detoxification and rehabilitation services. It seems odd, and it strikes me as a great hardship, that there are almost twice as many residential detoxification and rehabilitation beds in New South Wales than there are in the state of Victoria. Quite frankly, getting help when you need it should not be like winning lotto. What we all know and understand is that, when an individual makes the personal and emotional commitment to find a more positive and constructive pathway for their life, to get opportunities back within their reach and to correct some of the errors in terms of missed potential that drugs and alcohol use may have provided, we should be ready to provide that assistance at the time when it is being sought, when the person in need of help is looking for and seeking a partner-someone who can support them at this difficult time to find that more constructive and positive pathway for their life. The report recommends that there is a need to pursue this service and these facilities in the Greater Frankston-Mornington Peninsula region. There is a need to make sure that families are more properly supported. That leads nicely into a recent announcement I was able to make that Odyssey House Victoria has received some additional funding from the federal government to make sure that families that have a drug or alcohol issue that puts pressure on children are getting support so the children do not become the secondary victims of this insidious disease of excessive drug and alcohol use. I commend Odyssey House for their work and hope that we can partner to have a short-term stay program in the region that I represent that can segue into Odyssey House’s existing programs so that support, services, expertise, encouragement and, particularly, opportunity are available to people suffering from drug and alcohol conditions to make a better choice about their lives and so that we are there as partners to support them and their families at that difficult and challenging time. Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd my electorate, Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd, along with their employees and their trade union, the AMWU, on the impressive stance they have taken on skills enhancement. In June last year the company reached an agreement with the AMWU to improve productivity and terms and conditions of employment. The parties identified key performance indicators that were necessary to advance the interests of the business, including securing lucrative export markets. The parties recognised that, to achieve those performance indicators, it was necessary to have a highly skilled and highly trained work force. To improve quality and productivity as well as job satisfaction, Darrell Lea and the AMWU recognised that training could achieve a situation where workers were not only skilled in their immediate tasks and responsibilities but also achieved a broader understanding of the whole production process. Through conducting a skills audit it was quickly realised that employees MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Statements By Members
284,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (9.36 Am),"I rise today to congratulate a local company inwho perhaps in the past had been regarded as untrained were actually highly skilled in particular areas. The task of identifying performance indicators and focusing on the broader development of both individual skills and skills across the workplace was achieved through leadership from both the employer and the union. On8 June this year I had great pleasure in presenting 130 employees of Darrell Lea with their certificate I in Food Processing. All the employees, many from non-English-speaking backgrounds, were deservedly immensely proud of their achievement. I would like to publicly recognise the work of the Chief Executive Officer of Darrell Lea, John Tolmie; the Human Resources Manager, Tom Hearn; and the encouragement provided to them by the Lea family, including Michael Lea and Jason Lea. I would also like to congratulate Bruce O’Keefe, an organiser with the AMWU, and Michelle Burgess, the Secretary of the Food and Confectionery Division of the AMWU. This local success story demonstrates what can be achieved through a cooperative approach to industrial relations focusing on skills enhancement, which is so vitally important not only to individual enterprises but to our nation as a whole. Television: Channel 10 Whaling Ms GAMBARO (Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (9.38 am)-I rise today to speak on two issues that are greatly troubling people in my electorate of Petrie. The first is a decision by Channel 10 to broadcast Big Brother, which is nothing more than the thin edge of the wedge in the race to televise pornography on free-to-air television in Australia. I join with others to call for Australia-wide boycotts of products that are advertised within this degrading and decadent rubbish that is being portrayed so prominently to younger members of our community as the normal way of life. I realise that Channel 10 may be struggling in the ratings-and I saw on last night’s news that their share price took a bit of a diveand they see this as a way of trying to compete with cable TV, which is making life difficult for the seemingly undertalented and grossly overrated program producers at the Ten Network. But I will no longer sit back and watch our young people have their morals compromised by this garbage that is served up in the guise of entertainment. It is time to start asking consumers of Australia why they want to support advertisers that are complicit in this degeneration of standards in free-to-air television. Some people will brand me as a wowser, and everything that goes with that, but I am the mother of two teenagers and I will not stand idly by and watch this negative morass of mediocrity attempt to pervade the thinking and moral standards of decent young people in our community. Sadly, the mighty dollar is the only way that people can really make things happen. The second issue I want to address today is that of Japanese whaling for supposedly scientific purposes. In my electorate of Petrie, people are still concerned about the practice and the damage that it is causing to these beautiful endangered species, not to mention the risk to the tourism industry which has developed around the whales’ annual pilgrimage to breed in the warmer waters off the Sunshine Coast. Whale watching is indeed a very valued activity in my area of Petrie. That is why when the issue first arose I began collecting signatures on a petition to the government and people of Japan. The petition is simple and we have even had it translated to save them the trouble when it is delivered. It reads: MAIN COMMITTEE This petition from the citizens of Redcliffe, Australia to the citizens of our sister city of Onoda in Japan, draws attention to the decision by the Japanese Fisheries Agency (JFA) to embark on a new whaling programme in the Southern Ocean this year. We, the undersigned, urge the citizens of Onoda to lobby their Government to end the JFA’s de facto commercial whaling that is carried out under the pretext of scientific research. Enfield Community Food Centre Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (9.41 am)-I rise today to speak on a fantastic organisation in my electorate, the Enfield Community Food Centre, which I had the pleasure of visiting twice earlier this year. The centre sells food and household products at more affordable prices than the average supermarket and is relied on by many people who find it hard to make ends meet. From the humble beginnings of a household refrigerator and a kitchen table, the centre has grown into a low-cost supermarket serving between 500 and 700 families each year. It was established in 1990 by a group of residents from Blair Athol and other inner northern suburbs who were concerned about poverty in the local area. The food centre is staffed by a team of dedicated volunteers. There are about 60 volunteers who contribute around 400 hours per week. They are drawn from churches and the local community and are the backbone of the operation. Chatting with them is always inspiring. They give of themselves so selflessly, and they are always helpful and cheerful. Recently, the centre’s future was in doubt after its rent was substantially increased. I was contacted by the centre manager, Neville Mibus, for assistance. After visiting the centre I wrote to the federal Minister for Family and Community Services and to the South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, requesting assistance for the centre. On3 June 2005 the South Australian state government announced a $68,000 package, including a $63,000 financial injection by the state government, to help ensure the centre’s future. The rescue package will not only give the Enfield Community Food Centre financial assistance but also help in business and financial planning and marketing to ensure its long-term future. Strong representations on the food centre’s behalf had also been made to government by the state member for Enfield, John Rau MP, and Port Adelaide Enfield councillor Joanna McLuskey. I was really pleased to attend a morning tea at the centre earlier this month where the South Australian Minister for Families and Communities, the Hon. Jay Weatherill, presented the assistance package to the management committee and volunteers of the centre. So often people in this House speak of community. However, it is always inspiring to see what it means in a concrete sense. Fifteen years ago residents in the north of my electorate had a vision to make a real difference in their local community. They could see a problem and did something about it. The results speak for themselves. Today, the Enfield Community Food Centre provides low-cost groceries to those most in need: over 500 disadvantaged families and low-income earners whose lives are made easier through the generosity of spirit in their local community. The Enfield Community Food Centre will be celebrating its 15th anniversary at a dinner on 1 July which I will be attending. I would like to take this opportunity to commend each and every member of the team for the valuable contribution that they make each and every day. Fifteen years of service to the community is certainly a wonderful achievement that should be congratulated. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE people dedicated to reducing global poverty. One quarter of the world’s population lives in abject poverty and 28,000 children die every day from preventable causes. RESULTS Australia is part of an international advocacy network of ordinary people working towards the eradication of hunger and poverty. This group is working tirelessly to achieve the following goals: to advocate on behalf of the world’s poorest people, to empower individuals to be agents of change, to raise public awareness of poverty related issues and to build collaborative partnerships for action. RESULTS is an acronym for Responsibility for Ending Starvation Using Lobbying Trimtabbing-which means maximum effect for minimum effort-and Support. On 19 April this year, RESULTS Australia launched their eye-catching bookmark in Belgrave in commemoration of the UN International Year of Microcredit. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I can see that you are impressed with the bookmark. I am glad to see that. The leader of the Hills group based in Belgrave in my electorate of La Trobe, Emmanuelle Emile-Blake, generously hosted microcredit supporters at her home to celebrate this bookmark and enjoy afternoon tea. I was fortunate to be a part of the bookmark launch with the RESULTS team in their efforts to fight global poverty. The RESULTS team are launching a pre-stamped envelope in Sydney on 5 July and I wish them well with that initiative. I congratulate the members of the RESULTS Australia committee: Sue Packham; Ian Sansom; Maree Nutt, who is the National Manager; Mark Rice; Iris Hately; and Emmanuelle Emile-Blake on their dedication to reducing global poverty. This international group advocates initiatives such as microcredit-the use of microloans for the poorest to set up small business ventures-debt forgiveness and the provision of basic health, sanitation and education services. Microcredit provides small collateral free loans for self-employment to very poor people. Microcredit is a critical tool in fighting against poverty. More than 80 per cent of the borrowers are women, who use the income from their small businesses on better nutrition, improved living conditions and better levels of health and education. In 1997 more than 2,900 people from 37 countries attended the Microcredit Summit in Washington DC. The summit launched a nine-year campaign to ensure that 100 million of the world’s poorest families receive credit for self-employment and other financial and business services by 2005. Reaching 100 million of the world’s poorest families, especially women, with microcredit will actually benefit about 500 million people overall.

QantasLink Newcastle Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.47 am)-I rise to lodge my support for all the working people of Newcastle and the Hunter Region and their families as we enter a very uncertain era in industrial relations. This week, 14 QantasLink employees at Newcastle airport have been given notice of retrenchment. Sadly, Qantas’s parent company has tendered out those services. They are customer services like desk ticketing services, the sorts of people that everyone here deals with every day when they are travelling. They already provide an exemplary service and are very committed to their work. They were at first given two weeks notice of their retrenchment. Then they were told that it would perhaps be extended to August. Then, following interventions, Qantas are now saying that it is up to senior management and that senior manMAIN COMMITTEE",219,Statements By Members
285,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (9.44 Am),"TodayI would like to draw your attention to a group ofagement still have to ratify this. Workers in those jobs are particularly uncertain about their future. QantasLink have been an excellent corporate citizen in our region. They have sponsored our football team and taken up services when there has been a clear need for additional services to Sydney by sponsoring Aeropelican and Brindabella Airlines from Canberra. They have been a good corporate citizen. I am very disappointed that they were not the successful tenderer for these jobs-as these 14 workers would have stayed in their positions. The tender has gone to a firm called Skystar. As QantasLink, at least Eastern QantasLink, has the lowest pay rates in Australia, I shudder to think what the workers are going to have to compromise if they transfer over and are taken on by Skystar. It seems to me that Qantas can afford not to make those sorts of decisions. They also have a responsibility to aviation security. If workers are going to be contracted out at the lowest possible price, then there is a real danger that we get the lowest possible service. It means that aviation security culture is not established at any of our airports. I thank QantasLink but I also say to Qantas: ‘Not good enough-you can do better.’ Aviation in our region has just boomed and they are the beneficiaries of it. Of course, this new contract has come with Jetstar’s increased activity in the region. Jetstar had agreed, I thought, to put their maintenance facility at Newcastle airport, with millions of dollars of assistance from the state government. Now we find that that agreement is not signed, sealed and delivered because it depends on a union-free agreement being signed by their loyal workers. We are talking about skilled people who get our jets safely into the air, but apparently a union-free workplace is a condition. The Howard government pretends to be talking about choice-but companies are not talking about choice; companies are talking about control. (Time expired) Whaling the outstanding community support I received last Friday when I joined with the Mayor of the Gold Coast, Councillor Ron Clarke, and Mimi MacPherson to launch an anti-commercialwhaling petition. I have no doubt at all that the large media contingent were there to see Ron Clarke and me more so than they were there to see Mimi MacPherson! Nonetheless, I was pleased that such a strong level of community support was achieved as a consequence of this launch of an antiwhaling petition. I also pay tribute to and thank Wayne Marsh and Angela Delbianco from the Spirit of the Bay whale-watching cruise ship, as well as give special thanks to the staff and team at Sea World Nara Resort. Sea World Nara Resort, of course, play a very crucial role in the ongoing care as well as emergency rescue of distressed and sometimes stranded mammals in our natural marine environment, especially whales and dolphins. There can be no doubt that there has been worldwide concern over the push by Japan, Norway and Iceland to resume commercial whaling. I think special tribute must be paid to Senator the Hon. Ian Campbell, Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who in Ulsan in South Korea this week has certainly done an absolutely outstanding job in delivering the worldwide view that commercial whaling simply cannot be allowed to be resumed. I congratulate Senator Campbell for his efforts over there. I was especially pleased yesterday to note that Australia was able to spearhead a campaign-that is a poor choice of words-to also indicate the ICC’s regret over scientific whaling.

286,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (9.50 Am),"I am very pleased to rise this morning to talk aboutFrom my perspective, it was a pleasure to have had so many Gold Coast residents come on board with the petition that I launched together with Councillor Ron Clarke and to see the high level of community support. That support extended to a campaign by virtually every high school and primary school in my electorate. To those hundreds of students who signed petitions, I pay tribute to them and say thank you. I want them to know that while they were actively working locally I was trying to work nationally as well and had a meeting with the deputy head of mission from the Japanese embassy to express my concerns as well as the concerns of residents in my electorate. There can be no doubt that whale watching is a vibrant, value-added way for the tourism industry to continue going forward. It is such a remarkable shame that there are still some countries that would like to put all of that to one side and resume harpooning whales for the sake of putting whale meat on dinner plates. It is not acceptable. I thank the community for their support and I am very pleased that Australia, together with other conservation-minded countries, was able to achieve such outstanding success in South Korea. Eastlakes U3A Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.53 am)-TodayI would like to put on the record my support for the Eastlakes U3A-University of the Third Age-which celebrated its fifth birthday last week. Eastlakes U3A is run by a very active executive, which includes Tom Ryan, John Schindlair and Nancy Tayler. They are a very dedicated group who have undertaken, with CES, the role of promoting U3A within the eastern part of Lake Macquarie. U3A was established in Toulouse in France in 1972. ‘Third Age’ denotes the age of retirement. U3A was first established in Australia in Melbourne in 1984. Classes are held in the community during the day in places like libraries and other community venues. The teachers and the leaders of the courses are volunteers. They are retired people who have professional skills or people who have had a lifetime hobby which they wish to share with other people. U3A Eastlakes has some 300 members. It is thriving, growing and providing a vitally needed service to all the people of the eastern part of Lake Macquarie. All the administrative work-including enrolments, inquiries, arranging venues, printing programs and publishing a regular newsletter, which is of the highest quality-is done by member volunteers. The members are men and women over the age of 50. There is no age limit in the Eastlakes U3A. There are people in their 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s. I am quite sure that soon they will be joined by people in their 90s. They are a vibrant, vital group who are out there getting their message out to people in the community. U3A Eastlakes offered 28 courses in 2004. Those courses ran between four and 40 weeks. This year they are running more courses than they did last year. The classes are held in easyto-reach venues in Belmont, Swansea, Redhead and Valentine. Their publicity officer is Faye Rothwell. I want to share with members some of the courses that are run at U3A in Eastlake Macquarie. They include current affairs discussion groups, personal history, painting, drawing, sculpture, German language, needlework, crafts, aquarobics, Pilates, Tai Chi, Australian history, ancient Greek history, croquet and tap-dancing. The only limits that are placed on the types of courses are the limits placed on them by the people that are involved. If people have a course they are interested in, U3A can deliver. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Water Reform Green Corps Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage visiting us. Greg Hunt is coming to the Shoalhaven in the Gilmore electorate. We have a concern in common, and it is to do with the Shoalhaven water supply. There is no doubt that New South Wales has a water crisis. No-one could argue with that. Whilst the Shoalhaven is finding solutions to our water problems through innovative projects such as the recycled effluent management scheme in Coonemia, Premier Carr is stealing our water savings and doing nothing to find viable solutions for the city of Sydney. His solution is to use the water saved in the Shoalhaven to make up for his own government’s failure to act on urban water reform and to provide adequate supplies for the people of Sydney. Premier Carr, it is about time you were serious about doing something about urban water reform in Australia’s biggest city. Stealing water from the Shoalhaven is not an acceptable solution in the 21st century. The REMS project at Nowra is a demonstration of what could be a viable solution to Sydney’s water problems if Premier Carr allowed Sydney’s waste water to be recycled and reused for agriculture and industry. The REMS project is an excellent example of how water reforms offer a benefit to industry, agriculture and the environment. The project delivers 1,500 million litres of recycled water to industry and agriculture and takes pressure off potable water sources. Indeed, the Shoalhaven project is a model for the rest of Australia as to how water can be recycled. Each year, Sydney Water dumps 400 billion litres of primary treated sewage off the coast of Manly, Bondi and Malabar and two billion litres of raw treated sewage off the cliffs of Vaucluse. That is an absolute disgrace. Much of this water could be reused along the lines of the REMS water treatment. It would do something about the projected shortfall of 200 billion litres of water a year that is expected to be a feature of life in Sydney in 2030. With Sydney’s dam levels already below 40 per cent, Premier Carr and Minister Sartor must answer this question: how much worse does the situation have to get before they get serious on urban water reform and recycling? WhilstI am on my feet, I want to congratulate the Green Corps that is going to work at Crooked River, in Gerringong and near Kiama. The project will see the Green Corps members working with the region’s dairy farmers to, amongst other things, exclude cattle from 10 kilometres of river frontage. It will also be involved in the oyster industry in the Crookhaven River area. Green Corps is an exceptionally good tool to help improve the Gilmore environment. This project will certainly be an asset to the people in Gilmore. Lake Macquarie City Council Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.59 am)-In the 20 seconds that remain for this debate, I would just like to put on record my horror that Lake Macquarie City Council is considering not notifying residents of developments that are taking place in their near vicinity.

288,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins),"Order! In accordance with the resolutionDebate resumed from 20 June. Second Reading Heritage) (10.00 am)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Statute Law Revision Bill 2005 corrects minor errors in existing acts including spelling, numbering, lettering and punctuation errors. It continues the important exercise of promptly repairing the statute books and improving the accuracy of government and commercial consolidations of acts. Schedule1 amends 24 principal acts and schedule 2 amends misdescriptions in 24 amending acts. The kinds of errors being amended in schedule 1 are minor clerical and drafting errors in various current acts such as incorrect numbering of subsections and typographical errors. Misdescribed errors are ones that either incorrectly describe the text to be amended or specify the wrong location for the insertion of new text. Misdescribed errors are best corrected by amending the amending act, rather than the principal act, and schedule 2 sets out the amendments to the amending acts. None of the amendments proposed by either schedule will make any change to the substance of the law. The bill also updates references to organisations. For example, reference to the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission and the Queensland Crime Commission, which no longer exist, will be replaced with a reference to the Crime and Misconduct Commission of Queenslandthe successor of these two bodies. The bill, while not making any substantive amendments to the law, does improve the quality and public accessibility of Commonwealth legislation. I commend the bill to the House, and I place on record the explanatory memorandum. Revision Bill 2005. I had a private conversation with the member for Flinders earlier, and I must concede that all governments over all periods of time demonstrate errors and that this is not a reflection of incompetence on the part of government. These things happen and, as the parliamentary secretary indicated, there are also reasons to update references to various bodies that have either ceased to exist or changed their names. The rationale for this form of omnibus legislation, where there are so many items riding on one instrument, was described when the first Statute Law Revision Bill was introduced in 1981. The then Fraser government Attorney-General, Senator the Hon. Peter Durack, said: The Government has decided to introduce Statute Law Revision Bills into the Parliament on a regular basis, at least once in each year and, if required, once in each sitting. This will enable the prompt correction of mistakes and errors and removal from the statute book of expired laws. In the absence of the regular passage of Bills of this kind, the correction of an error in an Act can only be achieved by having a special Bill passed for that purpose or waiting until the Act needs to be amended for some other more important purpose. Indeed, in fully supporting the mechanism that was announced by the Hon. Peter Durack, the then senator Gareth Evans stated: MAIN COMMITTEE",225,Results Australia
289,Mr Hunt (Flinders,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and,226,Statute Law Revision Bill 2005
290,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (10.02 Am),"The opposition fully supports the Statute LawThe Statute Law Revision Bill is a fascinating Bill, for the contents of which the Government is to be much congratulated. … … … The first innovation is the very existence of the Bill as a vehicle-a compendious vehicle-for tidying up oversights, errors and oddities that creep into even the best laid drafting plans and also to accommodate minor changes that become necessary because of changing circumstances. The Opposition notes that it is the Government’s intention to introduce housekeeping Bills of this kind at least once each year, and perhaps every sitting. I, for one, certainly applaud that as a rational legislative measure aiding in the avoidance of the unnecessary cluttering of the parliamentary process with what are on any view small issues most of the time. That indicated the bipartisan support for this vehicle that has occurred for over 20 years now. In terms of the mechanisms adopted in this Statute Law Revision Bill, the parliamentary secretary noted the correcting of drafting and clerical mistakes, the removal of references to bodies that have ceased to exist and the updating of references to bodies that have succeeded earlier bodies, to assist in the publication of consolidated versions of acts and obviously to facilitate those consolidated versions being placed on the electronic means of communication that we have now-I think primarily SCALEplus, the government web site, or AustLII, which is run by the Law Council of Australia. It is encouraging in our democracy that, for over 20 years, oppositions of both descriptions have accepted governments on faith in identifying what are minor amendments of an essentially technical nature. That says volumes for their faith not only in our parliamentary system but also in our bureaucracy. At the end of the day, I note there is a safeguard, as this legislation will be the subject of oversight by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. But again, consistent with what has occurred for over 20 years, both sides of the parliament support what is a practical measure of correcting errors and updating legislation. is necessary sometimes to update legislation to correct errors that occur in the drafting of bills. I spoke recently in the main chamber and, I suppose, bemoaned the fact that it was necessary that this should occur. I do know that our Parliamentary Counsel and drafting office are of a very high standard, and I do not really understand why on so many occasions it is necessary for the parliament to bring in omnibus bills to change legislation to correct errors which, when one looks at them, one feels ought not to have been made in the first place. I suppose, though, that parliament is becoming more active. There is an ever-increasing amount of legislation passing through the House, and it is understandable, given human error, that the odd typo, spelling mistake, punctuation oversight or omission can find its way into the final version of the bills that become part of the law of Australia. I think the technical terminology for the cause of these minor mishaps is that there are gremlins in the system. However, gremlins or no gremlins, mistakes must be corrected not only to reduce any possible confusion with the implementation of the laws but also for the sake of the English language. The fixing up of these unintentional errors is the function of the Statute Law Revision Bill 2005. When one looks at the bill, particularly its contents page, it is interesting to note that it includes a list entitled ‘Amendment of Principal Acts’, which features some 24 acts that have fallen victim to gremlins. Below that list, however, is another list, which is entitled ‘AmendMAIN COMMITTEE",226,Statute Law Revision Bill 2005

Few ministries have escaped this phenomenon; errors have been discovered in many acts. But one of the functions of the parliament is to make sure that what we have ultimately is correct. The price of making sure that we have that level of correctness is the passage of the Statute Law Revision Bill 2005, and that is certainly a very important initiative forward. The staff of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, the parliamentary drafting office, have spent countless hours preparing the bill, noting and collating the errors and putting them all together into a document such as the Statute Law Revision Bill 2005. I commend all those people who have worked so hard to make sure that in future our legislation will be better than it was. I support this bill and commend it to the chamber. Heritage) (10.10 am)-in replyMr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, in rising to close on the Statute Law Revision Bill 2005 I will begin by commending you for your well-known, sharp, jocular sense across the House. There are three substantive points which I wish to make. The first is in relation to bipartisanship and the comments of the member for Barton and the member for Fisher. In this House we often forget the role that bipartisanship plays and the fact that many of us here are able to look beyond party boundaries. What we have seen today is a small example of bipartisanship. Many examples of bipartisanship exist, but the fact of their bipartisanship is often lost to the broader public or to the national media. I think it is worth reflecting on the fact that there is an enormous amount of goodwill across the chamber between members of different parties and people who work together to pursue and further the national interest.

On behalf of the government, I wish to thank parliamentary counsel for their diligence and also to apologise for any errors which we as legislators have made. I think it is important that we acknowledge those mistakes. Thirdly, I want to meditate very briefly on the point that, as legislators, we often underplay our role. There is a risk that parliament will fall into too much formalism and become a stamp for the executive and that the role of legislator, which goes back within the Westminster system for hundreds of years, will not be played sufficiently well and will not be carried out with appropriate personal focus. That responsibility is incumbent upon each of us. In that context, I want to express my respect for those who, through the private member’s bill process, recently sought to pursue a viewpoint. They did so in a way that produced a change in policy, and I thought that that was a fine example of acting as legislators. A fine compromise was reached, so I want to use this opportunity, as we focus on legislation and legislators, to express my respect for their work and their efforts.

Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. His Holiness Pope John Paul II Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the document. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (10.14 am)-It is a great honour to be speaking today on his Holiness Pope John Paul II. Some 57 per cent of my electorate observes the Catholic faith and I know that the life and work of Pope John Paul II meant a lot to them. It is a privilege to be given the opportunity to speak about the late Pope and, on behalf of the people I represent, I would like to add my thoughts on the life and times of an outstanding human being. The late Pope was born in Poland in 1920 and, in fact, I have met constituents in my electorate who hail from the same village as the Pope. They are very proud to be associated with him in this way. Pope John Paul II lost his mother and brother at a very young age and was brought up by his father who was a retired army officer and had experienced the trauma and horror of the Nazi occupation of Poland. The late Pope was a very gifted man. He was gifted in many ways. He attended university, indulged in some acting and worked in quarries and chemical factories, but it was not until 1942 that he began to study in secret for the priesthood. In 1962, the year Vatican II began, he was named Bishop of Cracow. His attitude to communism would be substantially influenced and shaped by the years he spent as a priest and bishop under the communist government. He was elected Pope on 16 October 1978. He was the first Slav Pope and the first non-Italian Pope in more than 450 years. The Pope was a former professor of philosophy, published poet and playwright, mountaineer and skier. He was influenced very strongly by his Slav identity. MAIN COMMITTEE Historian Eamon Duffy, in his book Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes, commented that the profundity of his thought was quickly recognised as well as his markedly conservative character. Yet, in a series of social encyclicals, the Pope demonstrated a deep suspicion of Western capitalism and denounced: A fundamental defect, or rather a series of defects, indeed a defective machinery is at the root of contemporary economics and materialistic civilization. These are defects which trap the ‘human family’ in ‘radically unjust situations’ in which children starve in a world of plenty. On2 October 1979, while addressing the United Nations, he acknowledged that it was the painful experiences of millions of people which led to the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which he also viewed as the basic inspiration and cornerstone of the United Nations. He was a fearless man and never refrained from speaking his mind and, as such, he strongly condemned the war in Iraq. The Pope was proficient in many languages and his multilingual capability made him more effective in his travels to all continents and most countries. It is now legend that he travelled the world more widely than any other Pope had previously done before him. He defended religious liberty, promoted ecumenism and interfaith understanding. On 29 November 1979, he visited the ecumenical patriarch, Dimitrios I, in Constantinople and stated that the Second Vatican Council declared that the shared riches and traditions of the Eastern and Western Christian churches should help overcome their divisions. He was the first ever Pope to visit a Roman synagogue and established formal relations with Israel in 1993. He visited leaders of other churches and welcomed them at the Vatican. He organised a gathering of representatives of all major religious faiths including Jews, Muslims and Buddhists at Assisi. Such was his embrace of multifaith dialogue that the present Archbishop of Canterbury made the unprecedented decision to attend his funeral. The Pope first visited Australia in 1973 as cardinal for the International Eucharistic Congress in Melbourne. He became the second Pope ever to visit Australia in 1986 and met religious and political leaders of all persuasions. He met people of all backgrounds, praised Aboriginal culture, participated in ecumenical services and spoke to leaders of other religious traditions. In 1995, he performed the first beatification of an Australian, Mary MacKillop, in Sydney. He declared that she devoted her life to the poor and that, as a result, she stood for a new attitude of human dignity which will take precedence over material gain. Penola Catholic College, in Broadmeadows in my electorate of Calwell, quite proudly takes its name from the place of Mary MacKillop’s first school in Adelaide. It is no wonder that the Pope was an outstanding man. I have made reference to his promotion of interfaith dialogue. I know that he was very strong on that and I saw it work effectively here in Australia, particularly in my home state of Victoria and my own community where the Catholic church has been at the forefront, together with representatives of the Jewish and Muslim faiths, of promoting interfaith dialogue in a world where such dialogue is absolutely pivotal, not only to the security of the world but also to the interactions between people from whatever religious or faith persuasion they come from. In conclusion, I would like to draw on a comment that was made by the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, who said that history would place MAIN COMMITTEE Pope John Paul II ‘alongside St Francis of Assisi as one of the great witnesses to the power of the word over that of the sword’. This is a very true and fitting tribute to Pope John Paul II who was, indeed, an outstanding human being. condolence motion not only as a Catholic, although one can always argue the toss about degrees of Catholicism amongst Catholics, but also as a member of parliament and as a citizen of this world who met the Pope on one occasion and saw his work. It is a privilege to be able to add my voice to this condolence motion. It was a sad time when we saw the passing of His Holiness Pope John Paul II. He was indeed a remarkable leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Arguably his greatest legacy was that he took the papacy to the world and left an indelible mark on our global society. To Catholics and non-Catholics alike, he was held in the highest esteem as he championed individual freedom in the face of the subversive force of communism in Eastern Europe. I know that many people in my electorate, particularly the congregations of St Thomas’s, St Luke’s, St Phillip’s, St John’s, Our Lady’s and Holy Spirit, would have been very saddened by his passing. We did not always agree with his pronouncements, but certainly he was the leader of the Roman Catholic Church and in that regard he had our full respect and honour. Pope John Paul II’s spiritual journey began at a young age. I know it has been said before, but it is important for me to state in this place the chronology of the man’s life. Even as a youth, his resilience and willingness to stand up to tyranny was intertwined with his journey before God. At the age of 21, for example, he was the only surviving member of his family. His mother died in 1929 and his father died in 1932. So he grew up in very tough times-as a young man, on his own and living in Eastern Europe behind the Iron Curtain and with all that the Iron Curtain represented during that tumultuous period. In the mid to late 1930s, he studied the performing arts, which included theatre and poetry, and he went on to study Polish philosophy. Interestingly, he undertook military training and began clandestine studies and involvement in underground cultural resistance activities. I guess it is at this point where perhaps we can see the start of his concern and his fight for individual freedoms. This was particularly against the tyranny of various dictatorships around the world. In the 1940s, while working at a chemical plant during World War II, he began underground seminarian studies. At the conclusion of World War II he was ordained as a priest and his journey to the Vatican began in earnest. One of the most significant aspects was his young age. He was installed as Archbishop of Cracow at the age of 44 in 1964, created a cardinal at 47 in 1967 and elected as Pope, as we know, in 1978. He was an international champion of freedom. That is his greatest legacy. There were many factors that led to the rapid demise of communism across Eastern Europe. I know that many will say that the demise of communism in Eastern Europe began with another great freedom fighter in Poland, Lech Walesa. I would certainly share that view, but Pope John Paul II was also an inspiration to Lech Walesa. I know that when they first met, very soon after the collapse of communism, it was a very emotional time and one that the whole world looked upon with great admiration and reverence. The international climate during this time changed as more and more people behind the Iron Curtain longed for the freedoms offered by democracy. Few people can lay a genuine claim to helping bring down tyranny in Eastern Europe and the end of the Soviet Union. MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Statute Law Revision Bill 2005
301,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (10.20 Am),"I welcome this opportunity to add my voice to thisThere were a number of players in that process, and Pope John Paul II was certainly a beacon of freedom for the suppressed people of Eastern Europe. He embellished cultural and religious freedoms and was a passionate advocate for the people of his home country of Poland. He also brought to the Catholic Church a role in international affairs that it had not enjoyed for around 200 years. As a cardinal he defied the Czech communist regime when he spoke at the funeral of fellow cardinal Stefan Trochta in 1974. As a newly elected pope he made a triumphant visit to Poland in 1979. Throughout the early 1980s he defended the rights of Polish sovereignty and wrote to Soviet president Brezhnev in defence of Polish sovereignty. If a repressive government did not want John Paul II to visit, he would plead with it through phone calls and letters until it relented. I think he said that he was probably personally seen by more people than any other in the history of mankind. That is an achievement that will be hard to beat by any successors, whether they be in the political or religious field. Pope John Paul II was a visionary promoter of interfaith dialogue. His willingness to engage with other denominations gave the Christian world a sense of unity and solidarity. I know that members of other churches also feel that in Pope John Paul II we had a leader who spoke on behalf of all Christians. Of even greater significance, Pope John Paul II reached out to the world’s other great religions. As I watched the tributes pour in from across the globe on the TV, one of the most powerful images was seeing him stand shoulder to shoulder and share a joke with the Dalai Lama. He also suffered in his quest to engage when he was shot by would be Turkish assassin Mehmet Ali Agca in 1981. He used his suffering to expel compassion and mercy when be publicly forgave Agca in 1983 by visiting him in prison. The Pope also worked towards peace in the Middle East. He visited Israel and Egypt in 2000, where he asked for pardon for the sins committed by the Catholic Church towards Jews over its 2000-year history. It was a very momentous time and a turning point in what was a deteriorating relationship between the Jewish faith and the Catholic Church over a number of years. He suffered, and he suffered with humility towards the end. Pope John Paul II’s later years were marked by deterioration in his own health. He brought with this a great sense of humility and grace, and once again channelled his own suffering towards the greater good. In 1994 he embellished this when he stated: I have understood that I have to lead the Church of Christ into the third Millennium with prayer, with various initiatives. But I saw that this was not enough: I must lead her with suffering. This was indeed one of the many emotions that I experienced when I met Pope John Paul II. In 1999 I visited Europe with a parliamentary delegation. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I still have the photo in my office which shows your former colleague the member for Prospect and I standing quite imposingly behind the Pope. We were all touched by that meeting. It was a brief but compelling moment for us, and one that we will not forget. In conclusion, the death of Pope John Paul II marks the passing of a man who has left an indelible mark on the Catholic Church, on the Christian faith and on global humanity. In his 26½ years he is said to have spoken to 17½ million general pilgrims, to have had 246 meetings with heads of government and to have created 482 saints. I know that there are moves afoot at the moment to also declare the Pope a saint at some time in the future. Whether that happens or not is a matter for the church, and I certainly will not enter into any discussion on that. MAIN COMMITTEE Many more people have been touched by his generosity, forgiveness and compassion. I would like to join with the other members of parliament who have spoken on this condolence motion by expressing my gratitude for the life of, and the lessons learnt from, Pope John Paul II. I am sure that I speak on the behalf of all Catholics within my electorate, and people of other Christian denominations, who looked towards him with inspiration. In speaking on this condolence and expressing our views on Pope John Paul II, we also offer our best wishes and support to the new pope, Pope Benedict XVI. John Paul II dedicated his life and the 26 years of his reign to uniting the world. In death, the world has joined together in sorrow for a truly inspirational religious leader. The late Pope was a man of peace, whose courage and conviction shone as a beacon to humanity. He not only led one billion Catholics throughout the world but also guided a path for all the world’s citizens regardless of their religious faith. Pope John Paul II was born Karol Jozef Wojtyla in Poland in 1920. He was the second of two sons. By the age of 21 he was the only surviving member of his family. His mother died in 1929, his brother in 1932 and his father in 1941. The late Pope was involved in the church from birth. He made his first Holy Communion at the age of nine and was confirmed at the age of 18. The Pope was an artistic man, and as a young man he enrolled in a drama school at university. But the Nazis closed the university and he was forced to work in a quarry and then in a chemical factory to avoid being deported. Surrounded by the deprivation and cruelty of war, the Pope received his calling to the priesthood in 1942. His courage at the choice of vocation was evident. He began a secret course at a Cracow seminary and at the same time was one of the pioneers of the clandestine Rhapsodic Theatre. At the end of the Second World War he continued his studies at the seminary and went on to the now-reopened university. He was ordained in 1946 before travelling to Rome, where he worked under the guidance of the French Dominican. The Pope completed a doctorate in theology in 1948, while exercising his pastoral ministry among Polish immigrants in France, Belgium and Holland during his vacations. On returning to his native Poland he continued his studies and eventually became a professor of moral theology and social ethics. His hard work and dedication to the Catholic Church was recognised by Pope Pius XII in 1958. He was appointed auxiliary bishop of Cracow. Later, Pope Paul VI appointed him to the role of Archbishop of Cracow and made him a cardinal in 1967. As a cardinal he participated in the Second Vatican Council and all the assemblies of the synod of bishops. On the death of Pope John Paul I, the humble man from Poland was elected to the Holy See in Rome and the throne of St Peter. In doing so, and in keeping with his nature, he took the name Pope John Paul II. He was the Catholic Church’s first non-Italian pontiff in more than 450 years and was history’s first Slavic pope. His election was greeted with enthusiasm throughout the world by the faithful and by other religious leaders. He also became a friend to all faiths. He reached out to Jewish people and to those of the Islamic faith while recognising all Christian denominations. In this sense, he became the most widely travelled pontiff, embarking on 104 foreign visits during his reign. He travelled more than 1.2 million kilometres, or 3.24 times the distance from the earth to the moon. He met more than 1,600 political leaders to spread his message of peace and hope. Consequently the Pope was seen by more people than anybody else who had ever lived. Over his reign an estimated 18 million people attended MAIN COMMITTEE",231,Condolences
302,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs) (10.29 am)-Popehis Vatican audiences. The Pope visited Australia twice: firstly in 1986 and again in 1995 to beatify Mother Mary MacKillop. He spoke eight different languages, including Spanish, after becoming Pope. His extraordinary courage and ability to forgive were on display after he survived an assassination attempt in 1981. He was shot at St Peter’s Square by a young extremist. Two years later the Pope met his would be assassin in prison in Rome to forgive him. Unfortunately the assassination attempt would throw a security cordon around the pontiff. In future the Pope was forced to travel in an armoured glass van-earning it the wonderful nickname of the ‘popemobile’. Despite the security scare, his message to the faithful remained the same. He focused on human rights, particularly the rights of children and those of the individual. At every opportunity he pushed for freedom of assembly and religion as well as free elections. Nowhere was this more evident that in his dealings during the Cold War with the communist Eastern bloc. The Pope was a strong and ardent critic of communism and he played an instrumental role in the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the months following his election as pontiff, the Pope visited his Polish homeland in a bid to free it from communism. A short time later, the Solidarity trade union movement was born-a step towards Poland breaking free from the East and becoming an independent state. Over his life the Pope was a keen writer, publishing four books on his teachings and his life story. The first was Love and Relationships in 1960, followed by Crossing the Threshold of Hope in 1994 and Gift and Mystery: On the 50th Anniversary of My Priestly Ordination in 1996. Lastly, his autobiography Get Up and Let Us Go was published in 2004. His autobiography followed his life from being a new bishop of Cracow to being elected Pope, a truly remarkable feat. Its publication also marked the Pope’s 84th birthday. In recognition of his many achievements, Time magazine named him Man of the Year in 1994. In later years Pope John Paul II developed Parkinson’s disease and increasingly began to rely on his cardinals to assist with many of his ceremonial duties. For example, at Easter 2002 he was unable to carry out the washing of the feet ceremony, which is symbolic of the Last Supper. It was the first time the role had been performed by cardinals. He also called on the clergy to work for greater dialogue with other faiths in the wake of the September 11 attacks in the United States. Despite his illness, the Pope’s schedule was relentless. In 2003 he travelled to six European countries. As his health continued to decline, he visited Switzerland in June 2004 in his first foreign trip for nine months. Two months later he visited Lourdes in southern France on a two-day pilgrimage to one of the Catholic world’s most revered shrines. In early 2005 the Pope’s health deteriorated further. The pontiff spent 28 days in hospital over two periods in February and March. During his second hospital stay, he underwent a tracheotomy to ease respiratory problems. The surgery rendered the man once known as the great communicator to the world virtually unable to speak. Despite the surgery, his health continued to deteriorate and eventually he suffered a heart attack and other complications. In his private suite at the Vatican, surrounded by his close friends and advisers, the people’s Pope died late on 2 April 2005. From a personal perspective, I found that, as a man with great health challenges, the Pope’s desire to keep working and to present himself in his public role was a great inspiration. He did not believe that those who are sick or old were to be hidden away. They were part of life, and MAIN COMMITTEE he set a great example in his own personal time of great trial through his illness. The world has mourned and will mourn his passing, but he certainly will not be forgotten. His legacy will live on in the practices of the Catholic Church and the more humane society that he fostered. The first two years of the Pope’s reign will be the template for the years ahead. I am sure many Catholics would agree that among the pontiff’s many significant achievements has been the restoration of the conservative stances of the church. He made strong declarations on abortion, contraception and biotechnology. Although not all Catholics or others agreed with his vision, the Pope must be commended for having the courage of his convictions. I extend my congratulations and good wishes to Pope John Paul II’s successor, Benedict XVI. Pope Benedict was close to his predecessor, and I am certain the Catholic Church will go forward in safe hands. Debate (on motion by Mr Sawford) adjourned. That further proceedings on orders of the day Nos. 2, 3 and 4, government business, be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. That the House do now adjourn. Pictures from the Port Gallery in the Parks community centre in Angle Park in my electorate I will have the great honour of launching a photographic and sound exhibition on behalf of photographer Suzanne Laslett and composer Robert Petchell. Soprano Tessa Miller will also perform at the opening, singing several songs created by Robert in response to some of Suzanne’s images. Added to this performance will be guest appearances by some port characters by members of the Walks ’n’ Talks group. I have to say, I am pretty excited about this launch and am looking forward to playing a part on the day. The photographer Suzanne Laslett took up residence in Port Adelaide nine years ago. She has been photographing the area for some time and has a significant collection. The exhibition is just part of an ongoing project for Suzanne. Some of the photos were taken when she first arrived in Port Adelaide; others have been selected from other exhibitions, of which many focused on the port; and there is as well a body of new work. This year, 2005, has seen the photographer Suzanne Laslett begin a collaboration with composer Robert Petchell, which will have a number of outcomes in years to come, of course anticipated to be highly successful. Pictures from the Port is the first of these outcomes. There is an exhibition of black-andwhite photography by Suzanne and a sound scape installation created by Robert Petchell from stories and sounds recorded in the Port Adelaide area. Pictures from the Port aims to capture aspects of the Port Adelaide area at a point of time of major change, by seeing and hearing the port through stories which evoke memories as well as a sense of the future.

305,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (10.40 Am),"On Sunday, 3 July at two o’clock at the AxisSuzanne is a local Port artist who has also had many solo and joint exhibitions throughout Australia and whose work is represented in private and corporate collections in Australia and overseas. Her work creates a feeling of stories through the placement of people within recognisable locations. With this current exhibition she brings together a selection of existing work with newly created ones, using different sites in Port Adelaide-some of which, unfortunately, no longer exist. Robert Petchell, who also lives in the western suburbs, is a composer and musical director who works with both professional companies and performers as well as on community based projects. A special feature of his work is the use of recorded sounds and conversations, which are brought together with other musical elements to create new musical works and sound scapes. An excellent example of Robert’s work is the Smelter Symphony, created and performed for the 100th Smelters Picnic at Port Pirie in 2003. The exhibition will open from 29 June to 27 July. It is supported by the Parks Arts and Function Complex, Axis Gallery and the City of Port Adelaide Enfield. Written history is not always authentic nor fully explained. We are all aware of the cliches, such as ‘to the victors go the history’ and ‘control the narrative, control the history’. A great Port Adelaide photographer from the past was the late George Hutton, who lived in Largs Bay. Copies of his photographs can be seen in many Port Adelaide establishments-in fact, in many South Australian establishments. His photographs recorded infrastructure, transport, celebrations and famous locations. For many years he photographed every child every year, in individual and classroom photographs along Le Fevre Peninsula. His smile and cheeky grin were always welcome when I was a young child, and his legacy to Port Adelaide is priceless. Therefore, to recognise another photographer in Suzanne Laslett, recording the images of Port Adelaide in an artistic and an authentic way, is particularly welcome. I wish her every encouragement and support for the future-a long and productive future. That it is to be accompanied by a sound presentation is an added bonus. Music, too, is authentic. It is transferable. Music is always a new event. It is emotional. It is intense. It cannot be appropriated by any power. Like photography, there is a strong connection to memory. It is insulated from political power. It is insulated from religious power. It is insulated from gender politics, nationalism and everything else-great stuff. As a form to accompany a photographic exhibition, music is a refuge for hope. This is an exhibition beyond language. It can lead us, inspire us and take us on a journey to boundless imagination. Photography and music need only to be. They liberate and help us deliver freedom and, from that, wisdom and enlightenment. This can be a delicious irony for, unless you subjugate ambition, status, power, celebrity or fame, you do not reach wisdom and enlightenment-a good message for politicians and journalists. As I said earlier, I am looking forward in great anticipation to seeing, feeling and hearing all the aspects of this wonderfully planned exhibition. Industrial Relations Reform gional Services) (10.45 am)-I rise to speak on not just the industrial relations reforms that the coalition government is set to introduce but also the recent funding provisions, particularly the $5 billion offer that has been made to the state TAFE educational facilities right around Australia. If you knew the man in question, you would not be surprised that lately the member for Murray-Darling has been sounding off not just about industrial relations reforms but also MAIN COMMITTEE",235,Adjournment
306,Mr John Cobb (Parkes,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Rehow he believes that TAFE education is finished in Broken Hill and that the Commonwealth is not funding it any more-all of which is total rubbish. The reforms that we are seeking to introduce-not just the industrial relations reform generally but the conditions we are putting to TAFE around Australia, particularly in New South Wales and in this case western New South Wales-are incredibly important. I for one cannot understand why the teachers union, some of the TAFE teachers and especially the member for Murray-Darling would be so upset by them. I can think of why he wants to divert attention from the problems of the New South Wales government. I might touch on those in a second, but I would like to talk about TAFE. It is an extraordinarily important teaching and training institution in New South Wales in particular. It probably accounts for about 85 per cent of it, outside of schooling and university education. We are simply asking TAFE to get modern, commercial and cooperate with industry to have courses which reflect what industry needs rather than what academics and those setting the curriculum believe everybody should learn. It is about making TAFE responsive to the skills needs of the region. Why in heaven’s name would teachers unions, others and the member for Murray-Darling be frightened about offering staff the ability to have a workplace agreement, should they wish to have one? Do they not want those who have the confidence to act for themselves to better themselves? If you are a particularly dedicated and good teacher, why should you not be allowed to have a workplace agreement? Why should you be represented by a union if you do not wish to be? If you want to be-and it is entirely the choice of that teacher-you can still be part of collective bargaining. But if you wish to bargain directly with your employer and secure a better deal, why should you not? As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews, has said, people will not be disadvantaged by workplace agreements. That is a given. The member for Murray-Darling continually talks about Commonwealth issues when we are running the best economy that we have seen in 30 years with the lowest unemployment we have seen in 29 years. His obvious reason for doing that is that he is part of a government which in the last budget budgeted for the next 12 months of drought approximately what the Commonwealth government spends on drought every two weeks. I would be embarrassed too if I were the member for Murray-Darling and I represented 40-odd per cent of a state, a whole lot of which is in drought and a whole lot of which his government has thumbed its nose at. He also has problems with the club tax, especially in a place like Broken Hill, which has an excellent club that supports community and sports issues. The new tax will greatly reduce its ability to do that, as it will for all clubs in Dubbo and right around New South Wales. The member for Murray-Darling has a lot to worry about, I guess, not least of which are trains. They are closing branch lines right around our state, refusing to spend money on them while at the same time the Commonwealth, through AusLink, are spending money, particularly on the transcontinental lines that run through our electorate. I am very proud of what we are doing with trains. I am absolutely embarrassed by what the New South Wales state government is not doing; it is refusing to spend money on a train that is outside of the metropolitan area. (Time expired) Family Services: Child Care Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (10.50 am)-Barnardo’s South Coast is a great organisation and a wonderful asset to the social infrastructure in my electorate, assisting and working with MAIN COMMITTEE some of the most disadvantaged communities-for example, in the Bundaleer Housing Estate in the suburb of Berkeley. The organisation focuses on building community capacity and is very involved in early intervention programs. It runs an OOSH program in Warrawong and Berkeley and, in so doing, incurs financial shortfalls each year, as the parents that go to these services cannot afford to pay for them. Over the past six years, Barnardo’s South Coast has spent on average an additional $150,000 a year supplementing shortfalls so that these beneficial programs can continue to operate. We made a submission to the government last year about this funding problem, and I have to acknowledge the assistance provided with a one-off grant of $143,000. However, the service at Berkeley West, the OOSH program, is again under threat, with its possible closure in the months ahead. This out of school hours and vocation program caters for 40 children and caters for a high percentage of single working parents-usually working mums. One of the mums, Renee Callaghan, who has three children, pointed out the impact of the possible closures in the following terms: I have been looking for work for two years and have finally succeeded in securing employment. I have no family or backup support for childcare. I have no other option but after school care. Following representations to the minister and a good deal of local protest action and agitation, the government has now provided $35,000 to Barnardo’s, which should keep the program running until the end of 2005. But it is only a temporary reprieve. Barnardo’s rightly argue that they cannot continue to keep services running, lurching from crisis to crisis every six months. I have written to the minister and urged her to ensure that there is ongoing funding to meet the financial shortfalls of about $7 per day per child in after school care and the shortfalls for the vocation program. Both these programs cater for a population predominantly of single mums who cannot afford to pay those fees. Barnardo’s is now covering a deficit of around $100,000 to keep the OOSH programs running in Warrawong and Berkeley. These two suburbs are among the most disadvantaged in New South Wales, identified as such by a recent study by the Jesuits, looking at the correlation between postcodes and poverty. So no-one can dispute objectively the disadvantaged situation these suburbs are placed in. There is a limit on how long Barnardo’s South Coast can keep subsidising these essential services. The government needs to understand that other providers in my electorate are most unlikely to step in and pick up the lost places, as those places are not financially viable due to the deep-seated nature of the disadvantage in these communities. I have to question how a sole parent will cope when their child turns six and, under the government’s new proposals, will be forced to look for work or suffer a cut to their income. How can they find suitable child-care arrangements in parts of my electorate where the government is presiding over the possible closure of existing services? The government’s position on these issues is not clear. At one stage, the Prime Minister said in the House that sole parents would be subject to the same rules that apply to people on the Newstart allowance. But then, as we know, there are no rules under the Newstart proposals that allow parents to refuse a job on the basis that they have no child-care places. I think there was a degree of public embarrassment in the Prime Minister’s position because he later conceded, in a backflip, that he was opposed to breaching provisions applying to sole parents MAIN COMMITTEE who could not find child care or whose income from work would leave them in a negative position in comparison to their position when in receipt of their entitlement. I have nearly 4,000 sole parents in my electorate and I feel I have an obligation to speak up on their behalf. TodayI have taken the opportunity to urge the government to provide the funding for Barnardo’s South Coast and to recognise the problem in electorates like mine where current services are under imminent threat of closure and yet on top of that the welfare to work provisions announced in the budget would see almost 4,000 people in my electorate potentially have to find work without the adequacy of child-care and vacation care provision. Ethanol the world market, the Philippines is expected to pass legislation this year that will require oil companies to use ethanol as a fuel blend, starting with five per cent ethanol and rising to 10 per cent by the year 2010. It was also noted by the Brazilian Trade Bureau that resistance to use of ethanol as a fuel blend has died down because of the rising cost of petroleum products. Here in Australia. I was encouraged by the news that the Prime Minister announced the formation of a task force on biofuels. It will be made up of an expert panel which will examine a number of areas in relation to ethanol and biofuels. This examination should do much to counter the negative and sometimes contradictory misinformation put out by certain sections of the oil industry. The question here is: is it the role of government to drive demand or should the government ensure that fair debate is allowed to prevail so that influential forces cannot dominate the flow of information? In this case, the consumer is entitled to be told so as to allow them to draw a fair and considered conclusion. I am also heartened by a report in the Financial Review earlier this month, which indicated that oil companies may be softening their stance against the introduction of ethanol. I suspect that their support is less than effusive, as suggested in the article. RatherI think they are sniffing the wind and hedging their bets. When pressed for detail, the oil company spokesman said that those decisions were ‘strictly confidential’. Why, when the same oil companies use ethanol overseas? To me that is ‘code speak’ for information that the public does not need to know-in other words, non-committal. I must support Bob Gordon when he says that the only evidence of a change of heart in the oil companies will be when they start buying ethanol and marketing it. Ethanol blends are increasingly used in South Africa, while Brazil, the world leader, produces four billion gallons of ethanol a year. All Brazilian fuel contains at least 24 per cent ethanol, and much of it is 100 per cent ethanol. Engines can be designed to run on 100 per cent ethanol. Chrysler, Ford and General Motors all recommend ethanol fuels and nearly every car manufacturer in the world approves ethanol blends in their warranty coverage. Henry Ford designed the famous ModelT Ford to run on alcohol, and he said it was the fuel of the future. Although they are not exactly mainstream in the United Kingdom, manufacturers like Volkswagen, Citroen, Peugeot and Ford are among the pacesetters that have already produced bioethanol-powered cars. Citroen has a development called C3 capable of running on bioethanol, while Volkswagen has the technology in a Golf. Peugeot, meanwhile, have used a 307 to pioneer the new fuel, and Ford have turned to the Focus to test its ethanol engine. MAIN COMMITTEE",236,Adjournment
307,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (10.55 Am),"To try to ease the impact of rising petroleum prices inMeanwhile in Washington, congress has passed a bill to mandate ethanol that would require refiners to use 3.1 billion gallons of the alcohol fuel this year, escalating to five billion gallons by the year 2012. This year the industry expects to produce four billion gallons of ethanol, most of it distilled from corn. Farmers groups and ethanol producers want accelerated requirements leading to a national mandate of eight billion gallons of ethanol by the year 2012. The flourishing ethanol demand has been created largely because refiners use it to replace the gasoline additive MTBE. MTBE makes gasoline burn more cleanly, but it has been banned in many states because of concerns that it contaminates groundwater and poses a health risk. Why aren’t we hearing from our own home-grown environmentalists about the risks associated with conventional petrol? Commenting on the bill, Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa said in a press release: Americans deserved to know why oil companies making record profits insist that families pay top dollar at the pump when prices could be reduced by blending more lower-priced ethanol in our fuel supply. Sound familiar? Why can’t we now do this in Australia? We have the ethanol and our oil reserves are becoming more precious each year. Why is it that we cannot move on? Australians are entitled to ask that very same question. We have asked it, but there has been a stony silence from the oil companies. AllI am asking for is an open debate on the question. This recently announced expert committee on biofuels is well placed to state firmly and unequivocally whether there is a place for alternative fuel supplements in Australia. The claims and counterclaims from both sides should be deliberated upon by someone who is objective and unbiased. I welcome this initiative, I look forward to the report of the committee and, hopefully, I will meet this committee in time to come. Automotive Industry Job Cuts Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (11.00 am)-I rise today to express my deep disappointment at the recent announcement of further job losses at Autoliv, an automotive components company in Campbellfield in my electorate. As Australia’s largest manufacturer of seatbelts and airbags, it is devastating that the Autoliv factory has been forced to cut more than half of its 900-strong work force in order to remain viable in the face of price competition from overseas suppliers. In addition to the 430 job cuts announced in 2003, Autoliv has now announced that a further 70 jobs will be lost over the next 18 months. In total, we are looking at the loss of 500 jobs by August next year. Thirty of these will be transferred to low-cost labour countries to ensure that Autoliv remains competitive in a climate of global sourcing, while the remaining 40 resulted from the changes to future contracts and restructuring requirements to meet competitive pressures. As a flow-on of these job losses, over 65 jobs are at risk at Autoliv subsidiary, seatbelt textile maker Webco in Thomastown. Autoliv represents around 95 per cent of Webco’s business, and there is talk of a forced closure within 18 months as volume constraints affect productivity. Combine the 500 jobs at Autoliv with the 160 jobs at windscreen maker Trico in Springvale, the 170 jobs set to go at the radiator factory Calsonic in Port Melbourne and the 65 potential job losses in Webco in Thomastown and all this adds up to a disturbing trend for the automotive industry in Victoria. These cutbacks are not isolated incidences; rather, they will be followed by more closures and restructuring as tariff protection is withdrawn and jobs are lost offshore. MAIN COMMITTEE In a recent submission to the government, the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers argued that local car part makers would derive little benefit from a free trade agreement with China, noting that the removal of the duty on imports from China would most likely worsen the already substantial automotive trade imbalance in China’s favour. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released as of June this year show that Australia has lost almost 30,000 manufacturing jobs in the nine months to May, divided evenly across New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. In net terms manufacturing jobs have shrunk by 84,000 in the past five years and by almost 150,000 since tariff cuts began in the late 1980s. The dilemma we now have is: where do these employees who are about to lose their jobs go? What jobs are there for tradesmen and women who have spent their whole working lives, in some cases specialising, in work that is no longer required? Who will pay their mortgages and their bills as they commence the painful task of looking for work again? Many of them are in their mature years. I understand that this has been a tough decision for Autoliv and I appreciate that, to remain viable, the company needs to downsize to ensure the protection of as many manufacturing jobs as possible into the future. Autoliv has been, and I am sure will continue to be, a good employer in my electorate and a good corporate citizen. This decision is very sad for everyone involved but is particularly devastating for those who are losing their jobs. The community will feel the effects of this halved work force, with Autoliv unlikely to contribute as generously to the community as it has previously done. Over the years Autoliv has contributed to many charities and fundraisers, including this year when its employees raised $18,000 during their Work for the Tsunami Survivors Day. Earlier this year this community minded company formed a partnership with the Northern Hospital, through which Autoliv staff the hospital kiosk one day a month and employees contribute to the volunteer drivers program, and a $15,000 fundraising goal has been set for the purchase of a diagnostic kit for the emergency department. In return, the hospital supports Autoliv staff by providing information and services, including flu vaccinations and checkups. In conclusion, I would like to agree with the Leader of the Opposition, who made these comments about job losses. He refers to them as a ‘national disgrace’ and a further sign of the government’s failed export policy and failure to diversify and strengthen the nation’s manufacturers. Exporting Australian jobs is certainly not something my electorate can afford, and these job losses will be felt hard by the 500 families who have lost an income from Autoliv and who stand to lose even more as they find it incredibly difficult to find a new job for themselves in order to maintain their families and their lifestyles. Pharmacies the media in particular about whether Woolworths and larger supermarkets in our country should have the opportunity to sell pharmaceutical products. I wish to strongly put my position forward in the parliament today. I do not support the proposition that supermarkets in this country-and in particular Woolworths, at this point being led by Roger Corbett-should be allowed to sell pharmaceutical products. I want to place on the record very firmly my position on behalf of the people of Ryan that the pharmacists in this country play a very important role and that they should have the opportunity to carry out their role separately and independently from the big arm of supermarket chains. MAIN COMMITTEE",239,Adjournment
308,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (11.05 Am),"There has been some debate in the public arena and inThe pharmaceutical market in this country is worth some $5.6 billion. Pharmacists play a very important role in the health of Australian, and I want to support the position that the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Tony Abbott, has taken in recent times. He supports the view that pharmaceutical products should be dispensed by pharmacists in particular. Community pharmacies provide a very specific and vital service in communities throughout Australia, and those services would certainly be under great jeopardy with the introduction of supermarket pharmacies. Of course community pharmacies are also small businesses. They are run in many instances as ‘mum and dad’ businesses. They are family businesses, and they are highly valued in our communities. They already face significant challenges in their own right, with significant overheads in operating their businesses, but they are also often run by health professionals who provide essential services to their communities. I hope very much that my colleagues in the government would support my position. Having spoken to my Queensland colleague the member for McPherson, I know that her position is very much in line with mine. In 2003, an independent study by the Curtin University of Technology estimated that pharmacists nationally provided close to 78.2 million free consultations. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia estimates that, giving the ageing of our population, by the end of 2005-that is, in this year alone-this would jump to almost 80 million free consultations. In the Ryan electorate I have no doubt that this service is going to be threatened very significantly if the position changes. There is no doubt that many pharmacies in the Ryan community would face very difficult choices about their sustainability. There are 948 pharmacists in the electorate of Ryan. I have had the opportunity of going to visit many of these in my almost four years in the national parliament. It is a great privilege to know many of them, and the service that they provide to the consumers of Ryan is of a high quality. I find it quite disturbing that the CEO of Woolworths, Mr Roger Corbett, wants to enter this market. I know that he runs a business and his bottom line is to provide the highest profitability for his company and for the shareholders, but I think the pharmacists in this country occupy a unique position. As I said, not only are they small businesses but they also provide an allied health role in this country. I want to place very firmly on the record that, as my duties permit, I will very strongly represent the pharmacists of the Ryan electorate and those in broader Brisbane. Currently, pharmacies stock between 12,000 and 15,000 items. Many are small picks or unusual items which are rarely called for, but they are still stocked. Around 80 per cent of PBS medicines are stocked on a ‘just in case’ basis by pharmacists, representing a considerable amount of capital tied up on the back shelves. I am not sure if supermarkets would go down this route, given that their particular role is very much commercially orientated. I do not agree that supermarkets would place a strong focus on the health aspect of this business as those operating community pharmacies do. As a very strong advocate in parliament for small business, and as a very strong advocate for the small businesses of the Ryan community, I want to again place on the record my strong feelings on this matter and reassure my constituents that I will be looking after them. I will be putting my position to the Howard government. If there are any signs of changes, I will certainly be lobbying my colleagues in the government. I know I have the very strong support of many of my Liberal colleagues in Queensland, and I am sure that many of my colleagues MAIN COMMITTEE from the class of 2001, such as the member for Casey, will be very interested in hearing further public debate on this issue. Cane Toads gency-namely, the relentless march of cane toads across Australia. As the House would know, cane toads can be found throughout eastern and northern Queensland, and have moved west to the river catchment areas around Kakadu National Park. In New South Wales, cane toads have spread as far south as Yamba on the northern New South Wales coast and now cover an area of some 500,000 square kilometres. The female cane toad can lay up to 40,000 eggs a month, with up to half of those expected to become tadpoles. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that cane toads are now steadily advancing towards Western Australia, the last part of Northern Australia yet to be infested by these noxious pests. According to sightings this week, they are as close as 200 kilometres from the Western Australian border. By next March cane toads could be in the Ord River wetlands, by which time the precious Kimberley region will be all but beyond saving. This special region faces an environmental, social and economic crisis and it will happen on our watch in this term of government, in this financial year. Since first released in Queensland in 1935, cane toads have proved to be extinction in motion. They have no predators. A toad kills any native animal that tries to eat it or pick it up. In turn, it eats whatever it can fit into its enormous mouth. It is an aggressive competitor for habitat that forces other species into local extinction. For 70 years, this poisonous menace has spread unchecked and, as I have mentioned, has already infested Kakadu-one of our great national parks-and is on the suburban outskirts of Darwin. The precious biodiversity of the Kimberley region is now in peril. One of Australia’s most significant bioregions, with hugely important cultural and natural values, is under siege from the cane toad. Infestation will result in the regional extinction of species such as monitors, freshwater crocodiles and native frogs-all integral to the environment of this region. Because of these immediate extinctions, the Kimberley economy itself is at grave riskparticularly its outstanding nature and culture based tourism operations, which rely on a toadfree habitat for their distinctive point of difference from the rest of tropical Australia. This will cost people their jobs. It will impact on rural townships finding their feet after September 11 and the collapse of Ansett. Rapid extinctions will have a cruel social cost. Indigenous communities, who depend on native species for their cultural and spiritual well-being, will be left with nothing. After every indignity that Aboriginal people in Northern and Western Australia have endured and suffered, the loss of bush tucker on their hard-won native lands promises to be yet another cruel dispossession. The local Miriuwung-Gajerrong people have cried out for help. They are committed to joining their fellow citizens in fighting off this menace. I draw to the House’s attention the bipartisan community action involving two state governments-the Northern Territory state government and the Western Australian state government-and several NGOs, that has been undertaken to prevent the toad from entering Western Australia. This is an issue beyond race, class, politics or man-made borders; it is an issue of the moment. MAIN COMMITTEE",241,Adjournment
309,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (11.10 Am),"I rise to speak on a matter of great urIn August last year the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Campbell, committed the federal government to match the Western Australian government dollar for dollar in its Kimberley cane toad initiative. The Western Australian government has earmarked $1.5 million and the Northern Territory government $1.4 million. Non-government organisation Stop the Toad Foundation has set itself the goal of raising $1.5 million for a groundbreaking trapping campaign in the Victoria region of the Northern Territory to stop the toad in its tracks. I call upon the minister and the government to make good their promise to match state moneys and to join the efforts of two state governments and their communities to halt the westward spread of the cane toad while there is still time. Failure by this government to support the actions now will have irreversible consequences. The community and the state governments are ready to act. I strongly urge the federal environment minister and this government to commit the necessary funds to halt the cane toad and to protect the Kimberley region. Indian Ocean Tsunami into all our memories as a day of tragedy and of loss of human life. The response to the tsunami by the world community was instantaneous and unprecedented. Australians alone contributed around $300 million through personal and corporate donations. The Australian Government’s initial and immediate commitment of $60 million, and the subsequent $1 billion package over five years to Indonesia, encapsulated how as a government and a nation we view our responsibilities to our neighbours, particularly when they are in dire need. Organisations such as the Australian Red Cross, World Vision, UNICEF, CARE Australia, Caritas Australia and Oxfam Community Aid Abroad all responded immediately and with so much assistance on so many fronts. These organisations are renowned for their efforts in times of need and they are to be commended for their response. But so often it is the efforts of ordinary citizens and their personal commitment to those in need that are overlooked. These people and the communities they represent need to be acknowledged and commended. Of course, from the tsunami there would be hundreds of wonderful community stories of help in the region that make all of us proud as Australians. TodayI want to mention just one. I want to acknowledge and express appreciation to Billanook College for responding to the relief effort to those affected by the tsunami on Phi Phi Island and other parts of the Krabi region of southern Thailand. Billanook College is situated in Mooroolbark in the Casey electorate. The students and the teachers saw a need and responded by contributing the best way they knew how: to offer to go there themselves and help. Two of the staff members and six year 10 students gave up their holidays in April this year to assist the communities in the region. Their contribution was one of sheer hard work-working side by side with the locals to rebuild what had been destroyed. Where they were working there was no earthmoving equipment to remove the rubble. They laboured for three days carrying cement and construction wire and digging footings. They forged a bond with the local villagers, particularly with the young children who came out and became their companions. They watched and observed as our young volunteer ambassadors assisted in the building of five new homes. They bear witness to the fact that Australians, young and old, care and have shown this by putting their shoulders to the wheel to help rebuild shattered communities. MAIN COMMITTEE",243,Adjournment
310,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (11.15 Am),"The tsunami of Boxing Day 2004 is etchedI would like to take this opportunity in the House to mention the staff from Billanook College, Megan Fortington and Mark Robert, and the students, Lisa Gray, Vanessa Smith, Andrew Wadsworth, Michael Brown, Brodie Smith and Laura Donovan-Hayes. With the future in their hands Australia is not only richer today but is guaranteed to be richer into the future. In the years ahead, the people of that region and of that island will look back and they will remember the help that official organisations and the Australian government gave-they will remember that as a nation Australia gave generously. But I think that far more than that they will remember the young students of Billanook College, who came there to help and who showed first-hand that the people of Australia cared and wanted to make a difference to their lives in their time of need. Western Sydney Industrial Awards Western Sydney as a centre of population and economic growth and as a centre of influence over the future development of Sydney, our most global city. Western Sydney is the economic powerhouse of Australia, with more than 150 of Australia’s top 500 companies located in the Greater Western Sydney region. From its humble beginnings as a manufacturing centre, today Western Sydney is home to many small, medium and large firms focused on innovation, export and growth. Last Friday night I had the honour to see the best of our industries on display at the 2005 Western Sydney Industry Awards. While highly focused and highly innovative companies are operating throughout the region, I was pleased to see that a number of businesses operating in the electorate of Werriwa were among the finalists. With so many businesses operating out of the nearly 1,000 hectares of business parks located in Campbelltown, Leumeah, Ingleburn and Minto, it came as no surprise that some of the finalists were from Werriwa. One such award winner was Broens Industries from Ingleburn. Broens has operated for more than 25 years, designing and manufacturing high tech solutions for precision engineering, tooling, special purpose machinery and automation applications. It currently exports to 17 countries and includes among its customers companies such as Mercedes Benz, Ford, GM, Boeing and Airbus. The company employs 150 people, including 27 apprentices, and is reported to invest around 30 per cent of its annual turnover in process development and new products. Broens took out the very prestigious Global Excellence Award and the Most Outstanding Large Business Award-fitting tributes to its efforts. However, Broens was not the only company with a base in Werriwa to take home awards that night. Reln, a manufacturer and distributor of surface water drainage and effluent disposal products, based in Ingleburn, took out the Excellence in Innovation Award. Reln’s environmentally responsible solutions and recycling products are now distributed to more than 350 local governments in Australia. The Luemeah based business Editricks also received a special mention. Since 1992, Editricks has specialised in the ongoing filming, collection and preservation of historical film and video-especially that from the Macarthur region. Editricks is also an excellent corporate citizen, contributing to its community by taking on projects for charitable organisations and community events. I looked through the many and varied finalists and noticed one thing that the vast majority of them had in common: these companies are innovators in their field and all make regular and significant investments in research and development. MAIN COMMITTEE",244,Adjournment
311,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.19 Am),"We often hear people speak of the importance ofYesterday I had the opportunity to comment on the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, Working for Australia’s future, when it was presented in this chamber. HoweverI did not touch on the discussion of research and development contained in the report. The report highlights the need for more research and development by Australian business. A common view is that as a nation we need to invest much more in research and development if we are going to maintain a competitive position in the global economy. Submissions to the committee noted that Australian and New Zealand are the only two OECD countries in which private investment in research and development is lower than public investment. The success of the Werriwa based companies I have mentioned-the fact that they remain at the cutting edge and receive awards for innovation and excellence-rests on their understanding of the importance of research and development. They know that to remain at the forefront of their field they have to invest in research and continue to develop new and innovative processes and new and innovative products. The example set by the finalists of the Western Sydney Industry Awards is not one that should be lost on any of us in terms of the future of Australian industry if we are to maintain our forefront position as we approach competition in challenging global markets. All of these businesses are to be congratulated for their outstanding achievements. These businesses invest in their local areas, provide local jobs, contribute to their communities and continue to invest in research and development to help themselves innovate and grow. I congratulate all of the businesses who so deservingly received awards on the night and I look forward to businesses in Western Sydney, and in particular those in south-west Sydney continuing to make an outstanding contribution to the Australian economy-both on the national and on the international stage. (Time expired) Publications is not given where credit is due. From time to time all of us feel that maybe the very substantial contributions that we make in our different ways to public debate are not necessarily recognised. The coalition, over the last couple of days, has seen the launch of two very interesting occasional publications. I would like to congratulate my good friend Dr Andrew Southcott, the honourable member for Boothby, in Adelaide, for his publication Looking Forward. Similarly, I would like to congratulate my friends Mr Andrew Robb and Senator Mitch Fifield for publishing The Party Room. Over the last 60 years there has been a contest of ideas in politics. Over the last 60 years the world has changed. The Liberal Party stands for what it always stood for-that is, there is reward for initiative, enterprise and hard work. The Labor Party, however, no longer stands for the prime part of its platform, which was the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. When one looks at the policies of the Hawke and Keating governments, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams-I know that you personally closely scrutinised those policies and maybe you helped create them-one will see that the Labor Party has moved a long way from its ideological roots. The publication Looking Forward was launched by the Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. He drew some very interesting historical comparisons. Regrettably, a division was called just before he reached the climax of his speech, but we got the message that the Liberal Party is the party of ideas. We are the party of innovation. We are a party whose ideas, MAIN COMMITTEE",245,Adjournment
312,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.25 Am),"So often in politics we tend to get criticised and creditto a certain extent, have been stolen by the Labor Party. The point the Treasurer made was: why on earth would anyone ever vote for the Labor Party to implement policies that were originally the idea of the Liberal Party? The Prime Minister launched The Party Room. Similarly, he has been encouraging discussion on our side of politics about important issues. I want to recognise some of the contributors to the first editions of Looking Forward and The Party Room. Sixty years ago Dr David Kemp’s father, CD Kemp, when he was involved with the Victorian IPA, produced a magazine called Looking Forward. Some of that magazine was used by Sir Robert Menzies as the genesis for the philosophy of the great party that is the Liberal Party of Australia. Dr David Kemp wrote an article entitled ‘Sixty years in the battle of ideas’. For those members opposite who may not have read his article as yet, I can only commend it to them. Senator Nick Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration, contributed an article entitled, ‘Facing the Facts’. Michael Keenan, a new MP, wrote an article on Menzies’ foreign policy. The former federal president and former state president of the Young Liberals, Nick Park-who occasionally has assisted in my office; his brother Andrew Park works for the Minister for Foreign Affairs-brought the youth perspective to Looking Forward and David Crawshay wrote an article on the Liberal social reform tradition, highlighting that, in many cases, social reform in Australia has been the responsibility of the Liberal Party and not the Labor Party. Contributors to The Party Room, which is a magazine designed to reflect the views of member and senators, included Senator Brett Mason on the topic ‘The tragedy of conspicuous compassion’; Michael Keenan, again, with ‘Clear Skies Ahead’; Andrew Laming, with ‘The Power of Choice’; Kevin Andrews, with ‘The Business of Indigenous Affairs’. Dr Dennis Jensen had a very thought provoking contribution on nuclear power, ‘Time for a reasoned debate’. Senator Alan Ferguson wrote on the Commonwealth-is it more relevant to the Pacific than the UN? Wilson Tuckey-not to be outdone-wrote on funding people, not institutions, and Chris Pearce had an article entitled, ‘Bringing back the Piggybank’. The point I am making is that, in both these publications, we have encouragement of a variety of ideas. We are in a new millennium. The Liberal Party is looking forwards and the Labor Party is looking backwards. I simply want to commend the authors of both publications. (Time expired) Bendigo Electorate: Maryborough Maryborough in my electorate has been dealt yet another body blow by the Howard government. I refer to the decision by the Commonwealth government, through the Department of Family and Community Services, to reduce funding for the Goldfields Children’s Centre, which is the only child-care service in Maryborough. The announcement means that there will be a substantial reduction in funding over the next three years. The centre has been operating for the past eight years and has 18 staff, who provide care for around 65 children. This is a serious body blow to Maryborough residents, many of whom rely on low-cost child care while working mostly in part-time jobs or while spending a considerable amount of time travelling, looking for work. The ABS states that the electorate of Bendigo, of which Maryborough is a major centre, has a median weekly family income of just $736 per week. Given the high levels of unemployment in and around Maryborough, the average family income for this district would be MAIN COMMITTEE",246,Adjournment
313,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (11.30 Am),"I rise to inform the House that the rural city ofmuch lower than this figure. In fact, the general unemployment rate in Maryborough for the December 2004 quarter was 16.7 per cent-11.6 per cent higher than the national average of 5.1-with teenage unemployment expected to be around 32 per cent, which is more than double the normal rate. Maryborough’s unemployed people are being left behind because of the Howard-Costello government’s failure to invest in skills and training. If the national unemployment figure were 16.7 per cent, there would be a major scandal; yet Maryborough is expected to tolerate unemployment levels three times the national average. I believe the true unemployment figures are much higher, as these figures do not tell us how many people are only working a few hours per week. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that one in five people who work part time want more work than they currently have, and recent trends show that 90 per cent of new jobs created are part time. These figures come as Maryborough and Central Victoria feel the impact of the national skills shortage crisis, with many local businesses struggling to find qualified workers across most of the region’s industry sectors. The federal government has failed to address the growing skills crisis, and it is hurting the Maryborough community. Instead of helping local people to get the skills to find work, Mr Howard and Mr Costello are turning thousands of people away from TAFE courses and universities and we now have to import skilled labour from overseas countries. Now the community has been dealt another blow with a substantial reduction in funding for its essential child-care services. This is not the first time the Howard government’s policies have failed to assist this region in a time of crisis. I refer to the decision by the Nestle company in 2001 to close its Maryborough plant and export 140 Maryborough jobs to New Zealand. Not only did the Howard government ignore the plight of Nestle workers by doing nothing to assist them, despite repeated requests to help; it actually worsened the situation by attempting to blame the union for Nestle’s decision to move its operation offshore. In answer to a prearranged question on a Wednesday from a Liberal MP, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, launched a scathing attack on trade unions and cited industrial problems as the reason for Nestle closing its Maryborough facility and relocating to New Zealand. This was a vicious slur on Nestle’s dedicated and competent work force in Maryborough and it continued the union-bashing frenzy that the Howard government has indulged in over the past nine years. Nestle management had paid great tribute to the Maryborough workers and had never said that industrial problems were the cause of the decision to relocate. In fact, on several occasions since making the announcement to close the plant, the Nestle company went out of its way to praise its employees. When Nestle management refuted the minister’s appalling statement, the minister did not have the decency to apologise. The state Labor government has worked tirelessly to assist Maryborough in a range of areas, including attracting industries to Maryborough and, in particular, establishing a vitally important education precinct. In contrast, the Howard government has caused nothing but distress for Maryborough workers in the printing industry, the honey industry and other manufacturing industry sectors. This latest blow to the children’s centre will impact severely on an already depressed region. I urge the minister responsible to review this callous decision. The Howard government continues to treat the Maryborough region with all the compassion shown by the Third Reich. MAIN COMMITTEE Flinders Electorate: Koo Wee Rup Heritage) (11.34 am)-I am delighted today to launch a 10-point plan for the town of Koo Wee Rup within my electorate. Koo Wee Rup is a wonderful town. It has a long tradition as a farming centre for potatoes and asparagus. The clearing of the swampland over the course of the last century has helped prepare that area. Today there are many young families moving into the area. As a result, there is a series of needs, both rural and urban, which present themselves for Koo Wee Rup. In conjunction with the member for Bass in the Victorian parliament, Ken Smith, we are putting together a 10-point plan for Koo Wee Rup. The first of those points is that we will work tirelessly to replace the portable building at Koo Wee Rup police station with a permanent building. This building needs to be upgraded. It needs to be in better condition. We need to convince the state government that local law enforcement must be given a higher priority through a building upgrade and through a campaign to do that. The second thing that we will be pursuing is an upgrade of the intersection of Station Street and Rossiter Road in Koo Wee Rup. This intersection, as many locals have said to me on many occasions, is dangerous. More needs to be done to ensure that it is safe. Many heavy trucks travel through that area; they use it as a bypass. Local schoolchildren are at risk. We have three local schools. Kids pass through that area, and we have to take steps to protect them and to upgrade the intersection. The third point is that we want to help rejuvenate the streetscape in Koo Wee Rup. Both Station Street and Rossiter Street would benefit from a rejuvenation program, such as a Work for the Dole project along the lines of that which we did in conjunction with the kids from Crib Point primary in Crib Point. The fourth project which we want to pursue is about establishing more car parking spaces-in particular, working with the Cardinia Shire, a shire that does a great job, to develop a strategy to obtain more car parking in the area. The fifth project which we want to pursue is work to revitalise the train line and train station for community purposes. The state have announced that they will be reconnecting the line, and the message is very simple: please either proceed and do that, or allow the community to use the line and the station area for practical community purposes, a sensible outcome. The sixth element of the plan is to ensure that the needs of the local hospital, the Koo Wee Rup health service, are met and that there is an adequate allocation of aged care places to meet local demand. The Commonwealth allocates places but, unfortunately, the Commonwealth is not entitled to allocate anything to Koo Wee Rup Regional Health Service, because it is state owned, unless the state asks for those places. The state is standing in the way of the local community and of the board of the health service, also known as the Koo Wee Rup hospital, and preventing them from making the application. We want to work with them. We want to help deliver those aged care places. The area has need for them. We would encourage the state to allow them to make the application and to support that application. Point No. 7 in the plan for Koo Wee Rup is to work to deliver more child-care and afterschool care places for Koo Wee Rup. We have already had some recent announcements on this issue. In particular, we would like to work with local child-care providers, with the schools and also with the Koo Wee Rup Regional Health Service in providing those places. There are some very interesting proposals. A commitment both Ken and I have made is to work towards getting additional child-care places in Koo Wee Rup. MAIN COMMITTEE",247,Adjournment
314,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andThe eighth point is in relation to the Koo Wee Rup bypass. Locals overwhelmingly want the trucks out of town. They want the bypass down the Koo Wee Rup-Pakenham road. That would also help with the Clyde-Five Ways Road. The ninth point is in relation to cleaning up and paving the parking area outside Koo Wee Rup primary-a small but important project. The 10th point is to work for an Australian technical college annex for Koo Wee Rup secondary or within Koo Wee Rup, to help create additional technical opportunities. This is an area which has a proud working tradition. This would be an outstanding addition for both Koo Wee Rup and for Pakenham. I commend the 10-point plan for Koo Wee Rup to the House, and I say thankyou to the community and to the shire for their wonderful work. Carers Allowance Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.39 am)-TodayI wish to raise an issue that I have raised before in this parliament: the issue of carers allowance and carers payments for parents of children with disabilities. The particular case I would like to concentrate on today is that of a constituent called Tracey who has a son with severe autism. He has been diagnosed as having autistic spectrum disorder, global development delay and severe communication disorder. This young boy is 3½ years of age. He does not speak and is severely disabled. He requires constant care. His mother receives the carers allowance for him. Unfortunately, his mother is also eligible for carers allowance for two of his siblings. She has put in an application for carers payment and this application has been rejected by Centrelink. My office is following this up with Centrelink. This is a very big issue, one that I have been confronted with on a number of occasions. I am sure other members have also been confronted with this. These are parents who are absolutely struggling. They are working beyond their capacities to care for their disabled children. In this case I thought I would run through some of the problems that this young boy has. His mum cannot turn her back for a moment. If by some chance she closes the door but does not lock it, he will run out onto the street. If she turns around for a moment, he will turn on the stove. He has absolutely no speech at all and is not even able to point to identify what he wants. He does not answer to his name. He has problems in a number of areas and no idea whatsoever about personal safety or what will happen as a consequence of his actions. He does not play with anyone. He has all the classic symptoms of a person who suffers from autism. In addition to that, this young child has an intellectual delay. To be quite honest, his mother is really struggling to survive. Just imagine having three disabled children, with the youngest one having these severe disabilities. She has applied to Centrelink for the carers payment and been rejected. I find it very hard to believe that she is not able to be granted carers payment. The disability levels of the children have been supported by assessments that have been conducted by a clinical psychologist. She is getting support from DADHC in New South Wales. She has a child who needs 24-hour a day care. That child needs assistance with feeding and toileting and needs constant supervision for his own safety. Such a payment would ensure the security of the family and the children. It would ensure that there is less cost to the community, because if this mum cannot provide the adequate care that this young child needs then it will fall to government to pick up the cost of providing that care. Time and time again I have come across situations where parents of children with a severe disability have been refused carers allowance or carers payment and you have to go in and make strong representations. I am sure that eventually we will be able to turn this around. MAIN COMMITTEE The bottom line is that there is a problem with the assessment tools. The assessment tools need to be changed. (Time expired) Dunkley Electorate: Employment Program Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia am)-It is a great pleasure to have a few minutes to convey some thoughts about the issues and concerns of the community that I represent and also about some of the good work that is going on. In the next few weeks I will be releasing a report on an Employment Innovation Fund program to assist mature age workers into the work force. We piloted that program in the Mornington Peninsula area under the auspices of the Peninsula Job Team and South East Development. We provided a number of what were initially pilot programs aimed at tackling the barriers to mature age job seekers entering the work force. These are not only whiteand blue-collar mature age job seekers but what have been called ‘pink-collar’ mature age job seekers-people who have been primarily focused on family-raising responsibilities but who are now in a position to get back into the work force. Through the support of the federal government and the Employment Innovation Fund, we were able to host a number of workshops. The important thing about these workshops is that they sought not only to build the confidence and the optimism of the job seekers but also to make sure that mature age job seekers were meeting the market-that is, the nature of work and the expectations of employers. The workshops even raised the thought of portfolio work, where a number of part-time roles might represent the working life of a mature age person, or any person. This is the contemporary reality of the labour market. For some people who had not been in the work force for some time, there was a sense that perhaps they were looking for a kind of work that might not be there and, in effect, narrowing their own opportunities. What has been most innovative about this is that our approach has sought to dismantle or, in some cases, put to one side position descriptions that people were using to limit their own options. Some people who had had a job title or a particular role in a particular workplace or industry were looking to re-enter the work force in the same kind of industry and the same kind of role and were perhaps looking for jobs that had a very similar position description. Our view-and I think we have been vindicated by the work-was quite clear: this is not the best way of going about trying to find a job. All of us who have been in work for some time develop competencies or capacities. Through this program, we are able to look behind the job title or position description and focus on what made people successful in a whole range of different workplaces and to recognise that those skills, capacities and competencies are quite transferable into a range of new employment opportunities and enterprises in a range of different workplace arrangements that are available and for which mature age job seekers are ideally suited. As well as that avenue to the program, there are other aspects, such as making sure that information technology or computer skills are not a barrier. The program also recognises that people can get down on themselves and so perhaps will not put forward their most positive attributes when they are involved in searching for jobs after a number of disappointments. With a success rate of 50 per cent, we have clearly demonstrated that this program works. Looking at how the recent federal budget recognises mature age job seeker participation as a key employment challenge, this is a nice coming together of a national policy initiative with MAIN COMMITTEE",249,Adjournment

This program has shown that things can be done to get mature age job seekers fully involved in the work force-as they should be, if that is their choicefully contributing and also benefiting from that economic engagement. I commend that pilot program to the House. For members who are interested in mirroring the work that we have undertaken in Dunkley through the Peninsula Job Team, a report will be published shortly on that work. In the minute that is available to me, I would like to share with the House our work of a fortnight ago when I led a parliamentary delegation to Indonesia and up to Aceh to see how our relationship with the Indonesian government and the nation more generally is travelling and also to see how the reconstruction and rehabilitation work in Aceh is going. CanI say that there is no race to spend the money. It is not a reckless charge to unload cash in an area that has been devastated. There are some fundamental decisions that the Acehnese have been making and need to make, such as: do you reconstruct where the devastation is the greatest? The coastline has dropped by about a metre in the areas that have been devastated. Does one simply reconstruct without assessing whether that is wise and in the long-term interest? The Acehnese have been making those assessments, and the Indonesian government have been very focused on that. People need to come to grips with the actual work to be done.

Proposed Brickworks at Perth Airport good folk of Hazelmere as part of the federal electorate of Swan. Through a redistribution in 2000, however, Hazelmere became part of the new federal seat of Hasluck and was splendidly represented for three years by Sharryn Jackson. At the last election Stuart Henry won the seat for the Liberal Party. While I no longer represent the suburb specifically, I rise today to discuss a proposed new development in Hazelmere on Commonwealth land leased to Perth Airport. The terminals on the majority of the grounds of Perth Airport fall within my electorate; and, as I said, while the proposed development falls within Hasluck, the potential impact on my own local community is significant. The project I wish to draw the House’s attention to today relates to the leasing of Commonwealth land to the private company BGC for the purposes of a new brickworks. Members from other states may not know that the economic boom in Western Australia over the last few years under the Gallop administration has meant that there are simply not enough bricks for the number of houses being built. Despite the federal Treasurer’s attempt to cripple the Western Australian economy by recently calling for businesses to move out of my home state, sound social, economic and environmental policies under the Gallop government are bringing more people to Western Australia than ever before. There is a genuine need for more bricks in Western Australia, and companies such as BGC that are able to fill this demand swiftly are to be commended. To say, however, that there is community unease within both my electorate and that of Hasluck over the brickworks development is an understatement. I understand that the member for Hasluck was represented at a community forum recently hosted by the state member for MidMAIN COMMITTEE",251,Adjournment

Under Geoff Gallop, Western Australians are benefiting from one of the most environmentally conscious governments in my state’s history. The state Minister for the Environment, Judy Edwards, is a committed advocate for WA’s beautiful but sometimes fragile environment. She is part of a government which has successfully balanced concern for the environment with economic and industrial progress. It is a shame that the same level of concern for the environment is not shared by the federal government. I join with Minister Edwards today in remarks she has conveyed to the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Ian Campbell, that the brickworks development at Perth Airport must be assessed by an environmental impact statement under federal environmental laws. This is the minimum level at which the proposal should be assessed, especially as the development potentially could increase brickworks omissions during the strong easterly breezes of summer over my own electorate. It is essential that the proposal be subject to an open and transparent public consultation process and that issues of potential hazards to native vegetation, declared rare flora and threatened ecological communities are assessed. I am equally concerned about the increasing use of Commonwealth controlled land for non-airport related developments. Already the brickworks development will see a local golf club removed from the grounds of the airport. There are already three brickworks in the region, and the Swan Valley air shed, which my constituents breathe, may already be overloaded with toxins. I intend to expand on this and other issues relating to the Commonwealth’s conduct at Perth Airport when parliament resumes. Today’s announcement in five minutes time from Mr Anderson is, I imagine, that he is stepping down as Minister for Transport and Regional Services. It is, I believe, a step in the right direction for a number of reasons. One leading transport representative said to me only 15 minutes ago that this may be one small step for Mr Anderson but it is one large step for Australia. It is also one giant step forward for the people in Swan. I hope that the new minister will start to put some focus back on Western Australia in terms of transport infrastructure. I have already spoken in this place about the need for more funding for the Great Eastern Highway and how the current AusLink program is ‘EastLink’ as far as we are concerned because it is so focused on this side of the country. We need that focus back on Western Australia. In terms of the new minister, I would wish the member for Parkes well. I would like to see Mr Cobb advance somewhat. I think he would do a good job in that portfolio. The Gallop government is protecting and enhancing the state’s lifestyle and environment. The Commonwealth government should share in that commitment to Western Australia. I look forward to hearing the member for Hasluck’s views on the brickworks development in his own backyard. Sitting suspended from 11.55 am to 12.30 pm Supported Accommodation Assistance Program Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (12.30 pm)-I want to speak very briefly today on the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. This very important program commenced in MAIN COMMITTEE January 1985 and is designed to address the needs of Australia’s homeless people. In December 2004, the Howard government announced its funding offer to the states and territories for the fifth round of funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, known as SAAP 5, which is for the forward five years and is proposed to start from 1 July 2005. The Commonwealth’s offer is an allocation of $931 million over five years, with indexation of just 2.1 per cent. This represents no increase in Commonwealth funding for the SAAP agreement beyond indexation, despite the fact that the Homeless People in SAAP: National Data Collection Annual Report 2003-04-the government’s own report-outlined that the program was operating at capacity and needed a funding injection of 15 per cent just to meet unmet demand. We hear now that this 15 per cent is needed just to keep open the doors of many of the homeless shelters that I deal with, including women’s refuges. During budget estimates the government admitted that every day, nationally, around 300 people are turned away from Supported Accommodation Assistance Program services. That is a very significant number of people. Of those people, a substantial number are women and children who become homeless because they are fleeing domestic violence. Around 20 per cent of people who seek assistance do so because of domestic violence. In addition, around 22 per cent of the services funded under this program are targeted at that demand. Fifty-eight per cent of all SAAP clients are women. Starting in March 2005, the New South Wales Women’s Refuge Resource Centre asked all its member refuges to send a letter to Minister Patterson whenever they had to turn women and children away from their centre’s services, so that the minister would become aware of the human effects of the government’s refusal to increase SAAP funding. To date, 16 refuges have participated by sending 150 letters to the minister, telling of 512 women and 585 children being turned away from supported accommodation at refuges-I repeat: 585 children. Most of these refuges are in regional areas such as Tamworth, Maitland, Ulandra, Kempsey, Tweed Shire, Wagga Wagga, Katoomba, the Central Coast, Forbes and Woy Woy. If a person is turned away from such a service in one of these towns, they have nowhere else to go, as most of the towns have one refuge-and that is it. It is common that women and children fleeing home because of domestic violence do so with just the clothes they stand up in. They seldom have money or possessions with them. So to be turned away from a refuge is dire indeed. Women’s refuges play a vital role in assisting women and children escaping from domestic violence and in trying to prevent them from becoming homeless. When a woman and her children finally gain the courage to leave a violent man and go to a refuge but are told that there is no room for them, in many cases they will return home-and the consequences of that are quite disastrous. One refuge on the Central Coast, in some of its letters to the minister, outlined the circumstances of people who were turned away. It told of a 33-year-old woman who had been homeless for over 12 months since leaving a violent partner; a 26-year-old mother with two children, aged nine and four; a 21-year-old woman with a 19-month-old son; a woman with two children who had been living out of her car for the previous three days; and a woman with four children who had stayed in another refuge for eight weeks. They also told of a woman with four children, aged 17, 15, 11 and 10-her 15-year-old daughter also had a very young baby-who had been refused 17 rentals. They also told of a woman with three children who had been referred by the Newcastle Domestic Violence Information and Referral Line. MAIN COMMITTEE We are letting these people down by not providing adequate funding for them. We encourage women to leave violent situations but, when they do, the first place they turn to tells them there is no room at the inn. They have no alternative but to go back to violent partners. (Time expired) Aviation Services: Gold Coast the tourism industry in Australia and particularly for the Gold Coast, Australia’s premier tourism destination. I am very pleased that over 20 per cent of the people in my electorate are directly or indirectly employed in the tourism industry and that some 35 per cent of our local economy is made off the back of the tourism industry. It is a vibrant industry that provides excellent career opportunities and that I believe will go from strength to strength. In many respects, the success of the tourism industry is borne upon the ability of people to travel. By definition, tourism is the travelling of people from one destination to another to have new experiences, to enjoy new delights, to have the opportunity to learn more about other cultures and, of course, to participate in a range of activities. The Gold Coast offers more than most-that is part of our natural competitive advantage. A key debate taking place of late, though, relates to the provision of airline services to the Gold Coast. It is Australia’s sixth largest city and it is rapidly growing. There has been a very strong push of late regarding the need for more transport infrastructure to the city, particularly for the resumption of airline services by Qantas. The Gold Coast continues to prosper in terms of the demand for tourism. In many respects that has been brought about by two key changes recently in the dynamics of the airline travel market into the Gold Coast. One of these was the commencement of the low-cost carrier airline, Virgin Blue, and the other was the initiation of Qantas’s no-frills carrier, Jetstar. Both of these airlines have played a very significant role in attracting new tourists to the Gold Coast. Both of these airlines have played a very significant role in growing the market pie, so to speak-attracting more people and providing more opportunities for people to travel to holiday destinations like the Gold Coast. Nonetheless, there has been a very strong view within elements of the Gold Coast community that this has come about, in some part, at the expense of the city’s business base and its premium-yield clients, business tourists. There has been some angst in the Gold Coast community that Qantas has not been able to satisfy the demand for additional services and additional scheduled Qantas flights in and out of the Gold Coast. I have spoken about this issue with Qantas on many occasions. I must state very clearly on the record that Qantas has always demonstrated an openness and a willingness to have conversations about the long-term sustainability and the best shape of the Gold Coast inbound travel market. WhilstI certainly understand the concerns a number of tour operators, chambers of commerce and business leaders have about the need for Qantas’s premium brand to fly into the Gold Coast, it is very clear that a business case must be made. Qantas has always demonstrated to me a willingness to talk, but also it has stated very clearly that there must be a commercially sustainable business case put to it for additional flights beyond the two a day now made to the Gold Coast. Tourism operators in my city certainly want to have an additional lunchtime flight by Qantas into the Gold Coast that would enable better interlining for inbound international passengers. But it is very important that, instead of simply calling for this, we demonstrate that it can MAIN COMMITTEE",252,Adjournment
318,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (12.35 Pm),"The past several weeks have certainly been big forbe done in a sustainable way. I note that Virgin Blue recently announced that it would be providing business class services on its traditionally no-frills carrier. This decision tends to demonstrate to me that a business case can be made. I call upon all those in the Gold Coast tourism industry to join with me in putting together a case to demonstrate the merits of Qantas reestablishing more services beyond the two flights a day that it currently has into the Gold Coast. We certainly have the ability to put a rational argument that there is demand, especially when Virgin Blue, a competitive carrier, has made announcements about going down that path. We welcome the commitment from Virgin Blue, we are thankful for Jetstar’s contribution to the Gold Coast economy, and we are grateful that Qantas provides the services that it does. But we will continue to push for more services, believing it to be a win-win situation both for Qantas as a premium carrier and for the Gold Coast. (Time expired) Telstra Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.40 pm)-I wish to raise a case that I think is extremely important. It is a David and Goliath story; the Goliath of course is Telstra and the David is a three-person company in my electorate called Stickybeek. It is important to note that in March 2004 Telstra’s directories arm Sensis paid $636 million for the assets of the Trading Post group. Obviously online marketing is a lucrative business. At the time commentators said that that price was ‘way outside the criterion for such an acquisition’. Ziggy Switkowski conceded that they had paid ‘a very full price’. It seems to me that they will do anything to recover that cost which they paid for the Trading Post. My constituent came to me in October to say that his business was being prejudiced by what he saw as the predatory behaviour of the Trading Post-that is, Sensis and Telstra. What was happening was that when you went into a search engine like Google and typed in ‘Stickybeek’ because you wanted to look at a car that was for sale, a search page would come up with Stickybeek’s listings. But on the right-hand side of the screen would come up the word ‘stickybeek’ also spelt with a ‘double e’ not an ‘ea’. When you clicked on that you would go directly to the Trading Post site. One would think that that is an unacceptable trade practice. When he sought my advice I advised him to take the matter to the ACCC. We do have regulators and we should have faith in them. Certainly as a three-person company with a registered trademark at risk he was not able to take on a corporate giant like Telstra-and certainly not able to take on the litigation costs that might arise. During the time that we were taking this up with the ACCC my client videoed everything that occurred on the sites. It did not just happen on Google; there were something like 12 search engines which were also displaying the word ‘stickybeek’ with a direct link to the Trading Post. Everyone here knows that that is a distinct competitive disadvantage for my client. The ACCC finally made their decision this week. It is one that I am dissatisfied with and one that my constituent is dissatisfied with. Certainly they reviewed the practice and were concerned about it. When they wrote to the Trading Post and alerted it to this practice it instantly ceased. That was too late for my client, of course, who lost customers and contracts out of this. The enforcement committee made the decision that, in their judgment, the Trading Post’s conduct may have contravened sections 52 and 53D of the Trade Practices Act and therefore may have constituted misleading or deceptive conduct and misrepresentation of an affiliation or sponsorship that the Trading Post did not have in suggesting that it was Stickybeek. Today, interestingly, because I have registered my dissatisfaction with the ACCC’s deciMAIN COMMITTEE sion and my constituent has registered his dissatisfaction, a representative of Graeme Samuel, the Chairman of the ACCC, contacted my constituent saying that, yes, they have reviewed the video clip, which they have had for many months, which shows beyond doubt that this was what the Telstra-Sensis-Trading Post was doing. Those sections of the Trade Practices Act are clear on this. It seems that the committee’s decision then was, ‘Okay, it may have breached the act, but because that practice has stopped we are not going to take it any further.’ I do not know what small businesses in regional Australia have to do already to protect themselves from predatory competitors of huge scale. When Telstra is no longer half owned by the government and has no regulator, one wonders what chance they will have at all. It seems to me that this is a case that should have gone to the full commission. I would call today in parliament for Graeme Samuel to make that decision and to review the case to protect everyone using the internet and to protect everyone using online marketing and online advertising. This is a case that I think deserves thorough attention and review by the ACCC. It is not good enough for my client to just be told, ‘Yes, we think they were wrong and they were doing the wrong thing by you,’ and ‘Yes, it may have cost you money. You have recourse under civil action; you can take it to protracted litigation if you have millions of dollars.’ Most small businesses in Australia do not have millions of dollars. This is a case of corporate muscle being used in absolute disregard of the law. (Time expired) Country of Origin Labelling try of origin labelling and the important role that that is likely to play in the growth of our retail sector, with a particular focus on the grocery subsector of Australian industry. It is worth noting that the entire retail industry is worth $223 billion a year-an extraordinary figure when we talk about government revenues and expenditure-and 25 per cent of that is devoted to the grocery sector. It has been in a stage of consecutive growth over the last five years of approximately five per cent per annum. Despite this growth and the increase in availability of retail products to consumers in all parts of Australia, we can also report that, as a percentage of disposable income, the amount of money spent on retail products, and groceries in particular, is falling. That is a product of better services, better products and lower prices relative to wages, and the result of strong competition in the sector, delivering more for shoppers. Figures taken from 1980 show that an average of 13.9 per cent was spent on groceries, but, over a generation, that figure has fallen to an astounding 10.3 per cent. That is a large change for households. Demographic changes, such as the slowing population growth and smaller families, better access to supermarkets and a larger range of groceries are forcing down prices compared with the CPI, and that is also evidenced with the lower levels of inflation that we have enjoyed in the last five years. The role of technology has been important as well, and, despite a concern that I will mention later about consolidation in the retail and grocery industry, we are seeing the arrival of new merchandising strategies, electronic labelling, distribution sales and markdowns, which are all becoming more and more prominent. In addition to consolidation of the retail industry, in groceries in particular, there are some new entrants. The arrival of Aldi has considerably changed grocery purchasing habits in my electorate of Bowman. In this case, the residents are the beneficiaries of choice, with many people availing themselves of new competition where before there was less. A combination of consolidation in the industry with, at the same time, MAIN COMMITTEE",255,Adjournment
319,Mr Laming (Bowman) (12.45 Pm),"TodayI wish to highlight the importance of counnew entrants reflects a Blue Ocean Strategy approach to the sector-that is, just when it seems to be consolidating, quite often it simply opens up new opportunities for new entrants to offer different products to differentiate and take advantage of newly created markets that we could not have dreamt of only a few years ago. Obviously, total retail expenditure is coming off a relative high point in the growth cycle. There are some questions about forecasting exactly where the grocery sector will be heading. I want to highlight that, while estimates range between three and five per cent in real terms per annum, at the same time there is the question of a growing current account deficit and the role that further country of origin labelling and more obvious Australian made and Australian product marking on labels could play. A number of surveys have been done within Australia, and I would like to highlight the following questions that were asked in the Australian Made campaign. In that survey shoppers were asked: thinking about shopping, how often do you consciously buy Australian made? Would you rely on or look for particular factors if you were looking for an Australian product? How easy or difficult do you think manufacturers make it for you to identify a product as being Australian? When you see ‘made in Australia’ or ‘product of Australia’ on the packaging, what is your understanding of those two claims? The findings were that almost half of all Australian adults buy Australian made products wherever possible. That suggests that customers are likely to be less price sensitive than we might otherwise expect. They may well actually be seeking out Australian made products. I conclude with the point that there are some business and marketing opportunities for Australian producers in coming together and labelling more clearly the origins of the ingredients in their products. We could see a growth in locally and domestically produced groceries, and a corresponding fall in the amount of imported groceries that are produced, simply by making more crystal clear country of origin labelling. I know there have been some moves to approach industry in this area and to offer clear labelling in exchange for a small contribution to continue an Australian Made product campaign. I would support that effort fully, and I wish industry all success in promoting Australian made products. (Time expired) Indigenous Health through the United Nations, established eight Millennium Development Goals. These are specified targets to be achieved by 2015 which, broadly summarised, are about improving the lives of the poorest citizens in the world and form part of the fight against global poverty. That decision was important for a number of reasons. TodayI want to focus on one part and consider its application in Australia. The global community essentially decided that they wanted to focus on outputs instead of inputs and processes. Debates about inputs in overseas development have been important for a long time. There has been a debate about the 0.7 per cent target. The debate about process is also important-grants versus loans; multilateral versus bilateral. They are all important, but we decided as a global community to focus on outcomes. That decision has been important because it has generated serious, focused activities-for example, by the UK with Gordon Brown’s initiative for an international finance facility and by the United States through the millennium challenge accounts. These are different but both are positively targeted at achieving those goals. MAIN COMMITTEE",257,Adjournment
320,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (12.51 Pm),"Some five years ago the international community,I have been disappointed that Australia has done so little, but that is not my point of focus today; that is for another debate. I want to raise the fact that we should consider taking the same approach with regard to the circumstances of Indigenous Australians. We need to do something about setting an Australian equivalent of Millennium Development Goals, where we focus on outcomes rather than inputs and processes. I am very determined that we should do that. It is not my advocacy that we should abandon the rights agenda. That is quite a different issue, and I will continue to speak out about land issues and Indigenous rights. But in Australia we are crying out for some outcomes, and we are not focusing on them because we are debating issues of inputs and processes. I want to start the debate with some suggestions as to what those goals might be, although I am not yet in a position to articulate what I think the final list should be. I would start with some of the initiatives of the AMA. First, they have raised issues about the life expectancy gap, which is a scandal in Australia. When you compare us with the other comparable countries-Canada, the United States and New Zealand-the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is wider than in any of those three countries. In those three countries the gap is narrowing, but in Australia it is getting wider. So that is one place I am determined we should start. A second very positive initiative taken by the AMA recently is about low birth weight babies. They believe a $20 million campaign would change the life opportunities of Indigenous babies by reducing the number of babies with low birth weight, which has significance for poor health for the rest of their lives. Low birth weight spills over into a number of the issues, such as renal failure, which we see as a blight on the Indigenous community without proper explanation. The AMA suggest that this is related to the low birth weight issue and talk about some positive initiatives that we could take. A third issue, which the AMA also raised previously, is about Indigenous doctors-and, I might say, other Indigenous health workers as well. They are not of themselves the solution to the problem, but there is no solution without more Indigenous doctors, health workers and dentists. Clearly we need to focus on the area of education. There are some issues to do with secondary school attendance and achievement at year 10 and year 12 and just opportunities for attendance. Some two years ago, I commented on the decline in Indigenous Australians training as teachers. The number is actually falling-not as a percentage but in absolute numbers. Whatever you think the solution to Indigenous education is, there is no solution without Indigenous teachers. Other issues to consider are housing and the incarceration rate. That is just a starting point. I want to suggest this: in a partisan way we will argue about inputs and processes, but let us set nationally some goals that we can strive for to say it is not right in Australia in the 21st century that we have a difference in life expectancy that is wide and widening, that we have a crisis of low birth weight babies, and that we have a crisis in access by Indigenous children in remote communities to secondary education. Let us set some goals and argue about how to get there. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE University of the Sunshine Coast Sunshine Coast Grammar School lease issued by the deputy federal Labor leader, the shadow minister for education, the member for Jagajaga, when she wrongly accused the Howard government of increasing HECS fees for students at the well respected University of the Sunshine Coast. She also suggested that there had been a cut in funding for the University of the Sunshine Coast-in the amount of money given to that university-by the Australian government. If it was not for the Australian government, in fact this Liberal government, we would not have a University of the Sunshine Coast as such and it would not have been able to obtain independent status as the University of the Sunshine Coast and escape from being the Sunshine Coast University College under the auspices of the Queensland University of Technology. I pay tribute in particular to the former minister for education, Dr David Kemp. He was the minister at the time the university was seeking an acceleration of its independent status. The University of the Sunshine Coast always was a freestanding institution able to issue its own degrees, but as the Sunshine Coast University College, operating, as it does, in a competitive tertiary environment, it would not have had the opportunity to grow as it has or to attract as many students as it has. The honourable member for Fairfax and I, with the then chancellor of the university and the vice-chancellor, Professor Paul Thomas, went to see Dr David Kemp. The recommendation from the department of education was that the federal government ought not to give consent to the independent status of the college, but Dr Kemp was a visionary person who was not a ‘yes, minister’ type; he handed the advice from the department recommending against independence of the University of the Sunshine Coast across to the chancellor and vicechancellor and said, ‘This is what you have to overcome.’ The chancellor and the vice-chancellor went away, did some work on the proposal and brought forward an amended case. The result was that the then minister for education gave consent to the Sunshine Coast University College becoming an independent institution known as the University of the Sunshine Coast. It had its own access to university funding in the same way other universities have access to funding, and, through Dr Kemp and his successor, the current Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, it has been a substantial beneficiary of this government’s focus on the importance of regional universities. As a government, we have pledged $23.3 million over the next four years to the University of the Sunshine Coast. This includes an additional 10,080 student places as well as 64 Commonwealth learning scholarships worth up to $24,000 each to be used for expenses such as textbooks and computers. These funding allocations will go a long way to further boost the excellent services and facilities of the University of the Sunshine Coast. It ought to be noted-and I think it is recognised in my local community-that the Australian Labor Party actually voted against all of these important allocations. The shadow minister for education blamed the government for a massive HECS fee increase. I just want to set the record straight: the decision to raise HECS fees at the University of the Sunshine Coast was made by the university itself and announced last year. It is obvious that the Labor Party is just continuing to seek to deflect attention from its own shortcomings MAIN COMMITTEE",258,Adjournment
321,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (12.56 Pm),"I was particularly disappointed to read of a media reby trying to regurgitate an issue dating back almost 10 months. Dr Nelson, the current minister, has visited the university and when the additional places were allocated, the University of the Sunshine Coast obtained a huge proportion of new places given to Queensland. In the remaining seconds, I would like to congratulate the Sunshine Coast Grammar School, and in particular to wish its 2005 UK cricket tour team every success. There was a letter of good wishes which I was able to obtain from the Prime Minister; there was also one from the Premier and one from the mayor of Maroochy Shire. Yesterday, I handed the booklet from the university setting out details of the team and its program to the Prime Minister, who was particularly impressed. We all know that the Prime Minister is a keen cricket fan. I noticed that he read the publication from cover to cover and was most impressed with the content and production quality. On behalf of the parliament and on my own behalf as the member for Fisher, I would like to wish the Sunshine Coast Grammar School 2005 UK cricket tour team every success. (Time expired) Chiquita Park Howard government needs to respond to concerning Chiquita Park, which is in the municipal area of Kingston in Melbourne’s south-eastern suburbs. This park was sold by the federal Department of Defence in December 2001. The park had been used by the local community and leased by the local council, Kingston council, for use as a park since 1955. I was born in 1955 so I try to say it is not so long ago, but some people would say that that is a very long time ago. Certainly there is a strong tradition of local use of this area as a park. It sits in an area with one of the lowest open space provisions in Kingston and it has been identified as having significant remnant native vegetation. At the time the land was sold by the federal defence department, Kingston council passed up the opportunity to buy it. That was unfortunate. At the time, there was a Liberal state MP representing that area and a Liberal dominated local council. The land was purchased by Croft Health Care. My understanding is that they are significant Liberal Party supporters and donors. They on-sold the land seven months later, for a very large profit, to a company called Omni Developments. Local outrage concerning this has been significant. I know that local people have been trying to save as much of that park as possible, but the federal government has given them what appears to me to be a very raw deal in selling this land in the way that it did. We have the following situation. The government sold the defence department land known as Chiquita Park. The land had been used as far back as 1955. The amount that it was sold for to Croft Health Care was, I understand, $2,226,500. And this company was able to sell the property in July 2002, just seven months later, for $3 million, a profit of over $700,000, to Omni Developments. There are two issues here. First, what process did the department of finance and the government go through prior to selling the land to consider whether it should have been retained in public hands and made available for ongoing use for people in the community. Secondly, once the government determined that it was going to sell the land, what steps did the department of finance take to ensure that this land was sold to the highest bidder and that taxpayers received full value for the land. The fact that it was able to be sold for an additional $700,000 MAIN COMMITTEE",260,Adjournment
322,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (1.01 Pm),"I wish to raise an issue that I believe thejust seven months later suggests that it was sold for considerably less than it was worth. I believe that these are serious questions for the federal government that it needs to respond to. Leader of The Nationals and Deputy Prime Minister Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (1.04 pm)-I have just come from the House of Representatives chamber, where we are farewelling the Hon. John Anderson as Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party. Of course he continues as the member for Gwydir. I want to pay my respects to him as a very great man in this place and to put on the record that John has been a great champion of rural and regional people. It is not just in the way that he has helped develop policies, although I should mention those. One of course is the National Water Initiative. Not since the time of Alfred Deakin have we seriously taken into account property ownership rights and access to water-and Alfred Deakin was operating in the 1880s in Victoria. There was a real problem in Australia, with different jurisdictions treating water in different ways, not just through pricing but through its allocation, and there were different ways of understanding the ownership of and access to water. John Anderson has been a champion in trying to develop national consistency not only in understanding the resource and the need to sustain it but also in the treatment of water so that it delivers the highest value and is used most efficiently. There are also the infrastructure issues. The Roads to Recovery program is probably the most popularly supported system of grants that have come to any part of rural or regional Australia. For the first time, local councils got access to Commonwealth funds directly for roads. The roads could be minor; they could be dirt or gravel roads that had never seen a lick of bitumen in the many, many years-sometimes hundreds-that they had been there. With the Roads to Recovery funding, we have seen significant improvements in access for country communities, not only in taking product to market but also in delivering basic needs such as getting children to schools and enabling small communities to go about their daily business. AusLink is of course an extraordinary program, one that will usher in a new relationship between the states, the Commonwealth and the private sector, when it comes to addressing not only ageing infrastructure but also the critical business of expanded road, rail, sea and air networks. These networks are essential in maximising the export earnings of our country and in ensuring that the domestic economy can grow and that our social infrastructure can be linked by decent access. I also want to talk about John Anderson’s contribution as the member for Gwydir, a large rural seat. Representing a rural seat is not like representing a geographically small suburban place, where the issues might be fairly limited in terms of a set of commuters in residences that have a fair homogeneity about them. When you represent a rural region, like many of us do, there is a whole battery of issues which are life and death issues for the populations that live there. They include everything from health and education to issues about ageing, labour shortages and skills shortages. They also include issues about the very identity of people who come from a rural and regional area, when they face the day-to-day onslaught of television, radio and even daily newspapers which have come from a very different perspective-a metropolitan or capital city type perspective. When you represent a seat that is as demanding as a rural and regional seat, as John Anderson has done, and you also have the enormous job of being Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, you deserve to be commended, and we have to commend John MAIN COMMITTEE Anderson for the extraordinary tasks that he has performed. Of course, it has been difficult for his family-for Julia and their four children. There has been sadness in his family, with the loss of a child during this time. We understand only too well that, while the parliament will lose a leader, Julia and her children will regain a husband and a father in terms of his ability to give them his time-the most precious part of any parenting. I commend the extraordinary contribution of John Anderson, and I wish him well in whatever he does in the future. Aircraft Noise noise and Sydney airport. I raised this matter earlier this week in this chamber, as you no doubt will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, in the consideration in detail debate on the appropriation bills. I note the comments just made by the member for Murray. I, like the member for Murray, was in the chamber a little over an hour ago when the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services announced his resignation. Part of that decision, we understand, is due to health reasons. I wish Minister Anderson and his family very, very well. It is sad when someone has to leave very important positions such as those which Minister Anderson has held within his party and also within this House. He goes with the good wishes of everyone I know, because he is a good man. However, I have to keep fighting for my constituents, and Minister Anderson, as the relevant minister, has been the person responsible in relation to Sydney airport and aircraft noise. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I was elected to this House in 1998 on this issue. I have campaigned more on this issue than on any other issue in the time that I have been the member for Lowe and I will continue to do so, notwithstanding the resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister. Curiously, yesterday in question time the Deputy Prime Minister was asked a dorothy dixer by the member for Barker and he gave what I could only describe as a highly provocative response for someone like me and, of course, the member for Grayndler, Anthony Albanese. I remarked to Anthony Albanese in the chamber very soon after the Deputy Prime Minister had given that response to the House that he must be contemplating his retirement, because it was just so obvious that under the coalition government we were never, ever going to see a full implementation of the long-term operating plan, which would give fair distribution of aircraft noise to the people of Sydney, particularly to those in my electorate and in Grayndler who cop the most noise. ‘White elephant’ was the phrase that the Deputy Prime Minister used in saying that there would never be a second airport. I interjected in the chamber and said that that was nonsense, because quite obviously, if we do not plan for a second airport, the expansion of Sydney airport under the existing master plan-which the government has happily presided over-will result in horrendous consequences for my electorate. When the minister gave his reply yesterday in the House, it was clearly intended for the ears of the Macquarie Bank board and Mr Max Moore-Wilton and the Southern Cross consortium. In the short time. I have, I want to make the point that the minister made a number of false assumptions in his answer to the House yesterday. The policy intent of sections 18 to 22 of the Airports Act simply does not exist, and unless a second airport is built to take the pressure off Sydney airport the long-term operating plan can never, ever be fairly achieved-thus demonstrating the absolute hypocrisy of the Deputy Prime Minister’s repeated statements over the years that Sydney airport’s noise problems have been solved. MAIN COMMITTEE",261,Adjournment
323,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (1.09 Pm),"I wish to raise yet again this week the issue of aircraftWhen the government gave the first right of refusal for the future owner of a second airport to build Sydney West airport, I asked the minister why the government would do so if a second airport was not necessary in the foreseeable future. Quite honestly, the Deputy Prime Minister could have taken action to repeal sections 18 to 22 of the Airports Act, because a second Sydney airport is never going to come to realisation under a coalition government and that legislation is just giving false hope to the people of Sydney that they will get one. I can assure you that the people of Sydney in my electorate of Lowe will not forget. The public will not forget the facts. Sydney needs a second airport, and the aircraft noise problems need to be solved. (Time expired) Local Answers Program be here representing people and talking about large policy issues, it is really the issues that affect people on the ground that people are concerned about. They want us to be able to make a difference in the circumstances that surround their lives. SoI am very happy to talk about the Local Answers program-a part of the Stronger Families and Communities Strategywhich aims to help people find answers for their own communities and their own families at the local level. As a result of this program, there are funding rounds now taking place giving communities the opportunity to identify answers to their own problems. Due to the success of the initiative in the past, there has been a further commitment of $70 million to the expansion of Local Answers. That will bring the total funding up to $137 million over four years. The programs this has helped in the past have included things like parenting and relationship skills programs as well as mentoring and leadership programs. I was very happy last week to be in contact with the Northern Area Community and Youth Services in Davoren Park in the electorate of Wakefield to announce to them the fact that they had been awarded money through this program for their proposed project on family solutions to family conflict. It does not matter what strata of society you come from, family conflict is something that is very damaging. As we look at the divorce rate and the dysfunction that follows, we see the incredibly damaging results of family conflict. SoI applaud any scheme that is going to help give families, particularly parents, the skills they need to relate well to each other, to resolve conflict and to parent well. Just yesterday I spoke in the House on the government’s aims to reform the family law system. Some of those reforms in particular looked at targeting measures that will help support relationships before any breakdown takes place. Some of those will occur at the corporate level and will be implemented by government and large bodies, but just as important are the programs that are run at the community level where they get alongside people and give individual families the skills that they need so that that family, and the extended family and community affected by them, have the skills to keep relationships strong. I commend Clare Dilliway and her staff working at NACYS, the Northern Area Community and Youth Services, for the work that they have done in providing opportunities for people in the Peachey Belt to come together and find solutions that work for their community. This funding of $118,000 is shared with another group in that area called the Bounce Back Foundation, which looks to reconnect young people into school communities. This is yet another area where the Howard government is providing resources to local communities so that MAIN COMMITTEE",263,Adjournment
324,Mr Fawcett (Wakefield) (1.14 Pm),"As most of us in this place know, whilst we canthey can find the answers to strengthen our families for the benefit of all Australians. I commend Clare and her staff at the Northern Area Community and Youth Services for their work. Leader of The Nationals and Deputy Prime Minister Holt Electorate: Cranbourne Telephone Rates today, I want to make note of the resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, from his position as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services on the basis of health and family factors. Many of us come to this place and spend substantial periods of time away from our families. In my experience I found the Deputy Prime Minister to be a very good man and a man who tried, on the basis of his values and principles, to make our community a better place. I would certainly have liked to have seen him resign under more propitious and favourable circumstances. I want, from my side of the House, to acknowledge the contribution that he has made and wish him and his family very well in the future. I rise tonight to talk specifically about STD rates in Cranbourne as a first-order issue. The member for Wakefield has just spoken about politics in the local. Whilst we may feel that a number of the big picture issues that we debate in this place are of critical importance, it is the issues around small things-or supposedly small things-in our local communities that matter. One of the issues that matter for residents in Cranbourne-which is a fantastic community, a rapidly expanding community about 41 kilometres south-east of Melbourne-is that they, as a consequence of their location and an historical anomaly, have to pay STD rates when they call out of Cranbourne to places like Melbourne. Cranbourne is the epicentre of a very rapid growth corridor of Melbourne. If you look at the 2001 census figure, you see that the population of Cranbourne was about 36,273 people. There has been a very substantial population increase of about 49 per cent in about 10 years. A large population of young families live in this area. It has a very high percentage of residents in the 24to 35-year age group and the zero-to-nine age group. From a geographical perspective, calls made by people in areas surrounding Cranbourne, like Berwick and Narre Warren South, are charged as untimed local calls; yet calls made by people in Cranbourne, which is a rapidly expanding area that is adjacent to suburbs such as Berwick and Narre Warren South, are charged at the STD rate. This is just crazy. Looking back and working out why Cranbourne was incorporated with areas that pay the STD rate, one can see that it is due to the anomaly of a boundary. These boundaries were created in the 1960s and, it is believed, were used as a basis for Melbourne metropolitan taxi tariffs. So it is a historical anomaly. But Cranbourne is very much part of the Greater Melbourne suburban area. It is linked by suburban train services and by road to Melbourne Central. In the old days of the 1960s, when these boundaries were established, Cranbourne was a rural country town, but it has very much changed. Cranbourne residents are saying that Telstra should recognise that change has occurred and, as a consequence, no STD tariff rate should apply. In fact, the state government of Victoria recognised this in the Melbourne 2030 strategic plan. As I have said, Cranbourne is one of the five key growth areas of Melbourne, and the Victorian government views it as part of Greater Melbourne. MAIN COMMITTEE",264,Adjournment
325,Mr Byrne (Holt) (1.17 Pm),"BeforeI address the issue of substance I want to talk aboutFor a long period, the residents of Cranbourne have felt disadvantaged. They had to lobby for 10 years to get a Medicare office. Their local information and support service is underfunded for the emergency relief that it provides. As a consequence of globalisation, occupations within the community have undergone substantial change. The predominant occupations in Cranbourne are those of tradespeople in the construction industry. They feel that Telstra should recognise the changed nature of their community. I call upon Telstra to be a good corporate citizen. It would not cost Telstra much to take Cranbourne out of the STD zone and charge calls made there as untimed local calls. It would be good for business, it would be good for families and it would buy corporate goodwill. I know that the minister is being visited by a delegation from the City of Casey, and I would urge her to urge Telstra to be a good corporate citizen: to take this tariff off and give the residents of Cranbourne the equity and fairness they deserve. Drought thank the previous speaker for his very generous remarks. But what is equally emotional I suppose-and John Anderson would know this better than most-is to go through parched countryside that is part of your electorate. Gwydir has been one of the electorates that have suffered very heavily, as has my electorate of Hinkler. In the areas of what is known as the Burnett-Gayndah, Mundubbera, Eidsvold, Monto and Perry-the drought has been very cruel and very demoralising. Many regional and rural people will be sleeping a little easier after the much needed rain that fell this week, and I certainly want to get back to see how widespread that has been and whether there are any pockets that have missed out. We should also recognise that the problem of drought is not solved with the first downpour of rain; it takes farming communities a long time to recover. It means too that drought assistance needs to continue for a fair while after the actual fall of the rain. While the outlook was pretty tough, the rain has given some people the heart to face the future. But extending our exceptional circumstances drought assistance for a further 12 months for farmers has also been widely welcomed in my electorate, including in particular those farmers in the Burnett region. Around 3,000 farmers, graziers, horticulturalists and intensive livestock producers in my electorate will benefit from the improved EC arrangements. Farmers in the shires I have mentioned-Gayndah, Mundubbera, Isis, Perry, Eidsvold, Monto and the Maryborough coast’s Kolan-are now busy applying for income support payments and interest subsidies of up to $100,000 for a further 12 months. It is not just the farmers who will benefit from this arrangement. For every farmer we support, we are also helping local small business with its trading. So, even though more than $7 million in EC assistance has been extended to the Burnett primary producers since the beginning of the drought, the spin-offs from that are worth tens of millions of dollars in our regional community through the multiplier effect. I am most appreciative of the government for what they have done. These landholders need every cent of financial assistance. What rainfall they have received has simply not allowed them to recover from the ongoing drought. The Australian government’s streamlined approach to assessing EC declared areas for this year’s extension means that eligible farmers within my electorate do not have to wait for any MAIN COMMITTEE",265,Adjournment
326,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (1.22 Pm),"It is a very emotional day for the National Party and Iapplication to filter through the state government first. That is not said with any political bitterness or nastiness; it is just a streamlining of a most tiresome procedure that will allow money to get to farmers more quickly. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, also deserves accolades for increasing the EC interest rate subsidy from 50 per cent to 80 per cent on interest payable on new and existing loans. We have doubled the threshold for off-farm assets to $435,000, and from next month onwards farmers will benefit from a $10,000 supplement to the off-farm income test. I for one have long heckled and harassed for this increase of the threshold for offfarm assets. I think $217,000 was unrealistic. That increase means that more farmers will qualify for exceptional circumstances relief payments and those receiving part relief payments will receive a higher benefit. This reinforced commitment to our farmers brings the coalition’s support to more than $2.2 billion, and this could go higher if the drought continues. Hopefully, these rains are the start of a better period, but I do ask the government to be sensitive to the fact that the effects of this drought will be a long time being ameliorated. China cerpts of a press conference of the Chinese defector Chen Yonglin, where-to quote Tony Jones, the compere-grave allegations about a ‘coordinated diplomatic strategy by China to draw Australia away from the US and into the communist nation’s sphere of influence’ were broadcast. At his press conference, Chen Yonglin said: The Chinese Government consider Australia can be part of a role, like France, can implement a policy to say no to the United States. The Lateline journalist Michael Edwards said: ‘According to Mr Chen, China views Australia as a country that can be bought off in return for its silence on human rights abuses within China.’ Chen Yonglin, in translation, said: To utilise economic needs and financial forces to pressure or to force Australian Government to give grounds on the political and human rights sensitive issues. Michael Edwards said that Chen Yonglin had seen this when Australian officials visited China. Chen Yonglin, in translation, at his press conference said: They have virtually raised no human rights issue whatsoever and that is why the Chinese Government believes the Australian Government can be bribed ... can be bought. These are very serious allegations. Next week in Beijing the ninth part of the China human rights dialogue will take place. I know there are many officials and people in the Australian government who do have an earnest desire to promote human rights in that great country, that great trading partner of ours, but I do feel there is some truth or substance to the allegation that, in making a formalised human rights dialogue, the Australian government seems to have given up its capacity to speak out on these kinds of issues. That does seem a great shame. We have seen recently in China some great mistreatments of the Catholic Church, in particular, which concern me, and other people have spoken about other religious persecutions that are taking place in China. The New York Times has been reporting that internet activists are being jailed and that blogs have to be registered with the Chinese secret police.

MAIN COMMITTEE Aged Care (Question No. 404) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 9 December 2004: (1) Is the Minister aware of the article titled ‘Care Crisis– Bed shortages leave elderly in despair’ in the Village Voice in November 2004 which reported that hundreds of older people in the Canada Bay region are being deprived of care because of a chronic shortage of aged-care places and that a combination of insufficient federal funding, staff shortages and an ageing population has meant many have to wait months and sometimes years for a nursing home bed. (2) What arrangements exist between the Commonwealth, State and Local governments to address the unmet demand for aged care places in (a) hostels, (b) nursing homes and (c) palliative care units. (3) What capital funding has the Government provided for aged care places in (a) hostels, and (b) nursing homes in the electoral division of Lowe, and the postcode area (i) 2045, (ii) 2046, (iii) 2047, (iv) 2131, (v) 2132, (vi) 2133, (vii) 2134, (viii) 2135, (ix) 2136, (x) 2137, (xi) 2138, and (xii) 2140. (4) What operational funding does the Government provide aged care providers operating (a) hostels, and (b) nursing homes in the electoral division of Lowe, and the postcode area (i) 2045, (ii) 2046, (iii) 2047, (iv) 2131, (v) 2132, (vi) 2133, (vii) 2134, (viii) 2135, (ix) 2136, (x) 2137, (xi) 2138, and (xii) 2140. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) (a) and (b) In conducting the annual allocation of new aged care places, the Australian Government uses a comprehensive planning framework to achieve an equitable distribution of aged care places to all Aged Care Planning Regions. The cornerstone of this framework is a provision ratio of 108 operational aged care places for every 1,000 people aged 70 years or over, increased from 100 places in the 2004 Budget. The process for the annual allocation of new aged care places has three distinct levels of decision making. In level one, the Minister for Ageing allocates the number of new aged care places to be made available in each state and territory for the coming financial year in accordance with Section 12-3 of the Aged Care Act 1997. The allocation is based on the provision ratio, the current allocated ratios and population projections. The second level of the decision making process provides for the distribution of the available places across each of the states and territories. The distribution of places is based on the advice that state and territory Aged Care Planning Advisory Committees provide to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing. These committees include persons with specific aged care expertise from a broad range of community organisations as well as personnel from local, state and federal governments. In advising the Secretary on how the places should be distributed, the committee identifies individual community needs, and provides advice on the most appropriate proportion of places and care types to be provided in each Aged Care Planning Region. The third level of decision making incorporates the advertisement, assessment and allocation processes. All of these processes are performed by the department. (c) The Australian Government is providing significant assistance to meet the needs of people who are dying, and their families. With respect to palliative care units, the Australian Government has made available a total of $188 million throughout the five years of the Australian Health Care Agreements (2003-2008) to state and territory governments for palliative care. State and territory governments are responsible for the allocation of these funds to ensure access to specialist palliative care in their jurisdiction. In addition to this funding, the Australian Government also committed $55 million over four years in the 2002 federal Budget for national activities to support improvements in the standard of palliative care offered in local communities. A major focus within this program has been to support the palliative care needs of the community, including residential aged care facilities. This includes a range of education opportunities for staff in residential aged care; support for linkages between residential aged care and specialist palliative care; and funding for palliative care equipment that can be used in the home or the residential aged care setting. To build on this, the Australian Government has also announced $15 million over the three years 2005-06 to 2008-09 to support improved access to palliative care service. This Local Palliative Care program will provide assistance with equipping premises for palliative patients and provide support to help people to be cared for at home. (3) (a) and (b) (i) to (xii) and (4) (a) & (b) (i) to (xii) The Department of Health and Ageing plans by Aged Care Planning Region. The Electoral Division of Lowe is within the New South Wales Aged Care Planning Region of the Inner West. In 2003-04 for the New South Wales Aged Care Planning Region of the Inner West, $172,487,000 in funding was paid under the Aged Care Act 1997. Of this funding, $8,599,000 was paid as concessional resident supplement which is available for the purpose of maintaining and improving capital stock. A one-off payment of $15,190,000 (included in the $172,487,000) was made to residential aged care homes in June 2004. This payment was in recognition of the forward plan for improved safety and building standards for aged care homes and in particular improved fire safety. The forward plan was developed and agreed with the aged care sector. A further $1,341,330 in 1998-2004 was provided as capital grants in the region. Regional Counter Terrorist Teams (Question No. 680) writing, on 7 March 2005: Can he say whether any countries have agreed to a regional counter terrorist team being based in their country; if so, which countries. the honourable member’s question: Yes, countries within South East Asia have agreed to have AFP Counter Terrorism Regional Cooperation Teams work in collaboration with their law enforcement agencies.

The “investments” item in the tables listed above shows term deposits with the Reserve Bank of Australia held on the AOFM’s balance sheet. The volume of these assets has grown since the 1990s due to budget surpluses and proceeds from asset sales, which together exceeded the reduction in gross debt on issue.

In addition the trend volume of term deposits represents an ongoing offset to CGS debt and is matched against a corresponding volume of Treasury bonds in the AOFM’s Debt Hedge Book.

334,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:North Korea (Question No. 1340) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 12 May 2005: (1) What is his department’s assessment of the recent statement by Admiral Lowell Jacoby, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, that North Korea has the capability to arm a missile with a nuclear weapon. (2) What is the department’s assessment of North Korea’s relationship with Iran with respect to nuclear technology. (3) What is the department’s assessment of the strategic impact of a successful North Korean nuclear test on countries in the region, such as South Korea and Japan. (1) The department’s views on the matters raised in the question are based on a range of sources, underpinned notably by classified intelligence. The department is, therefore, not in a position to provide a substantive response. (2) See answer to (1). (3) The department is aware of recent speculation that North Korea may be preparing to test a nuclear weapon. A North Korean nuclear test would be a grave development that would seriously escalate the nuclear crisis and deepen North Korea’s isolation. Australia stands firm with the international community in pursuing the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and in steadfastly opposing a North Korean nuclear test. Should North Korea undertake a nuclear test, Australia would respond firmly.

337,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Were any consultants engaged on the development of the new management and organisational structure; if so (a) what are their names and postal addresses and (b) what sum was paid to each. (3) What other costs are associated with the process of developing a new Australia Council. (4) What sum will the Key Organisations section receive for administration in (a) 2005-2006, (b) 2006-2007 and (c) 2007-2008. (5) What sum has been allocated to the Australia Council to provide to the 145 organisations that it funds on a triennial basis in (a) 2005-2006, (b) 2006-2007 and (c) 2007-2008. the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) The Future Planning Review was not conducted by the Australia Council for the purpose of reducing costs. As a result no such efficiency savings are expected to result directly from the implementation of the recommendations from the Review. (b) The restructure will not result in an increased call by the Australia Council on funding from Government. From within existing revenue levels additional expenditure of $200,000 or 1.5% of administrative costs will be made in the area of salaries in 2005-06. This net projected increase results from the establishment of two new teams – Key Organisations and Community Partnerships – the costs of which are not fully offset by staffing changes and workload changes made in other areas in the restructure. Finalisation of the organisational structure and resulting staffing costs is dependent on the outcomes of scoping studies in the Community Cultural Development and New Media Arts sectors. (2) (a) and (b) The Australia Council has provided details of the consultants engaged on the development of the new management and organisational structure. See the table provided below.
