In view of the Government's lack of constitutional power to control hire-purchase charges, will the Treasurer favourably consider using his good offices with the Commonwealth Trading Bank to make money available to this co-operative and to other co-operative hire purchase companies which are lending money at reduced rates of interest? May I finally ask the Treasurer whether he is aware that last year the South Australian Trades Union Hire Purchase Co-operative Society Limited charged only 3 per cent, interest on loans to people honourable member is going a little too far. almost finished , Mr Speaker. On some 1 loans-that is, loans on certain electrical equipment repaid within twelve monthsno interest whatever was charged.' learn that this co-operative hire-purchase organization is continuing to trade profitably. The honourable gentleman may recall that on an earlier occasion when I recommended that the trade unions examine the possibilities of taking this action, I was told by a spokesman for the Australian Labour Party not to be silly, because this was quite unrealistic. However, we have in South Australia a good example of what can be done. The honourable member's suggestion that I should intervene with the Commonwealth Trading Bank to induce it to supply additional finance will, I think, be shown on examination not to be a desirable course. It would be quite irregular for the Treasurer to seek to bring his personal influence to bear upon such a body for the purpose of securing a loan for a particular organization. However, I am quite certain that the Commonwealth Trading Bank would be willing to examine carefully and with every consideration an approach from such a body. The approach would have to rest on its merits, of course, but at present the banking system is in a reasonably liquid state and 1 suggest that the organization pursue that course. which is being voiced by the Premier and others in Victoria to the effect that that State is being by-passed in the programme of Commonwealth developmental projects. Will the Minister give sympathetic consideration to speeding up Commonwealth public works in Victoria? monwealth Government is not able to undertake developmental work in a State such as Victoria which is relatively more developed than many other States. But I was rather surprised at the statement by the Victorian Premier, because of six major Commonwealth works works to cost £500,000 or more-whic h are listed for the current financial year no fewer than three are listed for the State of Victoria. These are the new customs house which will cost, I think, £1,800,000; stage two of the Commonwealth offices in Melbourne which will cost £2,200,000; and a new building for",7,Setup

Mr O'BRIEN -Last May, the Minister for Labour and National Service answered a question in which I sought to ascertain the total number of waterside workers on compensation in capital ports. The Minister's reply indicated that the daily average for Brisbane was 7.2, for Sydney 3.2 and for Melbourne 3.3.

No other government has ever done as much as this Government has done to establish adequate mechanisms for the protection of Australian industry, and certainly no other government has ever established such a basis of consultation with industry as exists now.

As a result, the normal Post Office procedure was followed. If an air mail letter carried only 6d. postage the sender would have been contacted by the Post Office, if his name and address were shown on the envelope, and advised of the need for a further Is. postage. He would have been given six days in which to pay the additional amount to avoid a heavy surcharge at the point of delivery. If the additional postage was not forthcoming at the end of a week the letter would have been sent by surface mail. There are three airmail services a week to Thailand and only one shipping service. In these circumstances I think the honourable member will realize how the confusion has arisen, but it will last now for only a day or two because all officers have been advised of the new rates. question to the Postmaster-General. Has his attention been directed to a report that a youth at Bendigo died as a result of accident because the person who went to telephone for assistance could not find the emergency numbers and did not realize that such calls were free of charge? The pages had been torn out of the book. In these circumstances could not the emergency numbers be displayed in public telephone booths together with the information that no charge is made for the calls? which the department has applied itself on a number of occasions to try to ensure that people using public telephones in an emergency and in other cases have ready access to the numbers they require. As the honourable member knows, the numbers of the various emergency services are prominently displayed in the front of the directory. I think, too, though I am not sure, that information is given also to the effect that these calls may be made without charge. It is difficult to ensure that these emergency any plans for political reforms in that part numbers are always available. The honourable member will realize that public telephones are subjected to a considerable amount of vandalism, as a result of whicb any notices appearing in the directories are frequently torn out. Also, notices placed on the walls of public telephone booths are defaced. It is a difficult problem that we try to overcome, and it gives rise to regrettable incidents of the kind referred to by the honourable member for Darebin. to the Minister for Air, representing the Minister for National Development. I refer to statements by a spokesman for Australian companies interested in oil search to the effect that although the total Budget allocation for oil-drilling subsidies had been increased, the reduction of the subsidy from 50 per cent, to 30 per cent, in respect of each project would detrimentally affect Australia's enterprises vis-a-vis overseas organizations and would impose hardships on Australian investors. Would the honourable gentlemen obtain from the Minister a full statement on this matter, and if it should appear that Australian companies and their shareholders are adversely affected will he ascertain whether and in what ways the Minister is prepared to consider a modification of his proposals? member realizes, the Minister for National Development is in another place.

I think that out of respect for the Legislative Council we should watt for its discussion of the petition before we attempt any discussion of it here. Shipping and Transport heard of the suggestion that a certain amount of the payment to the States under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act be reserved specifically for city and suburban road-making? Does he know that the suggestion has been made that for this purpose 10 per cent, of the total allocation be made now, and the amount be progressively increased until it reaches 40 per cent, per annum, the percentage now available for rural roads? As good rural roads are a major factor in decentralization, will the Minister do all in his power to have the allocation for rural roads increased, rather than make a specific and increasing allocation for centralized areas? the Lord Mayor of Melbourne made an approach to the Government for an allocation of funds for metropolitan roads. This was done on behalf of the civic authorities in other capital cities as well as Melbourne. 1 want to emphasize that, because Victorians have an objective outlook. The Lord Mayor made these representation on the basis that he did not want to disturb the present allocation of 40 per cent, of road funds to rural roads. The Commonwealth Aid Roads Act will be in operation until 1964, and I assure the honourable member that consideration will be given to all aspects of this matter that are brought to our attention before the new legislation to succeed the present act is brought into operation. I do not recollect the suggestion that 10 per cent, of the funds should be allocated now to metropolitan roads. I assure the honourable gentleman that full attention will be given to the needs of rural roads, as well as to any other representations that are made on behalf of other interests ritories inform the House of the progress that has been made with the programme to control and eradicate cattle tick in Papua and New Guinea? Does he expect that the programme will have to be radically changed in view of the altered position in West New Guinea? we began a campaign for the eradication of cattle tick in Papua and New Guinea? This year we asked an Australian expert, Dr. Legge, to make a survey of the progress that has been made. Dr. Legge gave us an extremely favorable report, both on the efficiency of those engaged in the work and the correctness of the methods they have followed. Both from our own knowledge and from his report, we have considerable confidence that we can achieve complete eradication and not merely control of cattle tick. As I understand the position, cattle tick can move from place to place only on an animal host. There is a complete prohibition on the importation of cattle from any quarters except Australia and New Zealand, and any cattle imported from those two countries are subject to examination and treatment for parasites before being allowed into the Territory. From my knowledge, which may not be complete, I think that the only risk from West New Guinea would be constituted by wild deer in the Merauke area, which may be infested by tick and may cross the border. That is a risk of which we are well aware, but I do not think the risk will be altered in any way by a change of administration in that area. Mr J. R. FRASER I ask the Minister for the Interior: Did he recently announce his approval of increased rates of premium for third-party insurance in the Australian Capital Territory? Is the new premium rate for a private car to rise from £11 10s. to £14 7s.?

I am not in a position at this moment to tell the honourable member what stage our consideration has reached, but I hope that we shall have something more encouraging to put forward than the present tendency to have an annual increase of the rates. Attorney-General. The honourable gentleman may remember that I asked him a question on 14th August about the Communist school of subversion at Minto in New South Wales. He stated in reply that he had some information on this matter and that, if the question were placed on the notice-paper, such information would be given. Can the Minister advise me when this information will be forthcoming? orable member is quite correct; I said that when I had information available it would be given to him. That is in the course of preparation and, when it is ready, I will make it available to him. directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service.

WOOL. to the Minister for Primary Industry. In view of the encouraging report in a recent Bureau of Agricultural Economics survey about the future trend of wool prices, can he explain why wool prices have fallen by an amount ranging from 2i per cent, to 7 per cent, in the opening sales of the season? Does he think prices will improve later in the season? honourable member suggests that I should make a forecast of what prices will be later in the season, I want to disillusion him and assure him that I have no intention of doing so. The prices received at the initial sales this season were on a level with the average of last year's sales, although not as good as prices at the concluding sales. The information I have is that at the initial Melbourne sales consignments included some burry wool from the Riverina. Generally speaking, I think, we have been disappointed that the price levels have not been consistent with those ruling at the concluding sales of last year. I must say that wool production estimates by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and its general forecast of prices have been very good over the last two or three years. I just hope that its forecast about the prices overall this season will really materialize. Postmaster-General.

The honourable member who asked the question will recall that recently we included in our monthly statement of employment a breakup by occupations of people registered for employment and of vacancies. If those figures are carefully considered by honourable members, particularly the one who interrupted, it will be found that the number of job vacancies in the metal trades and electrical industries is now higher than the number of people registered for employment. What the facts indicate is that in the metal trades and electrical industries there is a shortage of labour, particularly in some skilled trades.

Motion (by Mr Freeth) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act relating to the Australian War Memorial. Bill presented, and read a first time. Second Reading. Interior and Minister for Works) [11.19] by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The Australian War Memorial began in a small way as the Australian War Museum, set up after the First World War. Since then, it has grown and developed in scope and dignity and justifies the claim that it is a splendid national memorial which has few, if any, equals in the world. The statutory authority for this development was first given by the provisions of the Australian War Memorial Act 1925. Under that act, the memorial has been managed by the Board of Management, and the whole of Australia owes a debt of gratitude to those men who, as members of the board, have over the years given themselves in a completely honorary service to the task of developing the memorial to its present position. The Government has reached the cona meeting of the committee later in the clusion that the time has arrived when the year, the following resolution was passedmemorial should be vested in a board of trustees, to be held in trust on behalf of mend the Commonwealth and the people of Ausfor the collections to be completely vested in a tralia. It would thus be placed in the same Board of Trustees; but that, subject to Ministerial position as the Imperial War Museum in control, the Board (to be constituted) should be Great Britain and similar memorials and ment institutions throughout the world. The original proposals for the re-establishment of the memorial along the lines set out in the bill came from the present Board of Management. Further, in the preparation of the bill, the Government acknowledges gratefully the assistance and advice of the chairman of the board, Lieutenant General the Honourable Sir Edmund Herring. This follows previous practice. In the preparation of the original act of 1925, the then government enjoyed the advice and assistance of the Australian War Memorial Committee of those days, and the subsequent amendments to that act were effected with the advice of the Board of Management of the memorial. The present act deals with the management of the memorial and with the administration of the Australian War Memorial Fund. This fund is a trust fund which, although it was formally constituted in its present form under the present act in 1925, had its origins in the Trust Fund Australian War Records Publications Account, which was set up in the years immediately following the First World War. That account was made up of moneys received from Australia's share in the War Office Cinematograph Committee's profits; funds to the credit of the Australian Imperial Force Publications Section in London; sales of publications and official pictures, and the exploitation of films and of the Australian War Museum by the Australian War Museum Committee; and voluntary donations from members of the public and organizations. As far back as 1924, the Australian War Memorial Committee had suggested that a bill be prepared to cover the vesting of the collection of war relics, as well as the trust fund, in a board of trustees. The building for the memorial had not then been constructed and the war relics had not been transferred to Canberra, which was to be their eventual home. The government of the day did not accept the suggestion. At After full discussion it was decided to recomto the Minister that the time is not yet ripe given executive authority in regard to the manageof the Memorial, and full control of the Trust Fund.",19,Personal Explanation
52,Mr Freeth (Forrest,"Minister for theThe present act, passed in the following year, accordingly gave the board two kinds of function, one to be exercised subject to ministerial direction and the other independent of ministerial control. The former -that is, controlled by the Ministerrelates to the administration of the memorial and the latter, the independent function, relates to the control of the fund. The board was given executive powers in relation to the memorial, but its powers of management were made expressly subject to directions of the Minister. Section 12 of the act vested the fund in the board, but the board's powers in relation to the use of moneys in the fund were not subject to ministerial direction. The main stages in the development of the memorial are now completed. Further developments will occur, but the basic groundwork has been firmly laid. The Government feels that there is no longer any valid reason for the retention of ministerial oversight of the detailed administration of the memorial. The proposed Board of Trustees will be constituted on the same lines as the present Board of Management -the Chief of the Naval Staff, the Chief of the General Staff, the Chief of the Air Staff and nine other members, appointed by the Governor General. The functions and powers of the Board of Trustees will, in effect, confer on it the authority to manage the memorial on behalf of the Commonwealth without subjugation to ministerial authority as can be seen from a perusal of clauses 13 and 14. The board will be a body corporate. Members of the board, apart from the three ex-officio members, will hold office during the pleasure of the Governor General. The board will be required to furnish to the Minister such reports as he requires and its annual report will be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament. By this means the board will account for its stewardship. The authority of the Board of Trustees to administer the Australian War Memorial Fund is set out in part III. of the bill. Tbe fund as it is at present constituted is continued in existence and is invested in the Board of Trustees. Tbe purposes for which moneys in the fund may be applied are at presented limited by section 13 of the act to the acquisition of relics, records, &c, for inclusion in the memorial. These purposes are extended by clause 18, however, to allow the board to apply the moneys more freely for the purposes of the memorial. This is in accord with the purposes for which the fund was originally formed. I direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that the fund does not include any moneys from Consolidated Revenue. The moneys in it originally were received from the sources which I indicated earlier. Since 1925, the fund has, under the control of the board of management of the memorial, grown considerably, with proceeds from the sale of the Australian official histories of the two world wars and other publications by the board. The moneys to the credit of the fund, which stood at £19,500 in 1925, have grown to over £130,000, whilst the memorial has, in the meantime, been greatly enriched by exhibits and relics purchased by the board with fund moneys. The Commonwealth will, of course, continue to bear its general financial responsibility for the memorial and its particular responsibility for the cost of the provision and maintenance of the buildings and the immediate surrounds and also staffing costs. The board will be required to keep proper accounts and records of its transactions in relation to the fund and these accounts and records will be audited by the Auditor-General. The bill also provides that the board will not be subject to taxation in carrying out its functions, particularly those functions, such as the publication of books and other material, through which the income is earned for the purposes of the fund. I would like to refer at this stage to another aspect of the bill. Clause 16 empowers the board to delegate powers to individual persons and committees. Such a delegation will be in writing under the seal of the board. This provision will enable the board to follow the procedure, found necessary in the past by the board of management, of carrying on its detailed work through committees. In particular, the detailed administration of the financial provisions relative to receipts to and payments from the fund necessitate the board's appointing a finance committee to carry out this work on its behalf. The provision for delegations under the present act, section 9, is far too unwieldy and requires the delegation to be in writing under the hand of each member of the board. It bas been found that the provisions of section 9 have not been applied in their entirety when, in some instances, the board has decided to delegate authority to a committee. For this reason, provision is made in clause 28 of the bill for the validation of all purported delegations which have not complied strictly with section 9. It has of course been accepted procedure that committees would report to the board on their actions, so the board has still retained an oversight of the acts done by its committees. The bill provides a regulation-making power and provides, in particular, a power to make regulations governing the conduct of persons on the land or in buildings forming part of the memorial. It is intended that this will enable the making of regulations to control minor acts of misconduct within the precincts of the memorial prejudicial to the interests of the memorial. These are matters which, in similar institutions in other places, are dealt with under by-laws made by the trustees. It is not intended that any regulations of this nature be made immediately, and I sincerely hope that the need will never arise. With the enactment of this statute, the present board of management will no longer exist. I feel that this should not be allowed to pass without acknowledgment of our appreciation for the sterling contribution Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 37). In Committee of Ways and Means: [Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 37).] 1. That the Schedule to the Customs Tariff 1933-1962, as proposed to -be amended by Customs Tariff Proposals, be further amended as set out in the Schedule to these Proposals and that, on and after the twenty-fourth day of August, One thousand nine hundred and sixty-two, Duties of Customs be collected accordingly. 2. That in these Proposals, "" Customs Tariff Proposals "" mean the Customs Tariff Proposals introduced, into the House of Representatives on the following dates:2nd May, 1962; 10th May, 1962; 15th May, 1962; 8th August, 1962; and 16th August, 1962. made by the men who have served and currently serve on that board. Distinguished Australians have been associated with the board since the inception of the memorial. We as Australians should be proud of their contribution and appreciative of their selflessness. On behalf of the Government, I acknowledge with gratitude the work of the retiring members-Lieutenant-Genera l the Honourable Sir Edmund Herring, who is chairman of the board, Lieutenant-General Sir Reginald Pollard, Air Marshal Sir Valston Hancock, Vice-Admiral W. N. Harrington, Senator S. K. Amour, RearAdmiral Sir Leighton Bracegirdle, Sir Gilbert Dyett, Mr W. A. McLaren, Mr C. E. W. Bean, Mr E. C. Riley, Air ViceMarshal W. D. Bostock and Mr G. M. Long. The bill does not provide for the automatic appointment to the board of trustees of the retiring members of the existing board of management. I sincerely hope, however, that all retiring appointed members will be available for appointment to the board of trustees. I am confident that through this legislation the Australian War Memorial will develop further and will assume greater significance in the eyes of all Australians as the Commonwealth memorial of those Australians who have died on or as a result of active service. It will take its place as part of the Australian heritage. For these reasons I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Haylen) adjourned.",20,Australian War Memorial Bill

We all remember what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) said during the last general election. He said he would budget for a £110,000,000 deficit, the amount which he thought sufficient to enable all unemployed persons to be re-employed, but he was ridiculed by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for suggesting what they termed an extravagant remedy.

These figures, conservatively estimated, were not seriously challenged. additional tens of thousands of workers Upon this basis he now calculates that the real number of unemployed at present is more than 143,000. It is doubtful whether the public realizes even yet that official figures are not the true measure of this running sore. We claim that always has been the true position. In reality the figure of 90,000 mentioned by the Minister should be about 143,000. But still the Treasurer, speaking for the Government, made no mention of any plan to remedy the position in the Budget speech. A few days ago the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) asked a question of the Minister for Labour and National ployment. I was amazed at the Minister's reply. So that honourable members will understand the Government's thinking on this matter I shall read the question and the answer. They are in these termsthe Minisier for Labour and National Service. In view of the fact that his last published statement revealed that almost 12,000 school leavers were unemployed, will he now tell the House how many boys and girls who left school at the end of last year are at present seeking employment. Because of this serious social and economic problem, will the Minister say what he intends to do to provide employment for our young people whose ranks will soon be joined by the school leavers of 1962? House that over the period November to June nearly 62,000 school leavers registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service for employment. I do not keep all the facts in my head and I cannot be expected to, but I can say that fewer than 2,300 young men now remain registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. So 2,300 young people of sixteen years of age who have just completed their schooling and are ready to go into industry and take their place in the community are on the dole. Any Minister who expresses satisfaction at that-that is what he did-is very easily pleased. In fact, he shows how completely out of touch he is with this very serious matter. The next important item to which I shall refer, because it will relate eventually to unemployment, is the effect on Australia of Britain's entry into the European Common Market. The United Kingdom is our best customer for our primary products, and to lose such a customer would strike a serious blow at our economy with the result that would be thrown into the unemployment pool. I do not like repeating statistics but the ones that I shall mention were quoted by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) and they relate to the matter under discussion. This is one way in which the people of Australia will learn how we stand. I hope I do not become boring by mentioning these statistics, but I believe that they are important. When Britain joins the Common Market our export of metallic lead ores and concentrates valued at £11,000,000 will be affected as also will our export of butter valued at £20,000,000; sugar valued at £18,000,000; dried fruits and raisins valued at £5,000,000; canned fruits valued at £11,000,000; fresh apples and pears valued at £5,000,000; wheat valued at £14,000,000; beef and veal valued at £24,000,000, and canned meat valued at £10,000,000. Those are our main exports to the United Kingdom and their total value is about £120,000,000. That is a very substantial sum. The goods which I have mentioned now enter the United Kingdom free of tariff and, when they are in competition with goods from any foreign country, the foreign goods are dutiable. I shall mention some of the preferences to indicate the great disadvantage which Australia will suffer in the event of the United Kingdom entering the Common Market. Take sugar as an example. Sugar from other countries is subject to a duty of £3 15s. sterling a ton, which is the equivalent of £A.4 13s. 9d. If we lose that advantage against competing sugar, which is largely beet-produced, and in addition are confronted with a tariff of £2 or £3 a ton imposed by the Common Market countries to keep us out, how can we hope to sell our sugar? In effect, it will carry a £6 a ton surcharge, if I may use that term, not to mention the great difficulty we have of being 12,000 miles from the market. We shall be confronted with the same problem with our fruit. At present our fruit is free of duty, whereas fruit from other countries is subject to a tariff of up to 8s. 6d. a cwt.

59,Mr Mcmahon,"I have made it clear to thethis matter last year, he said that up to two-thirds of our export trade to the United Kingdom certainly would be affected. That means that we shall have to find new markets for about £80,000,000 worth of exports. But, strange to say, neither the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade nor any other Minister or Government supporter has ever suggested where we shall place our er iorts when our United Kingdom market is closed to us. They are standing by hoping that something will turn up, as it does from time to time. ment members may ask what I would do about this problem. I certainly would act differently from the way in which the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and the Government have acted. All they are doing is crying, and they believe that unless every one else cries they have opposition to their policies. They regarded the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury) as a cuckoo in the wake. When he did not cry they kicked him out. If you do not cry along with the Government, you are sacked. When the Government brought down the Budget it d.id not give any honourable member any cause for laughter. No member of the Government will be laughing about the Budget. Honourable members on the Government side have to be careful about not being too happy over what will happen in the Common Market. There is not a shilling for any one in the Budget. To continue my remarks on the Common Market: The Government's greatest mistake was its failure to take action earlier than it did. The Six-Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg -whic h form the Common Market, entered into agreement on this matter back in December, 1957, when the treaty was signed. Before then there were very many years of discussion. Surely Australia had its foreign affairs officers and trade officials in Europe then. They should have known something about this, and surely the Government would have been wise to take some counter-measures or undertake some project to meet the situation that was bound to arise. It was common comment in Europe that the United Kingdom would enter the Common Market. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) were overseas in those years; they made their annual visits abroad. Surely they must have heard something about the Common Market. They should have taken some notice. A school boy would have foreseen some consequences for Australia. Any sensible government surely would have taken some action to offset the effects of the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community. I suggest that the Government should have taken action a long time ago, when we first heard about the Common Market. The United Kingdom was always likely to join the Common Market. There is no sentiment when it comes to business. If the United Kingdom can trade better anywhere else, then sentiment will not save Australia. That is for sure. The establishment of an overseas shipping line, which is ridiculed by the Government, would be one step that could be taken. That would be not only a great thing for shipbuilding in Australia and give employment to seamen but it would also have a wonderful effect on Australia's economy. Look what it would do for the Australian economy generally. If we established a shipping line and built our own ships here in Australia we would soon not have enough people to do the job. At least we would not have 100,000 people out of work. The Government should not complain if it costs a few more shillings to employ Australian workers. If we are going to buy things on the cheap we must forget about our standard of living. If we are going to look around for something a bob or two cheaper than the Australian article, Australian shipping or the Australian worker, we might as well forget about our standard of living. Time will not permit me to deal fully with the establishment of an Australian shipping line, but we know that it is costing Australia nearly £200,000,000 a year because we have no shipping of our own. Any one who goes about the ports will find that every little country trading with us sends its own ships to our shores. One can see Swedish, Norwegian and Danish vessels in our ports; the Swiss have no seaboard, but I believe they have their own ships. Australia, as",26,Budget 1962 63

Therefore, idealism has to be mixed with a very large dose of realism. The recent agreement on West New Guinea-o r Irian Barat as it will shortly be called on the maps-will , we hope, as the Minister said, usher in an era of cooperation between Indonesia and Australia, but, on the other hand, there is no guarantee that it will usher in that era except the promise of rulers who have already broken their word to Australia within the last two or three years, from the time of the Subandrio negotiations onwards. They are rulers whose speeches at the moment are more likely to cause more alarm and despondency than any progress towards peaceful co-existence.

63,Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes (Chisposition And Probably Could Not Say A Lot,"Never at any period in her history has Australia been more threatened with isolation in the South-West Pacific, if not with something far -worse. And never have Australians been less prepared to face the international intricacies and problems crowding in upon them. Since then, events in our region of the world have moved with remarkable swiftness. In the last two months, Laos has been, as it is called, neutralized. This is a standard pattern of routine for a Communist take-over under the Pathet Lao. Viet Nam is under grave attack, not only by guerrillas but in many other ways. Already we hear murmurs that South Viet Nam should be neutralized like Laos, and it would be a happy solution. This would mean the end of South-east Asia so far as freedom is concerned. How is South Viet Nam to be defended so long as the Ho Chi-minh trail through the southern province of Laos is unbroken and Teephone, within the Laotian borders, remains the supply base for the guerrillas, I do not know. Finally, we have this agreement on West New Guinea. Australia, for the first time in its history, now has a continuous boundary with another nation-on e which is at present under very strong influence from Russia. This nation now controls all the sea and air routes to our north except round the eastern end of New Guinea. I agree with the Minister for External Affairs that this is no time for recriminations, but it is very definitely a time for stocktaking. Perhaps he will forgive me if I say that I have some forebodings. We will all agree that it is desirableas the Minister for External Affairs saidto try to establish peaceful co-existence with our next-door neighbours, but we should also remind Australians, as Lord Home warned Britishers last year, that peaceful co-existence as interpreted by some people is neither peaceful nor co-existence. I regard Lord Home as one of the best statesmen in Great Britain to-day. Both Lord Home and Mr Adlai Stevenson, the United States representative at the United Nations, warned the world, between last Christmas and the New Year, that the United Nations was adopting double standards. In the article to which I have referred, I wrote that Lord Home and Mr Semoean, the father of the Indonesian Adlai Stevenson had warned us that the aims of the United Nations werebeing betrayed by the double standards being adopted by many Afro-Asians and the Reds towards their own actions as compared to those of others. The article continuesNevertheless, if the use of force is to be condoned in defiance of the Charter and the right of self-determination is to apply only to certain nations and not to others, ArticlesI and II which deal with keeping international peacebecome meaningless. I said then, and I still feel now, that at the beginning of this year when the threat of force was first made Australia should have taken action under Article 35 to bring that threat of force before the Security Council. The Minister said it would be no use doing that because Russia would use the veto. If that is so, if vetoes are going to be enforced, the people who enforce them should be brought out into the open in their full colour. I think we made a mistake in not bringing the matter before the Security Council. In other words, I think we have been playing "" chicken "" with a few dictators and our bluff has been called. Therefore it is most unwise not to have some forebodings and not to have a policy of clear-cut action in the event of certain circumstances arising. I do not suggest for a moment that we should have used force, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) suggested in an hysterical fit at the beginning of the year, but I do feel that in the United Nations we could have supported the Dutch on the moral issues in the New Guinea problem, even if this did not produce any definite results. An editorial in yesterday's "" Daily Telegraph"", which supported the the Minister wholeheartedly, statedIt would be equally a mistake to assume that the ranting of a few members of Parliament and jingoistic exhortations from people with axes lo grind indicate any widespread anti-Indonesian feeling in Australia. I have no objections to the Indonesians. I have a lot of friends among the Malays. Indonesians are basically the same race. They are a delightful and charming people; but I think I should-and I do-war n Australia of the people who are leading the Indonesians.

Why We must decide also the question of There was one other aspect of the Foot Guinea, they were ridiculed by Dr. Soekarno, who said that the national anthem of that territory was an Indonesian folk tune is immaterial but the recommendation was made in the interests of unity of our two sections of New Guinea. Finally, there is one other thing that I believe Australia would be very wise to do and very foolish to delay doing. I refer to a very necessary overhaul of our defence programme and policy to bring us to a state of preparedness and effectiveness in keeping with our overseas responsibilities and the demands of national security. Without setting myself up as an armchair general, I suggest that the first priority should be of which the honourable member for Chisholm three Australian Regular Army battle groups, with first and second reserves fully peril and we could continue along our way equipped and ready to move at very short notice. My second proposition is that the Citizen Military Forces would not be operafew minutes, we have seen further evidence tional without six months' continuous trainof the dissension which is bursting asunder ing, and that they are not by any stretch of the imagination fully equipped. If your economic policy is successful in achieving full employment you will not usually find it such as foreign policy. easy to get suitable recruits for a regular army. That is another reason why I again say that I think one year's continuous national service training, with two years follow-up in the C.M.F., would produce the best backing for our three battle groups in the Australian Regular Army. Of course, there would be other priorities in connection as a result of being harassed and dragged with the Navy and the Air Force. I have been told that this country cannot afford to on negative values, which this Government do these things. I say we cannot afford not to do them. I do not know whether members of this Parliament realize it, but these events in West New Guinea have caused more serious disturbances in the minds of Australians than anything else has for a very long time past. We have had traditional associations with New Guinea from the time when we first took over New Guinea territory from Germany and especially since the last war. This is a question on which Australians want their members of Parliament to talk. The people, even if they do not agree with what their members of Parliament say, want to know that their parliamentarians are interested in the matter. If what I have said offends any one, I am sorry. But I believe, as an Australian, that I should say these things, and I would rather be out of the Parliament than silent on this national question at this juncture. Temporary Chairman, the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) displayed before the committee a very interesting aspect of the situation in the Government parties. His remarks appear particularly interesting when we recollect that, last Tuesday evening, the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) addressed honourable members in this place in a very optimistic mood and assured us that, as a result of his visits to the countries has just discussed, Australia was in no without further considering this new and enlarged Indonesian empire. In the last the parties opposite. We have seen further evidence of the extent to which they fail to agree on major aspects of important issues I am very glad that the honourable member for Chisholm introduced this issue of foreign policy into the Budget debate. Foreign policy is a very important issue, and we have to consider just where this country stands to-day along by the regressive foreign policy, based has pursued so obstinately throughout its term of office. One has only to think back a little to recall the standing and stature which Australia enjoyed in the eyes of the world when Dr. Evatt represented this country in foreign affairs and led our delegations to the United Nations. In those days, Australia had an enviable position which it has not been able to attain again since the advent of the present Government. In Dr. Evatt's time as Minister for External Affairs, Australia was in the enviable position of being able to determine its own foreign policy independently. It then represented the rallying point for the small but numerous nations which, though small in geographical size and young in years as nations, have large populations and have banded together in the United Nations to form a very formidable power bloc. I refer particularly to the Afro-Asian nations -the nations which largely surround us and to whicb our future is inextricably tied.",29,Budget 1962 63
64,Mr Hayden (Oxley) [12.35],"MrThey are the nations which we must expect to look to us for guidance and assistance, and we should be directing our foreign policy at them instead of adopting the negative and regressive kind of policy which this Government always adopts when confronted with an international situation of significance to this country. We should have a foreign policy of which we can be proud and which will contribute to this nation's welfare. But, instead of formulating such a policy, the present Government hesitates and looks over its shoulder to see what the powerful people who give it patronage would do. member to name one instance in which the present Government has formulated an independent foreign policy. Every aspect of its foreign policy has been designed to appease the powerful friends of whom Government supporters speak so often. When Australia was represented at the United Nations by Dr. Evatt, the small nations looked to this country and accepted it as the harbinger and the herald of a new era in the history of world affairs and international relations. It is all very well to adopt a patronizing attitude towards these newlyformed nations of coloured people who, for so many years, have suffered under the colonialism which has been inflicted on them. These nations have now emerged as powerful influences in the world. We must realize this and accept the course of events and the situation that now exists. We must be duly cognizant of the feelings and demands of the people of these new nations, because we owe them a great obligation. It is undeniable that the colonial powers of the world derived great profits by exploiting these countries for many centuries. Now that these new nations have suddenly gained their independence-thei r rightful independence as our brothers-w e should stand shoulder to shoulder with them in the Afro-Asian part of the world instead of setting ourselves apart from them and adopting a foreign policy based on ideologies which are not in accord with the outlook and views of the people of the Afro-Asian area. We are European by race, but geographically and historically-thi s will increasingly be so in the future-w e are tied to the Afro-Asian bloc. We shall have to begin thinking as the people of that bloc think, because our whole future is inextricably tied to theirs. Honourable members opposite may believe that their leader, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), has made a great contribution towards the re-establishment of the friendly relations with these Afro-Asian countries which we enjoyed when Dr. Evatt was Minister for External Affairs, but I remind them that the Prime Minister did nothing to infuse enthusiasm for Australia into the Asiatic and African people when he supported South Africa in its iniquitous apartheid policy, which was based on fascist-like suppression and the segregation of races purely on the ground of skin colour. Not only the people of the Afro-Asian part of the world, but the people of the whole world, expressed their ire at our Prime Minister when he allowed himself to be pushed into supporting such a policy. The Prime Minister did no such thing. gentleman immediately changed his attitude when he received from his harassed subordinates in this Parliament who were carrying on for him while he was overseas communiques which advised him of the true tenor of the feelings of Australians and their disgust at and opposition to his activities. That is an undeniable fact which honourable members opposite, including the Minister who interjected a few moments ago honourable member knows it to be false. contribution this Government has made to the welfare of Papua and New Guinea. Let him tell the committee how much has been done in New Guinea over the period of some 50 years or more during which Australia has administered New Guinea territory, and particulary during the period of about thirteen years for which this Government has administered it.

We do not want to see repeated in New Guinea the sort of bloody debacle that occurred in the Congo. think that this is humorous. We stand indicted and condemned in the eyes of the coloured races of the world because we have allowed the situation which exists in New Guinea to continue for such a long time and have not made any worth-while contribution to the welfare of the indigenous people. They are our brothers, and we should now be trying to formulate a policy which will draw them close to us and ensure that their representatives sit beside ours in the United Nations as representatives of a brother nation. The people of New Guinea look to us for guidance and we want them to help us in the international field. I sincerely suggest that no one in this Parliament or in Australia generally labours under the misapprehension that Australia is greatly loved as a result of the tion of the Territory. policies of this Government towards the indigenous peoples of New Guinea. Let any one who thinks otherwise explain the riots which took place in the Pacific Island Regiment. Let such a person explain the widespread riots which expressed the dissatisfaction of the people of New Guinea at the continuance of the colonialist form of administration to which they are subjected. Let him explain why, on the occasion of a cricket match between an Australian team and a native team in New Guinea, natives sitting on the sidelines were calling out: "" Go home, Australians. Go home, Europeans. "" Newspaper reports of this incident appeared throughout the nation. This is the sort of thing for which we must answer. The obstinate and short sighted policy which this Government adopts towards the people of New Guinea, with a complete lack of appreciation of their and New Guinea, it is grossly unfair that the feelings and needs, is to be deplored. The Buka Island riots provided another example of the way in which the people of New Guinea view this policy. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. coming year towards the development of of the sitting, I was referring to the maladministration of Papua and New Guinea by the Government. I was about to discuss the Buka Island riots, which made headlines in the newspapers early in the year. The people on Buka Island suddenly had imposed upon them a demand for the payment of taxes. This was unreasonable to these people and, in their primitive state, it was incomprehensible to them. The attitude of the Commonwealth Government in forcing these primitive people to pay taxes was unreasonable and inflexible. It was a bludgeoning and showed no appreciation of the psychology of the primitive people on Buka Island. The Government tried to deflect the Opposition's criticism of its handling of the incident by implying that we were belittling the efforts of the police and the police natives employed to suppress the riot. That was not the point of the Opposition's argument, and it is still not our point. As with other outbreaks expressing the dissatisfaction of the native people in Papua and New Guinea, this riot was created by the Government's obstinate, short-sighted and ham-fisted handling of the administraMr Clyde Cameron -They do not have a vote. the native people do not have a vote and have no rights, the Government is prepared to force them to contribute to its coffers from their meagre sustenance. The Government should project itself into the minds of the coloured people. It should try to understand the problems as the coloured people see them and not try to apply a well-developed academic point of view to these people, who have absolutely no appreciation of these opinions. The native people cannot understand why they should suddenly, overnight, be lifted into an advanced stage of civilization. Of course, they should be raised to an advanced stage, but it is stupid to try to do so overnight.

74,Mr Hayden,"That is so. Althoughthe Territory. An amount of £20,000,000 is to be expended on 2,000,000 people, or approximately £10 a head for the year. Let us look at the amount that has been set aside for expenditure on Canberra. It is £22,000,000 on approximately 60,000 people, or about £300 per head per year. This is just for the city itself and does not take account of the huge amount that will be spent in maintaining government offices, paying salaries and wages and meeting a host of other expenses of the Public Service. Most of the £20,000,000 allocated to Papua and New Guinea will be used to pay the wages of European public servants in the area, and a very small amount indeed will be left for the development of the Territory. Very little money will be available to advance the native people to the point where self-determination would be possible. The people of Papua and New Guinea must regard the situation as unfair when they realize that last year Australians spent £471,000,000 on cigarettes and various alcoholic beverages. This expenditure, of course, cannot be held against the Government. However, when only £20,000,000 is available for the development of the Territory, £471,000,000 on these commodities must seem unfair to the indigenous people. Our treatment of these people must appear unfair and unjust to our Afro-Asian friends who, as a result, probably view us with suspicion. This, in turn, must cause a deterioration in our relations with those nations. Our relations with our Asiatic and African neighbours have not been improved by the Government's refusal to sign an undertaking with the United Nations to keep Australia free of nuclear weapons. These nations must regard Australia with suspicion when they learn of its refusal to sign this undertaking. They must regard us as possible antagonists and as potential aggressors in any future hostilities. There is no possibility across the Berlin wall. The people of Berlin of Australia being regarded as a neutral nation. Let no one be under the misapprehension that, with this Government in power, Australia will ever be neutral. The United Nations refuses to consider using Australian forces as a police force in any area of civil strife in the world. This is because of the biased, partisan attitude adopted by the Commonwealth Government in international affairs. This is an attitude which places Australia in a subsidiary position to more powerful nations, particularly our great and powerful friends in the United States of America. The Prime Minister readily speaks about our friends in the United States of America, but this great and powerful nation was not afraid to leave Australia by itself when the Indonesian situation developed and forced this Government to make a volte-face on that issue. New Guinea? honourable member for Richmond is a perennial interjector. If he had stayed awake, he would have heard the arguments leading up the point I have made, and would have had no trouble in understanding what I am saying. The failure of the Government to speak openly for peace has left us in a most vulnerable position in relation to other nations. As the honourable member for Parks( Mr Haylen) has pointed out before, peace is indivisible. It belongs to every nation, and all peoples of the world want peace to-day. the frittering away of Let us make no mistake about that. We do not want any world conflagration. We do not want the young people to be slaughtered on the battlefields. We want peace so that our families may develop into happy communities. Peace is earnestly desired by all peoples of the world. The people of Berlin to-day are sick and tired of being used as the pawns in international politics. They are sick and tired of being a sacrifice and of being pushed about on the checker board of international politics. They are demanding peace and they are criticizing both sides in international affairs. We know what happened in Berlin when a young lad was shot whilst trying to escape are disgusted and tired of being used in the machinations of the powerful nations in international politics. This is the important point to emerge from the present situation in Berlin. The rank and file people of the world earnestly declare that they want peace.

76,Mr Hayden,"-We know that thethe people of Australia, in common with the people of other nations, desire peace. Why should the Commonwealth Government ignore the exhortations of the rank and file people who so earnestly desire peace? As the honourable member for Chisholm pointed out, the Commonwealth Government for too long has played chicken, and its bluff is now being called. We must realize that Australia, with a population of 10,000,000, in a world of many billions of people, cannot be an aggressive world power. It has not the same influence in the world as have the many countries with much larger populations. Our contribution to international affairs in far too many cases is hardly a grain of salt in the great ocean of international affairs. A population of 10,000,000 is hardly a unit in the vast populations which throng the world to-day. The Commonwealth Government, in pursuance of its policy of making itself subordinate to the dictates and desires of overseas governments, has placed Australia in a very unfortunate position. As I said earlier, this Government should pursue a policy in international relations similar to that pursued when Dr. Evatt represented this country at the United Nations. Australia should be the rallying point for the small nations of the world. We should be showing them, as we did before, the great gains which can be achieved. We should be showing them that together we can create a common interest in the AfroAsian area to achieve goals unsurpassed by anything that has been achieved to date. Co-operation is a very important factor. I think that we will be excluded from the European Common Market area. If we are going to insult and generally upset our near neighbours in the Afro-Asian area there will be nothing to prevent their forming a common trading community of their own, as has been suggested by some of those nations. Where will Australia be if she is excluded from this community because of the policies of this Government? I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to the report which the MinisHouse, in which he said that he hardly rated any attention from the press of the United Kingdom when he visited that country .recently for discussions on the European Common Market. I am reliably informed that when he was in the United Kingdom on that occasion one of the major coverings that he received in a London newspaper was a single column of approximately 4 inches. At the same time, the marriage of a county cricketer was given greater coverage. This shows how important Australia's peril and Australian affairs are in the eyes of the world. If honourable members opposite believe that they present a homogeneous front and a unified government, how do they explain the constant criticisms that emanate from their own ranks? The honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) is a regular critic of the Government's defence policy. We have seen the former Minister for Air ejected from his portfolio because he dared to disagree with the dictates of the powerful Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). We have heard also the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) and the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) disagreeing strongly with the Government's European Common Market policy. We have heard the Minister for Supply( Mr Fairhall) criticizing Government policy on deficit budgeting. What sort of front is that for the Government to present to the nation? This is a disorganized, disunited front. It is a front which is incapable of presenting a constructive policy for the development of Australia. I need hardly go into the details of the Budget because they have been so well covered by my colleagues. It is a barren budget, a dismal budget from a tired, old government which is worn out and which has lost any conception of new ideas. This Government has much for which to answer to the people. Lack of foresight and total lack of planning epitomize the Government's outlook. Members of the Government wish to think of themselves as free agents. Laisser-faire is their established policy. In this complex world, such a policy is an anachronism. It is ineffective, so the Government introduces numerous ad hoc measures. Consequently, the economic development of the nation is like a patchwork quilt; neither rhyme nor reason is apparent.

78,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [2.30]. Has Been Struck After Charging In To,"there will be some effect on bank liquidity, because the money so found will be, in a sense, an accretion to the net liquid assets of the community. But I say that, since the Reserve Bank has powers both through the special accounts and its normal open market operations, it is able to control this liquidity At the beginning of this year, we had an by other methods. The banking system at the present time is abnormally liquid, and surely nobody looking at the state of the economy would want that liquidity to be diminished. I think it is almost certain that the Government is planning for a maximum level of liquidity in the banks for the coming financial year. If this be so, then the addition of £118,000,000 lo these liquid resources will not be of any great practical consequence either way. It is a kind of theoretical figure that is without much practical effect. I would say that when the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) based his description of this Budget as adventurous largely on this cash deficit of £118,000,000, which is concealing a very considerable real surplus, he was drawing the long bow a little. It is true, indeed, that the expenditure this year will be greater than that of last year by some £88,000,000. I refer honourable members again to page 11 of the appendices to the Budget speech and to the redemption figure there included, which decreases by £12,000,000 the nominal increase of £100,000,000. This is not a great amount when you measure it against the increase in the working population and the expansion of Australia. It is not an abnormal amount, but I do regret that in calculating it there has again been some attempt to do a little bit of double counting. I refer to the roneoed sheet which the Treasurer distributed with his speech. I mention this as a small matter; not a big one. The Treasurer looks at additional expenditure on rail projects and counts it in in this great increase in capital expenditure, but he omits the £4,000,000 spent on the rail project-correspondin g work-in Victoria. If you were to do it really accurately, you would count in that £4,000,000 spent in Victoria on the same basis as you would the expenditure on the Western Australian rail project for the coming year. This is a small matter and I do not want to press it, but there was perhaps a little bit of dressing up in order to produce an effect which seemed to be a little bit greater than it really was. The Budget is not without merit, but has it gone far enough? I would be inclined to think that it has not. Let us look at the unemployment situation, in the first place. unemployment peak of round about 130,000, and on the latest figures it is down to about 90,000. This is some improvement, but it is not much better than the normal seasonal improvement which might have been expected over the period. It is saidI think with justicethat the figure is likely to come down to 70,000, or even lower, before Christmas. I hope and believe this will occur, but the January and February figures are likely to show a rise to the vicinity of 120,000. Frankly, that is not good enough. I agree with the contention made by honourable members that the figures for unemployment in Australia are low, compared with the overseas figures. I find myself very much in agreement with what the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes said yesterday-that we have a high standard here and we should not be ashamed, but rather should be very proud, that our normal unemployment ratio is lower than that in most countries overseas. Of course, there are difficulties in international comparisons. I am not going into the technical points, but there are difficulties of measurement. When one looks at the other side of the picture, it does not look quite so good. If we look at the total of private employment between June, 1960, and June, 1962-the latest period for which figures are available in terms of absolute employment-w e see that the number of people in private employment increased by only some 40,000 during those two years. That is not enough, because during that time there have been something like 200,000 people added to the potential work force and, in addition, I would say from experience that during that time there has also been some decrease in the numbers of rural workers and those privately employed. I would have thought we should have been aiming at a total employment figure considerably higher than that which we have achieved. If you look at the picture over two years, there has not been much increase in productivity. During this time. I refer to the recent publication on the Australian balance of payments -ther e has probably been something like £400,000,000 of overseas investment in Australia. Our production should also be increasing in accordance with the increase in the working population. It should be increasing also through the application of new techniques. I do not think it is safe for us to be satisfied in Australia with anything less than a 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, annual trouble of riding a bicycle slowly. This is increase in the total volume of production. In fact, I say that we need a higher mark than the one envisaged in the Budget and need to raise our sights. I do not think the Budget gives sufficient Estimates. The first is the place of defence emphasis to the necessity for growth in Australia or sufficient emphasis to the necessity for maintaining that economic growth as a condition of increasing our population through migration and a condition of having a high rate of employment throughout the community. I do not want to say the Budget is without merit. I simply say that I do not think it has gone far enough. May I list some of the things I am sorry that I will have to give them in outline only because time will not permit me to analyse them-and some of the principles on which it seems to me that the Budget does not face up to the realities of the situation? The first of these principles I have already enunciated. Secondly, I think the Treasury has created an unreal antithesis when it implies you have to have either a boom or a depression. It is wrong -to say that there cannot be a middle course. spent The Treasury's thinking seems to be that if you do not have a boom you must have ter calls our great allies. It is not enough a depression and if you do not have a to fiddle with an additional £6,000,000 or depression you must have a boom. I am £7,000,000. History will not wait. The sure this arises from a very wrong approach Government has not made up its mind. It to the savings situation in the Australian is playing very perilously with the security community. In the presentation of this Budget some antithesis seems to have been presented between the real interests of the rural comproduce for defence a very much larger munity and the real interests of the secondary industries. I do not believe that there is this necessary opposition. I believe that in the long run both have the same interests. Perhaps there is a lack of appreciation of the need to insulate certain features of our economy against ungovernable movement overseas, and perhaps there has been an undue reliance on overseas investment as a means of keeping our economy on its feet. Growth and stability-w e should have both. But looking at the history not only of this Government but' also of its predecessors-thi s is not something in which either party can take pride-ther e has been a lack of growth when there has been stability, and a lack of stability when there has been growth. This in itself imposes technical troubles like the technical not always easy to do. Letme now come to more specific matters which I hope I shall have an opportunity to develop during the debate on the in our economy. The Budget provides, I think, an additional 3 per cent, expenditure on defence. This is not much. It is not much greater than the increase in the work force. I know that the Minister for Defence( Mr Townley) has been ill and I know that the Estimates are not in their final form, but frankly this is not enough. I am not one of those who believe that Australia faces major difficulties by reason of the change in circumstances in New Guinea, but I am one of those who believe that Australia continues to face major perils because of the Communist thrust southward towards us. The Government must make up its mind to increase the defence vote considerably to bring it into line with what is being per capita or as a percentage of national income by what the Prime Minisand the survival of this country. In my view we must think, and think now, in terms of an economy which can and more acceptable amount. This is unpleasant. This is something which people may not like, but because it is necessary for survival, it is the Government's duty to give the lead in regard to it. With the exception of a little flurry of sincerity at the time of the Korean War the Government's defence policy has been inadequate during the whole of its life. My second point relates to savings which, I am certain, are at the root of our economic troubles. At present the ratio of savings is at least satisfactory because the economy is working at a slow tempo and many people still remember that a few months ago it was working at an even slower tempo. The present savings ratio leaves nothing to be desired. But this is not the problem. The problem is to create an economy and a psychology in which the savings ratio will be satisfactory in times of full prosperity. If the Government does this, and only if it does this, will it be able to achieve its objective of the real combination of growth and stability. This Budget has lost opportunities. This was a time surely to think in terms of a better transport system for Australia. I do not mean simply a few more roads or a few more railways and a couple of ships. WhatI mean is a complete re-thinking by the States, perhaps under the chairmanship of the Commonwealth, on our whole transport system. It is here, for example, that we can really help to reduce costs in rural industry. It is here that we can really save our economy unnecessary outlay. You do not do that overnight but you must make a start on it. The Government should have done more in relation to education. Only recently I think it was the Minister for Labour and stated in this House that there could be labour shortages in various categories of skilled workers even through there might be an overall labour surplus. Very true indeed! But what are we doing about it? I know that education lies within the province of the States, but I am not moved very much by doctrinaire considerations oi that character in relation to a matter of such prime importance. Perhaps we could co-operate with the States. Certainly, the first move must be a conference with the States. It is not only a question of spending more money on education although that may or may not be necessary. I shall not go into that aspect. I believe that we should take the initiative and give leadership to others in trying to repair some of the defects in our national set-up, whether those defects lie within the province of the States or within the province of this Commonwealth Government. In such matters it is up to the Commonwealth Government to give the lead. I was happy when I noticed in the Budget a proposed increase in subsidy for organizations engaged in the search for oil. I was a little less happy when I found that this was co-related with a decrease in the rate of subsidy. As was said by a prominent oil executive in Australiarecently, the decrease in the subsidy may do two things. It may decrease the rate of exploration and it may accelerate the drift of ownership of oil properties from Australian into overseas hands. Either of those prospects would be undesirable. I was sorry to hear the addendum to the relevant Budget item. Many anomalies could have been cleaned up by this Budget without any great expenditure of money. I have in mind thefieldsof social services and housing. As to housing, we must do more than we have done because the demand for housing will increase in three or four years with the increase in the numbers in the age groups of those people who will want houses. This is a consequence of the high birthrate just after the war. We should be making some provision for this. These are all matters which do not necessarily mean any great expenditure of funds this year. Many of them involve only the proper co-ordination of policy with the States. Provision should have been made for some increase in expenditure, the greater part of which, perhaps, might have been directed into the defence vote. But over and above any increase in expenditure there surely was room for cleaning up some of these anomalies and for getting steerage way on to the economy again. In considering the Budget two possible approaches can be made by honourable members from this side of the House who are united in feeling that the Labour Party offers no alternative government. It is possible to give to the Budget the seal of approval-whic h is perhaps a little more than one may feel-and be one of the ""Thanks, Harold, you are magnificent"" school. On the other hand if you belong, as I do, to ""the school that believes that revitalization of the economy can come only from this side of the House, you become one of those who say to the Treasurer, "" Harold, you can do a little bit better "".",39,Budget 1962 63
79,"National Service ( Mr Mcmahon), Who","I believe that the Labour Party and its policies which are not necessarily the policies outside our borders without one blow being enunciated by the Opposition in this House, would be disastrous for Australia. But the Government has to get steerage way; it has to bring people in behind it to support it. It is a mistaken policy to pretend for this Budget an enthusiasm that we do not all feel -indeed , almost impossible-to obtain Unfortunately, Australia is not living in a vacuum. We are living in a highly competitive world, and the competition is not only economic. We are living in a world where, unless we can show that our way of life is consistently better than the way of life of other people-and better in all respects-w e may find ourselves in danger of a take-over. I have spoken of the possibility and the danger of a political takeover from the other side of the House. That is a very real danger and would be a real disaster; but it would be only a small danger and a small disaster compared with what we would suffer from a take-over by international forces which are waiting on Australia's doorstep. We must restore the full dynamic to our ideas-ou r democratic and our non-socialist ideas. I do not believe there is any inherent difficulty in this, but I also do not believe that the present document put before us quite measures up to the standard of responsibility required of the Government. It is not enough to meet the dangers that face us. I do not mean only that it is necessary for us to increase the provision for defence and to do so resolutely and quickly. I mean also that it is essential for us to restore to the economy the full rate of growth. I would not feel happy if the economic rate of growth were less than 4 per cent, a year. I would not feel happy if the increase in the number of persons in employment were less than the increase in the potential work force. I am not happy with the present outlookI admit that it is an improved outlook-bu t I do not join in the extravagant condemnations or the knocking of Australia. I do say that we can, we must, and we will, do better. honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) expresses the fear that Australia could become the victim of a take-over. ment stands condemned upon its diagnosis This country is being taken over by forces struck. No country similar in population and resources to Australia has during the last twelve years bought from outside its borders more goods that it does not need and that it cannot afford to buy. The result is that Australia nowfindsit difficult those goods that are essential to the growth and development of our industries. BeforeI sit down, Mr Temporary Chairman, I intend to prove that my statements are correct. I believe that credits are preferable to debits, that surpluses are much preferable to deficits and that profits are much more beneficial to a country than losses. I believe that debits, deficits and losses are the results of failures, maladministration and disastrous methods of government. Credits, profits and surpluses are the results of bountiful seasons, good administration and the kind of government that a country should have. We find that the Government, after what honourable members opposite claim to be twelve years of the greatest prosperity that this country has ever experienced, is budgeting for a deficit. Last year the Government said that it would not budget for a deficit even though 140,000 people were unemployed. The Government's view was that the putting to work of 140,000 people did not justify the incurring of a deficit of ( £100,000,000 or £110,000,000. To-day'the position has changed. The medicine that was too drastic for a sick economy last year becomes the medicine that must be taken this year. The Labour Party, of course, agrees that Australia's economy is so sick that it needs the stimulus of drastic measures. We believe that because of maladministration in the past and the problems and disabilities that have been created by this Government during the period of prosperity, the Budget should provide for a deficit. But we do not believe that the moneys covered by the deficit should be spent in the way that the Government will spend them. The Labour Party believes that if there is to be a deficit it should be used to increase the purchasing power of the vast masses of the people. The Opposition claims that the Govern-",42,Budget 1962 63
80,Mr Peters (Scullin) [3.0],"Th eof the ills of this community and the remedies that it has prescribed for those ills. Last year the Government said, "" No deficit, but we will reduce income tax by 5 per cent."". A flat rate! It said, ""We will introduce emergency tariff legislation and institute quota restrictions on imports. We will reduce the sales tax upon motor cars and by those means, within twelve months, everybody wanting a job will have a job."" The result was disastrous. Every one wanting a job has not got a job, and so the Government has adopted the electoral proposal of the Opposition and now says, "" We are going to budget this year for a deficit"". But it is not going to spend that asked some time ago. In effect, I asked money in the same way as Labour would do. Labour would increase child endowment and pensions. Labour would increase all types of social service payments. It would increase the wages of the average man so that people who had needs to satisfy would create a demand for goods and other people would be absorbed in employment. But this Government does the reverse. When it has something to give away, it does not give it to the people who are in need and who could make the best use of it. The Government gives anything it has to give away to those who already have so much that their every need is satisfied. They have a home and furniture. Their children are being educated. They wear the best clothing and eat the best food. When they receive an acquisition to their wealth, they cannot and do not use it in such a way as to promote business or industrial activity or to provide employment for our people. This Government stands indicted because, dom, £1,114,000,000 with the United States of after twelve years of prosperity at home, America, and £255,000,000 with Canada. It it says it is necessary to have a deficit of showed £118,000,000 to stimulate industries and put people back to work. That is bad This was an overall adverse balance of payenough. But what is a deficit? After all, ments of £1,911,000,000. That was the if at the end of a period a deficit is not increase in our indebtedness to other counredeemed by the creation of new wealth in tries under this Government's administrathe community, it will be funded and tion up to 1961.

So future generations will have worth more of goods than we imported. to pay for what we have as well as for the We sent out £187,000,000 worth more of day-to-day services in their day and age. the blood, sweat and toil of the people of That is serious. But, of course, that debt this country than we received from overis owed to Australians within Australia and seas countries. to that extent the position is not as serious as it would be if the deficit were owed to some overseas country. However, this Government does not give the people of Australia one deficit; it gives them two deficits. It gives the people a deficit of £118,000,000 at home, and it emphatically declares that the deficit abroad for the next year will be greater than £118,000,000. It will be at least £200,000,000. That £200,000,000 of deficit overseas will be added to the accumulated deficit that this Government has built up down the years. I have here a reply to a question that I what was the deficit both in trade and finance overseas with various countries of the world, during the Government's term of office. Listen carefully to these figures. On 9th August the Minister for Trade told me that between 1948-49 and 1960-61 our exports to the United Kingdom were valued at £3,434,000,000 and our imports were valued at £4,191,000,000. Our exports to the United States of America in the same period were £853,000,000 and imports totalled £1,299,000,000. Our exports to Canada were valued at £157,000,000 and imports were worth £295,000,000. Exports to Communist countries totalled £377,000,000 and imports were valued at £102,000,000. In our trade with other countries, exports totalled £5,776,000,000 and imports £4,046,000,000. The reply given to me addedOver the period 1948-49 to 1960-61 Australia's balance of payments on current account showed a deficit of £1,734,000,000 with the United Kinga surplus of £1,218,000,000 with other countries.",43,Budget 1962 63
81,( Mr Mcewen) Replied To My Question And,"member sure of that figure? I have the official documents here. We sent out £187,000,000 more than we imported and we showed a loss on our trading activities of £8,000,000. In his Budget speech the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) saidExternally, a good many uncertainties overhang world production and trade in 1962-63 and there could be some falling back from the very high point our exports reached last year. On tbe other hand, imports are certain to increase considerably as industrial activity and demand rise here. Last year we had a deficit of £8,000,000, with exports at an all-time high level and imports at a very low level. The Treasurer has now said that this year we will not export nearly as much as we did last year, and we are going to import a vast quantity more than we did last year. What will that mean? It will mean that our overseas deficit will increase again this year. Let me quote now the words of the Minister for Trade. Speaking on the Budget, the Minister saidLast year our exports earned £1,080,000,000, of which about £600,000,000 was commandeered immediately to buy in overseas countries the requirements of Australian manufacturing industries. Another £200,000,000 of it was used to purchase Australia's requirements for transport and they are available to everybody-to find for developmental works. According to the Minister for Trade, it was absolutely essential to spend £800,000,000 to buy the requisites for keeping Australian workers in employment and enabling Australian industries to expand. By that he did not mean payment of freight; he meant payment for aeroplanes and equipment of that type that were coming to this country. No employment was provided for the people of this country by the expenditure of that £800,000,000. But in addition to that there are the invisibles. We must pay freight on imports into this country. In the year before last £173,000,000 was paid in freight, and last year, because of the reduced imports, £154,000,000 was paid in freight. Tbis year, because of the increased imports that must come to this country, the freight will be much more than £154,000,000-it will approach £200,000,000. Of course freight is not the only invisible. We have to pay interest on the debts that we have built up overseas. Last Australia's primary industries in proportion honourable year instalments and interest charges on those debts amounted to £56,000,000, for which we received nothing in return, because the policy of this Government was to put this nation in pawn to the financial interests overseas. Added to that were investments flowing into this country from overseas. During the period of the present Government's occupancy of the treasury bench the investment of foreign capital in this country has increased from about £300,000,000 to about £2,000,000,000, and upon that increased investment the annual dividends payable overseas amount to approximately £200,000,000. Last year they amounted to £151,000,000. It is true that not all of that amount was paid out in dividends. Some of it was ploughed back, that is, reinvested in this country, but ultimately the burden on Australia to repay these amounts must become greater. Therefore, I say that this Government has got this country into a position where, because of the amounts that have to be paid annually overseas, we owe more than any other nation with a similar population and similar resources. Honourable members have only to look through the documents that are issued by the United Nations in connection with the economies of all nations of the worldthat no other country has been placed in pawn to the extent that Australia has by this Government during the past twelve years. Why did the Government place us in pawn? What did we get in return for these accumulated debts? We got all kinds of goods which we not only could not afford but did not need. To mention a few examples, Mahatma long-grain rice was imported from Arkansas, United States of America; peaches were imported from California; pears were imported from other parts of the world; packaged peas were imported from Holland; vegetables of all descriptions were imported from all sorts of countries outside Australia; we bave imported canned chicken, canned pork, canned this and canned that. These are all primary products, and the importation of such goods must affect the farmers of this country and destroy basic export industries. Sir, this Government has not developed",44,Budget 1962 63
82,Mr Mackinnon,I s the,45,Budget 1962 63
83,Mr Peters,"I am sure of that figure.to manufacturing industries, which do not provide exports. Could there be a greater indictment of the Country Party than this? I cite the net farm income of this country from figures published in the official documents. For the year 1953-54 it was £499,000,000; for 1954-55 it was £447,000,000; for 1955-56 it was £443,000,000; and so it goes on until in 1961-62 it was £472,000,000. There are now fewer farms, farmers and farm workers producing farm incomes. That is the sort of solid foundation upon which this Government is building the future prosperity of this country! Australia is gradually being captured-no t too gradually-by foreign forces, yet not a blow is being struck in its defence. All sorts of commodities have been accepted by Australia in return for portions of our industry, portions of land, and portions of all kinds of other wealth that exists within this country. Those commodities not only were not needed, but have tended to destroy Australia's secondary industries and prevent the expansion of primary industry and primary production, and have been continuously, despite protestations of members of the Country Party, reducing the farm income of Australia. It is impossible for this Government to answer this indictment. It evades the question of the accumulated overseas deficit and says our overseas funds are all right. Why are they all right? It is because the Government buttresses them with loans, because it buttresses them with investment capital that is used to buy goods for which the people of this country must pay in the indefinite future, and on which they must pay a toll to foreignfinancialexploiters. That is the method by which this Government conducts the business of this country. There is nothing complicated about it. All that Australia suffers from is the Government that sits upon the treasury bench, exploiting every resource of this country in the interests authority. of the predatoryfinancialinterests that have put it into power in this country, to the detriment of the vast masses of people of this country. This Government has pawned Australia for future generations to redeem by their work and toil. Not only will the present generation pass a burden on to future generations of Australians; it will never be able to enjoy the full product of its toil and labour because of the big amounts to be paid overseas. Last year our imports totalled £893,000,000, of which practically £500,000,000 was made up of invisibles. Last year our exports were approximately £1,000,000,000 and the invisibles were £-500,000,000. That is to say, we had to pay £500,000,000 without getting anything in return for the people of this country. No country-no t even "" Australia Unlimited ""-ca n carry burdens such as that, and in those circumstances no country can progress or profit. Temporary Chairman, I must take issue with the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) on a couple of matters to which he referred. He said that if the Labour Party was in power it would increase child endowment rates to some unspecified level, and would also increase age and invalid pensions. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten), in a magnificent speech here the other day, pointed out that an increase of only 5s. a week in child endowment rates would mean a total increase of £34,000,000 a year. If this were added to the deficit of £118,000,000 wbich this Budget is designed to produce, very little would be left out of the amount of £160;000,000 which Opposition speakers have said would be the extent of the deficit if a Labour government was in power. The honourable member for Scullin talked about Australia's trade losses. He said nothing at all about other countries. Doesn't he know that the United States of America, for instance, suffers a trading loss? America does not suffer a trading loss. authority that it does, and I accept that The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Drury) -Order! There are too many interjections.

89,Minister For Trade ( Mr Mcewen) And See What Their Objectives Have Been And,"were not happy about that, of course, but it was not a bad position when compared with the situation in other countries. It was a pretty good performance for a young country like Australia, when an oldestablished country like the United States of America suffered unemployment to the extent of 8 per cent, of the work force. The Treasurer said that stability means steady growth and a balance between current supply and demand, with stable costs and prices. I submit that we cannot afford to jeopardize our position. We must hold the line and maintain a stable economy. The second important aspect of the Budget is the provision for increased national development. Last year we provided about £10,000,000 for national developmental projects, while this year the amount has been increased to £27,000,000. During the winter recess I accompanied other members of the Parliament on a tour of the northern parts of Australia. As one of my colleagues has said, we southerners are often twitted about our lack of interest in the north. I had a look at some of the projects that have been started in the north, and I was very impressed with what I saw. I would like to tell honourable members that the Government of Western Australia has been spending 27 per cent, of its total budget roads commitment on development in the north-west of that State, where I think there are only about 1,500 or 2,000 people. Imagine the amount of development that Queensland could have had if, during its 40 years of socialist government, it had spent 27 per cent, of its budget roads commitment on northern development. Queenslanders would not now be crying out to us to step up the pace of development in the north of that State. I saw the Pilbara iron ore deposits. I have heard honourable members in this Parliament talking about selling our birth right in the form of our natural mineral deposits. I can tell tbe committee that I flew over some hundreds of square miles of pure iron ore. There were mountains of the stuff covering acre upon acre. If the three companies that are active in the area operated from now until doomsday they would hardly even scratch one corner of those deposits. The Western Australian Government, through the agency of its Minister for the North-West, Mr Charles Court, has drawn up a plan to co-operate with these free enterprise companies in the development of the area. The companies are to build towns, hospitals, schools, railways, ports and roads. This is the way to develop a country. When the necessary facilities and services are provided we will see industries established. We cannot expect to have industries established in such remote areas unless we provide something for them beforehand. Private enterprise will do the job successfully with the co-operation of the Western Australian Government, which has certainly not been lacking. I had a look also at the Camballin irrigation scheme on the Ord River in the Kimberleys. There is an area of at least 500,000 acres of irrigable country in that district, and I was very impressed with the way in which the research farm has experimented with the growing of cotton, safflower, castor oil and many other commodities. We produce only 3 per cent, of Australia's requirements of cotton, and this is certainly one product that could be grown very satisfactorily in the Kimberleys area. Cotton will no doubt be one of the basic crops grown in the area when the Ord River scheme is completed. There are more than 500,000 acres of irrigable country there. It is an amazing sight. The party then went to the Northern Territory, where my visit was very short. We visited one station where the manager told us that, within six years, the herds carried will increase from 40,000 head to 75,000 head. This increase in carrying capacity will be achieved by better means of animal husbandry, better subdivision and more water bores. This sort of development demonstrates the potential of the area, which, I think, will one day produce far more wealth than one can credit now. We also inspected the Belmont research station, where a great deal of work is being done on the crossing of different kinds of foreign cattle, such as the Afrikander and the Brahman, in efforts to evolve a tick-resistant type that will do well in the north. Magnificent work has been done at this research station, but there is a long way to go. We visited also Bryan Pastures and the Katherine research station, where the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is working on the development of tropical grasses and the problem of tropical diseases. The organization is to be congratulated on this work. There is no doubt that with respect to agriculture the northern areas are immediately on the verge of a major break-through. Over the next few years, we shall see tremendous changes in the north. We know that members of the Australian Labour Party talk about the north a lot. I point out that while they talk, these developments are taking place. I see that in this Budget the Government has provided for the expenditure of £1,750,000 on the development of brigalow lands in Queensland. As a farmer, I am very much impressed by the fertility of the brigalow area. The brigalow tree puts nitrogen into the soil, and there is no doubt that it greatly enriches the soil in the areas where it grows. I am greatly interested in the proposal for the expenditure of this large sum on the development of the brigalow lands, and I should like to be assured that, with the co-operation of the Queensland Government, local men will have some say in the expenditure of the money. I have seen what can happen in these development schemes. We have in the Orbost area in my electorate a land settlement scheme administered by the Victorian Government. The local Land Settlement Committee has been completely deprived of a say in the spending of the funds allocated, and I know that the local men are not altogether happy about the manner in which the money is being spent. I suggest that the Commonwealth Government make sure that local men with practical experience in the brigalow country have some say in the way in which the funds allocated to the development of the briaalow lands are spent. Like the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond), and also the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes), who asked a question on the subject the other day, I direct the attention of the Treasurer to the restricted volume of finance available to farmers. Several senior members of the staffs of two banks accompanied the party with which I recently toured northern and north-western Australia, and I discussed this problem with them. They said frankly that long-term lending to farmers is not attractive enough to the banks. We must do whatever we can to make more finance available in this field. People in my electorate have come to me seeking finance for what were absolutely sure-fire propositions for the banks, which were asked to provide a little extra capital, for example, to increase productivity or to promote efficiency. But the farmers just could not get the money from the banks. There is something wrong with the financial arrangements between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the trading banks if this sort of situation cannot be suitably dealt with. We see what happens, also, when a farmer who has, say, two sons but not enough land to settle both tries to obtain money from a bank in order to buy land on which to settle one of the sons. The bank will not lend the money. As a result, the second son is lost to farming and is forced to go to the city to get a job. I ask the Treasurer to look at these problems. The term over which the banks lend to primary producers was extended from three to eight years, but most farmers consider that the term is still too short to be satisfactory. Farmers need to borrow for longer terms extending up to twelve years, but the banks are not interested in lending for terms longer than eight years. monwealth Development Bank of Australia was supposed to solve that problem. to solve the problem, but, again, the possibilities are limited. It is a development bank; I am talking about ordinary trading possibilities. The Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia is designed to provide funds for the development of land. I have succeeded in obtainingfinancialassistance for people who wish to clear land, but the problem about which I am talking now is purely a trading bank problem. We hear a lot in this chamber about the redistribution of electoral boundaries, Mr Chairman. My electorate, I am very pleased to say, will not be affected by the changes proposed. Therefore, I can speak on this subject without fear of being charged with a display of unusual self-interest. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber have discussed this matter. Like a number of those who have discussed it, I am alarmed at the trend towards the weakening of the rural voice in this Parliament. Every time",47,Budget 1962 63

This is neither right nor fair to country people. Most of them, after all, contribute materially to the national income, and they should not be deprived, by redistributions, of their voice in this Parliament. I am very pleased to note that a total of £91,000,000 is to be allocated to housing this financial year. My electorate of Gippsland produces 30 per cent, of Victoria's requirements of scantling timbers. I am sure that the expenditure of £91,000,000 on housing will greatly lift the housing programme. The timber industry in Victoria has tremendous internal problems. I know, from talks with representatives of various sections of the industry, that all sections are doing their best to solve spoke about shipping freights and said that these problems. One of the greatest problems, of course, was presented by large imports of timber. I , for one, am very pleased that quantitative restrictions on Douglas fir and other timbers were imposed the other day, on the advice of the Special Advisory Authority associated with the Tariff Board. I am a little disappointed about several features of the Budget. I am sorry that it does not provide for a subsidy on superphosphate. This would have directly reduced farmers' costs and assisted them no end. I am sorry, also, that the Treasurer could not see his way clear to remove the sales tax from some foodstuffs. This would have greatly assisted primary industry, particularly the producers of dried vine fruits, in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull). Mr Chairman, this Budget will give stability to the economy. It provides for the continued expansion of trade and continually increasing productivity. We are now on a stable base. As a result of this Budget, unemployment will be reduced, despite the picture of gloom and doom painted by the Opposition. I submit that this Budget, far from being one of stagnation, will bring security to all. man, I am very pleased to have an opportunity to address the committee on this Budget. BeforeI discuss the points about which I am concerned, I want to tell the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr has not improved much. In April, 1962, Nixon), who recently visited the north-west of Western Australia, that the progress and development in that area of which he spoke have been achieved largely as a result of plans that were laid by a Labour government of Western Australia, together with pressure brought to bear on this Commonwealth Government, not only by Labour members of this Parliament generally, but also by me when I was formerly a member of this chamber. What this Government is doing even now is only a flea-bite compared with what should be done in the north of Western Australia and in the Northern Territory. However, I do not want to say too much about that matter; I would rather deal with it when the Estimates are being debated. The honourable member for Gippsland if we had our own shipping line, freight charges would be increased. I think that is it is true until it has been tried. But I point out to the honourable member for Mallee that when the Commonwealth line of ships was established by the Hughes Government, shipping freights were reduced by 50 per cent., and it was possible to break the shipping combine. That happy situation continued until the Bruce-Page Government came into office and sacrificed the shipping line at a give-away price. I mention that for the information of the honourable member for Gippsland, who probably was not very old when it happened and would not know very much about it. The Budget has been rightly referred to as the Treasurer's recipe for stagnation. That is a good name for it. It is a most unimaginative Budget. It does nothing to correct the blunders which have been a part of the disastrous policies of the Government. An economic stimulus was urgently needed, but the Budget did not provide it. As a matter of fact, it sent busness even further into the doldrums. Only a short time ago, the Commonwealth Statistician reported that employees in private industry fell by 74,300 in 1961. Despite the claims of the Government, the position",49,Budget 1962 63

94,Mr Webb,"I would not know whetherThe Australian Industries Development Association reportedEmployment in manufacturing industry is still nearly 50,000 below the level of a year ago. That is only in manufacturing industry. The report continuedA.I.D.A.'s Survey of Stocks for 1961, which was published in mid-March, indicated a build-up of £329 m. in the value of stocks held in 1960-61. We estimate that only about £75 m. of these stocks have been liquidated since. The report also saidUntil stocks are reduced to more normal levels, no steady demand for manufactures can be expected, and until manufacturing industry can return to a steady rate of balanced production, and so absorb the unemployed, provide work for the growing labour force, and keep eosts to a minimum, we cannot expect any vital return of public confidence and demand. The Budget has done nothing to allay the fears expressed by this association. We still have more than 90,000 unemployed in our midst. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) drew attention to this and said that the figure had been reduced from 130,000 to this level. But he was honest enough to say that this was only a normal seasonal reduction. He pointed out that the figure would rise to 120,000 when school-leavers joined the work force at tbe end of the year. That is not a very happy situation to have in prospect. According to the Minister for Labour and than 2,000 of those who left school last year are still unemployed. children went back to school because they could not obtain employment. The Department of Labour and National Service on 29th July reported that 23,349 juveniles under the age of 21 years were still unemployed. That is an increase of the number of young people seeking employment. It is scandalous that so many of them are out of employment. The economist, John Eddy, in an article published in the "" West Australian"" on 28th June, 1962, which was headed ""Budget and the 15-Year-Olds"", saidAn unusually large number of children turned 15 this year and many of them will be looking for jobs after Christmas. Their number of 215,000 is equal to 5 per cent, of our total work force of 4,300,000. This year's peak of 15-year-olds is nearly 40,000 more than last year. It is also 16,000 more than next year's quota will be. It results from a sharp jump in the birthrate In 1947. There was a marked increase in marriages in 1946 and 1947 after men returned from the war. With still about 2i per cent, of unemployment in Australia, let us hope that the August federal budget will take account of the need to remove the last remnants of our recent artificial pause in industrial growth. Nothing could be more frustrating for the new generation than inability to obtain useful work. The need to adopt measures in this Budget that would provide work for young people was utterly disregarded by the Government. This is a serious challenge to the Government, but it is doing nothing about it. Every person unemployed means so much unused capacity. There should be no unemployment in a young, developing country like this where so many works of a development nature have to be undertaken. The Government has created a pool of unemployment. In recent years, it has paid only lip service to the ideal of full employment. Its intention is clear. It wants a pool of unemployment, the depth of which will depend upon how much the public will stand. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said that there should be a pool of unemployment to discipline the workers. He said this publicly and his idea has now been put into effect. The"" Australian Financial Review ""a most unbiased newspaperof 14th August drew attention to the rising incidence of unemployment. It saidUnder the Menzies Government there has been a rising trend in the incidence of unemployment. Many school In the period July, 1946, to July, 1950, when Labour Government economic policies were predominant in their effects, the average level of registered unemployed applicants in July (excluding the 1949 strike-affected July) was 20,632. The newspaper pointed out that in the next six years of the Menzies Government, from 1951 to 1956, there was a rise in the average level of unemployed to 30,088, and the average for the last five years from 1957 to 1962 was 71,747. This shows that the pool of unemployed is gradually being increased rather than to the work force? paper. If you want to query what it has said, query the newspaper.

This means that at least 100,000 persons will be unemployed at the end of the year when the school children leave school. Tbe Deputy Leader of the Opposition claimed that this was a conservative estimate. It is conservative, because the honourable member for Mackellar has said that 120,000 persons will be unemployed. The figure could be even larger than this. The 1961-62 Budget allowed £8,630,000 for unemployment and sickness benefits, and the expenditure was £15,904,879-muc h more than the amount allowed.

That emphasizes the big lie of 1949 when the Prime Minister said that the value of social services would at least be maintained and, indeed, increased. He said that pensioners could rely on his party for justice. They have not got justice from this Government. When people were contributing to the National Welfare Fund in 1949 they believed that the money they paid would be returned in value. That has not happened because of the depreciation of the value of money resulting from this Government's financial policy. People have been paying good money and getting bad money in return. The £1 is worth approximately 7s. 6d. to-day compared with 20s. in 1949. The Government stands condemned also for its callous disregard of families. Every true Australian will agree that the native to £14 8s. a week. That allowance needs to be increased threefold in order to give placing themselves numerically. That is only natural because the family's spending A newly married man in receipt of £25 Taking reduced taxation and child endowment into account, the arrival of the second child reduces the income to £5 19s. for each member of the family, the third child reduces it to £4 18s., and the fourth reduces it to £4 4s. 2d. It can be seen that there is no encouragement to have children. The bigger the family the less it receives relative to its needs. Inflation under this Government has forced wage earners into higher income groups for taxation purposes but less can be purchased with the same amount of income. In 1949, a family on the basic wage with two children paid 16s. a year in taxation. Today, that family would pay £20 16s. As a result of inflation, people are paying more in taxation and are receiving less for it. More than 50 per cent, of the children born in Australia in 1894 were at least fourth in their families. This percentage has now dropped to 18 per cent. Fewer than one Australian couple in five is interested in having a family of four whereas about 60 years ago two couples in five were so interested. Surely, in order to lift the burden off the family the Government should increase child endowment. In 1948, when the basic wage was £5 15s., a family with five children received £2 per week in child endowment. To-day, with a basic wage of £14 8s., the same family receives only £2 5s. The basic wage has gone up two and a half times. In order to obtain the same value from child endowment to-day, a family of five should receive £4 10s. instead of £2 5s. Surely, these figures clearly indicate that something should be done in regard to child endowment. Some time ago, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council investigated nutrition levels in our community. It found that 73 per cent, of families with two children enjoyed a first class diet, but that only 62 per cent, of families with three children enjoyed that standard. For families with four children the figure was 38 per cent., with five children 27 per cent., and with six children 16 per cent. Big families cannot afford fat, fruit and milk products in adequate quantities which they need in order to give their children a decent standard of living. They must settle for bread and cereals as substitutes. This applies not merely to a few isolated cases, but to the community as a whole. If you have four children the odds are six to four against your being able to feed them well. If you have five, the odds increase to seven to three against your being able to give them a decent standard of living. The Government has turned a deaf ear to the plight of the pensioner. Science has so improved health standards that people are living longer than was the case 60 years ago. That is good. However, we should be concerned about not only how long they live, but also how they live. If a majority of pensioners are suffering poverty and are in dire straits, this is a reflection on our society. It has been suggested that a country's standard of civilization can be assessed by the way it treats its old people. If that is so, Australia has not a very high standard of civilization. Science is helping aged people to live longer, but the policy of this Government is making their additional years a misery to them. Pensions have not kept pace with the cost of living. The Commonwealth funeral benefit is still £10, as it was when it was introduced in 1943 by the Labour Government. The basic wage was then £4 16s., whilst it is now £14 8s. So, to restore its value, the funeral benefit should be increased to £30. It is important to compare our expenditure on social services with that of other countries. We are often told that we have a high standard of social service benefits. That is not true. During 1956-57, Australia spent 9.1 per cent, of its national income on social service benefits. Following are the percentages of national income spent on social services by other countries:Percentage of Country. national income. Austria 17.6 Belgium 16.3 Chile 9.7 Denmark 12.0 Finland 12.0 France 18.9 Germany 20.8 Ireland 11.5 Italy 15.2 Luxembourg 17.0 The Netherlands . . 12.3 New Zealand 13.0 Norway 10.1 Sweden 12.9 United Kingdom. . 12.1 Some countries, of course, spend a smaller proportion of their national income on social services than we do. For instance, Ceylon spends 4.2 per cent., Iceland 7.9 per cent., and Tunisia 5.7 per cent. These figures are available in a document titled, ""Cost of Social Security"", issued by the International Labour Organization for 1961. The social services expenditure that I have cited for Australia of 9.1 per cent, of national income includes expenditure by the States and public authorities generally on social services. I repeat that this Budget has been rightly referred to as a recipe for stagnation. The speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed the way to an immediate ending of the suffering and economic stagnation which the policies of this Government have created. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition put forward a dynamic policy, designed to provide the conditions for growth and planned national development which would secure prosperity and justice for all in this country. This Government cannot survive for much longer. The people are slowly but surely waking up to it. The skies are bhck with the Government's chickens coming home to roost.

I was hoping he would give me some leads, but he kept to the theme which most honourable members opposite who have spoken have followed during the course of this debate. His principal theme was unemployment. Members of the Opposition say they are in favour of full employment, but they deny that we on this side are in favour of it. I remind you, Sir, that the whole of this Budget is designed to create full employment. The honourable member for Stirling mentioned social services. I propose to say something in that regard and to give some comparisons a little later on. Tbe debate on the Budget has now progressed far enough for us to have a pretty clear idea of the policies of both the Government and the Opposition. The policy of the Government was summarized by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) in his Budget speech when he saidThe Government is determined to follow through with its expansionary programme until the economy is operating at the highest level of activity we can hope to sustain. That is the milk in the coco-nut. That, in precise terms, is what we stand for. The whole of the emphasis in the Treasurer's Budget Speech was on national development, stability of costs and prices and full employment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposiwords and later make some comments on them-said The Budget was obviously the work of men demoralized by their own failure. What an extraordinary statement by the acting leader of the party which left this country in a deplorable condition when it left office in 1949! The Labour Government left the Australian economy in the most deplorable condition in which it had ever been. It was still in power four years after the war had ended, so there was no excuse for it at all. It was not as though the Labour Government had been caught up in the aftermath of the war. It was still in office four years after the war ended, yet we still had complete controls in many respects. Commodities were dreadfully scare. Pensioners and people on fixed incomes were on the point of starvation, because they could not purchase goods which could be obtained only on the black market. There is no denying that. Commodities of all sorts were still under control. Building materials and capital issues were under control, and nobody can deny that black marketing was rampant at that time. Yet the party which was responsible for those conditions charges us with being a failure. It is very interesting also to notice that at the time of which I speak there was no effort whatever by the Labour Government to bring in a programme of expansion -for which the Opposition now tells us it stands-althoug h that was the time when expansion of industry was the most vital thing that could have been attended to. At that time the Labour Party was preoccupied with its idea of making Australia a socialist state, and it applied the. whole of its efforts to that purpose. Tbe Labour Government was thrown out of office because it tried to nationalize the banks of this country.",51,Budget 1962 63

That is apparent from all the speeches made by honourable members opposite. It believes that all economic in its history. The people now have more ills can be cured by a system of government controls. When something got out of hand, Labour would shut the door, so to speak, by putting a control on. That is the only method that honourable members opposite can suggest for adjusting the economy. They would not attempt to reach stability by having a free economy, although a free economy is the only field in which you can get full production. They want to control the economy by government edict. During this debate every spokesman for posal related to a period of only four the Labour Party has pressed for increased months and that its proposed deficit was at social services, and the member for Stirling the rate of £300,000,000 a year.

101,Mr Cramer,"I shall later. Our prowhich cannot buy the goods they need because the cost of the goods has been inflated beyond their means. As I have indicated previously, the Budget is designed to maintain the progress, expansion and development which have been the keynotes of this Government's policy since it was elected. To do this effectively it has been necessary to keep a very watchful eye on the movement of costs and prices because nothing would destroy basic progress more than would violent fluctuations in our economy. This has been no easy task in the last ten or twelve years. The world has been living on a razor's edge and there have been many occasions on which firm action has had to be taken to prevent runaway inflation. This Government has never hesitated to take the necessary action. Some people to-day ridicule the boom period of 1960. If ever there was a boom, that was it. I was able to observe it at close quarters. No one can deny that at that time the share prices of companies rose to an astronomical figure, far above their real value. In the real estate field, in which I have had a lifetime of experience, it was staggering to see, every Saturday, auction sales to which people would go to purchase blocks of land at almost any figure, not because they needed the land, but because they thought that they could make a profit by re-selling it on Monday morning. That was the kind of thing which was going on. As every one knows, new companies were springing up in mushroom fashion and taking over old established companies. The people were borrowing irresponsibly from cash order andfinancecompanies in a mad splurge of spending. Finance companies were springing up everywhere, wildly borrowing money through deposits, or by issuing notes and debentures at fantastic rates of interest, even up to as much as 15 per cent. These companies were advertising freely in the newspapers. Imports were soaring and our overseas balances were in jeopardy. This Government did not hesitate to take action, unpopular though it was, to rectify the position. No government would have been worthy of its salt if it had not taken action at that time to prevent that state of affairs continuing. I am convinced that this Government's F.6363/62 -R -[24 ] action saved the Australian economy. Unless the action had been taken the economy, as surely as we are here to-day, would have collapsed and presented all of us with very much greater difficulties than we are experiencing to-day. I am convinced that the Government was extremely courageous in the action that it took. This action has had the effect which was expected of it because now costs and prices have been stabilized, wild borrowing and lending have ceased, savings bank deposits have increased tremendously, imports have eased and overseas balances have improved. Unfortunately, in this march of progress some people have been hurt. That could not be helped. Although some unemployment occurred the Government has taken action to eliminate it. As every one knows, in February the Government reduced personal income tax and made the reduction retrospective. It made a special non-repayable grant to the States of £10,000,000, and an additional grant of £5,000,000 for housing advances. It reduced sales tax on motor vehicles, increased war service homes loans, introduced a 20 per cent, investment allowance on new plant and did many other worthwhile things. As I have said, these measures have had the desired effect and the economy is showing progress and stability. The principal point I want to make here is that most of these benefits are continuing, as the Treasurer indicated in his Budget speech. In addition, the proposed deficit of £118,000,000 will mean the injection of much new money into the community. This includes an additional £6,900,000 on defence expenditure, an additional £3,000,000 for the search for oil, an additional £17,000,000 for development projects in the States and an additional £26,000,000 for the States to spend themselves. Then, of course, as the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) has said, £91,000,000 has been allocated for housing purposes. I have not enumerated everything that the Budget contains but I have indicated what kind of budget it is. I know that there are different points of view on what a budget should do. People are entitled to have their own opinion. That is their democratic right. After all, every one does not see a matter in the same light. But frequently you will find that people do not think of fundamentals. Very often they are swayed by party political prejudices, believing that the other party is always wrong irrespective of what it does. In these cases catch cries sometimes become facts in the minds of the people. Then very often people are swayed by selfish motives and do not concern themselves with what is best for the nation so long as what is done suits their own purposes. Many people have such selfish motives. Then there are some who have an obsession about a particular matter and believe that if something is not done about it the rest of the programme will fall to the ground. Let us be clear about our objectives. I would say that all our efforts should be directed first, and above all else, to building a new nation; secondly, to preserving our democratic way of life; thirdly, to co-operataverage annual expenditure of £29,300,000. ing with other nations to keep the peace and preserve freedom for all; and fourthly, to increase our standard of living by evenhanded justice to the individual. Australia has a population of only 10,500,000 but bears a heavy responsibility. After all we are in the Pacific, adjoining the eastern nations, where more than half the world's population resides, but we are on the boundary fence. We are attached to western democracy. We have all the know-how handed down by tradition to us and yet we are completely uninhibited. We have the grave responsibility of occupying a vast continent, one of the last on earth to be developed. We have a responsibility not only to the free people of the world but also to tbe many young countries that have gained independence in South-East Asia in recent years. Unless we build here a new nation that is pledged to freedom and democracy, we are not doing our duty. I put it to the House that our primary The Government provided funds for work object should be to establish the basis upon on the Mount Isa railway in Queensland. which a great nation can be built.

To-day a great export trade is which this new nation is to be built. We being developed as a result of the assistance must not make errors; we must not allow this that this Government has given. country to drift into a condition that is not in line with our ideals and our free way of life. Therefore, the greatest responsibility rests upon us to lay the foundation to-day for this great new nation. Everything depends upon us. This is basically what is contained in this Budget and is the policy of this Government in its approach to national affairs. I invite honourable members to examine how the Government is laying the foundation. Look at what has already been started. The Government has spent £200,000,000 on the great Snowy Mountains scheme. This is an average of £16,600,000 per annum. Labour spent only £2,500,000 on it. The Government has carried on this scheme until £200,000,000 has been spent. The Government has provided for Commonwealth aid for roads the sum of £352,000,000 with an Labour spent a mere £8,900,000 per annum. For war service homes the Government has provided £382,000,000 at an average rate of £30,500,000 per annum. Labour, when it was in office, spent only £16,200,000 per annum. Thosefiguresgive some idea of the difference in approach of the two parties. Labour is pre-occupied with its socialistic ideas, consumer spending and its handouts to gain political favour. We, as I have said, are trying to develop this country by increasing its production and by giving work by establishing the basis for projects by which the nation can develop. Think of some of the other national works, in addition to those I have already mentioned, for which we on this side are responsible. Great water conservation schemes have been initiated by the Government in co-operation with the States. A grant of £5,000,000 was made to Western Australia mainly for the Ord River diversion dam. Standardization of railway gauges is This faith could easily be destroyed if the another developmental work for which the Australian people were foolish enough to Government has provided money. Funds put into power a government that would have been made available for beef roads run on socialist ideas and would destroy construction which will be of much assistall possibility of building within a reasonance to primary production in Australia. able time a great new nation, as we are The Government has concentrated on the bound-indee d obliged-to do. production of uranium and on supporting the Atomic Energy Commission; encouragespeech of the Minister for the Army( Mr ment has been given to the mining indusCramer) would be humorous if it were not try. No one can deny the progress that so serious for the many little people who the Government has made. We have conhave been hurt by the actions of this centrated on those things. One need only Government. His whole theme was that point to the search for oil and the unwe have never had it better. I invite the precedented expansion in oil refineries since Minister to come back to my electorate any this Government took office to realize the time he likes-the sooner the better-and importance that the Government attaches to address the record number of unemployed the oil industry. These are only some of there. He might tell those 808 unemployed the great works that have been started and the same things that he has been telling us are still being undertaken. Honourable members have heard the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the for is jobs. They want to work. They size what the Government has done to try to increase our export trade. Last year Australia's export income was £1,070,000,000-the highest in our history. the community-the farmers-wh o cerThis was a direct result of the work that tainly would not agree with the Minister. the Government has done.

103,Mr Davies (Braddon) [4.33],"Th eLast year, the Commonwealth Statistician published a consumer price index going back to 1949 and showing that £100 in 1949-50 bought goods which to-day cost £189. Applying this yardstick, the farmers with their £472,000,000 last year had in real income little more than half what they had in 1949-50, when Labour went out of office. Of course, the farmers realize this. Earlier in this sessional period, I told the House of a meeting of more than 200 farmers that was held this year at Ulverstone in north-western Tasmania. That meeting passed a resolution urging the Government to take steps to stabilize the posistagnation. tion of small farms. Those farmers realized there is no progress and no stability under this Government, as is claimed by honourable members opposite. It is about time the Government and its supporters came down from their ivory towers, went out among the people and learned the true position in the country. Farmers' incomes are a true indication farm income from such a property has of the stagnation in the Australian economy. fallen in the three years from 1957 to As I pointed out earlier, the farmers have 1960 from £6,728 to £4,332.

In view of this, the Government crimination is against the spirit of federawill have to give serious consideration to tion, and is totally unacceptable to us. We the facts brought to light in this most recent have put up with enough from this Government. In Tasmania, we grow the best lambs in the Commonwealth of Australia. They arc even better than the Canterbury lambs in New Zealand as is proved by the awards we have won in the United Kingdom. Yet this Government will not allow us even to stamp our lambs as a Tasmanian product. Then it has had the audacity to discriminate against Tasmanian producers and has made us take the lower guaranteed price. Our farmers need stability. More than any one else, they need to get out of the rut of No matter what Government supporters say to the contrary, there can be no denying a lack of stability when we consider the Australian sheep industry survey, published last week by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Let us look at a property in Tasmania with a capital value of £102,862, engaged in merino wool-growing. The net On a property engaged in growing crossand management has fallen from £792 to £151, or from 3.02 per cent, to .55 per In the case of a cross bred fat lamb prosurvey. Surely, it must grant Tasmania the higher minimum price for export lambs to stabilize the industry in Tasmania. One thing is certain: The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann), who is in charge of war service land settlement, should immediately review the commitments he expects soldier settlers to meet in respect of sheep blocks on which they have been settled. Under the present arrangement, the settler must find annually an amount which would represent at least 6 per cent, of the total capital investment in his holding. ""Yet the survey shows that the farmer on a merino wool-growing property is receiving only 3.36 per cent, and the farmer on a cross bred wool-growing property only .55 per cent. The settler on a cross bred fat lamb property receives only 1.29 per cent. It is impossible for the settlers to find 6 per cent, to meet their commitments, and in all fairness to the men concerned the Minister should review this matter. I was particularly interested to read in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" a report on action that is being taken in New South Wales. The report shows that this problem is not peculiar to Tasmania, but is also apparent in other States. The New South Wales Government has made a concession to struggling soldier settlers engaged in wool-growing and fat lamb raising. This follows the setting up of a committee by the New England Soldier Settlers Association, including representatives of the University of New England. The article goes on to stateThe report of the committee says that in many instances ex-servicemen who had settled on sheepraising blocks since 1955 had no chance of succeeding, whatever their efforts or capabilities. Then the report quotes the Minister for Lands in New South Wales as having saidThe Lands Department's change in policy would reduce the annual commitment of many settlers by as much as £800 a year. J turn now to the question of loans for rural purposes and here I would like to quote from a letter written by a group of primary producers in one part of my electorate. Dealing with this problem of bank loans for primary producers they say. . . we would like to mention that there is a desperate need for short and long term loans in the farming sector. There is the strange fact that to adhere to the assurance he gave to the in times of plenty loans are easily obtained, but when rural industry needs these loans most, they are restricted or have to be reduced. The rural industry, if to maintain its livelihood and competing abilities with elsewhere in the world, needs capital or protection. When banks are not prepared to assist to any extent, farmers are at mercy of merchants, brokers, etc., for credit and are sitting ducks for high interest rates. It is absurd that the banks indirectly advance monies to farmers through this sector of enterprise, enabling this sector to gain profit on interest rates-al l this adding to unnecessary greater production costs in primary industry. Mr Chairman, the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) raised this matter in a question directed to the Treasurer on Tuesday last when he referred to the growing need in rural industries for finance on a term equivalent, for instance, to that of the usual housing loan. In his reply the Treasurer said, among other thingsI did not seek to convey that the trading banks and the Development Bank together comprised all the available sources of funds for long-term rural borrowing. There are, of course, other institutions of which the honourable gentleman will be aware. Of course we all know about these other institutions. They include hire-purchase companies, pastoral companies and insurance companies. We all know, from trying to help farmers, how practically impossible it is to get loans through the normal banking channels. As my constituents say in the letter to which I have referred, they are sitting ducks for higher interest rates when they are forced to go from the banks to these outside finance institutions. Consider the position of a person who wants to borrow £10,000 for, perhaps, the development of some land. If he is unable to get it from the Commonwealth Trading Bank or the private trading banks, he is forced into the hands of, say, an insurance company. He must insure himself for £10,000, and so the high premium on this policy is added to his repayment of principal, plus interest at 6, 7, or even 8 per cent. That makes money so dear that it is practically impossible to-day for any one to do any fresh developmental work or try to set up his sons or daughters on farms. One could go on and give numerous other specific instances, but time does not permit. However, I do urge the Treasurer honourable member for Barker that this with the symptoms of this social malady matter would not be overlooked when the rather than to deal with the causes. next review was made of the banking policy of this Government. I should like now to turn for a few that is payable by Tasmania, at least on moments to Commonwealth and State that money that has been lent to us for financial relations. In view of the unour State works programme from Comemployment in my State of Tasmania, which monwealth revenue. If the interest bill rose from 3,000 in May to some 4,000 in were remitted we could finance more July, I repeat the plea that I made last developmental works and so reduce year for the cancellation of the interest bill unemployment. This should be done if we that is payable by Tasmania, from its own are to be denied special grants. In this taxation revenue, on money lent to it for connection the Budget papers show that in State works. I remind the committee that in June, from revenue, £916,000,000 in support of 1959, the Premiers' Conference devised a State works programmes. These revenues, new scheme of grants to replace the tax taxed from the people, have not been given reimbursement grants which had operated to the States; they have been lent to the since 1946. This new arrangement was to States at current bond interest rates, involvoperate for a six-year period, commencing ing the States immediately in burdens of with the fiscal year 1959-60. The view has repayment of principal and interest which been held by the State of Tasmania that will continue down the next 53 years. the basis adopted for calculating the new grants is of particular advantage to the vernment since it took office at the end of non-claimant States, which as members 1949, some £2,461,300,000 of revenue will know are New South Wales, Victoria, have been used to support Commonwealth South Australia and Queensland. This and State capital works up to the end of opinion has been confirmed by the very June, 1963. Of that figure, £1,545,200,000 definite improvement that has taken place has been expended upon Commonwealth in the revenue positions of those nonworks and, as I have already indicated, claimant States. The claimant States, Western Australia and Tasmania, do not derive the same relative benefit from the new grants, and their ability to achieve satisfactory budgetary results will continue to depend upon the receipt of substantial special grants. A study of the Budget papers over the past two years reveals that every mainland State will receive Commonwealth assistance for special projects and that Tasmania is excluded from such benefit. Certainly we did get a grant for the immediate relief of unemployment, but despite this the figures are still mounting. In my electorate alone the number of unemployed increased from 575 in May to an all-time record of 808 last month. The Bishop of Tasmania, the Right Reverend G. F, Cranswick, criticized the unemployment relief hand-out by this Government as only a temporary measure, and went on record as saying that to pay unemployment benefit is merely to tinker This Government could make a major contribution by cancelling the interest bill the twelve years ending this financial year the Commonwealth has provided, mainly Under the policies pursued by this Go£961,000,000 on State public works. It is little wonder, Mr Chairman, that throughout the term of the Menzies Government, while the public debt of the Commonwealth has fallen by £282,000,000, the public debt of the States has increased by £1,880,000,000, as is shown at page 92 of the Budget papers for 1962-63. Over the same period the annual interest bill of the Commonwealth has increased by only £3,500,000 per annum, while that of the States has risen from £35,000,000 to £130,000,000, as is shown at page 94 of the Budget papers. This constitutes a colossal burden upon State budgets. A very large portion of this interest represents interest on the total sum of £916,000,000 contributed from revenue in support of States works programmes. The effect in the case of Tasmania is that whereas the public debt of the State on 30th June, 1949, was only £37,700,000, it is now £194,000,000, which represents an increase in the interest liability of the State of more In Tasmania alone some 2,000 people were than £6,000,000 per annum. It would revolutionize thefinancesof the dustry for good.

104,Them To Proceed With Developmental Works To The Minister For Trade ( Mr Mcewen),"Apart from unrestricted imports from lowwage countries in recent years, our timber industry has been affected by the decline in home-building, particularly in Victoria. The circumstances of the home-building industry constitutes a barometer of conditions in the timber industry, because a rise or fall in housing figures directly affects the timber market. Such fluctuations are felt particularly in Tasmania, which sells 81 per cent, of its exportable timber to Victoria, which is the State that has been hardest hit in the matter of availability offinancefor housing. Exports of timber from Tasmania to Victoria fell from 60,000,000 super, feet in 1959-60 to 45,000,000 super, feet in 1961-62, a drop of 25 per cent. Let us look more closely at the housing figures for the various States. In New South Wales 29,522 houses were built in 1960, whilst in 1961 there was a very small drop to 28,522. In South Australia, 9,379 houses were built in I960, whilst in 1961 there was also a very small drop to 9,119. In Victoria 24,456 houses were built in 1960, but in the next year, 1961, the number fell by 5,806 to 18,740. In New South Wales the numbers fell by about 1,000, and in South Australia by fewer than 300, whilst in Victoria, to which State we supply most of our timber, the number fell by 5,806. Had conditions in Victoria been similar to those in New South Wales, where one house was built to every 102 people, 28,728 homes would have been built in Victoria. In South Australia one home was built to every 106 people, and on this ratio Victoria would have had 27,644 houses built. These figures clearly indicate that Victoria is getting a raw deal, which in turn means that Tasmania is suffering an acute depression in its timber industry. In fact, unless something is done to stimulate the homebuilding industry, the prospects for the timber industry not only in Tasmania but in all other parts of Australia as well are extremely bleak. In Canberra this month nearly 60 representatives of tbe building industry from all States met to prepare a common policy for meeting Australia's housing requirements. Their solution was that the present liquidity ratio of all savings banks be reduced from 70 to 65 per cent., on the strict understanding that the extra 5 per cent, so released will be ear-marked exclusively for home finance. and that such an arrangement must be on a permanent basis. Unfortunately, these gentlemen were not in possession of the real facts or they would have known that the banks are already operating at a level of 80 per cent., or even higher, with direction of funds into Commonwealth securities or the Reserve Bank. The banks, therefore, do not want to give any practical help for housing with their money. If they did, they could restrict their allocations to the Commonwealth Government and the Reserve Bank to the statutory limit of 70 per cent, and release up to £100,000,000 in additional funds for housing. It is high time that the Government faced its responsibilities with regard to housing, particularly in respect of homefinancein Victoria. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Falkinder) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Temporary Chairman, I was very glad to see the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) take such an interest in Victoria's problems. It is always good to see Tasmanians taking an interest in Victoria. We Victorians, too, like to help our sister State, which is so close to our shores, and I am glad to see the way in which representatives of the two States can co-operate in the solution of mutual problems. I was glad, also, to see the honourable member take a refreshing interest in the problems of the rural industries, for there has been so little mention by Opposition speakers during this debate of rural problems. Indeed, until I heard the remarks of the honourable member for Braddon, I wondered whether all Opposition members had forgotten that there were people who lived on the land. We listened for a long time to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) when he took part in this debate, but we heard not one reference by him to the rural industries. Nor, until the honourable member for Braddon spoke, did any other Opposition member mention this important sector of our economy. Government speakers in this debate, on the other hand, have shown that they realize that, as a result of this Government's economic policies during the last two or three years, the people who have benefited most are those who live on the land.",62,Budget 1962 63
105,Mr Howson (Fawkner) [5.4],"MrSurely the benefit to country people is demonstrated by the fact that in the financial year ended 30th June, 1962, our exports reached a record level of £1,080,000,000. because we have gone out of our way to achieve a stable price level, which has benefited particularly thW people who produce the commodities that we export. Furthermore, this stable price level has been achieved at a time when prices in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, many countries of western Europe and other countries to which we export, are rising possibly more rapidly than at any stage during the past ten years. The advantages of a stable price level in Australia are surely demonstrating themselves month after month. One would have expected honourable members opposite to mention these two important factors of our economic policy, but not once was there any mention by Opposition speakers of the important rural sector of our economy until we heard the refreshing speech made by the honourable member for Braddon. Opposition speakers have concentrated on manufacturing industry. As the representative of the Fawkner electorate, I am particularly interested in manufacturing industry, which plays an important part in my electorate. Therefore, I shall take on the Opposition on its own ground by discussing the situation of people at present engaged in manufacturing industry. I begin by saying that this Government's economic policy is designed to help private enterprise. With that in mind, let me discuss the economic environment as it is at present. I do not want to go into the past and keep barking back to what happened in 1960 or 1949, or at any other time in the past. Let me take the situation as it is here and now. I say to any privateenterprise undertaking engaged in manufacturing industry in Australia at the present time, ""Look at the wonderful economic environment in which you find yourself "". Let me run through a number of important aspects of manufacturing industry to-day. First of all, the manufacturer has full access to raw materials produced not only in Australia but also in any other part of the world. Absolutely no controls are F.6363/62 -R -[25 ] imposed, and he can import raw materials from any place from which he wants to get them. Secondly, he has full access to new machinery and can obtain for his manufacThis happened only turing processes the most modern plant obtainable from any part of the world. In fact, we encourage him, by means of special investment allowances, to buy new machinery with which to manufacture his product. Thirdly, any manufacturer in Australia who considers that he faces undue competition from imports can have his case for protection heard speedily by the Special Advisory Authority associated with the Tariff Board and can obtain promptly a determination on the question of whether the competition that he faces is fair or unfair. Not for many years have decisions been available to manufacturers more promptly than at present. Indeed, some people may say that we have gone too far in this respect. Fourthly, the manufacturer has full access to finance for development. Capital issues are not now controlled in Australia, and they never will be, I trust, while we have a government of the political complexion of the present one. Not only has the manufacturer full access to new money on the stock exchanges of Australia, but also, if he has a good case, he can obtain through agencies such as the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia and insurance companies funds witb which to increase the size and scope of his business. As we well know, over the last ten years, there has been no time better than the present for the manufacturer to approach the banks and obtain increased supplies of working capital for his business. Probably one of the most important factors for any manufacturer who has to estimate his costs for the purpose of determining whether he ought to manufacture a particular article, or for the purpose of submitting a tender for the supply of equipment, is a stable price level. No time has been more favorable than is the present for the making of these estimates. They can be made more easily now than in the past because we have a stable price level and also stable wage rates. The estimation of costs and future selling prices has never been more easy than at present. Next, labour and materials are available for any expansion programme. Various shortages such as were found in the past do not now exist. The next point is that there are no changes in tax rates. So often in the past, we have been told by manufacturers that changes in tax rates made it difficult for them to plan ahead. This Budget makes no change in the rates of taxes. This, also, should make it easier for the manufacturer to plan ahead. Finally, in estimating sales, the manufacturer can plan for a gradual increase in sales on the home market. With a programme of steady immigration and with increasing population, the home market is growing the whole time. Also, there are opportunities, if the manufacturer chooses to take advantage of them, for increased sales overseas as a result of the many incentives that this Government gives him to increase his exports. All these things, Mr Temporary Chairman, convince me that at no time over the last twelve years has there been a better economic framework within which to manufacture than there is at present. The one thing that any manufacturer needs to do is to get out and sell. In the past, he has not had enough incentive to do that. Selling has been too easy since the Second World War. But now, the one thing that the manufacturer needs to do is to sell, both on the home market and overseas. If every private enterprise manufacturer does his best to sell, there will be no more of this talk of lack of confidence in the Australian market. The Government has provided the necessary economic framework. The time is now ripe for private enterprise to take full advantage of the magnificent situation in which it finds itself. We heard the Deputy Leader of the some industries the work force is lower Opposition grumble about some problems than it was in 1960. What he did not say which he said existed in this field of private is that in many instances production in enterprise. He said that share prices on those industries is greater than it was in the stock exchanges are low. Anybody who 1960 and that there has been a marked inheard the Minister for the Interior( Mr crease in productivity in many industries Freeth) detail last evening the results of the operations of companies that have published their balance-sheets in the last month will know what good results are being achieved. the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would Each day now, we see reports of companies have us believe; the task is to reach a proproducing better results than ever. All this duction figure in excess of the 1960 figure. shows how conditions are improving in the We must find many new avenues of industrial field. As we were told yesterday growth in order to employ the additional by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr work force made available by the increase Turner), every indicator shows that throughof productivity that we have experienced in out the entire range of activity, except the last two years. possibly in the field of housing, the situation is improving. At this point, perhaps I may digress for a moment and discuss some of the matters that were raised by the honourable member for Braddon, particularly housing. Even if the rate of house construction at the moment is possibly not at quite as high a level as it was two years ago, the annual rate of commencements of new houses and flats is more than 86,000. Figures published this morning show that in July, authorizations of new houses and flats were nearly 8,500. This suggests that the building rate is in excess of 86,000 a year. The Australian Industries Development Association suggested a target of 93,000 homes a year, and already we are very close to that figure. So, even if the housing rate does reach 93,000, as I am confident it will in the next few months, the timber industry in Tasmania would seem to be geared at too high a level. Even with a high rate of home construction, it will find difficulty in selling all the timber that it can produce. It should be looking for other markets. The Opposition has made much of the need for full employment. I have always believed that we must make certain that we achieve full employment, but I would add the word "" useful"". I believe we should have not only full employment but also full useful employment. We should ensure that every person who is in a job is doing a job that is needed by the community. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spent some time establishing that in over the last two years. The task for Australia to-day is not to get back to 1960, as I remember well that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) spent some time in 1960 saying that the Australian work force was unbalanced, that there were far too many people in private enterprise and not enough in the public sector of the economy. He said that there were shortages of telephones, post offices, schools and so on. But what has the Government done in the last two years? It has effected a change in the distribution of man-power so that the various bottlenecks in the public sector that were holding up private enterprise are now being overcome. There has been a transfer of labour into some of the public sector for this very purpose. Now that we have done this, what is the cry from the Opposition? It is that the Government is bolstering up the economy with public works. Surely the Opposition cannot have it both ways! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said more than once: "" We will plan ahead. We will have a wonderful scheme of planning that will solve all our problems."" On what criteria will he decide that certain industries will grow at a certain rate and that other industries will grow at a different by Australian taxpayers. In order to do this, rate? How will he arrive at these targets for growth? He has not given us these details. But he has mentioned one matter and this may perhaps be taken as the way he will plan for growth. Let us examine his plan for a nationally owned overseas shipping line. This was also mentioned this afternoon by the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb). If this is to be one of the ways in which the Opposition will plan, we should inquire as to whether it is the most economical way of achieving the best use of Australia's resources. told us last night, the effect of the featherbedding of our coastal shipping trade is that it costs two and a half times as much to send copper concentrates from Port Augusta to Port Kembla as from Port Augusta to Japan. If the intention is to establish a subsidized overseas shipping line, let us consider some of the costs that the Australian taxpayer would have to meet. The first point I want to hammer home is that, to achieve a balance-of-payments saving of £200 a year the Australian taxpayer must pay £360 a year, a ratio of 5 to 9. The figures I am about to give are based on a paper prepared by the chairman of the Australian National Line, Captain J. P. Williams, entitled ""The Problems Facing Australian Shipping in the Next Decade"". I will not go into the detailed figures; I have a summary that bas been prepared from the detailed figures. The wonderful planners and economists opposite should keep these figures in mind. For every £1,000 of freight received by an overseas vessel trading between, say, continental and Australian ports about £270 is spent in Australia at the moment. The net drain on our overseas balance of payments is £730. If we were to have an Australian vessel operating between the same ports, it would be found that the Australian vessel would spend £530 overseas. The net gain, therefore, to the balance of payments would be £200 for every £1,000 of freight earned. That is a saving of 20 per cent. But in order to achieve this saving we would need to have an investment of £6,600, assuming that the ship were built in Australian yards at Australian prices. This, of course, includes the subsidy of one-third, which is already being paid we would need to find an interest charge of £170 a year on the building subsidy. The difference in operating costs must be subsidized, and this has been estimated at £190 for every £1,000 of freight earned. Let me repeat that, in order to achieve a balance-of-payments saving of £200 a year, the cost to the Australian taxpayer would be £360 a year. On the larger scale, in order to achieve a worthwhile saving in the balance of payments of £10,000,000 a year, we would need a subsidy of £18,000,000 a year and a capital investment of £330,000,000. We should compare this with the way that the Government has tried to increase exports. One matter that has been mentioned here is our aid to the export of coal. For an investment of £35,000,000 in coal ports in New South Wales and Queensland, we can increase our coal exports by £10,000,000 a year. An investment of £35,000,000 in Australian-built ships for an overseas shipping line would produce a balance-of-payments saving of £1,000,000. The same amount could be used to obtain an increase of £10,000,000 in our exports",63,Budget 1962 63
106,As The Minister For Trade ( Mr Mcewen),"of coal. Surely, it is better for the Government to invest in the most economical way rather than the uneconomical way proposed by the Opposition. I think, in the history of this Government, we have gone out of our way to spend the Australian taxpayers' money on an economic basis. The Opposition's proposal for a government-owned overseas shipping line would be one of the most uneconomic ways in which to spend the Australian taxpayers' money. The Opposition should have another look at some of these figures before they endorse these proposals. Everything that the Government has done has been done to help increase our exports and improve our balance of payments. We have used the criteria of useful work for the work force, .an economic return for the taxpayers' money, and a smoothing out of bottle necks -which have hampered private enterprise. One other thing I want to say before I conclude: During the whole of this debate on the Budget we have been thinking of the problems that we will encounter if the United Kingdom should join the European Economic Community. In a long speech, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave his views on this subject. He emphasized, quite rightly, the political aspect that will be a political point of view, for the United faced if the United Kingdom joins the Common Market. But neither he nor any member of the Opposition has said where the Labour Party stands on this issue. Do they believe that it is to Australia's advantage for the United Kingdom to join the Common Market or do they not think that? Let us have some courage from members of the Opposition and let them say where they stand on this issue. I have said on more tban one occasion, including tbe 8th March, 1961, that I thought that the political advantages of the United Kingdom's joining the Economic Community were such that it was vital that it should do so. I have stated that it is in Australia's interests that the United Kingdom should join the European Economic Community. I think the political advantages are such that they do not need much further debate. But not one member of the Opposition has done anything but sit on the fence with regard to this issue. I wish the Opposition would show a little more courage. I wish honourable members opposite would say where they stand on the political issue even if they are not prepared to say where they stand on the economic issue. I hope that before we finish our discussion of this Budget and of the Common Market next week we shall have some courageous statement in this respect from one member of the Opposition. [5.28] -Perhaps it would be appropriate if I commenced on the note on which the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Howson) finished. He challenged us to indicate what we think of the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community as a political issue. I remind him that the one outstanding Britisher whom we all admire in the United Kingdom, Sir Winston Churchill, is opposed to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom with respect to the political advantages-no t the economic advantages-that will flow from the entry of the United Kingdom into the European Common Market. That was stated clearly on television the other night. The honourable member for Fawkner has asked for a political decision on this matter from the Opposition. My answer is that the greatest leader the United Kingdom has produced has said that it would be bad, from Kingdom to join the Common Market. I always like to listen to the contribution of the honourable member for Fawkner. One of his statements with which I concur was that he favoured the useful employment of the whole of the Australian work force. The Opposition believes in that objective, too. That is why we object to the necessity to provide £13,000,000 in this Budget for unemployment benefit. The honourable member spoke about the increase in productivity. I have heard honourable members on the Government side of the chamber say that increased productivity should be the basis of increased improvements in wages and conditions of employees. However, the present basic wage was fixed as at June, 1960, taking into account only productivity increases for 1959-60. We have now almostfinishedthe year 1962, and the Government is talking about stabilizing the present situation. Since the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission last fixed the basic wage there have been three minor falls in",66,Budget 1962 63
107,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"the cost of living in the last three quarters despite the fact that the court added 12s. to the basic wage on the occasion that I mentioned. In his Budget speech the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) referred to the question of employment and production but the Opposition does not agree with the way in which he stated it. He saidIn 1961-62 there were big increases in employment, production and the volume of trade and, generally, expansion appears to be proceeding steadily. But there is still some way to go. Unemployment has to be reduced further. There is still a fair amount of plant capacity which could be taken up and there is always new labour coming forward and new plant being installed. The Treasurer also saidTo cope with this formidable task of absorbing labour, it is clear that there has to be a substantial and continuing rise in the demand for labourdirectly, as on building jobs or in transport and the service trades or, indirectly, through the demand for goods back along the lines of production.. In another part of the Budget speech, the Treasurer took credit for the fact that over £1,000,000 was to be spent this year in providing new diesel traction for the South Australian Government. Nobody would know better than the honourable member for Fawkner that with technological advances in transport less and less man-power is required. So, the Government has taken action which will have the reverse effect on employment to that which is desired. Some honourable members on the Government side of the chamber realize that if increases of productivity are not matched with increases of the purchasing power of the community the present stagnation will, continue. That is a fact which the Government does not appear to understand. I do not disagree with quite a lot that the honourable member for Fawkner said concerning productivity and the need for increases. The following statement appears in the Department of Trade publication, "" Survey of Manufacturing Activity in AusFebruary of last year, he made a statement tralia "", under the heading of "" Basic that caused me some concern. We know Materials "":Employment in the group did not increase by as young people from the schools begins in much as output did, as a number of industries, due to the special conditions of the recession, November of each year. In the report that made significant recoveries in production without I have mentioned, the Minister referred to the need for commensurate increases in employa record number of unemployed-to ment. One of the things that we do not seem to for employment. We are getting close to understand in this country is that every time we re-equip we get closer to outright automation. Every move that is made in re-equipment, whether in rail or road transport or in the air or in manufacturing, brings us closer to automation. Do not think that I am condemning automation and re-equipment. Such a policy has to be followed if we are to succeed as a secondary industry nation. But the problem that this Government does not seem to understand is this: We are not getting full employment and full productivity except in the six capital cities. Like the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Howson), I do not want to go back beyond the last thirteen months. I shall deal with the period from July of last year to July of this year. If we look at the monthly reports issued by the Minister for Labour and National Serperiod the number of unemployed fell from 113,000 to 90,000; or by 1,900 a month. If we analyse those figures, we find that although there were 23,300 fewer people out of employment, 17,000 of them lived in the six capital cities. The fall in unemployment represented by the other 6,000 is the diminution of a small force stretched across Australia. In the majority of the areas concerned, the number of unemployed is increasing. In answer to a question this morning, the Minister for Labour and National Service gave the figures for the country towns and provincial cities, but he did not go as far as I propose to go. This is one of the national problems that the Government is not facing. If the belief of the honourable member for Fawkner is correct, and the Government wants productivity for any money it expends, the first problem to solve is that of getting some return for the £13,000,000 it is pouring down the drain in unemployment relief. When the Minister produced a report in that there is an increase each year in the number of school leavers. The flow of 131,496 people actually listed as waiting",67,Budget 1962 63

I suggest that the Minister will be in exactly it demonstrated that this argument about callousthe same position this year. The Governness to the unemployed is hypocritical drivel. ment has merely budgeted for an amount of The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister relief. It knows that that money will go up the lead given by the Prime Minister. He down the drain, but it appears to be doing saidnothing effective to reduce unemployment. The Minister mentioned the question of unemployment in country towns this morning, but the Government is doing nothing at all about it. We can forget about the clearing of an area in the Fitzroy Basin, the return for the money that is being spent. money being spent on the Mount Isa railway line and the money being advanced July of last year and July of this year. In to South Australia for the purchase of new 1961 Bendigo had 383 people on unemrailway equipment. We can forget almost ployment relief and in 1962 the figure was everything the Government has done in an 452. In Wangaratta, in 1961 there were attempt to reduce the unemployment that 152 people on unemployment relief is spreading across the face of this country. and in 1962 there were 384. It is increasing month by month. When the Minister was replying to a ment at Wangaratta, where there are so question in this chamber not long ago, dealmany industries. The figures are similar ing with the man-power position in the throughout the country. A t Rockharnpton, coastal towns of Queensland, he referred to in Queensland, in 1961 there were 192 what was happening in the meat and sugar people on unemployment relief and in industries and said there had been a great 1962 the figure is 374.

What were 257 on unemployment relief in he should have referred to was the 1961 and in 1962 the figure is 344. result of automation in those industries in These are not the numbers of people Queensland. In July of last year, 3,051 men actually unemployed, but of those on unemwere picked up to meet the requirements of ployment relief.

I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner that if money is to be spent it should be spent on something productive. The Minister for Labour and National Service in his July report on employment made a comparison between the position in 1946 and the position in 1962. I remind him that we are dealing with human beings. Surely to deal with the problem merely in terms of a comparison between 1946 and 1962 is to get down to the lowest rung on the ladder. As we have claimed repeatedly, the Government has treated the unemployed callously. Apart from the 50 per cent, increase in unemployment during the last twelve months in Taree and Kempsey, as the honourable member for Lyne well knows, a vast number of children will be leaving school this year. Regarding the 600 unemployed on the basis of 200 single persons and 400 married men with two children-the family unit referred to by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister-w e find that the planned expenditure for this year in unemployment relief in those two towns alone is well over are trained they have to leave the town to £200,000.

Tbe statistics Lismore to Maitland, we find an increase published by the Commonwealth Employof more than 350 in the number of persons ment Service-the y are available to all receiving unemployment benefit in July, honourable members-giv e an idea of the 1962, as compared with July, 1961. In the shocking state of our education system, so north coast area 2,500 people are receiving far as technical training is concerned, after unemployment benefit. Let us regard this twelve years of this Government's adminisnumber on the basis of 500 single men, tration. Taking the Prime Minister's own 1,000 married men with no children and State of Victoria as an example, we find 1,000 married men with two children. that there are at present 17,481 males out Without taking into account the school of employment, of which number 474 fall leavers for whom jobs will have to be found, into the categories of skilled metal and £1,000,000 will be spent on unemployment electrical staff. But at present Victoria has relief in 1962-63. If you try to tell me 1,206 job vacancies in these categories. that this £1,000,000 is being spent profitYet the Prime Minister brushes off the ably, I have yet to learn the value of money. matter of technical education which was Let me pass now from the policy which Opposition! this Government has adopted in relation to unemployment relief to tbe matter of education. There is such an imbalance in power to think in terms of what is best for education that I marvel that the Cabinet Australia. Evidently this Government has stands for what is going on. When replying to the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on this question, the Prime Minister, who commented really on only two matters, unemployment and education, The second particular comment that I want to makeI might well make 50, but I will limit myself-is that the honourable gentleman said in his projected budget there would be an emergency grant to the States for education. Whenever the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) introduces a budget he makes a great play on the number of job vacancies. To-day, for the first time, the Minister for Labour some reference to the need to educate people for jobs. I do not think that any other member of Cabinet has done so yet. What is happening in the field of technical training to-day is tragic. I have heard the Minister say often that many children remained at school this year instead of seeking jobs. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knew the true position in relation to education before he made his speech because we had discussed it. He knew the deficiencies which exist in the Australian system of technical training. Taking Orange in New South Wales as an example, I point out that as soon as boys raised by the Deputy Leader of the Evidently this Government has lost its",69,Budget 1962 63
111,And National Service ( Mr Mcmahon) Made,"lost its power to think of the need for techas a national council was required in warnical training. Tbe Minister spoke about children remaining at school because they had no chance of getting a job. That is a national tragedy. I do not care what amount of money is spent on technical training. Even if the amount ran into millions of pounds, it would be money well spent. We should implement some co-ordinated Commonwealth and State training scheme designed to advance technical skills. The Commonwealth should find the money. Then, instead of children remaining at school money. As the Deputy Prime Minister because they cannot get jobs, we would be able to give technical training to those who wanted it. The nearer we come to automation, the greater will be the need for highly skilled technicians. the Government is doing nothing about it. Do not tell me that it is a matter for the States. The Prime Minister dismissed this matter by asking us what we would do. Even if £10,000,000 was needed to give technical training to every boy who wanted it, and who otherwise would be compelled to remain at school because he could not get a job, it would be the best £10,000,000 ever spent in Australia. Let me refer now to the honourable member's desire to have productive expenditure. There is not one member in this place who would not agree with him. Ministers and honourable members on the Government side have mentioned planning. During the war when every shilling and every ounce of man-power had to be considered, we set up the National Works Council to co-ordinate expenditure and productivity. What was necessary in war-time is more than ever necessary now. The national requirement, about which the honourable member for Cowper spoke, that £1,000,000 a year be expended on unemployment relief on the north coast of New South Wales is an issue that can only be dealt with on a basis of co-ordination between federal, State or local government. You, Mr Chairman, know that only last week in the town of Kempsey, in which already 302 people are on the dole, the local council had to sack eight more of its employees. The only reason was that it did not have tbe money to pay them. Just time, so it is required now so that we can get the very thing that the honourable member for Fawkner is talking about. We must have a co-ordination arrangement between the Commonwealth Government in Canberra, the State governments and shire and municipal authorities to ensure that, instead of pouring £13,000,000 in unemployment benefit down the draindead money-w e get some return for the amount paid in unemployment relief to a man witb a wife and two children is half the basic wage. If that amount of £13,000,000 were set aside and, if need be, an equal amount added to it, a co-ordinating authority could then make sure that some return would be forthcoming for the money expended. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) adopted a callous approach and said, ""That is what we have done and that is the answer"". The unemployment benefit for a man and his wife is £7 2s. 6d. a week-4 8 per cent, of the basic wage. I have never heard of anything quite so stupid as for the Deputy Prime Minister to admit that we are paying men 48 per cent, of the basic wage for no return at all. If we had a co-ordinated system between the authorities that I have mentioned the other 52 per cent, could be added and we could get a full return. That is why the Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition said that the Government's approach was callous. On behalf of the people in Kempsey, Taree and all the north-coast towns I say that the position is hopeless. Under this Government's policy they have no future. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

115,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Minister foropportunities both for employment and for the greater use of Australian resources. It is supplemented by an effective banking and financial policy to iron out industrial and business fluctuations during the course of the year. The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) having delivered the Budget, it is the responsibility of the Ministers and members on this side of the chamber both to explain its purposes and to justify it to the Australian people. Sir, I am sure we can do that. BeforeI come to the Budget itself, I should like to make two comments about the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). First, his speech was delivered from a very lofty perch. There were plenty of illustrations from current statistics. It was plentifully larded with statements taken from most of the weekly journals and financial periodicals that are available to us. But what I found singularly lacking in the speech of the honourable gentleman, just as it was singularly lacking in the speeches of all other members of the Opposition, was a feeling for humanity, a feeling of warmth and a feeling that the Labour Party acted for the common man and in his interests. Having hopped off bis perch, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition immediately afterwards jumped into the pan. He said that this Government bad been guilty of immorality in its approach to full employment. We state clearly that 2 per cent, of unemployment except at the seasonal peak is too high, and the Treasurer has stated that the action we have taken is designed to reduce the number of unemployed. But when the Labour Party was in office, it regarded 5 or 6 per cent, as normal. If our actions are immoral, what adjective does the Opposition use to describe its own ideas that three times the present number of unemployed is normal? SecondlyI regret to say thisI think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition indulged, particularly in Melbourne, in personal criticism of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-thi s brash and very ambitious young man-ha s to learn is that the people of Australia will not tolerate personalities from a young man and criticism of a great man who has successfully led Australia over the past twelve years. As I see it, there are two questions exercising the mind of the average Australian to-day. WhatI want to do to-night is to attempt to answer those questions and to satisfy queries about them. BeforeI do that, Mr Chairman, might I make one comment? When we are considering our problems, we should not think that it is for the Government alone to carry out tbe task of re-establishing and maintaining the economic health of this community. There are others as well as the Government. They include the manufacturers, the commercial interests, the retail traders and the trade unions themselves. They have a task to play just as importantly as the Government. The task should not be left to us alone. As I see it, two questions are exercising the public mind to-day. The first is this: Is the stimulus given by the Budget sufficient to achieve our objectives-to open up the way for greater opportunities to the manufacturers and to ensure greater opportunities of full employment? The second question is complementary. Will the stimulus that is given, and will the activity that follows, be sufficient to permit the absorption of the increasing number of young people leaving school and the growth in the work force that will take place during 1961-62? These, in my view, are the two main problems that face us. HereI want to state my political philosophy and the cardinal principle of Liberal Country Party philosophy. We believe in full employment. We do not believe in spouting out statistics. To us it is not statistics that matter. They are but illustrations of a trend and indicate to the Government the action it should take. WhyI want full employment-and why I am sure my colleagues want full employment-is because we do not want the suffering and frustration that comes to those who want a job, need one, cannot find one and consequently have to register with the Department of Labour and National Service and, in some cases, apply for unemployment benefit. My view of full employment is that this is a desperately human problem. I cannot understand those who do their best to create difficulties and a climate of pessimism so that unemployment will grow. 1 turn now to the question that I want to answer. Is the stimulus given by the Budget big enough? We have budgeted for a deficit of about £120,000,000. Sir, I would like to put this in context. Looking at Australia's present economic position, every objective observer would be compelled to admit that what is called the economic structure is sound. We have favorable overseas reserves. Our trading position is good. Our costs are relatively stable. If you look at the whole of the structure, you are compelled to say that it is probably one of the strongest, if not the strongest, in the whole of the western communities. This being so, and if we want increased activity, what is the ingredient missing? I shall come to that later. We have a sound economy and the Government has budgeted for a deficit of about £120,000,000. Again, I remind the committee that it is not the job of the Government to go it alone and try to do everything on its own. Others have to join with usthe manufacturers, the commercial interests and, in particular, the Australian Council of Trade Unions. If we look at thefiguresand at what has happened when we have had deficits in other years, we find that in 1958-59, when the Government budgeted for a deficit of £110,000,000, the number of wage and salary earners rose in the year by 50,000 and unemployment fell. In 1959-60, when the deficit was £61,000,000, the number of wage and salary earners rose by 106,000 and unemployment fell again. If you study the figures to see what has usually followed deficit financing, you will see that usually a budget deficit is followed by a fall in unemployment and a large rise in the number Of wage and salary earners. I think, too, that it is fair to say that the larger the deficit, the bigger the impact and the greater the fall in unemployment. SoI think we are entitled to claim that, as this is the biggest deficit we have known, the prospects of a large rise in the number of wage and salary earners is very real and, secondly, that the fall in unemployment should be substantial. I know you cannot always gauge exactly the impact of a deficit because you can never tell just how much people will save, nor can you tell just how much they will spend. What you can say, in the case of a deficit of this kind, is that it must have a stimulatory effect, and in my view the stimulatory effect should be sufficient to achieve the Government's objectives. I move on to the second part of this problem. I have stressed, and I want to stress again, that the job is not for the Government alone; the job is there for private industry, for the trade unions, and for consumers. Let us look for a moment at the consumers and ask whether they can afford to spend a little more. The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) stated in his Budget speech that during the course of the next few months there would be something like £90,000,000 or £95,000,000 in taxation reimbursements flowing into the community. Savings are at an all-time high and are increasing, and there has been a reduction in personal taxation of 5 per cent. In those circumstances no one can argue that there is not sufficient money to permit a large increase in consumer expenditure. There is sufficient, and if the consumers wanted to go on a spending spree it would be found in little or no time that we could quickly have another boom. Let us turn now to the manufacturers and see what we have done for them. I mention here that the amount of the concessions made by the Government in February and in this Budget will, in a full year, cost the revenue £75,000,000. But let us look further at the manufacturers and see what has been done to provide an incentive for capital investment. In the first place we have given them a 20 per cent, investment allowance, which means they can claim as a deduction from earnings of 20 per cent, more for the manufacturing equipment that they buy than they actually spend in purchasing it. Secondly, protection by way of quantitative restrictions of imports may be imposed by the special tariff authority call them quotas if you like. We intend to vest in the Tariff Board power to impose such restrictions, if it thinks they are desirable. They are provided with the money and then with the incentive to equip and, secondly, protection of the local market. I now turn to the trade union movement. I find it strange that members of the Opposition should be claiming that this is a stagnant economy. Even now the trade union movement is claiming a 54 per cent, increase in margins for skill and a big increase in the basic wage. Within the course of the next few months it will argue before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that so great has been the increase in productivity and prosperity that they are justified in claiming not a 5 per cent., not 10 per cent., but a 54 per cent, increase in margins. Any one who, in the face of that, claims that the prospects are not bright and that the economy is stagnant, takes a different view from mine. I wonder if the Opposition will state its views to the that the consumer is not spending enough. Arbitration Commission. This brings me to the answer. I have stated that the structure of the economy is sound; 1 have stated that I believe the Government has given incentives to the consumer and to the manufacturer. What then is the missing ingredient? I was pleased to-day to listen to my friend, the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr ducer. I mention that one reservation. I Howson), debating this matter, and I am sure that what he said is correct. The trouble with us to-day, Sir, is that there is community. The structure of the economy too much gnashing of teeth and wringing of hands. There are far too many people who proclaim that we have difficulties in front of us for which they cannot see a solution. For my part, if I were a businessproblem of employment will quickly be put man, I would regard it as the essential feature of selling and good merchandising to go out and sell my product rather than stimulatory effects of the Budget deficit will wail about my problems. This is the satisfy at least honourable members on this ingredient that is lacking. The great chambers of manufactures and to-night is this: Is the stimulus sufficiently commerce, and the retail traders, in their great to absorb the increase in the work monthly journals, are all too prone to force during 1962-63 and, more particularly, become involved in the higher realms of those who are about to leave school? I economics and to discuss the most academic well remember that just before the last elecquestions such as the prospects for balance tion many people were making predictions of payments and the future growth of the that we would not be able to absorb the work force. They always tend to adopt the school leavers who registered with us over attitude that our problems are insoluble. the Christmas period or, to put it more The same old problem is academically disprecisely, far too many people were claimcussed over and over again and in the proing that the young people leaving school cess the difficulties become multiplied until had no prospect of getting employment. finally it does look as though they are What are the facts and where does the truth insoluble.

In my view, if these great ment Service registered 72,500 young people associations spent more of their efforts in for employment last year fewer than 5,250 creating a psychology favorable to growtn are now registered. That was accomplished and favorable to spending, they would do at a time when all the critics, including ever so much better than by employing a few economists to give them an analysis of abstract theories of economics. This, Sir, is the missing ingredient. We have all a part to play. The Government has, I think, played its part. It is now up to the other sectors of the economy to take some share of the responsibilities. I should make, here, this one reservation. Australia is a great trading country and we have a tendency to move to extremes. Many people are now complaining That may perhaps be true. I do not want to advocate that the consumer should spend all he earns, because we still need savings if our developmental programmes are to be continued, and we still need savings if we are to restrain inflation and. consequently, to prevent costs rising and difficulties emerging for the primary prodo say in conclusion in this part of my speech that we have a vigorous, healthy is sound. The opportunities are there for rapid and widespread development. It is up to us now to get on with the job; if we do, I predict that this sensitive and difficult into perspective. I hope that what I have said about the side of the chamber. The second question I want to debate members of the Labour Party, were proclaiming that the problem was insoluble. Now, Sir, what of this year's school leavers? I look at the problem in this way. People say we have had a large increase in population, a large increase in the number of school leavers, and that we cannot solve the problem. Let me state in precise terms what the problem is. You can never gauge precisely the number of school leavers or the increase in the work force. We have, to-day, it is true, something like 90,000 people registered for employment, and we believe there will be an increase in the work force of between 85,000 and 90,000 during the course of this year. But we can never say precisely what the increase in the work force will be or how many schoolleavers there will be. What we do is take the number of fifteen-year olds in the community and from that draw certain conclusions. AlthoughI take no personal credit for it, being a bachelor, I can tell honourable members that since I have been the Minister for Labour and National Service the number of fifteen-year olds has increased from 175,000 in 1960 to 195,000 in 1961, and it is estimated to be 205,000 this year. What is important is that we have now reached the peak; we expect that the number next year will fall to about 200,000, and we do not expect a further rise to commence until 1965. What is important for me as the Minister for Labour and National Service is that in 1958-59, the first year in which I administered this portfolio, we registered through the Commonwealth Employment Service 39,667 schoolleavers whilst last year we registered 72,376, and we expect to register about 75,000 this year. I ask myself this question, therefore: If last year, in more difficult economic conditions than we are experiencing to-day, and with roughly the same numbers of people registering with us, we successfully placed nearly all of those people in employment, should we expect any great problem in quickly placing the new school-leavers in employment this year? The outlook this year is undoubtedly better. SoI can say with conviction that if we solved the problem without great difficulties last year our prospects should be much better this year. I have no doubt about this. I am sure that this problem of placing schoolleavers has got out of perspective. We. have three good months ahead of us, and the numbers of school-leavers out of employment will drop substantially below 5,000 before the end of October. Those who consider there is a problem, and who prefer to be defeatist, ignore the facts. They fail to appreciate what has been done and the nature of the problem. So, I answer the second question, whether I think that the stimulus is great enough to permit us to absorb the 1962-63 school-leavers more easily than last year. The answer, providing we all play our part, is an emphatic affirmative. wrong, anyhow. at the statistics and at every forecast that has been made, you will see that they have been right. If you would like to bet £10 in respect of every forecast, I will take the bet. Of course when one mentions money one can always shut you up. There are several matters relating to employment that I want to mention. The first relates to the employment of males. I have the relevant figures before me, and what I am glad to be able to report to the committee is this: Since the end of January this year the number of registrants for employment has fallen by 41,000. This is a healthy figure. I know that people will criticize it, and I personally realize that it is not quite good enough; however, no one can deny that in the few months that we have had to deal with the problem, the placing of 41,000 people in employment has been good. The important aspect to which I want to direct attention is that 32,500 of those 41,000 have been males. Women are important, of course, although again I do not want to say very much on that subject, being a bachelor. Of course women are important, no one denies it; likewise no one will deny that we regard the male breadwinner as being more socially important. We should regard the placement in employment of 32,500 males as a reason for satisfaction. The second point I want to make relates to the creation of job opportunities. I have heard it said that sufficient opportunities are not opening up quickly enough and that we have a stagnant economy. The fact is that we",71,Budget 1962 63
116,Mr Bryant,But you have always been,75,Budget 1962 63
117,Mr Mcmahon,"Hav e I? If you lookhave now more than 9,300 vacancies registered with us each week, which is about the highest level of job vacancy registrations that we have ever recorded in July, with ""two possible exceptions under boom conditions. This is not a sign of stagnation but of growth. Just as important is the fact that we are placing people in jobs at the rate of 6,900 a week, the highest ever recorded in the month of July. So, Sir, far from being depressed about the position, I say these are signs of a growing and dynamic economy. Looking at the position in perspective and taking all the facts, surely any objective and decent-minded person would say that this is a sign of growthopportunities are opening up. Let us give up wailing; there is no necessity for it. The only other matter I want to mention relates to the oft-repeated statement that we will have a large number of unemployed with us after the Christmas vacation. I think the committee will know-and certainly honourable members on this side of the committee will know-that it is unusual for employers to recruit labour over the Christmas period and during January. If the number of school leavers registered with us has grown from 39,667 in 1958-59 to 72,376 in 1961-62, and 70 per cent, of those have registered over the Christmas period, surely it cannot be expected that registrations for employment will be stationary or that we can prevent the number of registrants for employment from growing over that period. Of course the numbers will grow. All sensible men will know that under to-day's circumstances if a young person wants a job he will come to us to Tegister. He knows that that is the best and easiest way to get a job; and he knows, especially if he is acquainted with the facts what we want is confidence in our future. I have given, that he will be placed in emWith that confidence I have no doubt that ployment fairly quickly. It is not, therefore, we will see a declining rate of unemploya matter for wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth and of howling about the problem which will emerge during January and February. It is in the very nature of things that the problem will arise. That is no cause for thinking that the problem is not capable of solution. It can and will be solved quickly. When I consider vital industries where job opportunities must be opened up if we are to have full employment, I think of the textile industry, the motor vehicle industry and the building industry. I have not time to deal with textiles and motor vehicles; the committee knows enough about them already. I shall mention the building industry, and I shall read part of an article that appeared in this morning's "" Sydney Morning Herald ""The total value of new buildings approved in Australia in July was a record £62.5 million. If you look at the record of housing commencements you will find that thefigurefor this year is also a record one. This means that job opportunities are opening up. I would also like to quote an extract from the July, 1962, "" Survey of Trends"" issued by the Bank of New South Wales and the Associated Chambers of Manufactures. A forecast is made about prospects for the future in these termsThere is widespread optimism that the general business situation will improve during the next six months and the expectations now given are more favourable than those of the last survey and are strongly optimistic. This forecast, I believe, could well turn out to be right. I see no reason to disagree with this expression of view. Surely here, too, is reason for confidence. SoI conclude on this note: I have asked two questions. The first is: Is the stimulus great enough? The Government has done its part, and it is now up to the manufacturers, the commercial interests and the trade unions to join with us in reducing the number of unemployed quickly. The second question is: DoI think there is a real problem with regard to the young people? There is a problem to be solved, but I am certain that we can quickly solve it. Tbe structure is sound, the money is there, and ment and real prospects of employing those of our young people who come into the work force this year. Mr Chairman, any sane person must welcome the statement by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr McMahon) that the Government's policy is designed to achieve full employment. What is regrettable, however, is that he has not told us when he expects this to be realized.",75,Budget 1962 63
118,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [8.30],"Any sane person must hope that the Minister is right in his forecast that unemployment will fall. But, unfortunately for him, certain statements made by him last year are on record. I see that the Minister is now leaving the chamber. Since he was betting, it might have been a good thing had he stayed to hear about his former forecasts with respect to unemployment. Speaking on television on 3rd December, 1961, just before the last general election, the Minister saidJobs should be more readily available this year than last year. Only a sharp decline in business confidence will slow up the placement of these young people in jobs. Only the irresponsible and grossly false utterances of Mr Calwell and his supporters can shake business confidence. The critically important fact about employment is that the number of people registered for employAnother was a fear that the Government might be ment fell by 16,887 during the three months to the end of October and the number receiving unemployment benefits fell by 13,559. These figures clearly show that more and more people are being placed in employment and I am positive that this favorable trend is continuing. At the time at which the Minister said that, the number of people unemployed, according to his own figures, was 100,057. A t the end of the same month, it was 115,936, and, at the end of the next month, it was 131,500. The Minister said on 3rd December last, for election purposes, that the favorable trend that he claimed was then apparent was continuing. . Yet unemployment rose in the next two months by more than 31,000. So, if honourable members over here do not regard it as axiomatic that the Minister's forecasts are accurate, perhaps this is because we remember that the forecasts made last year were not accurate. The second thing that I should like to say about the Minister's remarks is that every budget involves a series of policy choices. The Minister has not vindicated the policy choices which this Government has made over the last few years. The Budget can be discussed effectively only by an analysis of the policies chosen and an analysis of the conditions in which they were applied. The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) has tended to discuss the Budget in the light of doctrines, particularly the doctrine of free enterprise versus public investment. He claims that the Budget will produce currency stability, on the assumption that there is no answer to the assertion that currency stability is the most important aim of policy. In the light of this assertion, he has claimed in the past that budgets have produced currency stability. The Minister for Labour and National Service has not mentioned this evening a vital passage in the Treasurer's Budget speech. Speaking of business attitudes during the period before this Budget was brought down, the Treasurer said. . amongst the people we lately consulted, more than a few told us that there was still some lack of confidence in the business world and, on closer discussion, it appeared that several elements were contributing to this. One was a doubt whether the recent expansion, after going some distance, might not flag and peter out. apprehensive of another boom like that of 1960 and might suddenly and hastily reverse its policies. A third anxiety, very different from the rest, was that something would be done, or allowed to occur, that would jeopardize stability, start prices and costs rising again and unhinge our balance of payments. The spokesmen for rural industry were particularly strong on this. Confidence is vital . . . and if apprehensions such as these exist it is for the Government to meet and allay them as far as it is able. The Treasurer does not admit that in his judgment this adds up to a lack of confidence. Clearly, these fears are descriptive of the policy changes over the last two years. Why should not the people fear that the Government will say there is a boom and suddenly reverse its policy? That is what it did in 1960, and the people fear a repetition. Those to whom the right honourable gentleman referred expect over the next two years more of the same sort of policy that resulted from the Treasurer's acts of judgment over the last two years. The right honourable gentleman gives the impression of being nonplussed at the reversal of his popularity, beginning in November, 1960. But there is something for the Treasurer to contemplate: If we foster great expectations which events belie, we must count on deep disillusionment. The community is deeply disillusioned about the Treasurer's judgment. First, there was his judgment on hire purchase in the Australian economy. Anybody who recalls the debates which took place on that subject in this Parliament in recent years will remember that, at a time when hire purchase was rising constantly in the Australian community, the Australian Labour Party opposed the way in which that field of finance was being managed and warned about certain of the consequences which that management would have. After years of supporting the hire purchase boom and applauding it as evidence of the prosperity which he had produced, although this great structure of hire purchase was commonly associated with usurious rates of interest, the Treasurer suddenly rounded on it in November, 1960. At that time, the Labour Party warned the community that this hire-purchase activity was affecting all interest rates. The Labour Party was concerned about hire purchase irresponsibility. But the Treasurer said nothing about it until he had conjured up a new name for it. When he did, he spoke, not of the irresponsibility associated with the whole structure of hireeconomy which existed from 1951 to 1959 purchase finance, but of the irresponsibility of fringe financial institutions. He had conjured up a new name which concealed the fact that he was rounding on his own error of judgment about the whole structure of hire purchase. Hire-purchase finance had a disastrous policy and clamp down on imports. It had effect on imports in this country. The to face tbe unpopularity of reversing Minister for Labour and National Service policies which had led to a condition pre° has said a great deal about stability this viously described by it as prosperity and evening. But the Government's policy now described as the unhealthy boom of decisions of November, 1960, were not 1960. Did we hear if described as the made purely on the basis of the internal unhealthy boom of I960 in 1960? No, it position in the Australian economy. They was a period of free enterprise being given were made because Australia could not free play, and we were invited to call it pay its way internationally. The terrifyprosperity. ing situation that had developed was in part a consequence of this whole structure of hire purchase in the Australian economy. constantly rising share prices. There was a Hire purchase has many virtues, but it constant importation of new money by means, among other things, that people borrowing to create constant capital gains purchase at a rate beyond the capacity of in the selling of shares. Having applauded their current purchasing power. If the this tendency for years, a sharp switch was goods which they purchase are imported, or made to denounce it. The lists of share have a high import content, the country itself begins to purchase at a rate beyond prices before the credit squeeze and after the capacity of its purchasing power. This the credit squeeze show striking figures. was what led to the policy decisions of We see as characteristic of falls in November, 1960. Everybody here knows that the Austrathousands of pounds in this reversal of lian Labour Party repeatedly warned, durGovernment policy. The defections of ing the period when hire purchase was intensely popular, that this form of finance could have dire consequences. One of the Government's claims which is not correct is its standard claim that it is a Government which does not hesitate to follow unpopular courses if it believes that those unpopular policies are right. A lavish policy of foreign borrowing and of continual purchasing abroad at a rate beyond our capacity to pay represents a very simple road to cheap, temporary popularity. In the light of the normal political history of this country and of the normal changes of government, the Australian Labour Party would have been in office by 1960 had it not been for the existence of the Australian Democratic Labour Party. The Australian Labour Party would have had to impose controls. Every gentleman sitting on the benches opposite would, in that event, have contrasted the free with the sort of economy which the Australian Labour Party would have brought about by legislative enactment. But the political wheel did not turn normally because of the support given to the Government by Democratic Labour Party voters. The Government had to reverse its own Characteristic of this boom period was prices, a drop from 98s. 6d. to 21s. 6d. Many supporters of the Government lost many Liberal voters that took place in Broadmeadows and other electorates, going impose import controls. I do not believe across the top of the Democratic Labour that there was any reason for failing to Party vote, are a sign of the alienation of re-impose import controls other than sheer the Government's own supporters. The present state of mind of the error in February, 1960. So, he chose to Treasurer is one in which he is surprised cut imports by the credit squeeze. The that, when an atmosphere favorable to difference between the credit squeeze and speculation was destroyed by the credit import controls as a device for cutting squeeze, he could not engender another imports is very simply explained. Import atmosphere Savings are at a very high level, but investdo not tend to creat unemployment. Credit ment and expenditure are not adequate. restrictions tend to create unemployment.

I am not allowed to say that the Government produced 131,500 unemployed. We know that the number existed. Instead of discussing this feature of the economy, the Treasurer speaks of the stability of the currency. The period of the greatest stability of the Australian currency was from 1926 to 1941. In 1926, the basic wage was £4 5s. In 1941, the basic wage was £4 5s. The only variation was a variation downwards during the depression when the basic wage was £3 and some odd shillings. That was a period of wonderful stability of the currency. And what on earth was the good of it? We had unemployment varying between 200,000 and 400,000. If we chose to make 400,000 people unemployed to-morrow, we would have a wonderful stability of the currency. But are we to accept that the whole aim of economic policy and the feature to be applauded is that the currency has been maintained stable? We have never yet in all Australia's economic history had a period in which full employment was associated with a stable currency. The Australian people have had experience of two conditions. They have had experience of very high levels of unemployment and they have had experience of inflation. Of the two, I think they would prefer inflation. The whole art of government is to find some balance in the economy. It is not to claim some wonderful achievement if the purchasing power of the £1 stays steady when it stays steady because large numbers of people have no incomes or very low incomes and cannot compete for the purchase of goods. There is no sense in applauding free enterprise as free enterprise, nor in attacking it as free enterprise. There is no sense, in ideological terms, in applauding F.6363/62 -R -[26 ] or attacking public enterprise. The processes of public and private enterprise are subject to rational analysis. For instance, cars are commonly produced by private enterprise and they are not more important than the roads that they run on. The community needs both. Alcohol and comic books are invariably the products of private enterprise and are not more important than water schemes or school construction. There is no case for encouraging private or public enterprise because of an ideological commitment to either. What needs to be encouraged is what matters to the community. I will be perfectly prepared to say that a private publishing house which is turning out many text books which are helping to create technicians in Australia is doing a piece of printing which is much more important than the Government Printer printing the "" Gazette"". But surely we should analyse anything that is happening in the economy, whether the result of public or private investment, in rational terms and not in ideological terms. There is a very sensible statement in a publication of the Committee for Economic Development in Australia on this subject of the role of private and public investment as follows:If, in inflationary situations, governments find it necessary to reduce expenditure, they must balance the relative merits of personal consumption expenditure, private investment, current expenditure by governments (including defence) and public investment. At first sight, there may appear to be a stronger case for having a reserve or backlog of public works, which can be used to increase employment and stimulate activity in times of depression, but the question then arises as to whether the undertaking of such works serves the ends of national policy better than increased expenditure in other directions. If the answer is negative, the case for the expansion of the public works in question falls down; if the answer is positive, it is necessary to ask why the public works have been deferred in the first place. On balance, therefore, it is doubtful whether public invesimcnt has any stronger claims than other forms of expenditure to be treated as a counter-cyclical weapon. The most that can be said is that a continuing high rate of capital formation in the public sector, if properly co-ordinated with taxation and borrowing policies, will have a stabilizing effect on the economy in general; and that it is sometimes possible to use public investment io stimulate activity in localized depressed areas or industries or to help correct a fundamental disequilibrium in the nation's balance of payments.",79,Budget 1962 63

Capacity use of plant and labour is the characteristic of boom periods in his experience and he cannot really envisage it as being other than part of an unhealthy boom, because he rejects rational decisions on imports or rational decisions on what industries the Government should encourage. Although unemployment has varied from 60,000 to 130,000 since the November, 1960, emergency measures were introduced, the Treasurer's judgment on the period is that we should look at it as a period of currency stability. After years of not worrying about the price level, while the basic wage moved from £6 9s. a week to over £14 a week, we suddenly learn that stability was the aim.

These problems of sale of primary produce that effects can be caused as they were caused by Sir Arthur Fadden during his period as Treasurer. The report of the Reserve Bank of Australia for September, 1960, shows that at 30th June, 1952, the trading banks held £147,000,000 in government securities. In June a year later they held £277,000,000. If the Government draws loan money from the general public, money in circulation, and uses that to finance government projects, including State projects, then the people who have subscribed to the loan have surrendered their purchasing power. They do not compete with the Government for labour and materials and the tendency of the loan is to be anti-inflationary.

It might be a very good thing if we were to examine the possibility of having a level of purchasing power generated by social services which would enable people with families to buy more butter. The Government has wished to avoid making policy choices, especially to avoid applying any economic controls. Hence, the economy drifted to a crisis point in November, 1960, when drastic controls were forced on the Government. Selective import controls would not have led to unemployment. This unemployment nearly overturned the Government. The Government is deluding itself if it imagines that, because selves from very onerous responsibilities. Australia has only 2 per cent, of unemployment, and that percentage is quite low compared with nearly every other country in the world, it is insignificant. New Zealand has i of 1 per cent, unemployment. It has had virtually full employment since 1938, irrespective of whether it was governed by the Labour Party or the nationalists. The honourable member's time has expired. Social Services) [9.0] Mr Chairman, I must compliment the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) on his language, but I regret that I cannot compliment him on his reasoning. When I hear him speaking I long for the return of the traditional trade unionist to the Labour Party-the traditional trade unionist who found an affinity with the working people of our country, who used his energy and talents in the fields, the factories and the workshops and who understood the faults and frailties of society from that point of view. The academic approach leaves me cold in circumstances such as these. That brings me to say that it is obvious, from this exhaustive and exhausting debate, that in all the vast and intricate machinery of a modern democratic government there can be no more formidable task than the preparation and presentation of a budget. I have nothing but compassion for the man who undertakes that responsibility from time to time. During the last twelve years we have had two Treasurers, and both of them have applied themselves to their task with consummate skill. All their natural tendencies were to give concessions, to be magnaniinous with regard to concessions. All their natural inclinations were to increase expenditure from time to time. But every Treasurer-as those of us who understand the working of democracy know-mus t bow to the inevitable. He must face up to the stern realities of the situation which confronts the people of our country from time to time. Perhaps the committee will be good enough to note that I used the term "" modern democratic government "". IfI may say so, that is not without significance. The autocracies and the totalitarian forms of government are free or they free themTo the best of my knowledge and belief, no communistic government has to concern itself with the preparation and presentation of a series of documents called, euphoniously enough, Budget papers, which set out in precise and detailed terms, in advance, the revenue which is to be sought from the people and the expenditure it is designed to meet. No communistic government has to temper policy to promote the economic circumstances which will render both possible of achievement within the space of a single year and, usually, within the space of a single harvest. But these are the primary responsibilities of every democratic government. They cannot be evaded or postponed indefinitely, no matter what other pressing problems may confront the elected representatives of the people. In modern democratic society no budget can be judged on its presentation. A budget is deliberately designed to achieve certain objectives, and the time for judgment, apart from a close and critical examination, is when it has achieved or failed to achieve those objectives. That is the critical point, but it is usually obscured by the premonitions of success or failure which immediately follow its presentation. This Budget has been no exception. I suppose there was a time when a budget could be confined within the strict limits of revenue and expenditure adequate to maintain the essential services of government at a bare minimum level. But all that has been changed by the paradox of modern society, when the popular demand is for a reduction in taxation and, at the",80,Budget 1962 63

129,Mr Roberton (Riverina,"Minister forsame time, for a general extension and expansion of the services of government in all their forms. It is manifestly impossible to reconcile a reduction in revenue with an increase in expenditure without tapping, temporarily perhaps, the credit resources of the community, of the people. But the general public remains unconvinced of that and, unhappily, their dubieties are accentuated by the conflicting political philosophies and ideologies which are present even here in this place. For example, the socialists believe-and the valiant among them can be brought to admit it-in production for use, not for profit, as the complete solution of every social and economic problem. [Quorum formed.] Mr Chairman, the intention of the honourable member who called for a quorum was, of course, to waste my time, but this gives me an opportunity to repeat a few words. I said that the socialists believe-and the valiant among them can be brought to admit it from time to time in production for use, not for profit, as the complete solution of every social, economic and political problem. To that end, they favour punitive forms of taxation and the confiscation of the property of the people, to destroy the profit motive and to yield allegedly illimitable and everlasting revenue, adequate for all purposes of government expenditure. It is to be presumed that after the profit federal expenditure, decade by decade, motive has been ruthlessly destroyed, goduring the first 60 years of federation. vernment expenditure will continue to be a first charge on Consolidated Revenue and our country was 3,773,801, federal exthat Consolidated Revenue will continue to penditure from the Consolidated Revenue be a first charge on the people of our counFund was £11,300,000, or approximately try, whose opportunity to meet it has been £3 for every man, woman and child in the destroyed. But that has never been made country. Ten years later, by 1910, when very clear. In addition, Sir, the socialists the total population was in the vicinity of are in a position to induce and encourage 4,455,000-the census was not taken until the credulous to believe that the credit the following year-expenditur e increased resources of the community can be tapped to £16,200,000 or approximately £3.6 per without restraint, without the inexorable head of the population. The next decade debt charges and the ultimate day of reckonwas nearly four years old when the nation ing when debts of every kind have to be was plunged into the First World War, but paid. All that is inconsistent with the bitter country was a little more than 5,000,000, experience of the people in communistic federal expenditure rose to £49,700,000 or countries where it is popularly supposed approximately £10 per head of our total that there are no inhibiting factors, no population. By 1929-30 when the popularestraints on revenue and no restraints on tion was still less than 6,000,000, expenthe utilization of the credit resources of the diture had increased to £78,600,000 or people to meet unlimited expenditure, but approximately £13 per head. the fact remains that in communistic countries they still cannot feed their people adequately, tbey still cannot clothe their people adequately they still cannot house tbeir people adequately, they still cannot educate their children nor can they develop their country, in spite of the fact that all these resources allegedly are available to them without restriction and without restraint. Political parties opposed to socialism are in a less favourable position. They must face up to the stern realities of simple arithmetic which compel them to acknowledge that expenditure is impossible without revenue and/or adequate arrangements to meet the deficit which must ensue when revenue falls short of what is required for public purposes. It is in that confused atmosphere that a democratic government opposed to socialism is required to prepare a budget, conscious of the popular demand for a reduction in taxation in all its forms, conscious of the popular demand for increased expenditure in all its forms and conscious of the utter hopelessness of attempting a reconciliation without resort to the Reserve Bank to meet from time to time what is considered to be a manageable deficit. This is an Herculean task, and its increasing magnitude can only be measured by a consideration of the growth in our In 1901-2 when the total population of in 1919-20 when the population of our Then followed the decade of depression and desperation ending in the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1939-40-n o census being taken until 1947, when the population was 7,579,358-federa l expenditure rose to £109,000,000, or approximately £15 per head. By 1949-50, with the population only slightly in excess of 8,000,000 people, the expenditure was £566,600,000, or approximately £70.8 per head of the population. This was the final year of office of the previous socialist government. Then followed the first decade of the present composite Government. By 1959-60, when the total population exceeded 10,000,000 people-fa r sooner in the century than any one had ever believed to be possible-federa l expenditure had reached £1,431,000,000, or approximately £143 per head of our total population. This was more than double the expenditure rate in the final year of office of the socialist government. With our total population standing at well over 10,600,000, estimates of expenditure in the 1962-63 Budget total £1,725,815,000 on items ordinarily charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. There is additional expenditure which will exceed over £2,080,000 this year, but that figure of £1,725,815,000 represents an increase of £82,787,000 on expenditure for the previous year and amounts to approximately £163 per head of our total population. That is, every man, woman and child can be accredited with a part in this expenditure of not less than £163, measured against £3 at the beginning of the century. Expenditure of the kind is impossible under socialism. The sources of government finance dry up immediately a socialist government is elected to office. That is our contemporary history, yours and mine, Mr Chairman, and it is the contemporary history of every country in the world to-day. If the Budget is to be judged by the revenue which has to be found by the people of our country, then this is a record budget, because it is, for all practical purcontrol over prices, and prices fali, poses, a record peace-time revenue. If the Budget is to be judged by the expenditure, which is three times the expenditure that astonished the community only twelve years ago, then this is our greatest budget. If a surplus has lost its traditional virtue and a budget must be judged on the dimensions of the deficit, then this Budget must be described in superlative terms, because it provides for a deficit of £118,000,000. But, except superficially, no budget can be judged on its presentation. It can be judged only on its purposes. The purposes of this Budget provide the only areas for controversy and disputation. This Budget is designed to continue, and even to accelerate, the most dynamic period of developmental history we have ever known, when the standard of living is higher than it has ever been, when the greatest work force we have ever had has been gainfully employed on terms and conditions more remunerative and more congenial than they have ever been before at any time in our history, when opportunities for advancement are available to the ambitious, and the staggering total of when we have moved into the proud position of one of the top ten or twelve trading nations on the face of the earth. It is designed to avoid a repetition of the disaster that threatened all the export industries of our country when, caught in the toils of an arbitration system that was encouraged to ignore falling export prices, their rising costs of production reduced prices below the point of profitability. Australia's export industries pour out from the fields, factories and workshops goods to meet the demands of the markets of the world, and when export parity prices fall, as they do from time to time, our industries multiply the physical volume of their production to meet that grievous situation. Last financial year, as we were told by they earned no less than £1,080,000,000. Eighty per cent, of our export income, as honourable members know, comes from the primary industries, from our arable and grazing land. The people who bring those lands to production represent a meagre 11 per cent, of the total work force of Australia. Eleven per cent, of the work force lifted the volume of rural production to record levels, of a gross value in 1960-61 of £1,375,000,000, and because we have no increased the volume of production to earn £1,365,000,000 in the following year. Eleven per cent, of the work force is belting out the produce of the land and is earning for Australia sums of that magnitude. The total work force is estimated at 4,300,000. The number of people",82,Budget 1962 63
130,"The Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Mcewen),","engaged in primary industry is estimated at only 500,000 and that proportion of the work force has built up the resources of our overseas balances and has made them, as far as possible, adequate for all our import purposes. The Budget is shaped to maintain our balance of trade at a favorable level, adequate for the purpose of providing all our manufacturing industries with raw materials and the capital equipment necessary for effective operation, without involving the nation in the debt penalties which are inseparable from an unfavorable trade balance. Tbe Budget is planned to restore conditions of full employment to a work force anxious and willing for gainful employment and to create employment opportunities for the young who, in increasing numbers, will be leaving school in each successive year. SoI could continue, but my time is running out. I Want to say that every informed member of the Parliament knows that though rates will remain constant, payments from the National Welfare Fundfrom whence come all our health and social service pensions, allowances, endowments, benefits and ancillary services-wil l move up this year to £387,574,000. This is an increase of £22,382,744 in the current financial year. However, the public will be encouraged to believe the contrary, that there has been no change in social service expenditure. War and repatriation expenditure this year, though the rates remain constant, is estimated at £110,701,000-a n increase of £6,363,000 over last year's figures. Those two vast sums total £498,275,000, which will be made available by 10,600,000 people who will pay income tax this financial year. This huge sum is equivalent to 91 per cent, of the income from taxation to be levied an,J collected this cliche-struck nonsense from the Minister financial year. To that total must be added the aggregate amount diverted to social welfare in six States of the Commonwealth and the two Territories. Thus the magnitude of the welfare commitment of the people of our country can be fully appreciated and recognized. It is a commitment which can be made only when the work force is fully employed and when all our industries-primary , secondary and tertiary -ar e geared to maximum and profitable production. The Budget is designed to achieve that end, and the task is not beyond a resolute people. The task is not beyond a community that up to this period in our history has stood up manfully to all its social, political and economic obligations and responsibilities. The alternative to this kind of budget is the socialist philosophy which destroys the profit motive and marches men and women out to the fields, factories and workshops to work for the State. This philosophy means that the State will be beggared to the degree that all the satellites of the Soviet Union have been beggared. Those countries cannot find adequate resources for the normal functions of government and cannot feed, clothe and house their people or develop their resources. That is the difference between the two philosophies. That is the fundamental cleavage between the two ideologies. So long as we remain free men, a free people, it is our manifest duty to stand up to our democratic responsibilities. If and when we surrender our freedom and surrender ourselves to the socialists, we shall become mendicants of the socialist state; and God help us all! listening to the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) for 30 minutes, one is inclined to think that Guy Fawkes had something. Fancy a member of the Country Party speaking in this place about democracy, social spirit and compassiona party pledged to plural voting, flogging and hanginga party of gerrymandered electorates and mismanagement of electoral procedures, and a party which does not know what democracy means. The Victorian Country Party and Liberal Party, if anything, are the worse of the lot. We listen to this kind of platitudinous and for Social Services for half an hour every time he rises in this chamber. It is a great pity that he does not turn some of his skill with words to thoughts for people instead.

131,Mr Bryant (Wills) [9.27],Afte r,85,Budget 1962 63
132,( Mr Mcmahon) Made Great Play About,"have confidence. His view is that if anything is wrong with the country', it is everybody else's fault. I wonder what he means by confidence. I wonder whom he will start with in attempting to gain some confidence. To-day, a rather historic occurrence took place in the Parliament of South Australia. A motion was moved in that Parliament by the Leader of the Opposition Government for its policies and calling upon senators from South Australia to vote against this Government. That motion was carried unanimously in the South Australian Parliament by members of the Liberal-Country League and the Labour Party as well as independents. We do not need to seek any further than the party of the Minister himself to find plenty of critics who believe that this Government is ruining the country and should hand over to somebody more competent. In this debate we have found that honourable members on the Government side are an unhappy, lot. The honourable members for Wentworth ( Mr Bury), Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) and Barker( Mr Forbes) were full of criticism of certain aspects of the Government's policy. The honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) was deeply critical and concerned about the Government's foreign policy and defence policy. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr thirteen years of almost unchallenged pow:r Stokes), who is here by the grace of a few Democratic Labour Party voters, was also critical of defence policy. The Australian Country Party is completely unhappy about the redistribution of electoral boundaries and other matters. On the question of confidence, if we on this side have no confidence in the Government, at least we are in good company. We had the support at the last general election of the majority of the people. IfI want to turn to anything to find a look at a chart that was published in ti.i words to indict this Government, I have Melbourne "" Sun News-Pictorial"" only a only to look at its own publications. These week or two back, dealing with private condemn the Government out of its own streets in Melbourne. They are an archaic mouth. The White Paper on National and medieval survival, maintained by the Income and Expenditure for 1961-62, Country Party in Victoria. There are 1,200 tabled by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) or 1,400 miles of streets in the outer suburbs only a week or two back, contains a number of Melbourne which are unfit for traffic of points which condemn the Government and cause heartbreak and misery. The Treaand show that it is ruining the country, with surer steps into this chamber and makes its constantly expanding population and growing human needs. The document contains such comments as thisOn the other hand, it is estimated that company income decreased by £25,000,000, farm income by £13,000,000 and indirect taxes less subsidies by £26,000,000. At page 4, we find this statementcondemning the Federal In 1961-62 estimated expenditure on personal consumption increased by £80,000,000 or by about 2 per cent., compared with an increase of 5 per cent, in 1960-61. Is there anybody in this Parliament who is prepared to say that the needs of the community are less this year than they were last year or the year before? We find also from this document that expenditure on durable goods, including furniture, floor coverings, domestic hardware, &c, increased from £200,000,000 in 1959-60 to £204,000,000 in 1960-61, but then fell to £201,000,000 in 1961-62. One can find throughout such documents ample evidence that the Government has created a position in which the machinery of the country is unable to keep pace with the growth in population. On these grounds alone, there is good reason to have no confidence in the Government and to condemn it. With every other citizen in the community, I want to look at the general picture and see what it is like. What is the general picture of Australia to-day? After in this Parliament, with complete control over the banking system andfinances,the Government has nobody to blame but itself f«-r the present situation. For thirteen years it has been in absolute control. If we examine the position in Australia to-day, we find it is desperate in manyfieldsand heart breaking in most of them. We have ample evidence of private wealth and public poverty. I suggest that honourable members take great play about a few beef roads in north Queensland. He should drive round his own area. Some time this week, I think, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) will open a magnificent new hotel in Melbourne. It would be as well if the right honourable gentleman looked at the streets and the public environment that the policies of this Government are preserving and exaggerating. In Australia there is increasing control of neglect of the educational resources of the Australian industry from overseas. The collapse of Commonwealth and State financial relationships has meant that the State governments get less. The more expensive forms of public enterprise have been left with no revenue and receive no consideration from this place. We find that, because of the Government's usurious attitude, interest rates have reached the stage where they are strangling public enterprise in the form of local government activities, railways and State works and are making homeownership almost impossible for a great proportion of the population. Nobody can justify the financial attitude this Government is perpetuating in the Budget documents. There is a doctrinaire approach to the problems of the nation. There is constant speechifying by such persons as the Minister for Social Services and the Treasurer, who speak continuously of stability, boom, expansion and growth. They quote statistics frequently, but what they do not do is to speak of our 11,000,000 citizens as people. This, of course, is the point of departure between the philosophies of the Australian Labour Party and our political opponents. We are concerned with public policies directed to the benefit of the people as individuals. We are not concerned with the cliches and ideologies that the Minister for Social Services was breathing here only a few moments ago. I express the heartfelt disappointment of honourable members on the Opposition side and, I presume, on the Government side also, at the failure of the Minister in charge of the welfare State to devote one sentence, so far as I can recall, to a consideration of tbe general problems of social services and of the people who live in misery and hardship on the miserable pensions squeezed from this Government. The general direction of social service policy is such that it is creating and continuing hardship in the community. There was no sign from the Minister that he understood these human problems. One of the things that disturbs us is the extraordinary waste of human talent that has been produced by this Government's policy. This comes in two forms. The first is unemployment, and the second is the nation. Previously in this debate, a number of speakers have amplified the needs of Australian education, but we cannot reiterate too often or make it too clear to the people that we on this side believe that with education, you hold up a torch for the future. Turning to unemployment, it is evident that the disastrous policies of this Government are inhuman. The tragedy of unemployment seems to be completely lost upon honourable members opposite. I must admit that I was shocked by the interjection of the honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp) who, referring to the remarks of my colleague, the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), said "" You are using mass unemployment as an emotional term "". I only hope that every honourable member gets emotional at the thought of unemployment. If you turn to the figures or go to the employment offices, you find that an increasing number of people are drawing unemployment benefits for longer and longer periods of time. For every one of those people this is, first, a blow at personal morale and, secondly, a hardship on their families. Thirdly, and possibly more important for the future, it is a tremendous waste of public talent and human resources. After all, the most important national endowments that we have are the skills in the hearts, hands and brains of the people of Australia. These are our principal resources. We can import the raw materials to build, we can import rubber and petrol, but we cannot import skills of that kind. So every person out of work is a national tragedy. I would think that 100,000 persons-the number now out of work-woul d be almost equivalent to the work force of an area such as Newcastle. If we removed Newcastle from the Australian scene, that would be regarded as a national calamity; yet under the policies of this Government there has been removed from the work scene of Australia a work force equal to that. When this Government took over the administration of Australia on 10th December, 1949, there were some 700 people drawing the unemployment benefit. I believe that, at the present moment, about 45,000 people are receiving unemployment benefit and, of course, more than 90,000 are registered as unemployed. In addition, there are those who have declined to register, and those whose registrations have not yet been disclosed because of the failure of the statistics to keep up with the system. So, I have no doubt that there are well over 100,000 people out of work. The figures have risen steadily since 1949; they are on record, and cannot be denied. If one could turn back the clock one would find that when this Government took over the treasury bench in 1949, in all Australia there were fewer than 1,000 people on the unemployment benefit. Nothing that the Government has done since then has been as disastrous as its departure from the policy of full employment. We, on this side of the chamber, regard that departure as a national tragedy and a national waste as well as a personal tragedy for those involved. We will not tolerate this any more than will the people of Australia. How can there possibly be talk of confidence when this is happening to human beings? The thing that disturbs me about the philosophizing of Government supporters such as the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes), who may be regarded as the Government's chief ideologist, is their failure to consider the human element in public policy. Therefore, Mr Chairman, we on this side of the chamber believe that there is ample reason for supporting the censure motion that is before the committee. As I pointed out earlier, this Government has been in complete command for nearly thirteen years, and in that time what has it achieved? Australia is one of the richest nations of the world. Statistics show us that in resources and capital per head of population we rank in either fourth or fifth place in the world. So, it is fair enough to measure us against the rest of the world and I think it is fair enough to say that we are one of the worse governed, worse developed and worse organized counment is most mischievous and most tries in our class. If honourable members reactionary. Taxation is the measure of turn to the records they will find that even the United States of America-the spiritual home of the honourable the Minister for broader social security system than we have in Australia. Canada has better hospital insurance. Great Britain has an allembracing medical benefits scheme that leaves ours in the shade. Australia devotes a lower percentage of its national income to education than do about 20 or 23 nations of Western Europe, America and Asia, and these include even Japan. This cannot be tolerated. Australia's expenditure on education is approximately 2 per cent, of the national income, but in other countries it is as high as 7 per cent. This Government has taken no steps to control monopolies, although in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada efforts have been made to do this. One of the most disturbing features of the Budget this year is the apparent readiness of the Government to accept unemployment as a continuing feature. Its estimate of expenditure on unemployment relief is something like £13,000,000. It has been calculated that this allows for an unemployment pool of about 80,000 people. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said in his speech on the Budget, "" But you must have estimates"". He did not think so two or three years ago. If you turn back the records you will find that the estimate for unemployment benefit was about £8,000,000, bnt that the Government subsequently spent £13,000,000. From a plain reading of the record it is obvious that this Government expects a continuing level of unemployment of somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000, yet New Zealand, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) pointed out earlier, has managed since 1938 to retain full employment despite changes of government, despite war, despite the threat of the Common Market and everything else. In this country no steps have been taken to control capital gains whereas the United States which, as I pointed out earlier, is surely the home of the capitalist spirit of honourable members opposite, has done something about this as have most European countries. It is in taxation policies that this Govern-",85,Budget 1962 63
133,Social Services ( Mr Roberton),"ha s apublic, community, or co-operative effort. It is from the taxation paid into public revenue that nations develop their co-operative enterprises whether they be roads, hospitals, schools, social welfare services, health services or such undertakings as civil aviation. I think it is fair to say that if you examine the taxation rates of other nations and compare them with those of Australia, you can only come to the conclusion that the Government is not as concerned with public policies and the development of social welfare and all the things that go with it as are the administrations of equivalent countries. The Australian Labour Party is not a low taxation party. It believes in equitable taxation. IfI knew that an increase in income tax rates would result in the provision of a better school for my children to attend and better social services for the aged people in my electorate, I would be happy to pay an additional £60, £70, £80, £90 or £100 a year. I point out that in West Germany 34 per cent, of the gross national product is taken in taxation whereas in Australia the figure is only 22 per cent. In Austria it is 33 per cent.; Finland, Norway and France, 32 per cent.; Sweden, 31 per cent.; Luxembourg, 30 per cent.; Great Britain, 29 per cent.; the NetherHonorable members on this side of the lands and Italy, 28 per cent.; the United States, 26 per cent. Surely to honourable members opposite who are so constantly quoting the spirit of the United States, who like to hitch their wagon to the foreign policy star of the United States, that is ample demonstration of a failure by the Government of this country to take up the challenge of developing the public sector of community life. In Denmark 24 per cent, of the gross national product is taken in taxation, and in Canada, Ireland and Belgium the figure is 23 per cent. It is only in the notoriously conservative countries like Japan, Greece, Portugal and Spain that a lower proportion of the gross national product is taken in taxation. The same thing applies in the rates of taxation. One of the more distasteful features of this Government's taxation policies is the way in which they protect and preserve the very wealthy. As has been pointed out, the flat rate rebate of income tax has given much to the wealthy and nothing to the people who really need it. Under this system whereas the wealthy man gets 143 times 13s. 6d. as a rebate for his wife, the man on the basic wage gets perhaps only 143 times 2s. The person who pays a lot in rates and is earning perhaps £3,000 a year gets a bigger rebate on his rates than does the person on £1,000 a year. This, in general terms, is the Government's taxation policy. The wealthy man in Australia retains 33 per cent, of his income, but in the United Kingdom it is only 11 per cent, and in the United States only 9 per cent. Our taxation policies favour the wealthy and take from the people in the lower income groups. In relation to direct taxation we are again in a miserable position when compared with the rest of the world. The Labour Party believes in direct taxation so that the people who have the ability to pay because of their capital or their income will do most of the paying, but in Australia we collect only 47 per cent, of our taxation revenue in direct taxes. In New Zealand the figure is 73 per cent.; in Norway and Sweden it is 67 per cent.; in the United States it is 65 per cent.; in Austria it is 59 per cent.; and so it goes on down the scale. These are points which I think every Australian should consider. chamber have very strong feelings about these things. I turn now to the pattern of thinking of Government supporters. They talk of growth. What exactly do they mean by growth? Surely these are the things by which you measure growth-housing , immigration, public investment, and perhaps a higher standard of living. What tests would you apply? Let us take housing. Here we find that although our population has been rising at the rate of about 250,000 a year, the number of houses commenced has been declining. The following figures are for the twelve month periods ending in March of each of the years stated:-1955 , 60,445; 1957, 52,656; 1958,51,490; 1959,48,380; 1960,45,155; 1961, 39,801; and 1962, 37,519. The figure to June, 1962, was 36,676. There can be no fairer test of the development or growth of a nation than to see how the average family is doing. The average family is obviously not moving into a new home, or .is not commencing to build a new home. There are a number of reasons for this. One is the high unemployment level and another is the difficulty of obtaining housing finance. The Government used a deliberate policy instrument when it introduced its economic measures in 1960. The speech made by the Treasurer on, I think, 15th November, 1960, is in the record for all to see. That speech shows that he made a sharp stroke at both the housing industry and the vehiclebuilding industry, and in doing so he struck at the standard of living of the people who want housing and at the employment capacity of the nation. So in its doctrinaire approach to the question of growth and stability this Government has surrendered all consideration of human needs and has struck bitter blows at hundreds of thousands of people. I would remind honourable members opposite, most of whom do not represent electorates such as those that we on this side of the chamber represent, that they should consider the number of people aged 65 years and over who were forced into retirement by the Government's policies. When they lost their jobs and reported to the various employment offices they received no consideration at all but were simply told to go on the pension. There is, of course, a greater degree of unemployment than the official figures have shown. One significant set of figures is that showing the rate of marriages. Tbis has fluctuated in the following way:Marriages per 1 Year. population. 1957 7.65 1958 . . 1959 . . I960.. 1961 Surely the rate of bouse construction and the marriage rate are measures of growth. Obsessed with this mystique of stability, the Government has struck so many bittei blows at the Australian economy that it will take us many years to recover. There are many matters to which we would like to invite attention at this time. re-orientate its policy on growth. We There are many things that we ought to do. should take a look at our citizens and see We ought to re-cast the taxation and what they need for a higher standard of financial policies of the nation. We ought living. We should see that our gradually to throw overboard the usurious approach increasing national wealth is given to the to interest rates and the use of interest rates to control housing development and public expenditure. We should enter the overseas shipping business. The fact that we have not already done so staggers me, and I hope that we will have adequate opportunity to debate the matter before very long. I say definitely that the answers to questions asked in this House of the Minister for lian in context, by inference and by implication, as have been statements made by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon). What is wrong with these people who profess to be Australians? This country runs one of the world's best airlines. It is generally agreed that Qantas Empire Airways Limited can hold its own with any other airline operator in the world. Do these critics of Australian enterprise think we cannot find people to run a shipping line that would hold its own amongst other shipping lines in the world? We of the Labour Party believe that public enterprise is a measure of selfconfidence and self-respect. As far as I am concerned, the Commonwealth Bank, Trans-Australia Airlines and the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority are instruments of public policy, created by, and, in a way the creatures of, this Parliament. The success of those enterprises is a measure of the confidence this Parliament has in its ability to handle the affairs of the nation. The socialist concept of public ownership is a doctrine of selfrespect, and we have no hesitation in proclaiming our complete confidence in our thousand of ability to manage public enterprises. Honourable members opposite who are con.. .. .. 7.52 tinually decrying the ability of Australians .. .. .. 7.40 to do such things as run an overseas ship.. .. .. 7.34 ping line are un-Australian, and they should 7.31 leave this place and go elsewhere. The average Australian should have this question put before him fairly and squarely and concisely. If this were done I am sure that he would reject the Government's attitude out of hand. I also suggest that the Government should",88,Budget 1962 63
134,Trade ( Mr Mcewen) Have Been Un,"Austragreat majority of our citizens and not disbursed through capital gains to shareholders, land speculators and others. We should provide for a dramatic reduction in interest rates, so that potential home-owners, hardships and difficulties that flow from its private businessmen and State and local government enterprises will not be hamstrung as they have been during the last century. I would make one more comment before concluding. for Bruce says, "" Hear, hear! "" I would just remark, in his present condition, that if he landed in the Northern Territory the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) would probably declare him a ward. the Northern Territory. turn our attention for a moment to New Guinea. The Minister for Trade has been orbiting the world for some time pleading for somebody to come and buy his goods. I suggest that honourable members turn their attention to New Guinea, where there are 2,000,000 potential customers. For every five Australians there is one person in New Guinea who, if his standard of living were raised, would be able to absorb some of our available exports. The market in New Guinea could be built up to the stage at which it might take as much as 20 per cent, of our surplus production. The simplest and most direct way of overcoming some of our problems of markets would be to raise the living standards of the people of New Guinea, by some progressive and visionary policies in finance and development. Mr Temporary Chairman, the Budget debate usually gives us an opportunity to speak on many topics. However, we in Australia are living at a time of crisis. Our trading policies have brought us to the point of stagnation in many industries. The Minister for Trade is so obsessed with his desire to look after the people he represents that he has done irreparable damage to the people we represent. We believe that an overall plan should be devised to rehabilitate our economy. The failure of the Government to act to control overseas investments in Australia will turn us into a virtual financial colony of foreign investors. If the Government continues in this way, the policies will take us many years to overcome. wish to take up much of my valuable time in answering the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant). However, I must make a few remarks about his opening comments, in which he criticized the Country Party members of this Parliament for complaining about the forthcoming electoral redistribution. The honourable member for Wills should be the last one to criticize members who desire to retain their voice in this chamber. If my memory serves me correctly, there was an article in the Victorian daily newspapers recently to the effect that a couple of Opposition members of this Parliament were very disappointed that in a particular district a certain number of voters were being shifted from one electorate to the other. I seem to recall that the honourable member for Wills was one of those members. I have taken out somefiguresgiving the sizes of various electorates. I note that the electorate of Wills covers an area of 7.62 square miles. That is not the smallest electorate in Victoria, but I ask honourable members to compare it with the electorate of Wimmera, which covers 10,506.83 square miles. It is just on 10,500 square miles larger than the electorate of Wills. I suggest that all country representatives should carefully consider the redistribution that has been recommended. It will be noted that I speak of country representatives and not Country Party representatives. If Australia is ever going to become a great nation, we must ensure that the rural areas continue to have an adequate voice in this Parliament. We have a very good chance of becoming a strong nation if, first, we keep the present Opposition exactly where it is-that is, in opposition-and , secondly, we retain adequate representation in the Parliament for rural areas. When I speak of representatives of the rural areas, I do not mean to suggest that they must necessarily be members of the Australian Country Party.",90,Budget 1962 63

139,Mr King (Wimmera) [9.57],"I do notOn the whole, Mr Temporary Chairman, Victorian members are not affected greatly by the redistribution proposals made by the Distribution Commissioners. This is chiefly because Victoria is to gain a seat, whereas some of the other States will lose a seat. Nevertheless, the principle of adequate country representation applies equally in Victoria. Although the number of seats in that State is to be increased, the as that of metropolitan seats, country additional seat will not be a country one. It will be a metropolitan one. Furthermore, the country electorates, with the exception of, 1 think, three, have been enlarged both numerically and geographically. This reminds me of that famous old saying: ""The rich get richer and the poor have kids"". This saying may be related to electorates as well as to people. As I said earlier, I believe that if we are Bob, I believe that honourable members to make this country strong, we must have strong representation of the rural areas. When I speak of strong representation, I am thinking, not of the quality of the representation given by individual members, but of the overall number of representatives of country areas. It has been said from time to time that "" One vote, one value"" is the policy of the Australian Labour Party. That may be so, and such a policy is fair enough in terms of a small organization or of representation by delegates at a State conference, for example. That principle is sound enough when those whom one represents number only half a dozen, a dozen, twenty or 30. The principle doss not apply, however, when one represents 40,000 or 50,000 people. I believe that all Australians are entitled the Parliament. Therefore, one of their to proper representation in the Parliament, Mr Temporary Chairman. They can have proper representation here only if they are able to get in touch with their respective members readily, regardless of political colour. My electorate is a moderately small one by comparison with those of my friends, the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Brimblecombe), the honourable member for Mallee( Mr porary Chairman, I suggest that we should Turnbull) and the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Ian Allan). Quite a number of Australian Country Party members represent electorates with areas larger than that of my constituency. However, I find that it takes me anything up to two months to visit all the centres in my electorate and cover it thoroughly. I believe, as I said a few moments ago, that all electors are entitled to be able to see their representative readily, regardless of his political colour. If country electorates are to be gradually enlarged numerically in order to raise the quota of electors to the same level people, naturally, will not receive proper representation, because tbe number of members representing country areas will be reduced. In this Budget debate, there has been a lot of discussion about unemployment. I believe that the Minister for Labour and most of the challenges by the Australian Labour Party on this subject. So help me opposite truly are shedding crocodile tears! Labour members repeatedly complain about unemployment. In my opinion, they are doing untold damage to their own colleagues, because they are creating in industry and in the man in the street, a lack of confidence. Let us not blame the Government for this. The opposition is to blame, for the statements of members of the Australian Labour Party are helping to cause chaos and lack of confidence in industry. We must bear in mind, Mr Chairman, that honourable members opposite require, if they are ever to regain office, disturbances and difficulties such as those caused by increasing unemployment. Opposition members know very well that the higher the level of unemployment goes the better is their chance of transferring to this side of aims is to promote unemployment. The suggestion that the present Government composed of members of the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Country Party believes in a high level of unemployment, and considers that high unemployment will keep it in office, is just ridiculous. The real situation is just the reverse. reflect on what a budget really is. Those Opposition members who criticize the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), and deny the points made by him and other honourable members on this side of the chamber,",91,Budget 1962 63
140,National Service ( Mr Mcmahon) Answered,,92,Budget 1962 63
141,"Getting Back To The Budget, Mr Tem","should ask their respective wives what a budget is. Those Opposition members seem to work on the principle that the Government has not budgeted for a sufficiently large deficit. Apparently, they suggest that it does not matter how big the deficit is so long as more money is spent. Opposition members say, also, that there is nothing of value in his Budget. What is a budget, Mr Temporary Chairman? The smallest child at school will appreciate that the word "" budget"" implies the assessment of the funds available and the determination of the manner in which they shall be distributed. The Treasurer, before he throws his money about, decides, rightly, how it is to be expended. He allocates the funds, not as the Opposition would like, but in the manner in which they can be most usefully expended. When we are determining how we shall expend our funds, we could perhaps look first at measures designed directly to help industry and the people, secondly, at measures designed to promote investment, and, thirdly, at measures designed to develop this country and build a very strong nation. I believe that this Budget makes porary Chairman. We propose to increase expenditure on welfare, on capital works and on the development of the north. When I speak of development of the north, I do not mean development only of Queensland, on which honourable members opposite, from whom we hear so often on this subject, seem to concentrate. They all seem to think only of the development of Queensland and not of the north generally. We on this side of the chamber are not concerned only about Queensland. We are concerned about the northern part of Australia as a who's. I think it is as well at this stage to have "" Since the cost of living has gone down so a look at some of the items included in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Last year, £85,201,166 of revenue was derived from customs, £265,607,203 £148,817,831 from sales tax, £537,345,194 from income tax paid by individuals, £282,688,192 from income tax paid by companies, £60,971,561 from pay-roll tax, and £19,825,992 from estate duty and death duty. These were the main items of tax revenue. To the sum of this revenue we must add the earnings of the business undertakings such as the Post Office and the Commonwealth Railways. I turn now to the expenditure items. Expenditure on defence totalled £203,077,706 last financial year. The estimate for the current financial year is £210,000,000. The only criticism that 1 would make here, if I made any, is that the amount could be larger, because of the importance of the proper defence of this country. We must be sure that we have effective defence forces. Expenditure from the National Welfare Fund last financial year totalled £365,191,256, and the estimate for the current financial year is £387,574,000. The figures for repatriation are £104,338,394 and £110,701,000 respectively. Departmental expenditure, including expenditure on bounties and subsidies, totalled £139,403,665 last financial year and is expected to be £148,041,000 in the current financial year. Expenditure on capital works and services was £161,592,399 last financial year and the estimate for the present financial year is £180,977,000. Payments to or for the States totalled £396,561,575 last financial year and are expected to reach £422,575,000 this financial year. Broadly speaking, those are the increased expenditures that are proposed this financial year. The Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) earlier this evening discussed the National Welfare Fund. I should now like briefly to deal with one or two points concerning this subject. I think it was the Minister for Supply( Mr Fairhall) who, earlier in this debate, discussed the cost of living and showed how it had fallen in the last four quarters. Since the cost of living has fallen, I suppose, if one took a technical point, one could say that the Government would have been quite justified in saying, much, the expenditure on welfare should go down in proportion "". But the Government has not reduced expenditure on welfare. It from excise, has retained the present level of age, invalid and repatriation pensions and of other social service benefits. The Treasurer mentioned the fact that 47.7 per cent, of tax revenue went into the National Welfare Fund in 1949, whereas to-day the proportion has increased to 72 per cent. The honourable member for",92,Budget 1962 63
142,"Provision For All Those Things, . Mr Tem","Wills, a few minutes ago, criticized this Government's expenditure on education and compared it with expenditure on education in various other countries. If we were to spend as high a proportion of the total tax revenue on education as is spent in some of the countries that the honourable member mentioned, we would spend all our revenue on welfare and education. The honourable member for Stirling( Mr ing with this subject. Southern developWebb) criticized the various rates of pension. But he did not say that the A class widows' pension during the reign of the last Labour Government was £2 7s. 6d. and to-day is £5 12s. 6d. He did not say that the age pension increased from £2 2s. 6d. to £5 5s. Opposition members refer only to the points that suit them. I believe that the best security any pensioner can have is a safe Australia, both economically and politically. Whilst this Government remains in office, Australia will certainly be sound politically. Our safety can be assured only by having a strong defence force. We all realize that our population must increase and that we must develop both northern and southern Australia. Australia is chiefly a primary producing country. We should remind ourselves that Australia is the only free white country that has room for development. This is most important. The coloured races far outnumber the white races, and Australia is the only country in which the white races have room for expansion. We on this side of the chamber believe that there are only two ways in which Australia can be developed to the standard we would like it to reach. The honourable member for Mallee has reminded me that the first requirement of decentralization is to decentralize political representation and the second is to have a general land development scheme both in the north and the south. There is no need for me to remind honourable members of what the Government has done to develop Australia. The Government has taken a broad view of this matter. I mention briefly that money has been set aside for beef roads, that money has been allotted to the Snowy Mountains scheme in New South Wales, and that money has been set aside for the clearing of brigalow land. We cannot overlook these matters. They are very important projects. Whilst we are speaking about northern development, we must not forget about southern development. I could speak for quite some time on the urgent need to develop some of the areas of Victoria, including portions of my own electorate. j challenges me to do so. I have many other matters that 1 wish to discuss, without dealment is a subject that could be dealt with by itself. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) knows all about the success of the Australian Mutual Provident Society's scheme in his area. The type of country developed in this scheme stretches into my electorate in Victoria, and a similar development scheme has been undertaken there. Time is running away from me, and I want to refer to an article in the Melbourne ""Age"" on Monday, 20th August. The article is headed ""Six-point Scheme for Market Threat. Mr Whitlam Calls for Action Now."" I should like to read portion of this article, because it is very important. It saysThe Deputy Leader of the Federal Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) tonight outlined a six-point plan for meeting the harmful effects on the Australian economy should Great Britain enter the Common Market. The plan is then outlined. I have not the time to deal with all six points. will wait for a moment he will learn whether I can deal with them. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's first point was that we should have inquiries into the most vulnerable industries. His second point was that we must give assurances that the burden of any damage sustained by the vulnerable industries will be borne by the whole nation. His third point was that we should get on with the job of making international agreements for primary products. I have not the time to deal with the remaining points, but they can be answered. My friends of the Opposition want to know whether I agree with them. Tbe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Hon. W. C. Haworth) -Order!

The honourable member for Calare( Mr England), wants to know who voted against it. The agreement was signed because he does not know how to mention in July, 1957. I think it was on 29th it.

I assume that the Minister, who was referring to this matter in the Victorian Parliament was comparing the rates in the various States. Surely, Commonwealth probate duties must be the lowest in the Commonwealth. Notwithstanding that fact, I believe the time has come for the Commonwealth to revise its rates of estate duty, particularly in respect of investments in export industries, having regard to the importance of expanding those industries. This is an instance in which the Government could encourage investment in important industries generally. Consequently, I was very disappointed that the Treasurer made no reference to this matter in his Budget speech. I urge the Government to give due consideration to this matter. The next subject about which I wish to speak concerns bounties and subsidies which have been reduced from £29,000,000 to £26,000,000. My Opposition friends will say that this is bad. In one sense it is. However, the reason why this provision has been reduced is that the Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund will not require as much money in this financial year as it did in the previous year. Last year the amount required was £12,000,000, whereas this year it is expected that £7,500,000 will be suffiopposite would call them, but also to people cient. That would more than account for the difference in the provision for bounties and subsidies in the two years. In view of that fact the Government should have given consideration to the provision of a superphosphate subsidy. If the £3,000,000, approximately, by which the allocation for bounties and subsidies has been reduced were used as a superphosphate subsidy it would be very helpful not only to the wheat growers but also to all those primary producers who depend on the use of superphosphate. A bounty paid on superphosphate used by wheat-growers would not be a total loss to the Treasury. Under the wheat stabilization plan, the cost of production is the basis on which the price of wheat is fixed for sale, first, on the home consumption market and, secondly, on the export market in respect of the 100,000,000 bushels for which the price is guaranteed, A bounty on superphosphate would reduce the cost of wheat production. This would reduce the cost of maintaining the stabilization fund and also the cost of the 100,000,000 bushels for export. Also, it would tend to reduce the cost of wheat to the Australian consumer and thus reduce the local price of bread, which is the staff of life. These would be the consequences of introducing a superphosphate subsidy. 1 am glad to see the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) in the chamber, because he has been rather sarcastic as far as the wheat industry is concerned. If he is afraid that my proposal would put too much money in the wheat-growers' pockets, I remind him that occasionally the wheat-grower has a good season and becomes a very valuable contributor to the Treasury in income tax. The more he earns, the more tax he will pay. So, I suggest that the Government should give consideration to providing a superphosphate subsidy, preferably during the present sittings of the Parliament but at least later this year. Very seldom do I speak in a budget debate or on the Address-in-Reply without referring to the Postmaster-General's Department. I do so because I believe that the department is most valuable as far as rural people are concerned. I refer not only to the "" cockies"", as some of my friends in country towns because country dwellers do not enjoy the same facilities in telephonic and general communications as are available to city people. Country people are entitled to such services on a reasonable scale. They do not want luxury services, but many country dwellers are not getting a reasonable telephone service. Several centres in my electorate have no telephone service at all, yet they had one 60 years ago. This is not the fault of departmental officers nor of the Postmaster-General( Mr Davidson) or of the Government. It is due to circumstances. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

151,Mr Cope (Watson) [10.27],"Mr Temdid the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr King)? It was the Country Party and the Liberal Party which defeated the prices referendum put forward by the Chifley Government in 1948 in order to stabilize prices for all time. In 1948, the basic wage was £5 9s. a week. We were told by the then Leader of the Opposition, Menzies), that the States could control prices and that healthy competition would keep prices stable. Yet, due to the Country Party's talk against that referendum, the basic wage has risen from £5 9s. a week in 1948 to almost £15 a week to-day. The honourable member for Wimmera spoke about wheat stabilization and other rural matters. If it had not been for the Australian Labour Party there would be no dairy-farmers on the land to-day. The honourable member then started to tell us what a great organization the Postmaster General's Department is. It is a socialist organization, and it suits honourable members opposite to be socialists sometimes. They are socialists when they want subsidies. The honourable member said that he wanted a superphosphate subsidy. At the last general election the Labour Party promised to provide such a subsidy and that promise would have been implemented by now if the present Government bad not been returned on Communist Party preferences. On 7th August last, when the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) presented this Budget of despair to the House it was blatantly obvious to all honourable members that his speech lacked inspiration and sincerity. This was so much so that the Prime Minister, his Cabinet Ministers and bis other supporters sat on the other side of the chamber with sick stares on their faces. They reminded me very much of the permanent inmates of Madame Tussaud's waxworks museum in London, so enthusiastic were they about it! There is no doubt that this document would have been better presented in Sydney's Rookwood Crematorium to the strains of the "" Dead March "". There was not one enthusiastic look from the other side of the chamber when this despairing document was presented. Let me read what some of the newsAustralia have been left out in the cold by papers had to say about this Budget. Like the refusal of the Government to increase the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr child endowment. King), I will quote the Melbourne ""Age**'. It saidThe 1962-63 Budget brought down must rank as one of the least exciting documents yet presented to Australia. The Melbourne "" Herald"" wroteThe Federal Treasurer presented the 1962-63 Budget with a speech which contained its own was a speech that tried hard but unsuccessfully to reconcile the obvious need for encouraging confidence and enterprise with a reluctance to put more spending power in the hands of the people. The Melbourne "" Sun"" commentedTo many people who look at the Budget it must seem to be a timid document lacking all the imagination and zest that these times require. The Brisbane ""Courier-Mail"" statedMr Holt's Budget leaves much to faith and hope as a treatment for unemployment. The Brisbane ""Telegraph"" had this to sayThe Budget is a pallid and unenterprising document. The Adelaide ""Advertiser"" saidA colourless Budget. The Hobart ""Mercury"" statedThe insipid document whicn the Treasurer read to Parliament classifies itself as a nothing Budget. The nation did not expect anything but stodgincss and conservatism. The comment by the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" wasWith a complacency that borders on contempt for both the Opposition and the public the Treasurer has ignored the opportunity that the Budget could have provided to set Australia back on the road to economic growth. The Sydney"" Sun"" had this to sayAs a national prospectus for 1962-63 the Budget is a dismal document lacking both courage and enterprise. The people of Australia were looking to this Budget to revitalize our run-down economy. They were looking to it to restore the confidence which had been shattered by this Government by the implementation of the infamous credit squeeze two years ago. This Government has exhibited a cold indifference to the real needs of the age and invalid pensioners and the widow pensioners.

152,Who Is Now The Prime Minister ( Mr Built,"in explanation for a stationary program. ItThis document of despair does not reveal one ray of sunshine for the 130,000 unemployed people-the unfortunate victims of the credit squeeze which was deliberately planned and conceived by the Government. When the Government planned the credit squeeze it knew quite well that unemployment would follow. Even the Attorney General( Sir Garfield Barwick), during a television interview in Queensland, admitted that unemployment was greater than the Government wished for. That is a statement that I would like the Attorney-General to interpret. When he has a few minutes to spare, I would like him to say what the Government actually did wish for when it implemented the infamous credit squeeze. I wish to refer now to the serious probthat the Prime Minister knows what it is lem of unemployment in more detail. At like to be broke and out of work? Of present, 93,000 people are registered as course not! He has never been through unemployed, but there would be at least the mill. An honourable member on the another 40,000 unregistered, giving a total Government side interjects to say that I of at least 130,000 unemployed people in will be out of work after the electoral Australia to-day. Many of these people redistribution. I might be out of work are ex-servicemen who, when they fought after the redistribution, but at least I will in the last war, were promised a new be fighting to return a Labour Government order. They were told that they would and to push the numskulls opposite out. have nothing to fear after the war in regard to poverty, distress or despair. Were those promises, made by the allied interview in Sydney last year the Prime leaders, only a gimmick to get a concerted Minister, in answer to a question by one war effort or were they made in all sinof the members of the panel, said that if cerity. The point is that if this is the the unemployment figure rose beyond new order, it is no different from the old 80,000 the Government would have to conorder of unemployment, poverty and cern itself with the problem. To any perdespair. Many of those out of work are son of reasonable intelligence that statenew Australians who were presented with ment would indicate that the Government rosy pictures of Australia in order to get is satisfied to have a permanent army of them to come here. They sold their worldly 80,000 registered unemployed in Australia. possessions and severed all their ties with At a later stage, when the Prime Minister their friends in their native lands in order was having a talk to the nation on televito come here. A great many of them sion, he appealed to the general public to are unemployed to-day. beause of the false spend their money and go about their picture that was painted for them overaffairs in a normal manner, as though nothseas, because of the propaganda initiated ing had happened. That request indicates by this Government in order to bring the Prime Minister's complete ignorance of migrants to this country. Many of the men who are out of work to-day are bread-winners. They are paying for their homes and have hire-purchase debts for household goods and other essentials. As every one knows, it takes the average wage-earner a couple of years to get out of debt following unemployment, even if he is lucky enough to find a job after a few weeks. From time to time the Prime Minister and members of the Government have expressed deep sympathy for the unemployed. I , too, express my sympathy, but, unlike that of the Prime Minister, my sympathy is based on practical experience on what it is like to be out of work. During the 1930's with a young wife and a baby, I was unemployed for three years. I received 14s 2d. a week in the form of dole coupons. I paid 6s. worth of those coupons for a tiny room, leaving me with 8s. 2d. a week on which to support my wife and baby. I express my sympathy for these people because I know what unemployment is like. But does anybody dare to suggest I vividly recall that during a television the normal reaction of any person working for a living in times of uncertainty. Is it not only natural that a man, working in a plant where retrenchments are taking place or have taken place, believes it might be his turn next week or the week after? The first thing he does then is to button up on his spending in case it is his turn next week, so as to have a few pounds to tide his wife and family over until he can find another job. That is why unemployment keeps snowballing-becaus e of uncertainty and lack of public spending. This situation was created deliberately by this Government two years ago when it implemented the infamous credit squeeze. The truth is that this Government is afraid of prosperity, and the people of Australia are afraid of their prospect for future prosperity under this Government. There is no doubt that the popularity of this Government has waned considerably since it was elected on Communist Party preferences last December. It has waned so much that the Government is not game to face the wrath of the people in the Batman by-election to be held next Saturday week. Even the most untrained mind in this House would realize that the coalition between the Country Party and the Liberal Party is fast breaking up. The marriage of convenience between these two parties is fast going on the rocks, so much so that it reminds me of the old song entitled ""These Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine "". The first two lines of that song go like thisThere goes Bob, there goes Jack, down to lovers' lane; What they did to Les Bury, ain't it but a shame. I wish to refer now to the flat rate reduction of 5 per cent, in income tax. This rebate is unjust, unfair and inequitable, as I shall illustrate. The latest figures issued by the Commissioner of Taxation reveal that the total number of taxpayers is 4,037,862. The5 per cent, flat rate reduction in income tax gives the following concessions:Single Married, Income. no Person. children. s. d. £700 per annum . . £13 10s. per week . . \l £800 per annum . . £15 10s. per week . . \\ £900 per annum . . }l £17 5s. per week . . £1,000 per annum . . £19 5s. per week . . 1 6 1 4 £1,100 per annum.. 6 £21 per week £1,200 per annum . . J 2 £23 per week £1,300 per annum.. £25 per week £1,400 per annum . . £27 per week J* 0 £1,500 per annum . . £29 per week J 4 The total amount of money involved in this concession is £30,000,000. There are 3,564,844 persons, or 88.2 per cent, of the taxpayers, who receive salaries of less than £1,500 a year and they will share £15,000,000 of the £30,000,000. The remaining 473,000 taxpayers, or 11.8 per cent., will share the other £15,000,000. Is that equity? Is it fair that 88.2 per cent, of taxpayers should share £15,000,000 and the other 11.8 per cent, should share the other £15,000,000? Let me give an illustration. A person paying tax on a salary of £1,000 a year receives a concession of 2s. a week whereas a person paying tax on £5,000 net receives a concession of £1 12s. 7d. a week. When the Treasurer introduced this concession he said that it would channel £30,000,000 into circulation as a stimulus to the economy and a remedial measure for unemployment. That was certainly wishful thinking. It illustrates the absolute ignorance of the Government of what a person in the higher income bracket would do with his rebate. 1 believe his rebate would go into the bank and stay there. A person on a salary of more than £1,500 a year does not need a rebate. The Government would have served its purpose of putting the whole of this money into circulation if it had given the £30,000,000 to those in the lower income brackets, particularly the men with families. They need the money and would certainly put it back into circulation. I should like to refer now to age, invalid and widow pensioners. This most neglected section of the community has been forgotten completely in this Budget. From Married, Married, time to time in this chamber comparisons one two child. children. are made between the amount some government paid many years ago and what this 8. d. s. d. s. a.

One is: Can the \l 0 1 0 economy afford to pay more than £5 5s. a week? The answer to that is, I believe, a 2 0 1 8 1 4 definite Yes. Secondly: Is £5 5s. a week j3 0 2 4 2 0 1 8 enough for a person to live on in keeping }3 4 2 8 2 4 2 0 with our Australian standard of living? I 3 4 2 8 2 6 believe that the answer to that question is 4 3 8 3 4 2 10 a definite No. If any honourable member disagrees with me, let bim get up and say so. Let him tell the House if he thinks that £5 5s. a week is enough for a person to exist on in these times of high prices. Last night my colleague, the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), told us of the exorbitant prices of meat, sugar, groceries, bread, and so on. Does any one imagine that anybody can live on £5 5s. a week? Surely the Government could have given these pensioners another 5s. a week. Even though that would have been a meagre amount it would have been a godsend to these people in their struggle to survive. These are the pioneers of this country and they deserve a lot better treatment than they are getting at the present time. My electorate and the electorates of Dalley, West Sydney and East Sydney in the metropolitan area of Sydney, probably have more pensioners than in any other portion of New South Wales. The representatives of those electorates are in a posiadditional funds to the States for education. tion to know what trials the pensioners suffer in order to try to exist. I repeat that I believe that even a paltry increase of 5s. a week would have been a godsend to these people, but this Government has overlooked their needs. The mothers of Australia have been refused assistance by this Government since 1950. Child endowment to-day remains at the same rate as it was twelve years ago, despite the fact that the value of the £1 has decreased by one-half since then. Has this Government endeavoured to increase child endowment as a means of populating this country? Plenty of mothers would be willing to bring more children into the world if they could afford to do so. I do not complain about the immigration programme. I very much favour it, but I believe that an Australian baby is just as good as a migrant brought from overseas. What is the Government doing for the mothers of Australia? It gives a young woman with a child 5s. a week. Just, imagine what it costs to keep a child to-day! It would cost at least £2 per week to feed and clothe a child of even two years of age. When there are more children in the family the drudgery becomes even greater, particularly for people in the lower income bracket. Time and time again my colleague the requesting support for the proposed stanhonorable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr dardization of the railway gauge between Allan Fraser) has appealed for an increase of child endowment, but the Government has followed the same policy in this Budget as it has followed throughout the past years. In conclusion, Mr Chairman, let me say that the popularity of this Government which was returned to power at the last election on Communist preferences, is fast diminishing. The fact that the Government has squibbed the issue in Batman proves that it knows this to be so. It is afraid to face the electors of Batman on this Budget. The Government is fast going on to the rocks and the people have lost all confidence in it. Shortly they will be looking for the return of a Labour government committed to a policy of full employment, committed to a policy designed to restore confidence and prosperity, committed to a policy to develop the northern parts of Australia and committed to a policy to build more schools and hospitals and to give That is what the people will be looking for at the next election. They will sound the death-knell of this mismanaged and incompetent Government. Progress reported. LOAN (QANTAS EMPIRE AIRWAYS Bill returned from the Senate without amendment.

This is their opportunity and I hope that the honourable n.ember for Boothby, the Minister for Immigration, the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Wakefield will avail themselves of it. Some South Australian senators were members of the Government's rail standardization committee i.nd they recommended that this work be carried out. Perhaps one can excuse the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) on this occasion, but the South Australian members of the committee now are on their mettle. senators who have been urging that this work be done now have an opportunity to show where they stand on the matter. Who was the Minister who set this great scheme in motion? Who was the man who brought together the disgruntled States which were opposed to the scheme when it was mooted? It was none other than the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). With the great vision for which he is noted, he brought plans for the standardization of the railways of Australia to the practical stage. I am very pleased to see that the lead in this matter has been given by the Leader of the Opposition in the South Australian Parliament who, in my humble opinion, is the best member ever to enter that Parliament and the man who rightfully should be Premier of South Australia. He was not prepared to stand idly by and just growl, mumble and groan as Sir Thomas Playford has done. Frank Walsh took the lead and moved the resolution which has been carried unanimously by the South Australian House of Assembly. A copy of that resolution has been submitted to each South Australian senator. I hope those who sent the copies to the senators do not forget to send a copy to each South Australian member of this House. I trust that some good will flow from the passing of this resolution. The Premier has agreed that the need to do this work is urgent. He has intimated that in his opinion the Commonwealth Government has shelved the scheme indefinitely. We want to hear from the Prime Minister what he wrote to Sir Thomas Playford and what he told him. What are the views of the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman) on this matter? Does he intend to shelve it indefinitely? Will he produce the letters? Is Sir Thomas Playford telling lies, or is the Prime Minister telling lies? -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Speaker, I rise at this time to take the opportunity, which has been denied me during the day because we have been in committee, to put the record straight on a reference made in the Sydney"" Daily The South Australian Telegraph "" of to-day's date to the speech that I made in this chamber yesterday. During that speech I referred to the fact that when the artillery was used in close support of the infantry the artillery fired ahead of the infantry and the infantry advanced behind that fire. The newspaper columnist wrote that I said that the artillery fired behind the infantry. I know that sometimes the Royal Regiment has been called "" drop shorts"" but I assure the House that the odd round that falls behind the infantry does so purely by accident and not by design. I might add that our gallant soldiers do not need the stimulus of having rounds dropped behind them in order to achieve their objective. I want to put the record straight because some people might believe that the way mentioned in the newspaper article is the normal way in which Australia sends soldiers into action. Speaker, I desire to direct the attention of the House to a situation which I consider is grossly unfair and places an added and uncalled-for burden on country people. I refer to the very high charges for trunkline telephone calls about which I have received numerous complaints from various people and organizations in country areas of Western Australia. These people have asked that the charges be reduced to amounts that are fair and reasonable for the service that is supplied.",100,Adjournment

156,Mr Collard (Kalgoorlie) [11.4],"MrSurely no member of this House would be prepared to suggest that a charge of ISs. or 12s. 6d. for a trunk-line telephone call from a country area to a person in the capital city of that State is fair and reasonAustralia who want to telephone firms or able? It seems that people in the country areas of Western Australia, and no doubt in the other States, are being penalized because they are prepared to live in those areas. This is especially so in the larger States. People in some of the farming, pastoral and mining districts of Western Australia, which are not a great distance from Perth, as distances in that State go, have to pay 15s. for a three-minute call to Perth. We must appreciate that people in those areas do not make trunk-line calls simply for the purpose of having a social conversation with people in the metropolitan area. Invariably the call is urgent and important. It may result from a break-down of harvesting, shearing or mining plant; from a serious illness or a serious accident; or from the fact that urgently-needed supplies have not arrived on the due date in some of the more isolated areas. Whatever the reason is, we can rest assured that the call is completely necessary. The charge is 15s. for a three-minute call. people have no ground for seeking reduced Any additional minutes are charged for at a lower rate. In many country areas the first three minutes of a telephone call often expire, or almost expire, before conditions are good enough for parties to hold a conversation. I agree that the Post Office officials do everything they can to ensure good conditions and that the time charged for is used. However, on a number of occasions it is very difficult to make good contact and get the message through quickly and accurately. The charge for a call over a distance of about 400 miles is 15s -the same amount that is charged for a call from one capital city to another. Many business people who make calls from one capital city to another because of business requirements are able to charge the cost of the calls to their expense accounts. Invariably the cost is passed on to the consumers. However, the people to whom I am referring have to carry the whole burden themselves. People in the cities make local calls from one side of a city to the othera distance of several miles-and talk for half an hour about a game of bridge or golf or a binge at a club. The cost of such a call is only fourpence. Country people in Western relatives in Perth on very important and urgent matters have to pay 15s. for the first three minutes, and if they wish to continue the call they have to dig more deeply into their pockets. Sometimes it is claimed that the high charges are necessary to meet the cost of the call. If the charges made are not sufficient to meet that cost the charges for city calls should be increased to make good the deficiency. Many calls in the cities are unnecessary and frivolous and last longer than is necessary. The country people, by their very existence in country areas, the work that they perform and the goods that they produce, make it possible for many people in the cities to live in luxury with no worries. Country people should be relieved of paying these high charges, which can be described only as unfair and exorbitant. This Government includes several members of the Australian Country Party. They should join me in condemning these unfair charges, unless they believe that the country charges, or unless they believe that the charges are fair and reasonable. To-night the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr King) spoke about the poor telephone services that country people have. I do not know why he is only complaining now. Tbis Government has had twelve years in which to rectify that position. It appears that the Government is all talk and no action. I sincerely hope that it will do something about this matter. I suggest that these high charges, like many other charges that country people have to meet for goods and services, should not be imposed on them simply because there are fewer people and greater distances in the country than in the cities and therefore costs are higher. In fact, charges in country areas should be lower than in the cities because there are fewer amenities in the country than in the cities. This Government has done very little, if anything, in its Budget for country people, so I sincerely trust that it will do something about these charges to which I have referred and give the country people some relief from these exorbitantly high telephone charges. First of all, I support the case submitted by the honourable member for Kingson( Mr invitees originally proposed for this banquet Galvin) and would remind the House that the Government is basing its claim for support for the current Budget on the argument that it provides for great developmental works in Australia. The dispute between tbe Commonwealth and the Liberal Government in South Australia in respect of the railway from Broken Hill to Port Pirie arises out of the last measure introduced in this House by the Chifley Labour Government prior to its defeat in 1949. To show that the Premier of South Australia has been particularly concerned about the failure of the Commonwealth to proceed with this work, I remind the House that South Australia took action in the High Court to try to compel this Government to proceed with the work under the agreement with the Commonwealth into which it had entered as a result of a decision of this Parliament. Because the High Court gave a ruling which, in effect, said that no time limit was fixed for the commencement of this work, South Australia found itself in the position of being unable to force the hand of the Commonwealth Government. Evidently it has taken every action possible to try to get this Government, which claims to be greatly concerned about national development, to undertake the work of building this standard-gauge railway. The project was provided for in the legislation to which I have referred and which the Government, apparently, is determined to shelve. The main matter to which I wish to refer concerns the challenge by the yacht "" Gretel"" for the America's Cup. I should imagine that there is not one Australian who is not hoping that "" Gretel"" succeeds in the race for what is virtually the world trophy for yachting. Some people will always avail themselves of the opportunity to have a guzzle at public expense; and .1 note that our ambassador in the United States of America has been desperately organizing such a function. I understand that it is to be held at Newport in the banquet? Of what use is it to Australia? United States of America on 14th Septem Sir Howard Beale is known to be extravaber next in a mansion called "" The gant at public expense. He entertains in Breakers"" which was built by the Vanderbilts. According to press reports, Sir Howard Beale has had a terrific problem on his hands because the list of 1,000 has had to be trimmed down to 300. I suppose the accommodation problem is one of the matters that concerned him. Every one knows that when Sir Howard Beale was a member of this House he was commonly known to all honourable members in the chamber as "" pin head "". So, honourable members will probably understand why he is having quite a problem in reducing the guest list to 300 and determining who should attend. The honourable member for East Sydney is offensive in referring to an ambassador in those terms. I ask him to withdraw the remark. honourable member for East Sydney to restrain himself. banquet that has been arranged by Sir Howard Beale is that the Australian Embassy officials are reported to have refused to disclose the names of those invited. If only 300 are to be invited from the social elite of tbe United States of America one can imagine the type of people who will be attending. There is to be an all-Australian menu-roc k oysters, barramundi, strawberries, beef and lamb to be flown from Australia-and the banquet is to befinishedoff with Australian wines. Australian floral decorations are to be flown from here by jet. One would imagine that at this banquet some tribute would be paid to the crews that will be taking part in the contest; but, strangely enough, though the banquet is supposed to be associated with the race it is not known whether the crew of the selected American yacht or the crew of "" Gretel"" will be present. The races are to start the following day and I should imagine that the crews will be preparing for the contest rather than taking part in a banquet.

160,Mr Ward,"A strange thing about thebohemian style, according to reports. All guests sit on the floor, and he has some rather strange habits regarding those who call on him. He loves to hit the high spots when he does not have to pay. I think it is time that this Government gave some explanation. Has it approved of this expenditure? Nobody would object if after the contest was over-becaus e obviously the crews could not participate before the contest-o r at the conclusion of the series of races, some entertainment was provided for the crews. But, evidently, the crews are to be the last consideration. This banquet is for the snobocracy of America who will be entertained by Sir Howard Beale at the expense of the Australian public. It is about time the Government gave some explanation of this matter and told the House whether it has approved of this expenditure. In the few moments at my disposal I want to refer to the Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick). On 21st August, he was asked a number of questions about the Government's intention to introduce legislation to deal with monopolies and restrictive trade practices. The Attorney-General, believing himself to be an eminent barrister who can put it over the rank and file of the Government, said that the Government had not undertaken to do this. He said that the matter was mentioned in the Governor General's Speech a few years ago and that the Government was going to examine it. Every one in this Parliament knows that the Governor General's Speech is prepared by the Government and is regarded as a statement of Government policy. Government undertook to introduce legislation to deal with monopolies. I joined in the criticism of the Attorney-General and asked him a question about information claimed to have been sent to him from the Sydney City Council in a letter from the Lord Mayor, directing the Minister's attention to restrictive trade practices and asking for some action to be taken a-t the Commonwealth level. "" Hansard "", I found that instead of replying to the question the Attorney-General saidThe honourable member's questions all depend upon the first one. To the best of my knowledge, within the Liberal Party and the Australian I received no such evidence. All honourable members know the evasive style that he adopts to hide his incompetence. I am not questioning the reliability of "" Hansard "", but I listened very attentively to what the Attorney-General said; and my recollection is that he said, "" I received no such evidence"" and did not say, "" to the best of my knowledge "". I am not blaming the "" Hansard"" reporters or suggesting dishonesty on their part, but I am suggesting that when the Attorney General left this chamber and found that he had slipped again, he added those words as a protection so that he could not be accused of having lied to the House. I have since obtained copies of the correspondence and shall read the letters to the House. This is the letter which was sent by the Lord Mayor, dated 21st February lastDear Sir Garfield, I attach herewith information concerning the prices submitted as a result of tenders being called for re-inforced concrete piping. There have been many other occasions on which piping has been purchased in small quantities which do not necessitate the calling of lenders. The similarity in prices submitted and the rotation which applies in certain cases, notably 18-in. Class ""S"" piping, causes me to suspect the operation of a cartel in the industry which, if applied to Government bodies, might be very detrimental to the public good. This information is forwarded for your consideration in view of reports that you are considering legislation to cover activities of monopolies and cartels. Yours sincerely, H. F. Jensen, Lord Mayor. The letter of acknowledgment received by the Lord Mayor was as follows:My dear Lord Mayor, The Many thanks for your letter of 21st Februaiy bringing to my attention the result of tenders called for reinforced concrete piping. member's time has expired.

All of them are shouting their fears from the housetops. In the past few days we have heard members on the Government side being extremely critical of the speeches made and the policies announced by the leaders of the Government. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), for instance, criticized every facet of Government policy. It is a terrible state of affairs when supporters of the Government sit in the House and criticize all features of the Government's policy. The practice is growing. I shall show how the disease begun by the honourable member for Mackellar is spreading far and wide within the Government parties. When we speak of the Liberal Party, we speak of a political party which has been for a considerable time the second strongest party in Australia. The honourable member for Mackellar criticized the Government viciously on all -matters of policy. The honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) criticizes the policies of the Government every time he stands in his place and speaks. As if all this were not enough, honourable members recently had the privilege of listening to the honourable member for Barker( Mr our eyes away so as not to watch it too Forbes), who disagreed with the Government on many features of its policy. Recently we had the spectacle of the honorshall not say much about him because he is away sick-goin g overseas, in the most doubtful company that one could find, to espouse the cause of fighting Britain's entry into the European Common Market, although his Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) says that that is not the policy of his party. distribution of electoral boundaries will not What is happening to this once great party a party that for many years was the second most important political party in this country? If all this is not enough, let me say what happened recently to the well respected member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury), who had the courage to speak up. Although he was a member of the Cabinet team, his conscience was pricked and he spoke out because he could not possibly conform to Government policy. When he had the courage to put forward his point of view he was sacked immediately. Disintegration is taking place within this party. To-morrow there will be one or two more defaulters. Honourable members know what happens when parties start to disintegrate. Years ago the Liberal Party was known as the Nationalist Party. When that party had disintegrated sufficiently, it was decided to call it the United Australia Party. When that party began to decay, Mr Speaker, it was decided to call it the Liberal Party, in the hope that, with a name like that, the people would not believe the party members to be as illiberal as they were and would give them support. I wonder what will be the next name of the Liberal Party when the process of disintegration is complete. priate, because it offers no hope for Australia. It is sad that a party which at the last general election polled only 300,000 fewer votes than the great Australian Labour Party should be disintegrating as we watch it. That is very sad for us on this side of the House. We are very distressed and we feel very strongly as we watch this disease, with consequent, disintegration, growing within the G nment's ranks. As repreover sentatives of the people, we feel it is a very sad situation indeed. We will have to turn closely. What is happening with the Australian Country Party? That party has been married to the Liberal Party for a considerable time. It is an unhappy marriage, but nevertheless they have been together. Now what is happening? In the past few days we have heard members of the Country Party say that the Government's ideas on the rebe acceptable to them. This marriage is about to break. That is sad for those who do not believe in divorce or, at any rate, in easier divorce. It is sad to see this marriage breaking up before our very eyes. This is a matter of grave concern.

They said we should regard the pool of unemployed as consisting of only 50,000 people. The honourable member for Higinbotham did not agree. He was insulted by the statement of the honourable member for Fremantle that 130,000 breadwinners are unable to earn their livings because the Government will not provide employment for them. The honourable member for Fremantle said that that was mass unemployment.

This matter has been brought sharply to my mind by a letter I received to-day from the Diocesan Registrar of the Anglican See of Armidale. He points out that no sales tax is charged on supplies received by church schools, and goes on to say that the church at Armidale, like many other churches and some non-denominational groups of publicspirited citizens, conducts a hostel for highschool children. The parents of many of the children attending high schools in the country live some distance from cities and towns, and the children must board at the centres in which the high schools are situated. It seems an extraordinary thing to me that because a church, as in the case of the Diocese of Armidale, runs a hostel for high-school children and not as a straightThis matter was brought to my notice in houses.

The Workers Compensation Ordinance 19581961 of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, which applies to workers in the Territory irrespective of race, provides a code of compensation scaled according to wages. The amount of compensation payable to the dependants of a native worker killed in the course of his employment would therefore depend on the wage received by the worker. (In calculating wages for the purposes of the ordinance, the value of rations, clothing, accommodation or issues which are required by law to be provided to a worker is added to the cash wage.

169,Minister For Mr Mcmahon,"The answers to the6. The present legislative provisions stem from the Government's consideration of the report of the Tart Committee of Inquiry into the Stevedoring Industry. That report emphasized that the statutory authority should not interfere ""more than is essential with the authority and control by the individual stevedore employer over the waterside workers employed by him through the bureau. Tbe emphasis should be on regulation rather than control."" The present provisions subject employers of waterside labour to supervision and sanctions such as do not apply to employers in industry generally. No employer can engage in stevedoring operations except with the approval of the authority. Cancellation or suspension of his right to engage in the industry may be ordered by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. He is liable to criminal prosecution for breaches of obligations imposed by the legislation and upon conviction to a minimum fine of £100 and a maximum fine of £1,000. To put this whole matter of discipline in perspective, the 300 apparent breaches referred to above resulted in a loss of 14,217 man-hours. During the same period the man-hours lost by unauthorized stoppages by waterside workers were 4,914,010. Drugs. Mr Cairns asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice1. What provisions exist in Australia for anticipating the effects of drugs such as thalidomide or phenacetin, or for ensuring adequate testing of these drugs before they are sold? 2. If these provisions are adequate, why was it possible for the drug phenacetin to do so much damage? 3. If these provisions are not adequate, will he take immediate steps to ensure that they are made so? has furnished the following replies:1. It should firstly be observed that drugs developed either overseas or in Australia are subjected to the most rigorous and searching tests by the manufacturers to ensure the highest standards of potency, stability and purity. As well, members of the medical profession make use of the detailed clinical information available concerning new drugs before prescribing them for their patients. These factors, combined, in the case of an overseas drug, with a time lag between its first release overseas and its release on the Australian market, ensure a high degree of safety in therapeutics prescribed by doctors in Australia. A number of public controls reinforce the standards set by the therapeutics industry and the medical profession. At the point of import the Commonwealth exercises controls under which the importation of dangerous drugs is prohibited. This control is maintained by the Customs authorities in co-operation with the Commonwealth Department of Health. Under the Therapeutic Substances Act, standards of purity and potency are laid down for drugs coming within the scope of the act. Because of the limitation on Commonwealth powers imposed by the Commonwealth Constitution, this control does not extend to tbe distribution of all drugs throughout Australia. For example, tbe standards of drugs manufactured and sold within States is the responsibility ef the State authorities. By regulations under the Therapeutic Substances Act the Commonwealth has appointed a number of laboratories for the examination, testing and analysis of drugs to which the Act applies. These laboratories includeNational Biological Standards Laboratory, Canberra. The Laboratory controlled by the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Sydney. The Commonwealth Laboratory, Department of Customs and Excise, Melbourne. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne. 2. The possibility must be recognized that any drug may cause ill-effects in particular persons, especially if taken in large quantities over a prolonged period. Generally drugs in common use such as phenacetin cause little ill-effect unless the recommended quantities are greatly exceeded. However, a patient's medical practitioner is the only person qualified to advise on the proper use and dosages of particular drugs. 3. The arrangements for the testing of drugs within Commonwealth control are continuously under review to ensure that adequate controls are exercised. Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice1. Can the Minister give an unqualified assurance that the prolonged use of acetylsalicylic acid which is the single active ingredient of Bayer's aspirin, can be taken without harmful effects to children and adults? 2. Does the pain-killing powder known as "" Bex A.P.C."" contain phenacetin? 3. What are the trade names of all powders and tablets known to tbe Department of Health to contain phenacetin? has furnished the following reply:1. No. Because of the known side effects of certain drugs on particular patients, a patient's own doctor is in the best position to advise on the possible effects of the prolonged use of acetylsalicylic acid, or any other drug. I am informed that the directions issued to purchasers of Bayers' product include advice to consult a medical practitioner when the recommended dosage fails to relieve the pain. 2. Yes. The product known as Bex A.P.C. contains a number of drugs including phenacetin. 3. Preparations containing the drug phenacetin are manufactured in various States, often for sale only in the State of manufacture. Complete information in regard to trade names is held by the Department of Health only in respect of those products which are pharmaceutical benefits. This information is contained in the "" Proprietary Index"" published by the Department of Health. It should be read in conjunction with the pharmaceutical benefits booklet issued to doctors.

United Nations Report. Mr Haylen asked the Ministerf o r External Affairs, upon notice1. Has his attention been drawn to the report called "" Decade of Development"" made by U Thant, Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, to the Economic and Social Council? 2. If so, does this report outline a plan which would lift income in under-developed countries by one-fourth in ten years, aim at a target growth of 3 per cent, above population increase in all countries, create new jobs and end unemployment by capital investment, and extend the use of national aid to undeveloped countries to 1 per cent, of the income of industrialized countries? 3. DoesU Thant remark that a gigantic project of this nature under the United Nations is urgent because nearly two billion people in the world earn the equivalent of a loaf of bread a day, half the world's adults cannot read or write, and two-thirds of the people in the world are undernourished? 4. As the plan envisages massive aid to Asian countries, could such a plan be part of our answer to the problem of the European Common Market? 5. Will he circulate this document to honourable members and arrange for a discussion of it at the earliest opportunity? Sir Garfield Barwick -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. The report was discussed at the recent session of the Economic and Social Council in Geneva and will be discussed again at the forthcoming General Assembly. 2. The object of the Development Decade is to create conditions in which the national incomes of the developing countries will be increasing by 5 per cent, yearly by 1970 (or 2 to 3 per cent, above present rates of population growth in most under-developed countries) and will continue to expand thereafter at the same rate. The Secretary-General's report contains a number of suggestions for the intensification of the existing activities of the United Nations system, together with proposals for new departures. These suggestions and proposals range over a wide area of development problems, including employment, capital investment and international aid. On the latter point the Secretary-General suggests that if international assistance increases to and maintains a level of 1 per cent, of the national incomes of the advanced countries during the Decade, this will represent yet another essentia] contribution to the success of the Decade. 3.
