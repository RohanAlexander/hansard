14,Mr Toseph Cook (Parramatta,"proposals of the Conference recognise these fundamental principles of naval strategy. Should the. motion which I am moving be carried, we shall turn over a new leaf in the book of our evolution. Our tutelary stages are past, our time of maturity is here. Let us hope that with it has come a deepening and increasing conviction of the immensity of the debt which we owe to the Mother Country for sheltering us while we grew. In passing the motion we shall enter what has been called the great Sea League of the Empire, and the wardenship of the Pacific will be allotted to us as the worthiest and most adequate contribution to the defence of the Empire that highest naval authorities can devise. This also is our response to the feverish war preparations which various nations are making-eigh t Dreadnoughts on the part of Great Britain, plus the creation of a great Pacific Fleet, and more to follow, if required. back the 25s. if there is more to follow. considered, if necessary. We say to these nations that just as they preserve the inviolability of their soil and maintain their land forces at sufficient strength to do so, so we as a maritime Empire are under an obligation to keep open the communications without which the Empire could not exist. Now, what has been done? I think that I am justified in saying that this movement had its genesis in the Dreadnought offers. Without those offers I doubt if there would have been this proposition to-day for the formation of a great Pacific Fleet. nologically the honourable member is out five years. Colonel FOXTON -It is not nonsense; it is perfectly correct. his speech the honourable member will give us the chronology and the genesis of the whole proceeding. I shall ask for nothing better than that. In the meantime I hope that he will allow me to deal with the facts. alongside the honourable member I am a poor feilow; still I hope that he will allow me to proceed. These Dreadnoughts will provide the major force of the new Fleet. We have, indeed, by these offers created a new Pacific Fleet. That is a plain unvarnished statement of fact. That Fleet is, as honourable members are aware, to consist of three squadrons, namely, one with its base at Bombay, another with its base at Hong Kong or Singapore, and another with its base in Australia. Our squadron is to be created by ourselves. The East Indies squadron is to be created by Great Britain. Great Britain is to join New Zealand in the creation of the China squadron. Canada will add her quota to Imperial defence, but she will do it in her own way, and in view of her peculiar geographical position. She proposes to establish a Fleet of a different kind at, perhaps, the same annual cost, but to be divided the between her two seaboards, for reasons of her own. I am not quite sure that she is doing the correct thing-certainl y not from a strategic point of view. But we may not criticise our sister Dominion, any more than we should like it ' to criticise us. We leave them to do their best in the light of local circumstances, and in view of all the surroundings of their position. But the fact is that they, too, propose to add their quota to the defence of the Empire, and to do so in a very substantial way. The Eastern Fleet will, therefore, consist of three vessels of the Indefatigable type, nine cruisers of the Bristol type, eighteen destroyers, and nine submarines, totalling thirty-nine ships, with over 7,000 men. If we add to this the four cruisers of the Bristol type which Canada proposes to create-on e cruiser of the Boadicea type, and six destroyers-w e get a total of fifty ships, and considerably over 9,000 men added to the fleet strength of the Empire. The capital cost to Canada will be ,£2,338,000; to Australia, .£3,695,000; and to New Zealand, ,£2,000,000, or a total cost of ,£8,033,000 to the outlying Dominions. But this by no means represents the whole cost of the additions to the Fleet. For instance, the three Pacific units will each cost .£3,095,000, or a total of ;£i 1,085,000. If we add to that Canada's contribution, we get, roughly, a total of ,£13,500,000 as the cost of the total additions to the fighting forces of the Empire; Here, then, is the response of the Empire, as a whole, to the needs of the moment from the Imperial point of view. Other nations are building Dreadnoughts. The response which Great Britain makes is eight Dreadnoughts this year on her own account, besides additions to the Pacific Fleets costing ,£13,500,000, or total",15,Imperia L Nava L Defence Australian Unit

20,Mr Joseph Cook,"I admit thatadditions to the fleet strength costing about ,£40,000,000 sterling. As regards the annual cost, Australia's share will be £750,000 per annum. Canada's share is estimated at £600,000, but it is only fair to her to state that, in addition to that sum, she spends on the protection of her fisheries, and on hydrographic surveys, not less than ,£200,000 per annum. New Zealand's yearly bill will be ,£250,000. Altogether, the total capital cost will be .£13,500,000, and the annual cost about ,£1,750,000. clude interest and sinking fund? the Prime Minister reminds meI had intended to mention it later-the fact that South Africa is not included in this movement is due to her peculiar position. There is no doubt that she will make a response when her scheme of internal union is completed and established. She will, I believe, stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the Empire in augmenting the fleet strength organized for its safety. Colonel FOXTON She contribules ,£60,000 a vear now. the basis of the calculation of the annual cost? Does it include a sinking fund? give all particulars. With regard to our own unit, honourable members are already acquainted with the details. We are to get an armoured cruiser of the Indefatigable type, with a speed of 25 knots and an armament of eight 12-in. guns; three unarmoured cruisers of the improved Bristol type, with a speed of 25 knots and an armament of eight 6-in. guns; six torpedo-boat destroyers of the River class, with a speed of 25 knots; and three submarines of the "" C "" class. It was the opinion of the Admiralty that the big ship should be laid down at once, and the others later, so as to time the completion of all about two and a half years hence. In addition to this, the Admiralty has very generously undertaken the whole of the inspection al work in connection with the new fleet. That is, I think, a matter of first importance. I do not pretend to criticise what has been done in regard to the supervision of the destroyers, but I am glad that the Admiralty will take complete overnumber. sight of the construction of the new vessels, thereby relieving us of all anxiety in that respect. Further, it will provide us with all the specialist officers whom we shall require, so that we may begin our training for the new -personnel. I have said that the cost of these vessels will be .£3*695,000, but, in all probability, it will be more than that, because we must have the very latest improvements. built in Australia ? that we shall be able to build the other three destroyers here; but, as regards the other vessels, I do not know. My very earnest desire will be to build all that we can, to develop our building resources and the equipment of these boats in every possible way. Admiralty will be confined to the vessels to be built in Great Britain? am afraid that we cannot hope to undertake the building of the larger vessels in Australia yet awhile, but I trust that the time may come for us to do that, and the sooner the better, I think. The sooner we are self-contained in everything relating to defence the better for all concerned. That is the spirit in which I approach this matter. All my efforts will be pointed in that direction. The Admiralty further agrees that, until.we can be self-sufficient in these things, it will supply all munitions of war, and all stores requisite at the same price as that at which they are supplied to the Royal Navy. That again is, I think, a very great concession. It also makes us a free gift of Garden Island, and the naval base in Sydney, the upkeep of which costs about ,£50,000 per annum, on condition that it is kept in a state of naval efficiency. Honourable members are no doubt anxious to know how the new fleet will compare with the squadron which we have at present. I have taken the trouble to get some figures, from which to make a comparison of the relative strength of the two units. Honourable members will see at once the striking advance which this proposal means in the direction of effective defence. While our present squadron comprises nine vessels, the new Australian unit will have thirteen. Note the number. too.",16,Imperia L Nava L Defence Australian Unit

You, sir, called upon two honourable members who were voting with the Ayes to act as tellers, and they asked to be relieved of the duty. Then you called a teller from the other side of the House. This is the first occasion on which that has been done in this Parliament, and I think it is only fair that the House should know under what rule this practice has been adopted, and whether the rules of this House are such as to justify a departure from the ordinary practice with regard to tellers being called from each side of the House. orable member, who has just called attention to what is the usual course, I desire to say that it is unusual for honorab'e members to refuse to act as tellers when called upon to do so. Never during the whole of my Parliamentary experience, nor in my study of Parliamentary procedure, have I met with a case of the kind. It has remained for some members of this Parliament to take a course which could only result in placing the occupant of the chair in a position of difficulty.

It is an absolute necessity that these boys should be caught young if they are to make efficient sailors and seamen. In addition to training establishments for the boys, we shall also need schools for signalling, torpedo work, gunnery, nautical science, and the mechanical branches of the service. These will all have to be established. all, for the officers, we shall require means of supplying advanced instruction. That is to say, we shall require these means for -those who have served a certain period and desire to qualify as lieutenants in the navy or it may be that the lieutenants themselves may require to pass special courses and to undergo special training in connection with some of the arms of the service. The petty officers and men would also be qualifying as specialists, for ratings, or for positions as instructors. They would desire the instruction which they could receive at the projected schools. In connection with a small fleet like ours we shall not be able to multiply these schools and to specialize them in the various directions I have suggested.

These persons have distinctly stated their willingness to subscribe a certain sum of money for the purpose of ""downing"" a Labour man. If our Electoral Act is to be properly administered, I hold that these persons who are infringing its provisions should be prosecuted.

A few months in gaol would do men like Mr Ritchie and some other Western District squatters an immense amount of good. In my opinion the Department should closely investigate the accounts of the expenditure incurred by candidates. If the Act is to be reduced to a farce, the sooner we know it the better. The Minister has told us how many prosecutions have taken place in Victoria and in the other States, but he omitted to tell -us that in one of these prosecutions, the Vice-President of the Women's National League at Geelong was fined £ 5 for a most flagrant breach of the law.

'Calare has pointed out, whenever the Customs Department is informed that the -Customs Act is being infringed, it at once takes action. It will investigate almost any complaint that is made to it. The Electoral Department should be conducted upon similar lines. Of course, I recognise that the proposal of the honourable member for Calare has no prospect of being carried. The numbers are up. But1 do trust that the Minister will take action in all cases in which complaints are made as to breaches of the law. in the absence of this clause. monwealth Government quite as much as it is done by the States. is very different from the State Electoral Acts. The latter do not impose any limitation upon the expenditure which a Parliamentary candidate may incur. We prolutely a sham. Under existing conditions a candidate may spend just what he likes. I do trust that the Minister will take some action in regard to this matter, irrespective of whether the proposed new clause is accepted or rejected. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. purity of elections cannot be secured By the mere specification of offences, and the enactment of accompanying penalties; there must also be a vigorous administration of the electoral law. In regard to many electoral offences, it would be' very difficult to get individuals to prosecute, or even to give the information necessary for the setting on foot of a prosecution. When a breach of the law is reported to the Electoral Department, as when a breach of the Customs Act is reported to the Customs Department, the police and detective force should be set to work to discover the guilty person, and to take steps to secure his conviction. Offences under the Electoral Act will not be punished if we throw on private individuals the onus of giving the necessary information, and thereby disclosing their identity. It has surprised me to hear it said during the debate that returns of expenditure by candidates are made which are not correct. If the provision which limits the expenditure of candidates to a certain sum is to be complied with, the Department must closely investigate all reAs the honourable member for turns, and, where it thinks that untrue statements have been made, should prosecute the person making them, without regard to the fact that he is a successful or unsuccessful candidate.

CATTS I understand from what the honourable member for Calare said that in some cases the Department has alleged that it had not the power to proceed against offenders, or that the complaints ought to be laid before some other Department. I understand from the Attorney-General that the Customs law contains no such provision as that which the honourable member for Calare wishes to insert ; but that is not a good reason for declining to put the onus of action in these cases on the Electoral Department. The proper conduct of elections is at the base of our democratic institutions. I ask the Minister, therefore, to try to meet the views of honourable members by inserting in the Bill a provision which will place the onus of action on the Department. No doubt the present Minister will do all in his power, to secure compliance with the law, but his successors may not view their obligations in the same light, and to provide against such a contingency, the law should require the Department to proceed in every case in which a complaint, has been made, and an investigation shows that an offence has been committed. ral) [2-29] -The proposed amendment really directs the Electoral Department to do certain things, and is too wide to be adopted. against public order or some statute has been committed, and a -prima, facie case is made out, the Crown prosecutes; but it is difficult for a Department to discover every offence, especially under the electoral cases a prosecution must ensue. law. published all over Australia, some of them without compliance with the provisions which require the publication of the name of the publisher; but it would be impossible for the Department to find out every such case.

Under section 206c of the Electoral Act there is an offence connected with the defamation of candidates, and surely that is a private offence? is not contemplated in the amendment. that class, and I.think it would be better if the Committee were content with the assurance that prosecution shall ensue ih any bona fide case. I understand that the honourable member for Calare said that sometimes the States were consulted, or their co-operation sought in regard to prosecutions ? police and detective forces of the States are used by the Federal authorities. cept an offence is committed, and then they are bound under the Constitution to help; but matters are only remitted to the States when the case, originally thought to be Federal, turns out to be a State one. fences under the Act in which the police have to take action, surely the State Departments are available to the Commonwealth? ments are not asked to make investigations and prepare cases, and there is no Act which contains a provision of the kind.

I am not attacking the wording of the proposal, but the principle, as giving a direction. At present the Department ought to prosecute where there is a primd facie case. I have looked into the matter, and I do not I think there is any remissness on the part of the Electoral Department of the Commonwealth, as compared with similar Departments in the States. The plausible plea of the Attorney-General practically is, "" Please leave the administration to prosecute as it thinks fit,"" and it mav be further refined into, "" Please leave the administration for the time being",28,Fuller I N All Cases Where A

We had an illustration yesterday that the law is not enforced if it be a question of ""saving the face"" of a political friend. We have had distinct breaches of the law in which the administration has been so peculiarly sympathetic that the culprits have escaped, and we do not want similar cases in the future. The Attorney-General knows that, in connection with postal voting, corruption has taken place. Persons who are otherwise honest seem to lose all their honour at election time, and to do things which, in ordinary 'life or business, they would view with scorn and horror. Some breaches of the law result from over-zealousness, too much enthusiasm, or strong party views; but we know that men of education, commercial knowledge, and ability do not hesitate to break the electoral law, and to secretly gloat over the fact that they are able to do so. The Attorney-General ought not to plead that the administration should be free to permit such offenders to escape. plea. plea of the Attorney-General practically amounts to. The amendment is sufficiently wide to leave the administration free not to take action unless it chooses. In the first place, there has to be a bond fide comtion on the Department. I again point out, plaint ; in the second place, that complaint has to be thoroughly investigated without prejudice; and, thirdly, the Administration need not, unless the circumstances justify it, one who has made complaints, because take further action. There is nothing mandatory in the clause-it does not say that any person committing a breach of the law by accident or otherwise shall necessarily be punished. Eveni f a case reaches the Court, no punishment may follow; and, under the circumstances, there will be no harassing of electors, and no trivial inquiries. All will be done impartially. It is in connection with the postal voting that we find most of these unfair and corrupt practices; and ""I think the Minister of Home Affairs will be well advised toaccept, not necessarily a mandatory clause, but some provision that will operate as ?. check. [2.38] -The position of the Minister is practically"" There are certain offences in which we shall take action and prosecute; but, first of all, we must be informed, not only what the offences are, but also who are the ""offenders, and if, with the evidence before us, we consider a case has been made out, we shall submit it to the Crown Law authorities', who, if they think there is a primd facie case, may place the matter in the hands of those whose duty it is to take action."" Apparently, the Electoral Department considers itself as merely a sort of machine for the purpose of registering, complaints and passing them on to the Crown Law Department. It is no part of the duty of the Crown Law Department todiscover either offences or offenders, but simply to deal with dry matters of law. and, on the evidence submitted, advise whether there should be a prosecution. It. is before that stage is reached that my amendment will operate, and place the Electoral Department in a position to arm itself with additional facts for the proper submission of a case to the Crown' Law authorities. Under similar circumstances, the other Departments take action on their own initiative. In the Postal and other. Departments, if an offence is disclosed, the machinery at hand is used to discover who the offender is, and that having been done the papers are sent on to the Crown Law Office for advice. The Electoral authorities take up their present position because of an opinion expressed by a previous Attorney-General-wh o is a member of the present Government-that there is nothing ir* the Act which places the onus of investigahowever, that the other Departments do not require specific legislation to cause them to recognise their duty. I am not the only there is also the honourable member for Herbert; and the Departmental reply that he received is practically identical with that, sent to me. We may reasonably assume, therefore, that that reply discloses the principle and practice of the Department; and, that being so, I now propose an amendment providing that it shall be part of the duty of the Department to institute investigations in bond fide cases. If , as I say, we are to assume that this is the general policy of the Department, has it to be applied only to certain members, and not to all ? If the Minister maintains that investigations are made, and prosecutions are instituted, by the Department, I desire to know why a line is drawn between myself and the honourable member for Herbert, on the one hand, and honourable members opposite, on the other ? that sort.

170,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare),,30,Fuller I N All Cases Where A
171,Mr Fuller,"I have done nothing ofnot, but that seems to be the only alternative to the position taken up by those who previously controlled the Department. If the Minister does exercise this power in his administration, then he is doing something which a previous Attorney-General said did not devolve upon the Department, that opinion being taken by the Department as an excuse for not moving in the matter. The law on the subject is very clear. Section 180 lays it down thatIn addition to bribery and undue influence the following shall be illegal practices :(a) Any publication of any electoral advertisement hand-bill or pamphlet or any issue of any electoral notice (other than the announcement by advertisement in a newspaper of the holding of a meeting) without at the end thereof the name and address of the person authorizing the same; (i) Printing or publishing any printed electoral advertisement hand-bill or pamphlet (other than an advertisement in a newspaper) without the name and place of business of the printer being printed at the foot of it ; Under the table of electoral offences and punishments appears the followingDistributing any advertisement, hand-bill or pamphlet published in contravention of section one hundred and eighty; Penalty not exceeding F if t y pounds, or imprisonment not exceeding -one month. The intention of the Legislature, therefore, was that the Department should have complete authority to investigate any breaches of those sections, and that, if such investigation showed that there was a case for the Crown Law Department, it should be submitted to it, and a prosecution instituted, against the guilty person if the advice of the Crown Law Officers favoured that course. That is the only way in which the Act could be vindicated. It is the only way in which every Act of this Parliament which provides for penalties and punishments for offences against it is vindicated. It is simply because the Department has taken up an attitude different from that of every other Department that I wish to have this clause inserted, placing upon the officers of the Department the obligation which, upon the authority of a previous Attorney-General's opinion, they deny rests upon them. If the present position of the Department is as the Minister states, what objection is there to carrying the clause? If , on the other hand, the Department propose to continue the policv which they have so far adopted, the clause is very necessary. It is wide, and in no way mandatory. I trust the Minister will allow it, as it is a machinery proposal pure and simple, to be included in this machinery Bill. The only legitimate reason that he could have for objecting to it would be that he wanted to take up the position that has been occupied by the Department in refusing to exercise the obligations placed upon it by the law. I hope he will seriously consider the clause, and that, even if he will not accept it, the good sense of the Committee will stand By it. hardly think it necessary to say much more on the subject after the able way in which the honourable member for Calare has stated the case. well as I could. to the matter; and it appears to me that the Minister is standing upon very weak ground.

As a matter of fact, most of our laws are more effective in the crimes that they prevent than in respect of""' the crimes that they punish. Many persons are kept in the path of rectitude because of the fear that if they depart from it they will be punished. We should see that there are as few loopholes as possible in our legislation. I can recall instances in which I have shown that a provision in a Bill to which the Minister in charge was wedded was not what it ought to be, and have successfully appealed to him to accept an amendment. cases in which, where a Minister has failed to recognise the weakness of a proposal made by him, the Committee itself, being free to exercise its intelligence, has carried an amendment despite his opposition.

Surely. the Minister is not to be al' lowed to play these little tiddly-winking tricks because of the prejudice against Labour men, or the solid phalanx behind him. In all deliberative assemblies men should be free to use their intelligence. If that were the position in this Committee, this amendment would .nol be defeated. Important proposals have been submitted from this side by honourable members quite as intelligent and as clever in reasoning as the Minister is, but they have been rejected by honourable memberopposite. Honourable members of the Opposition appeal again and again to honourable members opposite to consider important amendments, but they might as well talk to the walls. The ears of honourable members opposite are deaf to our entreaties. They are not open to conviction. They have sealed up their powers of observation and discrimination, and are absolutely clogged by the machine that is unfortunately governing politics in this Parliament to-day. honourable member connect these remarks with the question before the Chair? the attitude of the Department is part of the machine. If the Department will not administer the law and make it effectiveif it allows certain offenders to escape-it is a party to the crime. It is not merely conniving at, but encouraging, a breach of the law. I hope that this proposed new clause will be pressed to a division, because it is founded upon what the honourable member for Calare believes to be just and equitable and in the best interests of the Department. I shall leave the Minister to be guided by the Attorney-General, who, when attacked just now, left-the Chamber, and has not returned to reply I leave him to be guided also by the opinions of previous Attorneys-General, and by the dry and musty records of his Department. Having gathered knowledge from those sources, he may use his own judgment in determining whether or not electors shall be compelled to prosecute persons for violating an Act which he, in his present position, ought to have the courage to administer. am surprised that the Minister of Home Affairs should oppose this proposed new clause.

208,Mr Frazer,"He makes only a partialsuch as have been brought before the Minister during this debate that the Department throws upon the complainant the responsibility of discovering the offender. That is not a proper attitude for it to adopt. Where there is primd facie evidence that the law has been broken, surely the Crown Law Department should endeavour to trace the offenders and have them punished? That is such a reasonable proposition that I am unable to understand why the Minister is not prepared to endorse it. If we declare that in respect of offences under the Electoral Act there shall be vested in private individuals an authority which under other laws is exercised by the Crown Law Department, we shall institute an entirely new set of conditions. Why should a person who violates the Electoral Act, and so, perhaps, corrupts an election, be allowed to escape punishment? have very strong reasons to justify his determination to withhold the assistance of the Crown Law Department from those who desire that offenders under the Electoral Act shall be brought to book. I thought that the wisdom of this proposed new clause would commend itself to honourable members opposite, notwithstanding that it was submitted by a member of the Opposition. ber really believe that? circumstances even the antipathy exhibited by honourable members opposite towards the Opposition would not be allowed to run away with their judgment. I do not know whether the Minister will be supported by his .colleagues in his opposition to this proposed new clause. and see. that we shall not have last night's degrading spectacle repeated, he being on one side and all his colleagues on the other. If the Government think that persons who break the law should be allowed to go unscathed, it is for them to say so. there be to the insertion of a provision which will require the Crown Law Department to prosecute whenever a primd facie case of an infraction of the law has been brought before it? cause it is the "" wowsers"" who always break the law. orable member propose to give us a definition of the word "" wowsers "" ? order by the Chairman were I to attempt to do so; but there are members of the Committee who are generally recognised as "" wowsers,"" and yet, in my opinion, are the biggest sinners. I did not hear the Minister's statement of his objection to the proposal. Every other Statute contains a piovision of this kind. Crown Law officers always accept the responsibility of prosecuting when breaches of any but the electoral law occur. At the present time such an investigation is taking place under the Australian Industries Preservation Act. I admit that the inveS' The Minister must tigation which is proceeding is very slew, and that the discoveries^ are not wnfii would be made were it ""more energetic.

We have no chance of getting from this Government improvements which we could not get from previous Governments. Unless Ministers are prepared to be branded as friends of those who break the law, they must support this provision for the punishment of those who break it. I have had some experience of breaches of the electoral law, though perhaps the less said about it the better. On one occasion, although the sworn declarations relating to electoral offences made a big pile, it was difficult to get the Department to act. One of the chief officers concerned, when the matter was being discussed was running about his room, followed by his son, imploring him to be firm, that is, firm in allowing the Act to be broken.

224,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.20],"of the law, but, unfortunately, there seems to be no provision for the taking of immediate action. It is requiring too much of a citizen to ask him to proceed against offenders. We all wish justice to reign supreme, and though sometimes she may be swayed by technical objections, in the main she does so. Citizens should have the right to go to the officer in charge of a subdivision, or to some other officer, to make complaints, and should these be in writing, the Government should take action. Were citizens to take the law into their own hands, we should get back to the procedure of duelling, and other anachronisms which civilization has swept away. If the Minister will not accept the amendment, I ask him to ponder over the matter with a view to determining whether it is fair to place upon citizens the onus of prosecuting offenders under the electoral law. highest Court we have, and in the sacred name of justice the Government sliould see that all wrongs against the purity of elections are punished, taking upon itself the onus and expense of the necessary prosecutions.

It is an offence which is punishable in all the States now so far as my knowledge goes. It is in the power of the chairman or the conveners of a meeting to call in the police and order the immediate arrest of persons guilty of conduct of that character. whilst I agree with the honourable member to that extent, something more is being aimed at by a number of those who are supporting his proposal. dates for this' House being given rights and privileges that are denied to the general community. They should not, simply because they happen to be members or wish to become members of this Parliament, be put upon a pedestal ancl given autocratic powers in the conduct of meetings which are denied to the rest of the community. I» do not know that my experience has been exceptional, but I have been in State and Federal politics for fifteen or sixteen years, and during that time have fought election contests as hard as have fallen to the lot of any man. WhilstI have met with interruptions at public meetings, however, I have never yet been subjected to interruptions to which I could take exception to the extent of appealing to the law. Colonel FOXTON -Could the honourable member's opponents say the same? prepared to say, but my experience is that candidates themselves are largely responsible for interruptions at their meetings. some candidates sometimes speak so egotistically and present statements so wide of the actual facts that self-respecting people who like to hear matters fairly stated from the public platform allow their feelings of resentment to find expression in a manner which constitutes an interruption. In such cases it is not the audience, but the speaker who causes the interruption. fore I had uttered a word, my meeting was taken from me, the platform was rushed, and I was put outside. no such experience. Many interruptions at election meetings are in the nature of questions designed to elicit information or else they are denials of statements made by the candidate. would not come under -the proposed new clause* constitute an interruption of a public meeting.

Very often interruptions at a public meeting are nol the outcome of a preconcerted movement. In many cases the promoter of such interruptions is not actually present. A man who desires tb have a meeting broken up may gather a few men together in a neighbouring publichouse, ply them with liquor until they become muddled, and then send them off to the meeting, with the result that interruptions take place. Colonel FOXTON -That is the strongest possible argument in support of this proposed new clause. think it is. Under this provision the person actually responsible fbr such an interruption would not be punished. I am afraid that it will be put into operation in a very partial way.

The penalty is very mild, seeing that £ 5 is the maximum, and that even under the State law at present much milder disorder at a public meeting, which is a public place, is subject to a one or two larrikins or boys that he had penalty of £ 2 , or one month's imprisonment. The disorderly conduct under this clause must be with a view to preventing the transaction of business, but under the State law a few interjections at a public meeting, if they have a tendency to disturb the peace of the meeting, are punishable in the way I have stated. Under the South Australian Act, even the mild offence of a few insulting expressions taken place under that. book * public meeting. There was-it is, perhaps, jocularly said -a case in England under a similar provision. A man went to a theatre, and was the only member of the public who assembled there. the performance being carried out, as he had a perfect right to do, but after a time, when he disapproved of the company's method of acting, he began to hiss, and was put out for disturbing the audience. time the Attorney-General speaks he shows more plainly that there is no necessity for the clause, because ample provisions already exist in the State laws. Apparently the Government desire to create a new form of crime. They seem to regard this as a new chance of -stowing away objectionable electors who may vote the wrong way. I am sorry to have to oppose the honourable member for Darwin, who is generally on the right track, but he has addressed more meetings in more varied places than any other honourable member, and it is only in some little out of the way place in Tasmania that he has had trouble at a public meeting. Australia with Tucker's gang. has had only one or two cases of the kind. Disturbances of public meetings are becoming extremely rare, and an exaggerated idea of those that do happen is generally given by the press reports. I have had trouble at only one meeting in all my experience. That was in a little place near Moun* Gambier, and, curiously enough, among, farmers, as the honourable member for Darwin's experience was. One of the leaders of the anti-socialist party came to the door of the meeting pretty well drunk, and, with picked up, made a disturbance. As a general , rule any interruption that does occur at meetings is nothing more than is forgivable. Any man would sooner address a live meeting than a lot of men who are so apathetic or dead that he does not know how they feel. There has been a considerable improvement in the conduct of elections and behaviour at political meetings generally in recent years. There was a time when there was a good deal more noise and disturbance. The cases that occur to-day are so few that I appeal to the Government whether it is worthwhile any to embody in this Bill such a drastic provision. Any person who really obstructs can be dealt with under State laws. Why should we duplicate the law on the subject? I am astonished at the Attorney General being a party to it. It does not improve matters to have two or three He insisted upon laws doing the same thing, and the Attorney-General will agree that the more we secure uniformity of law the better. It is important that there should be no check upon those who want to put bond fide questions to candidates or raise a justifiable objection to inaccurate statements. In this chamber we are not allowed by the Standing Orders to interject, but there is hardlv a member who does not interject when some one makes a statement that he considers inaccurate, and he does it at the moment because he does not want the statement to go any further. Surely at public meetings electors have the right to do the same thing. Many disturb-",43,Honourable Members Hea R Hear

351,Mr Spence,"The honourable memberances are brought on by the candidate himself. I do not deny that there may have been organized obstruction at some meetings, and I have seen cases where there has been a chorus of singing, which is an effective way of preventing a speaker from being heard. We read of that being done in Melbourne recently in a great Church Assembly, where a speaker's voice was drowned by the singing of a hymn. It is not uncommon at Salvation Armv meetings to announce a hymn if the speaker is too longwinded. We are asked to create a new offence under the law, and interfere with tolerance and freedom in political meetings. Buti f it is justifiable to do that, surely the Government must go further and put a stop to Presbyterian Assemblies interfering with the free speech of any man who has the floor, by singing hymns or psalms. I should like to hear the Attorney-General on the point as to whether this clause is to apply to this Parliament, because we have experienced considerable interference with free speech here. The honourable member for Darwin must have had that in his mind, because I see that he originally proposed a penalty of six months' imprisonment. Under this provision a candidate would only have to provoke a few men to! create a little disturbance in order to have them run in, and the friendly justices of the peace on the bench would promptly give them a month's imprisonment, which would probably carry them beyond the date of the election, so that they could not vote. kind who have the courage to take risks in It is a new way to get into Parliament to "" g a o l "" all the fellows who are opposed to you. As the honourable member for Yarra has well put it, with the class of justices of the peace that we have, very little consideration will be given to a Labour elector if he interjects at an anti-Socialist meeting. He would be run in for the full term; in fact the justices of the peace would rejoice in their action and think they were doing a really good thing for the country. our men to break up their meetings any more than we want theirs to break up ours. be broken up. Cases of interference sufficient to complain about are so extremely rare that this great National Parliament would ' be making itself ridiculous by legislating for them, especially as they are already provided for under State Acts. I have not heard any honourable member tell of any great trouble that he has had at public meetings. There are cases of interruptions which one has to put up with for perhaps five minutes, but the trouble is all squared up afterwards, and frequently it is caused by some one with too much liquor on board. He has to be put out, but he is only one out of an audience, perhaps, ot five hundred or a thousand. He is often given drink to go to the meeting and disturb it, but this provision will not get at the man behind him. The Judges act on the well known principle of making the penalties more severe if there is an increase in any particular kind of crime, but in this case the disturbance of public meetings is a disappearing factor all over Australia, and, therefore, there is no need to provide for extra punishment. There are some candidates who cannot tolerate anything being said to them at all, but if they make wild and ridiculous statements at a meeting the . audience is not justified in standing such conduct. There are among the public a number of strong active politicians who vote intelligently, because they take a keen interest in politics, but if this clause is passed they -> will still go to meetings and refuse to allow candidates to make statements which they know to be untrue. They will challenge them there and then and take the risk of a month's imprisonment. It is men of thai, upholding the truth, that have made the world what it is to-day. Candidates have no right to be put behind ahedge where they cannot be challenged for statements that they make. Are we to make a law that will give them full freedom to mislead electors, and get into Parliament under . false pretences ? We ought to give the fullest liberty, not only to the speakers, but to the electors present at public meetings. In some cases people who attend political meetings go beyond the line of reasonable interruption, but such incidents are inevitable. Every man has not full self-control. Some men are more readily excited than others, and we must deal with men as we find them. Surely we are not going to say that a man who interjects on the spur of the moment at a public meeting shall be punished? We are supposed to be specially selected, because of our ability to legislate for Australia, and if we cannot keep within our Standing Orders relating to interjections",44,Honourable Members Hea R Hear

We are told that it will be necessary to prove wilful intent. Committee will agree, however, that it is dangerous to leave to magistrates the determination of mere matters of opinion. The justice meted out in such cases depends on whether or not there is any bias on the part of the adjudicating magistrates. It should not be left to a magistrate to determine whether or not disorderly conduct is wilful. question under the proposed newclause is to be determined by Justices of the Peace, and it is quite possible to conceive of some magistrates declaring that a man should be imprisoned for a month for daring to say ""Boo!"" at ja. political meeting. proposed new clause is altogether too vague, and there is no necessity for it. sorry that the Government have accepted it, and I sincerely hope that it will be rejected. ° [5-3J--It is interesting to observe 'the sweet simplicity of the honourable member for Darling, and the general concern manifested by honourable members opposite in regard to the proposed new clause is certainly very significant. The honourable member for Yarra spoke of a case in which a public meeting had been disturbed by university students, and the honourable member for Darwin intimated a few days ago that his chief reason for submitting this proposal was that meetings held, by him had been disturbed by rich ""boodleiers."" Disturbances by university students, rich ""boodleiers,"" or any one else ought not to be tolerated. This proposed new clause will be one of the best features of the Bill.

My proposal is absolutely in the interests of fair play. We do not desire that those .who make awkward interjections at public meetings shall become marked men, to be disfranchised. the protection which is being asked for. The Treasurer's pluck in addressing public meetings when the gold-fields trouble was on, when almost every man present was opposed to him, and almost ready to join in rioting, earned him admiration all over Australia. He did not ask for special protection then, nor try to place his opponents in gaol. in those days. passed through Parliament repressive measures such as that now proposed, but did not do so. He faced the electors, and explained the position to them as well as he could. He did not lose by it. I ask him to show now the pluck of his earlier days, and not surround himself with privileges of the kind proposed. He does not need this protection. ing of ourselves always. address public meetings must be in the same position, and liable to occasional heckling, but if they are able to interest their hearers, they can overcome any kind of obstruction, whether organized or not. I have known candidates who found it difficult to secure a liearing on the first attempt, by reason of organized obstruction, eventually obtain the attention of their audiences, and hold them spellbound. That has been done by men with whose political views I have not had any sympathy. If we are able to take the position of leaders of public thought, to which we aspire, we clo not need this protection: our ability to interest the public is suffithe Minister has overlooked, namely, the cient. I hope the proposal will be utterly scouted. [5.29] -Thos e who address political meetings are given a great deal of latitude, the law protecting them, to a great extent, in what they say. Much latitude is also given to those who attend such meetings. The Committee has resolved that persons who disturb public meetings shall be liable to a fine of £ 5 . We cannot go back on that decision, but it would be monstrous to make the alternative imprisonment for a month. now is to reduce it to a week, which is sufficient. I shall support the amendment. Politicians do not need one experienced in addressing public meetings of all kinds, I should support the amendment if I were influenced by the manner in which I think it will operate. In my judgement, no provision could do more to assist the Labour party than that now under discussion, not because it would protect them in the way intended by the mover, but because of the effect which must follow its application. If the amendment were put into force at an anti-Labour election meeting under ordinary circumstances, and one or two electors were sent to gaol, that, more than anything, would lead to the return of the Labour candidate. pass. favours legislation simply because it is advantageous to one side or the other. I take it we are here to legislate in conformity with the principles of British justice, free speech, and fair discussion. I hold that the people have a right to correct any public speaker, who is misleading them or misrepresenting the position,' and also the right to resent any insult, without being in danger of the police or gaol. Never in my public career have I countenanced any action against an opponent that I should myself object to; and one of my first injunctions at an election is that there shall be free speech on both sides. I have never had any trouble at meetings, beyond, of course, an interjection now and again; and my experience is that a public man, who goes on the platform to speak the truth fearlessly, will not meet with anything like organized opposition. But in the amendment I see a danger that, probably, possibility of unscrupulous underground engineers, such as I have met with during my thirty years in political warfare, paying one or two men to upset a public meeting with the express purpose of bringing this law into operation, and thereby throwing discredit on sections of the community who are perfecly innocent.

I am proud.to think that there is no necessity here for such an Act as we are told was passed by the British Legislature some twelve months ago. We have to remember that we have womanhood suffrage here, and that, therefore, we are in no danger of the methods, which I do not altogether agree with, resorted to by the suffragettes at Home. It appears to me that the action of these women, wiongly directed, is at the bottom of the British legislation referred to, and that there is some justification for it. by one of the New South Wales members that he has had blue metal thrown at him. at Booroowa, in New South Wales, where, years ago, just before the annual race meeting, certain people could be found gathering up little heaps of blue metal at the side of the racecourse for the use of those who "" dropped "" their money, occurred in Marrickville. it j and I have addressed many public meetings there, and have fought the hardest of fights against organized opposition, though not of the violent type. 1 never knew a place with which I have had so little fault to find on that score member for Lang informed me. such a provision as this had been in operation years ago, when the honourable member for Lang was a red-hot Socialist, he would have paid the penalty. Of course, that honourable member is now one of the oppressors, and not one of the oppressed, and is quite prepared to pass a law of tliis kind. However, as I sav, the common I anv, in my opinion, is sufficient to meet the position; and I am surprised that the honourable member for Darwin should submit this amendment, even in its watered down form. I always thought that the honourable member was a man of courage, who, in the face of all odds, would fight the battle of right; but this amendment almost indicates the white feather. It would seem as though the honourable member were afraid of the people; and when that is so, it is time a man left public life. I regret that the Minister has decided to accept the amendment; but I warn him that, if it be carried, it will return like a. boomerang against its supporters within the next twelve months. honourable member for Gwydir, as he says, believes in fair play, and in every one being heard, he ought to have no objection to the amendment, because only those who create a disturbance will be liable to prosecution. We who .believe in liberty of speech ought to adopt some such measure as that proposed. Personally, I have never had trouble, and do not anticipate any in the future; but, about three years ago, a meeting of Senate candidates in Launceston was disturbed during a .whole evenI have been told ing. For this the Labour party were blamed, by the press and others; but, as a matter of fact, it was not members of the Labour party, but a number of larrikins who were responsible. Whether larrikins belong to one side or the other, or are not electors at all, they should be punished for such conduct. Objection has been raised to the maximum penalty; but we know that the maximum provided is I am told that it seldom inflicted. Reflections have been cast on justices of the peace; but I can say that, in Tasmania, there are a large number who devote a great deal of time to their duiKes, without ;any remuneration, and with very little thanks. I believe that they always do justice; and I have never heard them accused of acting unfairly, either to the working man have halos, if we took ourselves at our own estimate. It is necessary, in the public interest, to maintain order at public meetings; and I further suggest that it would not be amiss if we maintained a little better order amongst ourselves in this House. It is scarcely creditable to hear one section of the House calling another "" garrotters,"" and raising accusations of political corruption; and, perhaps, it would be well to have a penalty for the use of such language. Surely we can have differences of opinion without branding each other with such names, which would not be tolerated in the streets or anywhere outside Parliament. I hope that the amendment will be carried, ancl thus insure that liberty of speech which is the boast of all Britishers. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [5.44] This clause ought to be branded as denoting the decadence of Australian politicians.

They desire, not -only to stifle the people's representatives inside this House, in order to prevent -criticism of themselves and their actions, but also to stifle the criticism of themselves by the public outside.

When politics are getting hot, and there is strong feeling, is not the time when there is calmness of mind among candidates arid their supporters', and it would be easy in such circumstances to magnify an unpremeditated interruption into some kind of organized opposition.

That is just what we shall have again. The honourable member for 'Calare knows the district that I am talking about. member ever know that to occur? Mr T. H . CATTS I know it as a positive fact. Honourable members opbers opposite are the wealthy ones. posite talk about the obstruction and interruption which they have experienced much wealth in the whole Labour movement at public meetings, but I have had as much of it of all kinds as any He is certainly man in the House. Are we going to be like a lot of grammar school girls, or namby-pamby individuals, afraid to meet men in open public meetings, and discuss politics with them? It seems to me to be proposed to reduce political discussion to an absolute farce. The proposal is a restriction of public discussion, and nothing has been put forward to justify it. Fancy a candidate addressing an audience consisting of 1,000 people like the honourable member for Wakefield, with his extreme excitability ! He stood up this afternoon, and in a few moments worked himself into a state of excitement which showed that if 1,000 men of his type were at a public meeting they would be altogether uncontrollable, and under this clause .would Whilst only certain render themselves liable to fine and imprisonment. As much offence can be created by a person speaking against the audience as by the audience against the speaker. Very often that is the way in which trouble begins. A man has an obnoxious method of addressing a meeting, or a vindictive personal way of replying to innocent criticism and interjection, and so brings down upon himself the wrath of the audience, causing them, perhaps, to break out in disturbance. There are some public men, or those who have attempted to become public men, who by their insulting methods would sting almost any audience into open revolt. Yet under this clause the law would step in and proinnocent persons whom he had provoked. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh says, the present Minister of Defence can scarcely rise in this House without I have exciting the strongest feeling of resentment in the breasts of his opponents, and one could easily understand a. gentleman of his type rousing an audience at a public meeting into the greatest hostility. viction in those circumstances. Mr J. H . CATTS -Oh, no, but who is going to fight it?

We are degrading ourselves as public men' by admitting for a moment that it is necessary for us to protect ourselves from the public of Australia in meeting assembled. ficient protection is offered under the present law. If all those diabolical atrocities are perpetrated which we have heard complained about to-day by honourable members opposite, surely the common law and the police of the States will protect them? But we know that it is not so. In no State in the Commonwealth is rioting allowed in the public streets, and there is no public meeting held anywhere at which the police are not present to see that order is maintained. If this clause were to apply only to halls hired by public men, the same objection could not be taken to it, because a man can do what he likes with a hall when he hires it. But it should not be applied to all sorts of public meetings. A politician might stand up in a busy thoroughfare and begin to abuse an innocent and unoffending crowd. turned round and retaliated on the man who intruded upon their peace and harmony, the law would step in and brand them as criminals, f t would be very convenient to many candidates to have a person who has some influence with his fellow men in a district put into gaol for a month, or until the election was over. able member do it? Mr J. H . CATTS -If he went to a public meeting and made some kind of interjection, the candidate might proceed against him. I have seen numbers of Conservative candidates who would magnify interjections into organized interruption. It is easy, in the heat of a political contest, for people to have exaggerated ideas, and on evidence of that kind a man might be convicted of a criminal offence. If this is a good proposal, why not offer the same protection to public meetings all the year round? The clause is only to apply after the issue of the writs, when the excitement begins, and when people are more likely to fall into unpremeditated interruptions than deliberately and coolly to organize opposition. Now that honourable members opposite have secured a provision in the law to include halls in their election expenses, why. He could spend more cannot they hire halls and have admission, by ticket, so that they may have audiences only of their own particular friends? The proposal not only shows a decadence in the politicians of Australia, but it is also most objectionable legislation, which will be exercised at a time when there may be exaggerated ideas of what really are ofQuite suffences. The honourable member for Darwin spoke the other day of the decadence of the British race, but he has now gone to the other extreme. He wants to have the kid gloves on, and to talk to an audience from behind barricades. This is simply a barricade put up between the candidate and the public. We are asked to let the candidate talk with his head over the fence, and a wall all round him to protect him. Honourable members opposite say, "" Save usfrom the public."" It is not only branding the public of Australia in a way in which they should not be branded, but it is an admission of incompetence on the. nart of public men to conduct public meetings, and of a lack of self-reliance on their own abilities to face their fellow men. It is a Conservative, reactionary, proposal, such as we might expect from the party now in Then, because they power, and is perfectly consistent vvith the coercive methods which the Government have adopted in passing legislation without allowing a reasonable discussion of it. I am sorry to think that if such a clause is carried it will be on the initiation of the honourable member for D a r w u iI have an idea that this proposed new clause must have been suggested to the honourable member by some one on the Government side of the House; that in an unsuspecting moment he succumbed to the blandishments of the other side and became its author. It will be very convenient for the Government who wish to pass such legislation to be able to say, "" It was proposed by a member of the Labour party, and we accepted it . "" Lang has already made that statement. Mr J. H . CATTS I am not surprised that he has done so. The Government and those behind them desire legislation to protect them from the criticism of their opponents in Parliament, and another class of legislation to save them from the criticism of the public when they go before the electors.

Returning officers from all parts of Australia have to be called together in the several States by the Chief Electoral officer and instructed in the rules and procedure that will have to be drawn up under this Bill as an amendment of the principal Act.

What should be done with a man who, at a meeting attended by 300 or 400 men, women and children, raises the cry of "" fire""?

The maintenance of free speech is the hope of the Labour party, because our opponents have the great daily newspapers with them, whereas we have not. Large property-owners do not as a rule attend public meetings; they are convinced not the that their mission is to go forth to vote for their property. Consequently the Labour party will be the chief gainers'from the passing of a provision to secure good order at political meetings, where the other side can be converted. We desire to induce our opponents to attend our meetings, and to be able to send them home converts to the cause of Labour. We cannot do that if they fear that they will be broken up by gangs pf hoodlums when attending our meetings. The honourable member for Bass has referred to a great meeting in a town in Tasmania which was broken up by a gang of larrikins, with the result that we could not preach the gospel of labour to the people, although we had paid for the hall and had a magnificent attendance. I desire that this proposed new clause shall be passed for the protection of the people themselves. I do not think that there is any decadence on the part of politicians. A politician is never so great as when he is a fighting man. John Bull wants a fight and an umpire. I desire to have the law as the umpire in my case, for I know that I shall then have a fair fight.

Home Affairs) T ?]--It is rather diffi8 1 cult to deal with amendments on short notice, but I would point out that the term "" approaches"" is a very wide one. For instance, the Athenaeum Hall, which is the principal, polling booth for the division of Melbourne, abuts on Collins-street, and the whole of iCollins-street might be described as ah approach to it. It seems to me that to legislate in this way would be to interfere with the State rights of people with regard to the use of public thoroughfares. I would remind the Committee that when the Bill of 1905 was under consideration it was proposed that the approaches to polling booths, for a distance of 50 yards, should be kept clear, but that proposition was rejected. It might be said that the running of a tram-car along Collins-street constituted an obstruction to the Athenaeum Hall when used as a polling place. I hope that the Committee will not accept the amendment. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [8.19] I am glad that the Minister has taken up this attitude, and trust that he will adopt it in regard to all other proposed new clauses. Honourable members on this side of the Committee have constantly appealed, to the Minister to stand by the Bill as introduced. for Darwin was successful in securing the insertion of a new clause.

We have jurisdiction inside a polling booth under the principal Act, but surely it will not be contended that we have jurisdiction in respect of the "" vicinity "" of a polling booth, or that we can order a street on which a polling booth abuts to be cleared. This is a ridiculous and unnecessary proposal. As a matter of fact the Act provides that the entrances to polling booths shall be kept free from obstruction, and we know that the authorities carry out the law in that regard. To propose that the Commonwealth authorities shall practically follow a crowd in a street, in the vicinity of a polling booth, or at the approaches thereto-what ever those indefinable terms may.mean-is to propose to carry the law to a farcical extent.

524,Mr Richard Foster (Wakefield),"Darling has suggested is part of the law of South Australia, which prohibits persons from congregating on polling day within fifty yards of the approaches of a polling-booth. This provision has been applied to the conduct of Federal as well as to the conduct of State elections, and its advantages have been highly appreciated. Its enforcement does not necessitate any interruption of traffic. In the city persons may pass up and down in front of a polling booth in the ordinary course of business, but they are not allowed to congregate within 50 yards of it. The Department could, I think, give effect to this reform by regulation. I do not know what objection there can be to the adoption of a practice which has resulted in a distinct improvement in the conduct of elections. There has been no interference with the rights of municipal authorities. that the amendment will not be adopted. Every polling place in my electorate comes up to the street frontage, the main door opening upon the footpath. It would be impossible to keep a clear space within fifty yards of these polling booths. As the honourable member for Darling has pointed out, what may suit a small town where the polling booth is in a courthouse, situated within an enclosure, would not suit a large city. The Athenaeum, in Collins-street, is a polling booth. Persons could not be prevented from congregating within fifty yards of it, because there are places of business quite near to it. allow persons to loiter in the vicinity of a polling booth. happened in the Lang division in the past, but I hope that something different, politically speaking, will happen at the next election. The Minister has done the right thing in refusing to accept the amendment, but will he carry his colleagues with him? Probably, as it will not mean the loss of a seat to a member of the Ministerial party, they will be solid on this occasion, and allow the Department administering the Electoral Act to make the necessary provisions for the proper conduct of elections. seems to me that if we agree to this proposal the ordinary elector may hi afraid to. approach a polling booth lest he should get into trouble, though, as a matter of fact, Australians are as well behaved as any set of people in the world. Most of those who vote are quite content to go to the booths, mark their ballot papers, and go away again. The more regulations we make for the conduct of elections the more likely is it that the law will be broken. In discussing all these proposals for the amendment of the existing Act we are wasting very valuable time, which we shall need badly later on. should have preferred to move an amendment of the provision in the original Act, but as I could not do that, I have moved the insertion of a new section. I think, however, that it would be better to leave out the words "" and approaches thereto."" ""vicinity"" of a polling booth? dinarily understood, which it is unnecessary to define. I have been specially asked by a number of ladies, including several from the Cook electorate, to bring forward a proposal of this kind. Tkey complain that they were unable to record their votes at the last election because the "" pushes "" congregated at the approach of the polling booth made it impossible for them to enter. They did not wish to go to the honourable member who represented the electorate, because they thought that he would not understand them, or would not secure the reform which they need; and, therefore, came to me. With the permission of the Committee, I shall amend the. proposal by leaving out the words I have mentioned. provision perfect, and, therefore, I intend to move that each female elector shall be accompanied to the polling booth by two members of the Young Men's Christian Association, and each male by two members of the Women's Christian Association. If we are going to make a farce of the law, let us do so completely. If this legislation cannot be seriously discussed, let us at least provide amusement in connection with it. not know why the honourable member for Lang has moved the proposed new clause.

The honourable member for Lang says that certain ladies have been unable to get through a crowd. Evidently in that case the police were not doing their duty by keeping the street clear. My experience is that if ladies wish to vote they can get through a crowd as well as men can. At shows, auction sales, and other places of the kind, ladies are as well able to fight their way as men. have not been able to record their votes because of the crowd round a polling booth is a reflection on the men of Australia.

The aboli-tion of the deposit was one of the big reforms put before the electors in the early nineties as the result of the movement which brought the Labour party actively into politics. no deposit has been required in that State. Consequently, in the first Federal election, conducted under State management, a deposit was not necessary. I am not aware that any strong reasons have been discovered that would lead the New South Wales Parliament to go back to the obnoxious monetary qualification as a condition of nomination. There have been instances of men nominating who polled only a small number of votes, but that is no justification for imposing this penalty. It does not always follow, because a man polls a small number of votes, that he is incompetent or even unacceptable. In New South Wales one candidate for a city constituency received a very small vote, and if a deposit had been required he would have forfeited it, but he was then a young and untried man, and that was his first experience. tion, was returned after a hot contest, and has remained the very popular representative of the constituency for a number of years. His rejection in the first case was the outcome of the peculiar conditions that obtained at the time, and did not at all prove that he was undesirable or incompetent. I opposed the monetary qualification when originally introduced in the New South .Wales Parliament, and have opposed it ever since. I oppose it now in regard to the Commonwealth Parliament. is gained by it. It is an embargo that operates harshly in the case of poor, but deserving, men. The question of whether such an embargo should be placed upon them may well be left to the electors. One of the reasons urged for its existence is that in its absence contests which would not otherwise take place occur, and that both the Government and the retiring member are put to unnecessary expense. That may have happened in the past, but there is no likelihood of its recurrence. At every election a well-defined issue is put before the electors, and wherever there is a division of opinion there is sure to be a contest. The embargo is undemocratic, Mr Thomas Brown. inasmuch as it does not recognise the principle of adult suffrage. It attaches to that principle a qualification sufficient to make it difficult for a very poor man to nominate. It is for that reason, and because I believe a deposit to be undemocratic, and that it would be a blot on the Commonwealth electoral law, that 1 support the proposed new clause. It succeeded, and ever since then [9.18] -This is a somewhat academic discussion, but I do not think that time will be wasted by devoting a few minutes to the consideration of the question. The principle of one man one vote and of one vote one value will not be complete until all men have an opportunity to offer themselves as candidates for the Federal Parliament. I shall not, however, vote in favour of the abolition of the provision that a candidate shall lodge a deposit of £ 2 5 , because I know that bogus candidates are sometimes put up for no other purpose than to cause a contested election. In many cases the Government are thus put to unnecessary expense. I can see coming, however, a time when we shall have proportional voting, and with such a system in force there could be no longer any reason for requiring a candidate to lodge a deposit of £ 2 $ . I agree with the Minister, that at present the embargo He stood again at the next elecought not to be removed. If it were, a man having no chance of election might be nominated, and his nomination might lead to the return of a candidate representing only a minority of the electors. Cases have occurred in which bogus candidates have secured more votes than it was thought they would obtain. The honourable member for Calare has referred to the nomination of a gentleman who proved that he had more in him than was imagined. That is by no means an unNothing common experience. It is not uncommon for a man to prove after his nomination that he has a good platform style and other qualifications. The instincts of a public man mav be so strongly imbued in him that he will be accepted by the electors, and may ultimately climb to the top of the tree. Such cases have occurred in Europe and in the Australian States. This discussion will show that we have not lost sight of the fact that every man should have eciual' rights and opportunities. There are times: when even a member of Parliament mav find it difficult to put up a deposit of £25. .The life of a public man is very expensive, and unless he has independent means is a great drain upon his resources -",63,Pairs

I could induce 200 men to sign a nomination paper for no other reason than that they were asked to do so. There are many men who would be prepared to sign any nomination paper in order to get rid of their interviewer. I believe that all men should have equal' opportunities, but until we have proportional voting I do not think that this embargo ought to be removed. shall vote to abolish the money test. Some of my friends have had a bitter experience of losing their deposits in circumstances absolutely unjust. The requiremert that a candidate for election to this Parliament shall put up a deposit of £ 2 5 is a remnant of the absurd and barbarous system of conducting elections that is in existence in England to-day. There a man cannot vote because he is a human being. He obtains the right to vote only by the direct or indirect ownership of property. Even now, a candidate there must be prepared to put down a large money deposit. In C/titty's Statutes, vol. 8, page 246, there is a statement showing that this system is a lineal descendant of the absurd and antiquated -system of conducting elections in the Old Country. The statement is as follows(1) In a borough the expenses mentioned above in parts i . , i i . , and i i i . , of this schedule, other than personal expenses (g) and sums paid to the returning officer for his charges (A) shall not exceed in the whole the maximum amount in the scale following :If the number of electors ou the registei does not exceed 2,000, the maximum amount shall be ^350. Exceeds 2,000, ^380, and an additional ^30 for every complete 1,000 electors above 2,000. Provided that in Ireland if the number of electors on the register does not exceed 500 the maximum amount shall be ^200. Exceeds 500, but does not exceed 1,000, £ S°2 Exceeds 1,000, but does not exceed 1,500, £ 7S2 (2) In a county the expenses mentioned above in parts i . , i i . , and i i i. of this schedule, other than personal expenses and sums paid to the returning officer for his charges, shall not exceed in the whole the maximum amount in the scale following :If the number of electors on the register does not exceed 2,000, the maximum amount shall be £650 in England and Scotland, and .£500 in Ireland. Exceeds 2,000, ^710 in England and Scotland, and £340 in Ireland; and an additional j£6o in England and Scotland, and £40 in Ireland, for every complete 1,000 electors above 2,000. A poor man might have the combined ability of a Disraeli and a Gladstone, yet he could not hope to contest an election in Great Britain in such circumstances. In Victoria a candidate for the Victorian Legislative Assembly has to provide a deposit of £ 5 0 , while a« candidate for the Federal Parliament has to lodge a deposit of £ 2 5 . The alternative suggestion that where a candidate for the House of Representatives is able to get his nomination paper signed by 200 electors, and that where a candidate for a Senate has his nomination paper signed'by 1,000 electors, no deposit shall be necessary, is a good one. Such a provision would be an improvement Upon that requiring a money deposit to be lodged. We ought to permit a citizen of Australia, privileged by right of his manhood to vote, to say to his fellow citizens, "" These are my views. If you believe in them, then I ask you to return me to Parliament to fight for legislation to give effect to .them."" I was assured by a member of the House of Commons that although he was privileged to be elected without a contest he had to pay an English officer £ 2 5 to declare that he was duly elected.. The late James Munro told me that when in England he was given an opportunity to contest an election for a seat in the House of Commons,, with the support of the great Liberal party, but that he found that the expenses would run into four figures. What we need to eliminate from our Australian Democracy is the power of property to control and manipulate our electoral system. The adoption of the suggestion made by the honourable member who has moved this proposed new clause would be preferable to the existing system. The only objection to it that needs to be combated is the contention that it might not suit some business people to attach their signatures to a nomination paper. The requirement that a nomination paper shall be signed by at least 200 electors would not be so harsh in connection with our large Commonwealth constituencies as it would be in the case of a State constituency, containing only a few hundred voters.

No candidate for the Parliament of any one of the twenty-two cantons of the Swiss Confederation, or for the Federal Parliament of that country, which the economic writers of the world call "" the school-house of Europe,"" is required to pay a deposit. However, if the Minister has made up his mind, no argument of mine, or of any other honourable member,-will change his attitude. But though we fail to-night, we shall try again. glad that the Minister refuses to adopt this amendment. pear that by the existing Act a serious disability is put upon certain individuals, who, but for the statutory requirement that a candidate for election to this House shall lodge a deposit of £ 2 5 , would offer themselves for election. there is. from the honourable member. enced such a disability in times gone 'by. nexion with a Federal election every man is a bogus candidate who has not behind him a considerable section of the community. considerable section of the community would not experience the least difficulty in inducing that section to back him -to the extent of £ 52 tunate expression. poor he may be, shows ability and qualifications for representing his fellow citizens in Parliament, he will have a considerable following in this country. To say that those who admire such a man will not be prepared to put down the sum of £ 2 5 to enable him to be nominated is ridiculous. It is unfortunate that members should pose before the public over a matter of this sort. To require a deposit is not to place anv candidate under a disability, but it will keep out of the field men who have no prospect of being returned. surprised to hear the honourable member for Echuca say that the £ 2 5 deposit prevents persons who have no chance from being nominated, because there are numerous cases in which deposits have been forfeited. In some of these cases the loss of the money is nothing to those concerned. Many persons are willing to risk £ 2 5 on the chance of getting into Parliament, or do so because they are misled or mis-read the public. Such persons are hardly fitted for political life. At the same time there are candidates who enter for an election not expecting to be returned. Candidates on the Labour side sometimes do that with a view to the future. A deposit of £ 5 0 would not prevent the nomination of persons who had no chance at all. Our object should be to give the electors the widest choice, and to prevent any bar being raised against the return of a It is sought to make it apcapable man.

The suggestion I have made may be more properly worded; but I put it forward as an alternative, so that in the event of the Surveyor-General not being able to act, an officer occupying a similar position in the same State, or in another State where there is not a Surveyor-General, may be one of the Commissioners. It is very desirable that these re-distributions shall be carried out in such a .way as to earn the confidence of Parliament and the public; and, in view of the small extra cost involved, I am prepared to accept the proposed new clause with the amendment I have suggested. to accept the suggested amendment. always objected to Boards, and because the duties of the Commissioner are clearly set down in the Act. He has to consider of communication, physical features, and existing boundaries and divisions; and that is quite sufficient to enable a single Commissioner to discover what is required. My experience is that where the reports of Boards of three or more are not satisfactory, we are unable to sheet home the blame. Buti f one Commissioner whose duties are clearly defined departs from them, it is a simple matter to get another Commissioner who will do the work properly. I object to the multiplication of positions. Every Bill brought before the House now seems to aim at the creation of fresh positions. The taxpayers* are suffering enough at present, and"" are getting about tired of it. The Minister has not shown in what way we are likely to get a better report from three Commissioners than from one. I do net believe that three could have done the work recently before us a whit better than it was done by the Western Australian Commissioner, to whose report the Minister stated no valid objection. A mere general statement that there will be more confidence in the work of three is of no value. It would give me no more confidence. I shall oppose the amendment. -Strong reasons ought to be advanced before the Committee are asked to make the radical change proposed. The first division in. the State of New South Wales was made by three Commissioners. Under the Federal Act there has been one Commissioner, and it is only fair to assume that State experience. I see no advantage in having three, and the Minister's arguments are not convincing. The fact that the report of a certain Commissioner was rejected the other day has no bearing on the question. rejected twice out of three times.",67,Pairs

The only way to get over that difficulty is to take the matter entirely but of the hands of Parliament. ber prepared to do that? I am in favour of it. pared to consider it, but this proposal would not bring it about. It will simply substitute three Commissioners for one, still leaving the final decision to Parliament. Under the present arrangement, one Commissioner fits the bill, and Parliament is the final judge. This proposal will simply add cost to the Department, without adding efficiency to it, and for that reason I shall oppose it. not see why it should be proposed to substitute three Commissioners for one. In Victoria we started with three Public Service Commissioners, and got down to one. At one time we had three Railway Commissioners, and afterwards had one, although we have since reverted to three. We have also only one Public Service Commissioner for the Commonwealth. It is proposed that two shall form a quorum, and that the Chairman shall give a casting vote in the event of a tie, so that in the end the work of the three may devolve upon and be carried out by one. I agree with the honourable member for Calare that the mere fact of a scheme being drawn up by three Commissioners instead of one would not prevent it being discarded by a majority of the Housei f they thought fit. If a scheme distasteful to a strong majority in the House were drawn up by any number of Commissioners, it would be rejected. The proposal means an unnecessary increase of expense, and will bring about no better results. Even if three Commissioners are appointed, the work of drafting the report will probably be left to one, and whether it was checked to any extent would depend entirely upon the amount of trouble which the other two devoted to it. The proposal will not give any greater finality to the report, or secure its acceptance by the House more readily, than in the case of one Commissioner, while it will treble the expense. [TO. 10] I take it that the amendment has been approved by the Minister, and that he has looked into the matter, and recommends that three Commissioners shall be appointed. In that case I shall support it. Home Affairs) [ro.11] -The amendment of the amendment which I now suggest would make it read as follows: The Governor General may appoint three persons in each State to be Commissioners, one of whom if his services are obtainable shall be the Surveyor-General or an officer of his Department or an officer having similar qualifications. Amendment amended accordingly. does not seem that we shall get much out of the proposal, or that it matters a great deal one way or the other. sand pounds. quarrel with the expenditure of £1,000 by this great, rich Commonwealth, but we are justified in seeing whether we are to get value for it, or whether it is necessary. Where one Commissioner is appointed, the best man with the greatest knowledge is selected, and he obtains the opinions and views of all and sundry before he finally decides. Three Commissioners would get no more information. If there is a division of opinion among the three, one man settles the question, and if there is no difference of opinion among them, it shows that any one of the three would have arrived at the same conclusion. If we had seven Commissioners, very much the same results would be obtained. I do not deny that, in a generay way, there may be more confidence in the report of three men, but when that feeling is analyzed, I do not think there is much ground for it. When the report comes before the House, the members for the particular State, who have a general knowledge of that State and its interests, use their judgment, and the House is largely guided by their advice. We have already provided for a month's criticism of the Commissioner's report by the whole of the public. There are many organizations whose business it is to watch . political affairs, and the Commissioner has the advantage of their suggestions. Just as honourable members have the advantage of the opinions of their constituents, and of organizations within their electorates as to suggested alterations of electoral boundaries, so the Commissioner is able to obtain such opinions when maps indicating the proposed alterations are exhibited.

In Sydney there are published a morning newspaper having a daily circulation of over 100,000; another daily, with a circulation Whilst such an officer might nearly as large, and two evening newspapers. In Melbourne we have the Age, with a daily circulation of over 110,000possibly the largest circulation of any daily newspaper in Australia-and the Argus, which has also a very large circulation. No one knows who writes the articles appearing in those newspapers. Many articles-article s which sting and are written unfairly-ar e published. They are written by men who are really engaged in sniping, and if their names were attached to every article they wrote, those whom they criticised would be able to face them and to fight them fairly.

Time «nd again members have been maligned, as they would not have been had those who libelled them been required to sign their articles.

Those who are attacked ought to know who are attacking them. Would any honourable member consider that he acted honorably if he attacked another under a -nom de plume?

If a man were known to write in the leading columns of the daily press constantly, and the literary merits of his work were recognised, he would build himself up a reputation, and our newspapers would be multiplied as happens in France, where men of means support such writers. In this way many writers would have more power than they have now. could do more damage than he does now. ber is welcome to his little joke. I object to pens that can sting and stab while no one knows who wields them. The Argus once had high ideals, so far as Free Trade was concerned, and I wish the Age well because it was the creator of the Protective policy in Victoria. But primarily all newspapers are run to make profits, and their proprietors regard chiefly the advertisement columns. I shall press my proposal to a division, preferring to stand alone when I know that I am in the right, to being with the big battalions and in the wrong.

The High Court, in the case of D'Emden v. Pedder, decided that, if there is a doubt as to the scope of our powers, there is always a presumption that our legislation is intended to be within those powers; that is, if it bears two constructions-on e that a provision is within our powers, and the other that it is not-the construction will into the light, and their character made be to keep it within our powers. Therefore I think that it would be held that we do not intend to go beyond our powers; but the question is whether we have this power, and I do not believe that we have. do not think that the matter altogether falls witliin the province of the States. We are now dealing, not with policy, but with electoral machinery; and I question whether Parliament has power to say that an expression of opinion shall not be published unless it bears the signature of the writer. I do not think that such a provision is incimatter of fact, I owe the press a debt dental, to electoral matters. the candidate who is affected. machinery, which has nothing' to do with political parties. define what a political article is? attempt that. My belief is that such a clause would he beid to be outside our powers, as incidental to this legislation. At the same time, I recognise that there is much in what the honourable member has drawn attention to; and, assuming that we have the power, we might be called upon to enerdse it. The suggestion contained in the amendment has been adopted by some of the leading journals in England, notably some of the reviews, although, at one time, anonymity of the writers was supposed to be sacred. after the word "" newspaper,"" the words "" pertaining to a Federal election."" Proposed new clause amended accordingly. am rather surprised at the indefinite way in which thc Attorney-General has given' his advice to the honourable member for Melbourne. In my opinion, the Government have lost a great opportunity to allay the suspicion that they are working hand in glove with the metropolitan newspapers. Had the Government a desire to "" score,"" they would have taken the opportunity to dispel any idea that they were sheltering behind the anonymity of the press. We know that the members of the press, like other persons, do just what the law allows, and the law allows them to abuse members of Parliament at election time. If those irresponsible writers could be drawn known, the effect would be that the men whom they oppose would be returned. But writers of this kind shoot from behind the hedge, and I am sure that in such I circumstances there is no one here who* would refuse to protect his fellow member. I thought the Attorney-General would have taken more trouble to assist the honourable member for Melbourne. Personally I have nothing to complain of, seeing that I owe my position here to the fact that the press continually abuse me. As a of gratitude; but there are other men who do not fare so well, and I should like to afford them protection. Since the Attorney-General, who is one of our constitutional luminaries, fails to find a way out of the difficulty, and the Minister of Home Affairs does not think it wise to interfere with the law just before an election, I am prepared to stand another contest under the fire of the press.",71,Pairs

Some independent tribunal must be appointed to prevent the gerrymandering that takes place on nearly every occasion when re-distribution schemes are placed before us, but I do not think that the body of Commissioners accepted by the Minister is the sort of tribunal that ought to be superior to Parliament. I therefore cannot support the proposal of the honourable member for Calare, even after the disgraceful exhibition of yesterday. orable member must withdraw that statement.

Perhaps the Minister will accept my proposal without discussion. cept it. cils, mechanics' institute committees, and other public bodies have varying rates for the use of their halls, and differentiate between ordinary public and election meetings. In some cases they charge, say, 5s. for the use of their hall for an ordinary public meeting and £ 2 for its use for an election meeting. It is scandalous that this extortion should be practised upon a candidate for election to this Parliament. Then, again, newspaper proprietors who ordinarily charge 3s. per inch for' an advertisement, increase that charge from 25 per cent, to roo per cent, in respect of electoral advertisements.

Another point is that it is difficult to say who could determine what is the usual charge for a hall. I do not think that the proposed new clause would be workable. am not enamoured of this proposition, but do not think' it more extraordinary than some which the Ministry have, accepted. The new clause penalizing any one who interjects at an election meeting was quite as undesirable as this is. I agree with the Minister that tbe discussion. seems to indicate that every candidate for the suffrages of the people ought, in the opinion of some honourable members, to have a dry nurse with him to look after him.

The whole situation is becoming ridiculous. I shall certainly 'oppose the proposed new clause.

We often find that anti-Socialists believe in anti-Socialism for everybody else and in There is no doubt a tenSocialism for themselves. This is a case in point, and the honourable member for Corio, who professes to believe in anti-Socialism, wants a little Socialism of a particularly objectionable kind for himself. We all know that there is a scale I hope the Government will not accept the amendment. Minister has raised an important Constitutional objection to the amendment, it is necessary that I should consult authorities on the subject. Perhaps the honourable gentleman will agree to report progress in order that I may have an opportunity to do so? I object to the statement -of the honourable member for Wide Bay that honourable members on fhis side are being dry nursed, and in reply state that honourable members on the other side were brought up on the bottle. I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. I object to the withdrawal of the amendment. The honourable member for Corio seeks to prevent the owners of halls from making an extra charge for their use for political meetings. I shall vote for the amendment. The difficulty is one which does not affect me very much, because unfortunately there is only one large hall in my district-the Melbourne Town Hall. As I have never had enough money to take that hall for a political meeting, I am not very well acquainted with the charges made for it, but I am informed that the charge for the use of that hall for one night is £ 1 5 , and that a guarantee to the extent of £ 1 0 is demanded to provide against damage. I know of no moral or other reason justifying municipal and other local authorities charging more for the use of their halls for political than for other public meetings. The school rooms are not under oui control, but the Federal Government have control of the drill halls throughout Australia,'and they might agree to let candidates have the use of them at a minimum charge or for one night free. I was given the use of a drill hall on one occasion, but was afterwards refused it, and could not move the powers that be. I think the honourable member for Corio would be prepared to accept a proposal that drill halls should be given free for one night to each candidate at an election.",74,Pairs

Mr J. H .

Again, elections do not occur every three months, and the owners of halls have a right to expect slightly increased rents from candidates during the election season. Honourable members are aware that the keepers of boarding-houses at tourist resorts expect to get a little more from tourists than from local residents. If honbeen printed. How can this Parliament orable members do not care to pay the rent asked for halls they can address the electors in the open air. I agree with the Minister that candidates for Parliament must be a very simple people if they require legislative protection against public criticism, and that we should under the electoral law of the Commonwealth finance their election contests in the way now proposed. This is making our proceedings farcical. agree with the honourable member for Cook. I intend to support the amendment. had experience of one district in the country where the charges made for halls were higher for meetings held by the Labour party than for meetings held by any other political party. I believe that the charge should be the same for all political parties, and for all kinds of meetings, with the exception perhaps of meetings held for charitable purposes. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Melbourne is one which the Minister of Defence might take into consideration. I think that drill halls might very well be placed at the disposal of candidates for Parliament. drill halls. that. Drill halls are usually very large, and the cost of providing seats would perhaps amount to the charge which would be made for the use of an ordinary hall, l t would be possible to get a larger number into a drill hall than into any other public building. In one division the Electoral Department has decided to use a drill hall for a polling-booth, because it is the I shall vote for the amendment, because I do not think that any person should charge more for the hire of a building for a political than for any other meeting, or differentiate in the manner which is objected to. listened to the amendment with some degree "" f consternation. The honourable member for Corio strongly avers his intention to obtain free for candidates for election to the Federal Parliament halls subsidized by a State. piovision. drafted by the honourable member, and has enact that halls subsidized by the State shall be used in that way? It is surprising that we have not had a little homily from the Attorney-General to the effect that such a provision would be unconstitutional, and would make us a laughing stock. Furthermore, how can we say to any individual that it shall .be an offence under the Electoral law to charge £ 1 is. for services on polling day when he usually charges only half a guinea. It seems to me monstrous that persons should not be nermitted to charge extra if they like. I cil charges more for the use of its hall for a political meeting than for an ordinary meeting.
