This bill provides for parliamentary' approval of a new Sugar Agreement, which is to operate up to and including the year 3935-36, and for an embargo against the importation of foreign sugar except with the consent of the Minister. I know that there has been a good deal of vacillation in regard to the sugar policy, and that the Government is faced with many difficulties in trying to placate all its supporters.

He informed them that he had been connected with one of the great founders of federation; that he was junior partner in the firm controlled by the late 0. C. Kingston. He had, he said, the interests of Australia at heart, but there were indications of a gloomy future for the sugar industry. embargo might be withdrawn, and the agreement was in danger if the growers did not voluntarily consent to a reduction in the price of sugar. In Brisbane the honourable senator said that there would have to be an all round reduction in wages and costs in the sugar industry. He emphasized the absolute need for a substantial reduction in wages, and compared the wages paid in the seasonal sugar industry i u tropical Queensland with those paid in the temperate southern States. He said that cane cutting was mere child's play. In the middle of winter, when fires were needed to keep one warm, it might seem that cane cutting was child's play, but we have to remember that the cane cutters work in the middle of a tropical summer, and they have to be athletes to work with bent backs in the cane-fields under the tropical sun from early morning u n t i l nightfall. Those who depreciate the work of the cane cutters in northern Queensland have obviously never spent a summer in that area. We know that, under duress, the representatives of the sugar industry agreed to accept a reduction in the price of sugar. The same party which, through its leader, pledged itself to uphold the sugar agreement, used its influence when it had a majority i u both Houses to intimidate the sugar interests into accepting a reduced price. The attitude of the official Opposition towards this measure is similar to that adopted by the Queensland Labour Government. accepted by the representatives of the sugar industry under duress."" The official Opposition is totally opposed to repudiation, and we believe that, the Government made a mistake in repudiating the sugar agreement and intimidatin g those connected with the industry into accepting the alteration. -The use of the word "" intimidatin g "" in reference to an action of the Government is out of order. intimidate and substitute the word ""misrepresenting."" B y misrepresenting the case, the Government made the sugar growers believe that something dreadful The would befall the industry if they did not accept a reduction in prices. By repudiation and the breaking of promises, the Government forced representatives of the sugar industry, under duress, to accept an alteration of the agreement. While the was no doubt that there official Opposition does not stand for repudiation, which has been practised by the Government in regard to the sugar industry honourable member to use more temperate language. w ill not oppose this measure, because it realizes that if the bill were defeated, the sugar industry would be left in the air, at the mercy of an unsympathetic Government, and its future would be jeopardized.

He left those gentlemen in no doubt as to what the action of the Government would be if its terms were rejected. The Scullin Government, faced with >an agreement which would expire on the 31st August, 1931, with the knowledge that it had to determine whether the embargo should be continued .or another system of control adopted; bearing in mind the great value of the industry to Australia, its employing capacity, and its relation to the cost of living and the basic wage, appointed a committee of inquiry to investigate and report upon it. The desire was to be absolutely fair to all sections of the industry. All those who have read the majority and minority reports submitted by that committee, must agree that the inquiry was made most carefully and systematically; that nothing was overlooked. interested were represented at that inquiry. There were representatives of the employees of the industry, the consumers, the Australian Sugar Producers Association, the fruit-growers and the manufacturers who use sugar. Mr John Gunn, the Director of Development, the accountant of the Department of Trade and Customs, and a representative of the Queensland sugar mills were also members of it. Those gentlemen began their task with open minds. The Scullin Government adopted the majority-report of the committee. I know that many persons are opposed to any system of government control in an industry, but that employed in regard to the sugar industry is not a new one. The Fisher Government, in co-operation with the Queensland Government under the premiership of Mr T. J. Ryan, entered intothe first sugar agreement, in 1915. Federal Government first imposed a prohibition on the importation of sugar except with the consent of the Minister for Trade and Customs. On five of the six occasions when that agreement has been renewed, the Leader of the Government in another place (Senator Pearce) has been a party to the negotiations. Although the Scullin Government came in for a good deal of criticism because it renewed the agreement under that system of control, it must be remembered that it was merely continuing the policy laid down by the Pisher-Ryan Governments in 1915, and followed by successive Federal and State Governments. When the Scullin Government renewed the embargo for a period of five years, and the existing prices for a further three years up to the lst September, 1934, it introduced new conditions into the agreement. These were designed to limit the returns of the sugar industry in conformity with the times, and to adjust retail selling prices as and when necessary on a fixed basis to be determined by fluctuating costs of production. It also adopted a special plan, put forward by persons representing the large majority of the fruit-growers of Australia, designed to assist the fruit industry in its present time of need. Honourable members who represent Tasmania will All parties admit that that assistance, to the extent of £110,000 per annum, has been of great value to tlie fruit industry. When the Scullin Government made those arrangements, it gave due regard to the tendency towards falling costs, and it inserted a clause in the agreement providing that the selling price of sugar might be altered as and when costs altered sufficiently to warrant that. A reduction in the cost of production equivalent to -Jd. per lb. of refined sugar would be passed on. to the sugar consumers at, any time if such a situation were brought about. The agreement also contained a special clause restricting the average basic price of raw sugar to £22 a ton, so that if the phenomenally low world's prices rose considerably, thus enhancing the value of the surplus raw sugar exported from Australia, sugar producers would not obtain more than the limited basic average return on the total production. That new provision was It was about that time that the deemed to be essential, as a recurrence",13,Sugar Agreement Bill Second Readino
43,Mr Lyons,The honourable member,14,Sugar Agreement Bill Second Readino
44,Mr Forde,"I have quoted what theof unduly profitable returns would result in inflated land values and increased production, to the ultimate detriment of both producers and consumers in Australia. A trust account was established under this agreement, and placed under the joint control of the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments, to make adjustments along the lines I have mentioned. Each season, this account was to be credited, on behalf of the sugar consumers, with the excess return for any raw sugar over and above the adjusted price of approximately £22 per ton for the season, or it was to be debited, on behalf of the sugar producers with the deficiency, if any, in the actual return from raw sugar below the adjusted price calculated on the basis I have indicated. Any net surplus in the trust account, at the end of any season was to be made available by the Queensland Sugar Board for the purpose of enabling an effective reduction to be made in the selling price of refined sugar, to be passed on to manufacturers and domesticconsumers for such a period as the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments might consider would exhaust the net surplus. and trust account arrangements have been omitted from the new agreement. The benefit of any reduction in the cost of production that would have come to the sugar consumers under the Scullin agreement will not be available to them under this new arrangement. I can quite imagine that the Government hopes for big reductions in wages, and a considerable lengthening of working hours in the sugar industry. The sugar agreement made by the Scullin Government also provided that, for the first three years of the period of its operation, the sugar industry should contribute £315,000 per annum for the benefit of the fruit industry on the lines recommended in the .majority report of the Sugar Inquiry Committee. Eor six years, the sugar industry had been contributing £205,000 a year for this purpose in a home consumption rebate of £6 5s. per ton on. refined sugar used by fruit processors, and with an export rebate paid on the sugar content of fruit products exported from Australia. The Scullin Government considered that the necessitous state of the fruit industry was such that this assistance should be increased by £110,000 per annum. Having had something to do with the appointment of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee, whose duty it was to distribute this £110,000 per annum, I am glad .to learn from the representatives of the fruit industry that its work has been greatly appreciated. Paragraph b of clause 4 of the agreement dealing with this matter, which was drawn up while I was Minister for Trade and Customs, reads as follows:The said committee shall furnish to the Minister of State for Trade and Customs an annual report of its work, and statement of receipts and expenditure pursuant to this paragraph, such report and statement to he in respect of the period ending on the thirty-first day of August of each year and to be furnished to the said Minister uot later than the thirtyfirst day of October of each year and such statement to be then submitted by the said Minister to the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth for certification. I wish to kuow whether that report of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee has been received, whether it has been submitted to the Auditor-General, The basic price and whether it Avill be made available to honourable members? It should be a most interesting document. In the year before the establishment of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee, the position of the fruit industry was so bad that only one-half of the main varieties of fruit available was purchased, and that at a price only a little more than half the cost of production. That was one of the problems which the Scullin Government had to face. The making available of the additional £110,000 per annum to which I have referred has made possible the purchasing of all suitable fruit for processing at reasonable prices fixed by the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee. Needless to say, the establishment of this tribunal was not favoured by the big fruit processing companies. They did not want any interference with the law of supply and demand, but wished to he .free, as they had always been, to offer the fruit-growers any price they liked for their fruit. In the old days, the sugar millers used to offer the canegrowers any price they liked, and if the growers were not prepared to accept the price offered to them, they were told that they could let their cane rot in the field. Remarks of a similar nature were made by the fruit processors to the fruit growers. The work of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee has been invaluable to the small fruit-growers of Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales. The Assistant Minister quite unfairly suggested in his speech that the sugar growers had made no sacrifices during the last four or five years. One might have gathered from his remarks that they were getting the same price for cane as they got previously. The honourable gentleman saidYet sugar remained practically alone, outside the arena of Australia's great struggle for eeononi ic reconstruction. Many people overlook the fact that our sugar-growers are not getting any more for their raw sugar now than they got in 1915-16. In that -year the price of raw sugar was approximately £18 per ton, while in 1932 the price was £18 6s. 6d. per ton. Since 1915-16 costs have gone up in the sugar industry, as they have in other industries. The reason for the low price of raw sugar is, of course, overproduction. After the making of the sugar agreement of 1921, during the Hughes Administration, the price of sugar rose to £30 6s. 8d. per ton. This led to a great increase in the acreage put under cane, and to a consequent overproduction from 1924 onwards. The average over-production is 33 per cent, of the total production. In 1930 the surplus production was 41 per cent, o.f the whole production. Some people have said that we should limit our sugar production to Australia's requirements. If that were done approximately 120,000 acres now under sugar cane could not be used for this purpose, and this would mean a reduction of 40 per cent, in the employment given by the sugar industry. It would also mean the loss of £2,000,000 a year which we are getting from Great Britain for raw sugar which we sell to her. Surely we cannot face such a loss at a time when it is necessary that we shall increase our return from exports. tected under the Ottawa agreement. absolutely nothing from the Ottawa agreement. These exports are being made obtained their sugar supplies at half the ""pursuant to the provisions of the British.. Finance Act of 1926. got a guarantee for another five years. preference before the Ottawa agreement was made, and this still had about four years to run. The Agent-General for Queensland, Mr Pike, discovered some little time ago that South Africa had an agreement with the British Government for a preference on sugar for a year longer than the preference granted by Great Britain on Australian sugar, and he at once communicated with the Premier of Queensland on the subject, and that gentleman approached the Prime Minister of Australia. Mr Pike also got into touch with the Resident Minister in London. The negotiations which were thus set on foot after the Ottawa agreement had been made resulted in the term of preference for Australian sugar being extended for the period of the sugar agreement made with South Africa. I say definitely that the Ottawa agreement has given the Queensland sugar-growers absolutely nothing that was not theirs already under the British Finance Act. It is not generally realized that the sugar industry of Queensland has done a great deal to assist other industries in Australia. We are always being told that it exploits the people of Australia. But ever since the beginning of the control period, the Australian manufacturers of confectionery, jams, condensed milk, beer, and biscuits have been able to obtain, at the equivalent of world parity, the sugar that they require for their businesses. For nearly two years they obtained their sugar at prices ranging between £29 and £46, although the world's price of refined sugar averaged over £60. For several months,in that period the price of sugar for the manufacturer of jam in England was £160' per ton as against about £46 in the Commonwealth. The Australian jam manufacturers lose sight of that fact when they condemn the sugar industry for alleged exploitation of the public.",14,Sugar Agreement Bill Second Readino

50,Mr Forde,"They did, for theyworld's parity. From 1915 to the end of 192U the Australian sugar cost £16,000,000 less than world's parity sugar free of duty would have cost. In other words, the Australian consumers were saved £16,000,000 by the existence of the local sugar industry. Tbe proposal in this bill means to domestic consumers a reduction of a -Jd. per lb. in the price of the sugar from the 5th January, 1933. On the basis of an average weekly consumption of 6 lb., each family will save 3d. a week. will aggregate £1,000,000. result in a reduction in the price of sugar to the manufacturers from £36 l is . 9d. per ton to £32 10s. 9d., a saving of £4 Is. on sugar used for alL manufactures except fruit products. Fruit processors will still pay £30 6s. 9d. per ton, as hitherto, for their home consumption requirements, or £2 4s. per ton less than other manufacturers. fied. satisfied with the agreement drawn up between the Scullin Government and the Queensland Government last year. The concessions to the big confectionery manufacturers is very great. The saving to the average housewife who has to cater for a husband and three children is only 3d. per week, but the big manufacturers will save £4 Is. per ton, which on the normal consumption of about 75,000 tons means an annual saving of £300,000. One big manufacturer of confectionery alone will save about £20,000 per annum,, another £15,000, 'and yet other amounts varying from £5,000 upwards. No doubt the new 'agreement is very popular with these gentlemen. As a matter of fact the urge for a reduction in the price of sugar came not so much from the householders as from these large industrialists. It will be interesting to note whether the consumers are to got any benefit from the advantage given to the manufacturers, or whether the profits will be pocketed by the big shareholders in an industry which has produced more millionaires than any other branch of business in Australia. Henry Jones, *he head of the great jam combine, wrote to the then Prime Minister in 1925, saying that it did not matter what the manufacturers paid for the sugar for processing fruits for local consumption, so long as they obtained it for processing for export at world's parity. At that time ""the Australian domestic price was £46 per ton. To-day it is £30 6s. 9d. per ton, but fruit processors will not only get sugar at the equivalent of world's parity for the export trade, but also an additional £110,000 by way of bounty to assist export. Both the majority and minority reports of the Sugar Inquiry Committee contain tributes to the high standard of efficiency which the Queensland industry has attained. Taking all phases of the industry together, Australia is now preeminent in efficiency amongst sugar producing countries. Queensland produces a ton of sugar from a smaller quantity of cane titan any other cane-producing country. Its raw sugar mills have a milling recovery second only, and almost equal, to the famous Hawaian mills, and cultural ' operations on. the Queensland farms have been the subject of exceptional commendation by experts from Hawaii and F i j i . These advances could not have been made without hard work, and the expenditure of much capital on research. Indeed were it not for the very high all round efficiency in Australia it would not be passible to produce raw sugar in competition with that produced by coloured labour abroad. In Java male labour is paid from lOd. to Is. and female and child labour from 4d. to '5d. per day for twelve hours as against ruling Australian wages. The serf conditions of Java permit of field wages equal to about 4 per cent, of the Australian rate, but the more efficient methods of cultivation and manufacture in Australia and the superiority of white labour, go far towards counteracting the enormous disparity in wages. If the Australian industry had not kept abreast of the times, and sent representatives abroad to collect tbe latest, ideas regarding machinery, methods of cultivation, milling, and refining, its product could not be put on the market at present prices. It is important to note, as pointed out in the majority The late Sir report, that the first material advance in Australian efficiency commenced in 1921,",16,Sugar Agreement Bill Second Readino

54,Mr Forde,"Yes, but they wereor six years after tbe embargo was instituted. This improvement has been added to since, and it is attributable to the stability afforded by the embargo, which enables the producers to introduce and develop improvements with confidence and security. Unfortunately the Ottawa Conference -did not consider the sugar position at all. Before the conference, the British Finance Act of 1926 had stabilized for ten years the preference on dominion goods, which was also effective in 1925. South Africa was given a preference extending a year beyond that which applied to Australian exports to Great Britain, and I have already pointed out that the acting Agent General for Queensland brought this matter under the notice of the Commonwealth Resident Minister in London( Mr Bruce), and the Premier of Queensland discussed it with the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons). Because of the negotiations which followed these representations, the Australian industry has been put on the same footing as South Africa. To say that the Queensland sugar industry has'obtained something from the Ottawa Conference, which it had not previously enjoyed under the British Finance Act, is mere casuistry. The Queensland sugar industry has been subjected to a good deal of condemnation, because of the operation of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It is true that the company makes a big profit, but a large portion of its operations is in F i j i , where it owns five of the sugar Colonial Sugar Refining Company:mills, two of them larger than any mills in Australia, not excepting the newest at Tulley, north Queensland, which cosf £800,000. The company's production of sugar in F i j i averages about 140,000 tons per year. The minority report of the Sugar Inquiry Committee statedTaking the total capital of £8,589,212 required to handle all the company's Australian sugar operations, it will be found that the average net profit of £472,000 |>er annum remaining to the company (after payment of income tax) is equivalent to 54 per cent, per annum, and it is not considered that this rate of earning is excessive. I am not competent to investigate the whole of the ramifications of the company, and learn where its moneys are invested. We know that Mr Knox, the general manager of the company, refused to disclose its accounts and balance-sheets to Mr Fordo. a royal commission a few years ago, and an alteration of the Constitution would be necessary before a full inquiry into the operations of the company could be made, But I know that the company has four sugar mills in Queensland and three 'in New South Wales, producing approximately between 100,000 and 120,000 tons of raw sugar annually. Of the 34 mills now in Queensland, only four are the property of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The company has refineries in each State capital except Hobart, and in New Zealand. It has altogether twelve sugar mills, six refineries, 900 miles of tramways, 105 locomotives, 13,000 trucks, 275 ships, launche; and lighters, 1,300 buildings and one distillery. The statement that the company makes all its profits in Queensland is entirely wrong. When Australian sugar growers were limited to a price of £30 6s. Sd. during the boom period following the war, when the world's price rose io £120, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was selling its products from F i j i at world's parity and made fabulous profits. Those profits were invested in al! sorts of enterprises, and the company makes available up to £10,000,000 to finance the Queensland sugar industry to-day The company, like a banking institution, is paid for giving financial accommodation. Sir Arthur Duckham, who reported on the sugar industry when ^c visited Australia some years ago, made the following statement regarding the This company is certainly very efficiently run and as its profits do not exceed one-twelfth of a penny per lb. of sugar, and as from thif profit it has to finance the sugar crop, I do not consider that its returns are in any way excessive. On the question whether this company is making abnormal profits, I make no further comment, because it is a subject that should be carefully investigated by some tribunal clothed with adequate powers, but as a representative of Queensland, a State which has thousands of sugar-growers, I do object to the sugar industry being condemned because of the alleged' rapacity of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the ramifications of which extend to F i j i and New Zealand. That company would not be at nil dismayed if the sugar embargo were removed, because it could', witb its huge financial resources, import sugar from Java and F i j i . vested funds in Queensland? not only in Queensland, but also in other parts of Australia and in New Zealand. It has a refinery in every State capital of Australia. Would it not suit that company to import black-grown sugar, say, from Java, and sell it in, say, Western Australia at £8 10s. a ton instead of £18 10s. a ton, which is the price ruling at.present ? member say that the company acts as a banking institution in Queensland? the sugar crop in Queensland, but at a lower rate of interest than that charged by the banks. It would no doubt suit the company to invest its money in sugar enterprises in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea or in Java. In conclusion, E would point out that we oppose, definitely, .the breaking of the solemn condictiveness, but merely because my crititract between the Queensland Government representing the sugar industry aud the Federal Labour Government. That contract was entered into for a specific period-u p to the lst September, 1934, aud it was grossly unjust for this Government to put a gun at' the heads of the representatives of the sugar industry in order to bring about a reduction in price, and then to place upon the industry the responsibility for the reduction that has since taken place. Although this Government has shown itself to be unsympathetic with the sugar interests, the withdrawal of this measure would give no consolation to the growers. It is better that we should support it than that we should leave the industry in a position of uncertainty. This Government has given a succession pf kicks to other Queensland industries, such as the cotton-growing industry, the tobacco-growing industry, the banana industry, and the canned pineapple industry, and, therefore, we could not expect from it anything better than the repudiation of the sugar agreement. The commencement and the termination of the speech of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde), being purely political and therefore of little value, did not do him much credit, but I am in agreement with his remarks as to the position of the sugar industry of Queensland. I have lived in that State. During last winter, I made a visit there and undertook an intense study of the sugar industry. From the knowledge that I gained, I must admit that the remarks of the honourable member as to the condition of the industry are true, but it is a pity that he could not have put his case before this House without spoiling it by introducing political propaganda. In not the honourable considering this bill, I am not much concerned about the proposed reduction in the price of sugar, and whether it is sufficient or insufficient, nor am I concerned about the duration of the proposed agreement. To those matters I shall refer at a later stage. I wish to view this bill as widely as possible, and to level some criticism, not. only at the sugar industry, but also at the State of Queensland. I do this, not in a spirit of vincism will, in the long run, do no harm. I wish to view the sugar agreement from the standpoint of federation and section 92 of the Constitution, and of Queensland's attitude towards interstate trade, because, that State depends for it's sugar market upon the remaining States of the Commonwealth, which, as buyers of sugar, cannot disregard Queensland's attitude, as a buyer of their products. Finally, I wish to view the agreement from the standpoint of Queensland's attitude towards the Ottawa agreement, because we cannot, now that that agreement has been practically ratified by this Parliament, disregard its effect upon the domestic trade of Australia. It is necessary that the northern areas of Australia should be populated, preferably by white people. The sugar industry has done that, but at a price, and whether that price is too great or too little does not concern me at the moment. A strong plea that' has always been put forward on behalf of the sugar industry is that it provides some means of defence. There is no doubt that the industry has led to settlement along the eastern coast of North Queensland, but the people there",17,Sugar Agreement Bill Second Readino

68,Mr Hutchin,"The next point toparcel of flour from Sydney at the price at which it is offered to him. When flour comes over the border, it goes into, the pool, and is sold at pool prices. Free trade between the States does not exist. This is an important point, and one well worthy of consideration. Acquisition Act might quite as well have been called the "" Anything Acquisition Act "" , because it covers all manner of things besides sugar. One cannot emphasize too strongly the possible effects of this act, if administered by a prejudiced government. In this connection, I propose to quote a letter which I received recently from a f i r m producing cement in one of the southern States. It is as follows:Just recently we were successful in securing an order for 9 tons of cement from the contractor who was the successful tenderer in connection with one of the Government wheat sheds that are being built throughout our wheat-growing areas for the storage of wheat. Before sending "" Goliath"" cement, we perused the specification, and found that preference was, as far as possible, to be given to Queensland products, and, in the case of cement, special mention was made that, ""where practicable "", the Queensland product was to be used. However, we secured the order on our merits and price, and after arrival, at its destination the Government inspector refused permission to the contractor to use '"" Goliath "". Fortunately, we were able to dispose of the cement without any very serious loss, but we consider it manifestly unfair that duce sugar at £5 a ton in New Guinea there should be such discrimination shown against southern merchandise. Nothing to our mind was more clear when the Constitution was framed than that there should he absolute freedom of trade between .States. That was the reason for federation, .and to do away with the silly customs tariffs .at the border of each State. Queensland has far too much to lose hy carrying on this unfederal spirit by the State Government. In ispite of the small reduction in the price of -sugar, what would we do without the southern .consumption. We already have an embargo :against importations of southern flour, and this embargo is now becoming more pronounced :against interstate trading generally. I put it to the representatives of the sugar industry in this Parliament, that, in their -own interest, they should not push this spirit of self-contained nationalism too far. If they t r y to keep Queensland for the Queenslanders, they cannot expect to keep the rest of Australia for Queensland sugar and bananas. industry, which is the largest and most important in that State, should throw [83] its weight in. favour of the principle of interstate free trade. purchases more from the southern States than she sells to them. The Sugarin the past; but Queensland is trying to reverse the position. This is a new movement, and should be nipped in the bud. Queensland cannot have it both ways. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr. Riordan) almost wept yesterday when recounting the attacks which, he sand, were being constantly made by the southern States and the Commonwealth on Queensland industries. He said that Queenslanders were becoming bitter, and that is true. I have been there, and have observed the bitterness; but that feeling has been fostered by the utterances of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Forde), and of the honourable member for Kennedy, who are doing a disservice to Queensland and to the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Kennedy said that city interests were scheming to undermine the Queensland sugar industry by launching an enterprise to grow sugar in New Guinea. I am able to inform the honourable member that I heard of this scheme, not in any of the cities, but on the cane-fields themselves. I was told that it was proposed to profrom Badilla cane. I propose to quote a few facts relating to the sugar industry which I gleaned while in the sugar-producing districts. From 1920 to 1930, the area under cane increased from 162,000 acres to 296,000 acres, and the production of raw sugar increased from 167,000 tons to 516,783 tons. It is evident, therefore, that although Queensland growers did not receive the benefit of peak prices for sugar during .the war, the reward was, nevertheless, sufficient to induce them to double their acreage in ten years, and more than double their output. couraged by the price they received to do that. sufficient to inflate land values, and other The sugar costs, and those costs are to-day sitting on the back of the industry; so much so, indeed, that, on the admission of the",20,Marketing

72,Mr Hutchin,"We l l , the price wassugar-growers themselves, notwithstanding the artificial price of their product, only 13 per cent, of the growers pay income tax on the basis of a £150 exemption. If that is the bqst the industry can do under a system of bolstered-up prices, there is surely something wrong. I believe that the industry is efficien tly conducted. The refineries are aknost, if not quite,-the last word in efficiency. The mills for the production of raw sugar are well run, .and the growers have shown steady improvement in .their farming methods. There is in operation a scheme of subsidized research, financed hy a levy of i d . a ton on the sugar produced. During the tern years up to 1908, the average production of cane per acre was 15.04 tons, while the production of raw .sugar per .acre was .1*63 tons. It took, on an average, 9.20 tons of cane to produce 1 ton of sugar. By 1930 the position had so improved as to give the following -results : The average yield of cane per acre was 15.89, and the average yield of sugar .per acre was 2.33. Whereas in 1908 -.it took 9.20 tons of caaae to produce a ton of sugar, in 1930 -a ton -being produced ifrom 6.93 tons of cane. This is -an important industry, and it has ;in important influence on the economy of A ustralia, but .we must not be awed by size.

After the employee has paid the farmer £1 4s. 6d. a week for his rations, he has left £3 3s. 6d. a week. These workers have no particular skill. stated that the high wages are justified because of the severe climatic conditions under which the men have to work. I admit that the climatic conditions can be severe; that they are more severe than in these latitudes. But North Queensland is not the only place in Australia where climatic conditions are severe. As a case in point, I mention the West coast of Tasmania, which is subjected to falls of snow and to almost continual rain. When wages are fixed for that district, no consideration is given to climatic conditions. The net wages paid in North Queensland to labourers who require no skill, and who frequently are southern Europeans, is £3 3s. 6d. It cannot, be denied that the percentage of southern Europeans. in the northern part of Queensland is noticeably higher than anywhere else in Australia. Coinpare that rate with the wages paid to people employed in the southern States. A trained fitter in Tasmania, South Australia, or Victoria certainly does not get £4 10s., while labourers in the south do not receive as much as Queensland' sugar workers, even after the latter have paid their board. Is it fair that the man who is growing something in> the south for the man in the north should be paid so much less? v should be a nearer balance of things. Is it surprising that the man in the south, who is trying to keep his family on this comparatively small wage, asks for sugar at a little cheaper price? Australia must be regarded as a wholewhich is necessary for the. sugar industry -o r as a number of parts. This agreement contemplates Australia as a unity, and seeks to arrange with the sugar industry something that will serve the whole of Australia. Therefore, we must bring into our consideration Australian conditions generally, taking the cons as well as the priDs. 1 I have mentioned that-, in the sugar industry, labour represents 63 per cent, of the total cost. In North Queensland one frequently hears the phrase that "" the farmer takes all the risk, and the workman takes all the profit,."" That is just a handy way of putting it, and it is true. At least it is so far as the half of the sugar crop which is exported is concerned-, although it does hot apply It has been to the 50 per cent, required for home consumption This agreement entails a reduction of l l per cent, in the reduction of the retail price of sugar. That basis was arrived at after conference between the parties concerned, the growers, millers, refiners, shippers, and employees. We do not know the details. Nor do we know how much each of the sections has contributed towards the general cut. But we do know that the workers have contributed nothing. Quite recently the employers of Queensland endeavoured to effect a reduction in the basic wage, in conformity with the reduced cost of living and reduced business turnover, but the Queensland Industrial Court, in its' wisdom, said, """"Oh iio', we shall push that on one side',"" and the ease has been deferred until February. Uiit.il now the workers iii thtj BUga'f industry have made none of the sacrifice, and yet only 13 per cent, of fhe growers paid income tax when sugar was at 4$d. If that is equality of sacrifice^ I do' n6t know the meaning of the English language.

78,"Mr Hutchin,","Yes, and that isparts of Australia. The people of the north are lucky that prosperity has stayed with them. We all wish that similar prosperity could be enjoyed by everybody throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. The towns of Townsville and Cairns are most attractive; model country towns which reflect the general prosperous condition of the people of North Queensland. The Australian public should appreciate that,-for the past ten years, the average price of sugar in Australia, as compared with the price of sugar in England, has been as 4$d. compared with 5£d. For that period sugar has heen cheaper here than in Great Britain. To an extent, that result is due to the control that has been exercised. Over a number of years the price of sugar iu Australia has been as follows:1015-1(1 .. ..3 1010-20 1020-22 192223 192332 The high price charged from 1920 to 1923 was to compensate the Commonwealth Government for the money that it paid for the import of the sugar necessary to make up the quantity needed for consumption. In 1919, the Commonwealth Government imported sugar at a cost of £4P 6s. 2d. a ton, and in 1920 such sugar cost £60 19s. 6d. a ton. While this is a favorable comparison between the price in Australia and Great Britain, it does not necessarily follow that the price in this country ment cannot be dissociated from the inhas not been a fair one, having regard to the prices of commodities generally. I believe that the Government has car-, ried out a public duty, in effecting this reduction. But as a supporter of the Government, I resent the suggestion that a p stol was held to the head of those : in the sugar industry. I am confident that responsible representatives of that industry do not make such a claim. also resent the implication of repudiation. Considering the matter from a Tasmanian point of view, or the point of vieAv of any other State, we must ask ourselves is Queensland prepared to give the other States as fair a deal as she expects for herself. I return to my original contention, that the people of Queensland would be Mr Eiitchin. Well advised, in their own interest, not to try to shut the gate against produce from the south. That can have only one result. It will breed ill will as time goes on, and the greater-the five other States -wil l discipline the smaller-Queensland . If that happens it will be Queensland's own fault. Those honourable members who represent that State in this chamber should, as public men, endeavour to influence Queensland opinion in that direction. The Ottawa agreement was one of the tests that I applied to this position. On the divisions that were taken in this chamber during the past 24 hours, Queensland members representing sugar growing districts, were almost unanimously against the Government. The preference which Great Britain has accorded to Australia in regard to sugar, d. if not actually part of the Ottawa agree. . 3-J ment, is at least in keeping with the spirit .. .. . . 0 of Ottawa.

The agreement is distinct from another that we have recently discussed, for it fixes prices, formed.] The sugar-growers are making and does not lay down principles. It is because prices represent such an uncertain factor that I raise an objection to tbe length of the term of the agreement. I congratulate the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) on the thoughtful and informative speech that he has just made. But I cannot subscribe to his view that Queensland is the only State in the Commonwealth which sets up barriers against the produce of other States. member's reference to the sugar industry was rather unfortunate. The arrangement made with those engaged in the sugar industry provides that, despite the cost of transporting the commodity to distant parts of Australia, the price of sugar shall be the same in each State. There could not be a better example of interstate free trade. Reference to the alleged unfriendly action of one State towards another is to be deprecated. It is a case of the pot calling the kettle black, for Queensland is not the only offender. Certain districts in Tasmania had to go out of potato growing, because it was stated that they were subject to disease, and Tasmanian potatoes generally were, therefore, denied entry into Victoria. Again, but a short time ago, the use of a trade mark was employed to prevent the sale in New South Wales ot articles made in the other States. I trust that the time is not far distant when interstate certainty free trade in Australia will be an actual reality and not an ideal. I approve of this agreement mainly able gentleman had experience while he because it has already been signed by the was Prime Minister of the difficulty in Queensland Government and accepted by some circumstances of securing the repeal the sugar-growers. Its rejection would of legislation. A -proclamation can be mean that the agreement made eighteen withdrawn without reference to Parliamonths or two years ago, would remain in ment. force, and this would be dangerous legally believe that this reduction in and politically, and would make the position of the sugar-growers most unstable. I congratulate the sugar-growers of Queensland upon having accepted the compromise embodied in this agr.eemesnt. In doing so, they have made definite sacrifices, but they have secured the stability which will result from the embargo being imposed by legislation instead of by proclamation. [Quorum practically all the sacrifices which the industry will be called upon to suffer under this revised agreement, for their cane had already been cut and much of it milled before the alteration was made. All the charges in connection with this cutting and milling were paid by the growers. On this account, I greatly regret that the Government could not see its way clear to fix a later date for the coming into force of the reductions of the price of sugar. The sugar growers would then have been recomI n this respect the honorahle pensed to some extent for their actual out-of-pocket expenses in wages to canecutters and charges of millers. The sugar made from this cane will not come into consumption until next year, so that the i<ireduction will actually be taken out of the pockets of the sugar-growers of Queensland. That, in my opinion, is nothing short of a scandal. The only consolation which the growers have is the knowledge that the embargo will, henceforth, have an element of permanence and certainty that was previously missing. It is much more satisfactory to all concerned that the embargo should be approved by both Houses of the Parliament. In the past, the proclamation applying the embargo was liable to be withdrawn at any time, for although the agreement was for a specified term, changes in government and policies could easily have affected it. is in a proclamation that is not in a legislative act?",24,Marketing

Senate has to offer itself for re-election every three years, the whole body is not likely to change its political character for a long time. honourable gentleman is sometimes in favour of embargoes? of an embargo on sugar. The sugar industry has been the subject of frequent investigation during the last 25 years. I suppose that in that period half a dozen impartial inquiries have been made into it. On every occasion, the inquiring body, whether it was a royal commission, such as that of Mr Justice Piddington, or an inquiring committee, such as that set up by the Scullin Government, which consisted to a considerable extent of persons undoubtedly hostile to the industry when they began their inquiry, has concluded that there is no possibility of giving any protection to the sugar industry worthy of the name by means of fixed duties. Sugar is one of the great gambling stocks of the world. The production of sugar is, in and out, largely dependent on seasons. '.It is estimated that, at present, there 'is an over-production of 2,000,000 tons of sugar a year, and stocks of 5,000,000 tons are held in reserve at this moment. Sugar, probably more than any other commodity, has been the subject of commercial speculation In consequence of this, the fixing it must be by embargoes. The question, of a duty, even on a sliding scale, would be of no value as a protection to the industry. consumer ? years, the Australian consumers have been better off than the sugar consumers of almost any other part of the world. This fact has been established by investigating tribunals consisting of sugar consumers and sugar processors. The honourable member for Denison( Mr made to the fruit industry. That this Hutchin) holds no brief for the sugar industry, but he informed us only a few moments ago that the price of sugar in England to-day is 5^d. per lb., while in Australia it is only 4^d. per lb., and will shortly be only 4d. per lb. In Czechoslovakia there is a duty of £20 a ton on sugar. Zealand? member should consider the experience of the New Zealand and Australian sugar consumers during the war, when our sugar industry was cut absolutely to the bone and many sugar-growers forced off their holdings. A t that time sugar cultivation was abandoned on 40,000 or 50,000 acres of land in Queensland. The result was that we found ourselves compelled to buy 100,000 tons of 1 sugar a year, in two successive years, at a price of almost £100 per ton, or nearly Is. per lb. But because we were paying only about 2d. per lb. for the sugar produced in Australia, it was possible to retail sugar in this country nt 6d. per lb. that story in Heaven. possible, because it is a true story. Since the war, and .particularly in 1925 and 1926, the price of sugar outside Australia has been higher than the price of it inside Australia. Eor this reason, impartial investigators who, in most instances, have been southern men without any personal interest in the sugar industry, have concluded that if the sugar industry of Australia is to be given any real protection, therefore, arises, what conditions shall govern' the embargo, so that the people of Australia shall be fairly dealt with. Since 1923 the embargo has been applied in accordance with the terms of various agreements, and we have every justification for saying that the sugar industry has given a measure of assistance to other Australian industries to some extent dependent upon it . In this respect it is singular among our protected industries.

95,Dr. Earle Page,"That is quitetheir solid support to the ratification of tins agreement. about the sugar consumers? sugar consumers are getting sugar at as low a price as the consumers of any other country, and at a lower price than most of them. Since 1923 our confectionery manufacturers, and the manufacturers of certain other commodities which use sugar on a large scale, have had the. advantage of a definite rebate of £4 per ton in the price of the sugar they use. They have been getting sugar for £33 6s. 8d. per ton. This has meant that the price of their'manufactured goods is lower than would otherwise have been the case. At present our fruit processors, jam makers, and canned-fruit manufacturers ai e getting their sugar for £30 6s. 8d. a ton. It is estimated by the fruit canners that, this concession is worth about £60,000 a year to them. We must also remember the concessions that are being given to our manufacturers of export commoditiesand, after all, this is one of the most important aspects of the subject. The sugar industry gives our exporting industries which use sugar, the right to buy all their sugar at world parity prices. It is estimated that this advantage is worth about £30,000 a year. In addition to aU this, provision is made under this agreement, for a concession of £110,000 a year to be made to our fruit exporters. In this respect the sugar industry stands alone among the protected industries of Australia. In every other case our protected industries take the fullest advantage of the protection granted to them, and do nothing to assist our exporting industries. Because the sugar industry does assist our exporters, and is playing the game by the people of Australia them! honourable member for Cowper is entitled to be heard without interjection. Other honourable members, who wish to express their opinions on this bill, will have an opportunity to do so. granted to other industries under this agreement are valued at about £200,000 a year. In these circumstances, it is amazing that honourable members of this House should decry the sugar industry. The British Government thinks this industry so valuable that it is giving us a preference of £4 5s. a ton on refined sugar; but because most of our sugar is sent away in the raw state to British refineries, this preference is actually valued at between £3 12s. and £3 15s. per ton. Both the United Kingdom and Canada, by according this preference to the Australian industry, recognize that it is worthy of assistance. On the sugar used in canned fruits for export we are given an additional concession which is worth £70,000. That is an indication of the perspective in which the industry should be viewed. I have no hesitation about supporting the agreement, because I regard the sugar industry as essential to Australia. Its value was demonstrated during the war period. Four hundred years ago, because these commodities were not then known to them, European peoples did without cane sugar, as they did without tea and tobacco, but to-day sugar is an essentia! article of the diet of all civilized people. We have proved our capacity to produce cane sugar as efficiently as it caii be produced in any country, and we should make some effort to uphold and develop the industry. I support,the industry, first, because it is par excellence, one which will not merely settle white people in agricultural districts, but by reason of the labour associated with mills and refineries, will also provide employment in the towns and cities. Secondly, I support it because it has now reached the exporting stage; last year it sent abroad 200,000 tons of refined sugar, worth £2,500,000. Having regard to our unfavorable trade balance, we must be appreciative of any industry that will earn money for us abroad. A third reason for. supporting the industry is that throughout it the system of. payment by results operates. The grower is paid for his cane according to its sugar content, and because of that, during the last ten years in which the industry has had a monopoly of the Australian market, the quality of the cane has improved enormously. Whereas, a few years ago, 12 tons of cane were required to produce 1 ton of raw sugar, only 7 tons are needed",26,Marketing

There has been a widespread demand in all States, except perhaps Queensland and New South Wales, for a substantial reduction of the price of sugar content maintained sugar. Even in prosperous times the Simultaneously sugar industry occupied a privileged position on account of the price it was able to extort from the public. Two years ago, owing to the prevailing depression, Parliament found it necessary to adopt As a basis, all fixed incomes were reduced by 22^ per cent.

We should not try to destroy the Queensland sugar industry, but should fix the price of sugar upon a reasonable basis, somewhat approximating the prices prevailing in other industries. I take exception ou various grounds to clause 16 of the agreement, upon which I propose to move an amendment in committee. It relates to the determination of wages and the conditions of employment. It provides that the employees in the sugar industry and in such sections of the Australian fruit industry as are set out in clause 7, shall be entitled to have their such conditions? Is it not fair that the wages and conditions, of employment determined by arbitration and conciliation. The frui t industry is, generally speaking, not under .any arbitration award, but under this provision, on the application of, say, a union secretary or the representative of the employers, the Commonwealth Government, can be called upon to set up a new tribunal of arbitration and conciliation. I object to that provision, because we already . have sufficient arbitration and conciliation tribunals in Australia. Why should we set up an additional tribunal to deal with purely State matters? The fruit industry, which is one of the poorlystand Arbitration Court awards. those employees who may be excluded employers, have the right to appeal to another tribunal. excluded from the Arbitration Court may call upon the Commonwealth Government to set up a tribunal, as provided in clause .16. I do not think that provision is an essential part of the agreement, and I propose to move in committee' that it be deleted. desire first to refute some of the statement of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn). He suggested that the people of this country had, in effect, been robbed for the past 20 years by having to pay excessive prices for the sugar that they consumed. As a matter of fact, the Australian price of sugar during that period has been very little higher than the world price. The higher price in Australia has been fully justified in view of the fact that the Australian product, in regard to quality, is second to none in the world. It was suggested by . the honourable member that the price of sugar in New Zealand, and in Great Britain, to-day is 2$d. per lb. Let me inform him that sugar refined in New Zealand is planted, cultivated and crushed by black labour at a wage of about Is. a day. Would the honourable member stand for the consumption in Australia of sugar produced under people of Australia should pay 2d. per lb. more to get the product of white labour in this country.

I have previously stated that the only canegrowers who are doing well at the present time are those who are still farming the land which they obtained from the Government at about £1 an acre. According to the report of one of the land tax valuators for the State of Queensland, the average prices of sugar land in North Queensland are as follow:Mossman district, from £3 to £20 per acre. Cairns, Babinda districts, from £5 to £35 per acre. Innisfail, from £o to £30 per acre. Ingham, from £5 to £25 per acre. Ayr and Homehill, from £3 to £20 per acre. Proserpine, from £5 to £15 per acre. MrH . P. Franklin, the valuator for the Bundaberg district, reports as follows concerning the lands in that area:1. Bundaberg-Isis Districtls t class . . 2nd class 9 . Mackay-Sarin a District1st class 2nd class 3. Ayr-Bowen District1st class 2nd class .. 12 4. Cairns-Ingham District1st class 2nd class Those values are not excessive compared with the prices that have been paid for land for other purf>oses, so that the argument that the present price of sugar is due to high land values falls to the ground. I am not justifying present land values. I do not believe in freehold at all; I believe that if all lands were held on lease from the Government, there would not be the same inducement to speculate, and commodity prices would be reduced. It has been said that cauc-farms have realized high prices. That is so, but I amsure the honourable member for Denison( Mr ing the central Queensland district, which Hutchin), whom I met when he was in Cairns, and who conducted a close investigation into the industry, will agree with me that the high prices are generally accounted for by improvements, such as up-to-date machinery, &c. The honourable member for Denison said that Queensland was somewhat hostile to the other States in the manner in which she had administered the Sugar Acquisition Act. That act was passed Air. Martens. to empower the Government to acquire certain primary products so as to prevent the exploitation of consumers. The administration of that act gave rise to the famous Mooraberri cattle case, which Mr T. J"". Ryan, as Premier, fought from the Full Court of, Queensland to the Privy Council, and won. Under legislation introduced during the war, the Queensland Government was prevented from handling certain base metals needed by Great Britain and her allies, and was required to hand them over to Dalgety and Company for disposal. I believe that if an account were kept of what Queensland buys from the southern States, and what she sells to them, the balance would be in favour of the southern States. Queensland buys apples and potatoes from Tasmania, and potatoes from Victoria, while the well known IXL brand of jam, a Tasmanian Per Acre. £ product, is to be seen in all parts of the State. The rice ufeed in Queens.. 25 hind is grown in New South Wales, and 11 I can remember meetings of the Aus.. 15 tralian Workers Union iu the sugar dis.. 7 tricts of Queensland passing resolutions declaring that, unless the storekeepers .. 20 stocked Australian rice, they would be boycotted. That is how the people in Queens.. 25 land support Australian industries. The .. 12 commodities I mention are not produced to any extent in Queensland, but come from the other States. Certain jams made from tropical fruits are manufactured in Queensland, but other jams are made from pulp brought from the south. The honourable member for Denison spoke of the high wages paid to those employed in the sugar industry. In Northern Queensland there is an allowance of 10s. extra on all awards made hy the Queensland Arbitration Court, and an allowance of 4s. on awards coverextends from St. Lawrence to Burdekin. These allowances have been made because of the severe climatic conditions in the north. With all respect, to the honourable member for Denison, I cannot agree with him. that there are other parts of Australia in which working conditions are so severe as in Northern Queensland. When I inform honourable members that, in parts of the district which I represent, the annual rainfall is up to 7 yards-no t feet-and that the summer temperature is often as high as 120 degrees, they will realize the conditions under which men have to work. Over the whole district from Cardwell to Cairns, the average rainfall is more than 5 yards a year. I have a daughter who worked as a chemist in the sugar mill at Babinda., and in a letter home some time ago she stated that the rainfall from the time she left the mill at midday on Saturday until the following Monday morning, was 21 inches. When I was at Innisfail recently, I was amused to see a builder and his men working in the pouring rain on the construction of new premises for the Bank of New South Wales. I was informed that if they did not work in the rain, they would never get the job done. By way of interjection recently, the that suggestions by the Government that honourable member for Lang( Mr Dein) certain things might happen if the price said that the wages paid to cane-cutters of sugar were not reduced influenced the were very high. honourable member for Denison made a of the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) on similar remark. cane-cutters this year and last year and the growers themselves, many of will average about 24s. a day for whom I know personally, was noticeable. the season.

He remembered that the minority recommensaid that until something was done by dation was based upon an accompanying other sections of industry to absorb those recommendation that definite steps should people the Government should exercise be taken to reduce the unprofitable surcare, and not interfere with the sugar plus production which nowgoes overindustry. The Sugar Inquiry Committee went Melbourne Age have taken me to carefully into all the facts. I shall make task for having the temerity to one quotation from the unanimous section of the report, which appears on page 9, and is as follows:From the evidence given before tbe committee, there seems to be no doubt that the enhancement in land values in 1023 was due to the fixation of tbe priee of raw sugar at £30 6s. 3d. per ton for the years 1020', 1921 and 1922. This gave great stimulus to the industry, owing to the feeling of security which was engendered, and the increased demand for land for sugar-growing to take advantage of the profitable returns from the industry. There is certainly nothing abnormal in that regard, so far as the sugar industry is concerned. The Government has brought about this agreement by conference. I do not say that it is the effect of duress, because to say that would be out of order. I do say This afternoon the growers, but the effect of the statements The wages paid to those who represent the sugar industry, It is alleged that the Government has not effected a sufficient reduction.

Inspired, no doubt, by members of the Sugar Consumers League, that journal declared that, if my contention is logical, it is merely necessary for all our industries to produce and export a surplus to enable us to meet the whole of our obligations overseas. Undoubtedly, Ave can meet our obligations only by marketing pur products overseas. No less an authority than Mr P. H . M . Goldsmith, the general manager of the Colonial Limited, stated that Mr Hughes asked the growers to grow sufficient sugar to meet Australia's needs. Otherwise something might happen to destroy the then existing agreement, which provided a price of £30 6s. 8d. a ton. It is pleasing to me that the embargo value to Australia to have that part of has been retained. This was unanimously the country populated.

So that the fears of the honourable member for Denison on that score should be allayed.

Mr Scui.tiu.^ I presume that it is true that some places in North Queensland are suitable only for sugar growing, enormous rainfall some of the areas are pre-eminently suited to sugar growing; rib'other crops will thrive So well in those in North Queensland before it was put districts. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) said on one occasion, speaking of sugar-growing, "" let it go to its natural place"", meaning that we should import blackgrown sugar. With all due deference, I suggest that he should go to North Queensland during a wet season and realize what the tropics really are, with their rain, heat, mosquitoes, and every other curse to which mail is subject. He tfbuld then be a wiser man. No place in the world is producing better sugar, of more cane tb the acre, than. North Queensland. The honbrable member for Denison quoted figured showing how enormously our production has improved in the past ten years. Sugar technologists From all over the world admit that the Queensland industry equals that of any other country in efficiency. I know that, a year or so back, statistics indicated that Hawaii was a trifle more efficient in milling. But ouic-Wn industry has since' improved, and it is now second to none in its production and techni(Jue. Australia would sustain an irreparable lo3s if its sugar industry went out, of existence.. Honourable members must bear it in mind that, in the aggregate,-.Queensland's imports from other States are tremendous. Queensland is not a manufacturing State, for outside of Brisbane, there are practically no manufacturing establishments except an occasional brewery or foundry. people of that State to bur White Australia ideal, in the cane-cutters? camps, resolution's have been carrie'd declaring that Other. than Australian products are not to be Used. Similar resolutions have been carried in goldmining camps, shearing sheds and other places where large numbers of men have gathered. This does not suggest that the people of Queensland are antagonistic to anybody. When Queensland adopted price-fixing machinery, it did a good service to the primary producers of Australia generally. If the primary producers are not now getting a fair return for their produce, it is because of the actions of middlemen, who come between themand the consumers, I believe that the case for the protection of the sugar-growers is unanswerable. If honourable members had seen the country under sugar, and could see it now, they would realize what vast changes have taken place there. Many years ago the Melbourne Herald sent a special reporter tb North Queensland to investigate conditions there, and this commissioner expressed the opiniom that it was very doubtful whether White men would bo able to clear such dense scrub country, and do tlie other initial worknecessary tb bring it into production; but this work has been done, and it has been done better by our own people than it would have been done by any other people. Our Australia* people are still doing the best work iir the tropics. Notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary, Australians' are the best cane-Gutters and mill-workers in this area. I have no desire to say anything against the Italians who are there; they work.hard, and, perhaps, are better plodders and stickers than the Australians, but the best work is .done by the Australians. The sugar season extends over only from three to six months of the year, and it is almost impossible to find employment during the other six months of the year for the great number of people required during the sugar season. For this reason fhe wages during the working period are high. It has been said tliat the wages are abnormally high; but I dispute this. As to the loyalty of the Persons engaged in certain industries in the southern. States of Australia are actually getting moro for their work than the sugar-workers of Queensland. Workers in the Sydney and Melbourne abattoirs, for instance receive higher wages than the sugar-workers, and have constant employment. I also say, with all due deference to th ose ""who disagree ""with.",34,Marketing
123,Mr Martens,"-Becaus e of theme, that their work is less arduous than that of the cane-cutters. Wages in North Queensland were better two or three years ago than they are at present. The lowness of wages at present is due to the depressed condition of the industry. But wages were never so high as has been suggested by the honourable member for Denison. now only about £18 6s. per (on, whereas it. has been between £22 and £23 per ton in recent years. We know very well that, in consequence of the good conditions in this industry in the early stages of its development, many people invested their money in it. But to-day some of them undoubtedly regret having done so. It has been suggested that the Ottawa agreement is worth an additional £1,000,000 a year to the sugar industry. That statement cannot be substantiated with facts. The value of the agreement will depend entirely upon the amount of sugar exported from this country. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr the Paterson scheme, or the Paterson Gullett) told us in his speech that sugar to the value of £1,000,000 was exported last year, but I disagree with his statement. Last year we exported 271,000 tons of sugar, and that was a big year. The normal annual export is 170,000 tons, though it may vary a little one way or the other from time to lime. If the present depression of the world's sugar market continues, it will be ;i poor outlook for the people in the sugar areas of Queensland and the northern rivers of New South Wales. There is every possibility that sugar-growing south of Gympie may be abandoned, and I think that perhaps it may be abandoned oven farther north than that before long. One mill has recently been closed in the Childers district. When I first knew this area there were three mills in it, but now there is only one. This is due to the adoption of more efficient methods of handling the crop, and to concentration in milling and sugar production generally. The honourable member for Denison said that if only 13 per cent, of the sugar-growers were able to pay income taxation, it was questionable whether the industry was worth maintaining, but he must realize that this low percentage is due to the depression which has affected Queensland in common with the other Mr Martens. States of the Commonwealth. The sugar growers are not responsible for the world depression from which we are suffering. Many of these people were encouraged to become sugar-growers by the promises of the former Prime Minister. The developments which followed the protection afforded to the industry by the GoThe price of sugar is vernment led by that right honourable gentleman caused its expansion at a much more rapid rate than was expected; but I believe that before long the industry will be stabilized. The position will gradually right itself, and we shall not then have an excessive exportable surplus. It has been said frequently that assistance has been given to the sugar industry at an excessive cost to Australia; but these arguments are nearly always based on unsound premises. Personally, I do not object to the granting of adequate protection to an industry. In this connection I may well ask how much more the people of Australia are paying per lb. for butter because of what has been called "" curse "". Still, I cannot remember that any body of industrialists in any part of Australia has carried a resolution protesting against the price of any primary product, including sugar or butter, which is produced under Australian conditions. Generally speaking, our working people are prepared to pay a higher price than world parity for the things they need, because they believe that by so doing they will assist to build up Australian industries. I shall have no hesitation whatever in supporting this agreement. glad that the Government has given this opportunity for the discussion of the sugar agreement. It was time that we were granted an opportunity to discuss it. I appreciate the fact that the agreement which we are now asked to ratify provides for a slight reduction of the price of sugar to the Australian consumers. But I must, nevertheless, oppose the bill. We have heard a great deal of special pleading this afternoon in the interests of this industry. I listened with a good deal of pleasure to the speech of the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin), who has recently visited Queensland and personally investigated this industry. I try to look at the sugar industry in its broad",35,Marketing
124,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [5.43],"I amnational aspect. I wish for equality of sacrifice in this as in all other Australian industries. We have industries which are of very much greater importance to Australia than the sugar industry of Queensland, and yet have not been accorded the favoured treatment that this industry has received. The sugar industry has been put in what might be called the A class; but I can see no justification for a differentiation or a grading of our industries. The application of different standards of living and different wages and conditions to various industries iu Australia is one of our greatest troubles. It cannot truly be claimed that the sugar industry is advantageous to Australia. ' In my opinion it is a hindrance to the Commonwealth. It is sheltered behind a price which is approximately three times higher .than the world price of sugar. One would expect to hear sound reasons advanced in the National Parliament for a continuance of the protection of this industry by embargoes; but so far,. that has been entrusted to us. There no honourable member has made out. a reasonable case for continuing to load upon the people of Australia the heavy cost of this industry. We know very well that our defence expenditure has been reduced to a very great extent. We are frequently told that the north-east coast of Australia needs defending. Yet Australia is spending twice as much on the sugar industry as she is spending on the whole of her defence services. If the north coast of Australia is so greatly in need of defence, I suggest that we should spend on the provision of that, defence what we are now spending on the protection of the sugar industry. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens) say that the country now under sugar cultivation in North Queensland is capable of producing other commodities. I knew that of my own knowledge, for I lived in Queensland for 2£ years. I knew the north coast of Queensland before it was put under sugar cane, and' while it was still under bananas, and I have seen it since. It could be successfully developed for dairying purposes, and, in my opinion, it would be more to the advantage of Australia to allow it to be used for dairying than to permit its continned use for the development of such an unnatural primary industry as, the sugar industry which must always be a burden on the people of Australia. [Quorum formed.] The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) quite correctly stated that on a previous occasion when I spoke on the sugar industry in this HouseI said that it would be better for the people of Australia to develop the sugar industry in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea than to persevere with the development' of this uneconomic industry in North Queensland. The honourable member has tried to make political capital out of the fact that the Mandated Territory is worked with black labour, and that if we obtained sugar from there it would be black-labour sugar. Buti t must be remembered that we are under an obligation to develop the Mandated Territory, and to report annually on our conduct of the mandate would be nothing improper or infra dig. in our establishing a tropical industry such as the sugar industry in this area. In my opinion, it would be infinitely preferable and to the advantage of this country for us to do so than to bolster up the sugar industry of Australia. Whenever we discuss this industry in this House.we are told about the humid and sweaty conditions under which white people have to work in North Queensland. Thi3 simply supports my view that we should not attempt to establish here industries which are .not suited to thecoun try. We would do better to leave this industry to be carried on in a country to which it is natural, and allow Australian consumers to buy sugar from abroad at less than half the present price. It is clear that there are varying standards set up for those engaged in primary production. Only this week, a representative deputation from all the States waited upon the Prime Minister to ask for assistance to the wheat-growing industry, which is of far more importance than sugar production. The wheat-farmer is producing at less than cost; he has asked for certain assistance, which has been refused. Over 75 per cent, of the growers are bankrupt, yet those people are asked to pay for their sugar approximately three times the price at which they could buy it iu the open market. The wheat export trade upholds the financial credit of Australia, provides a market for the secondary industries, and makes it possible for the sugar industry to continue. It 13 true that during the wartime, the sugar industry proved of , great value to Australia, but so did the wheat industry. The wheat-growers of Australia sold their wheat within the Empire, and for an aggregate return £140,000,000 less than would have been received had the price in the world's markets been obtained. They supplied the Australian market at one-third of the price which other people were paying, for wheat. But what is being done, for this industry in its time of depression? Parliament has burdened it with taxation, high customs duties, embargoes and the like. Is it fair that a Parliament which is supposed to deal out even-handed justice should ask the producers, who are in dire straits,, to continue to make sacrifices for the benefit of the Queensland sugar industry? The honourable member for Capricornia -(. Sir. Forde) referred to the fact that a rebate is allowed on all sugar used in manufacturing for export. It is all, very : well to provide canned fruits and other commodities cheap prices but the people in Australia have to' pay for such concessions. If sugar could be bought, as wheat is .sold, at world's parity,, the people now engaged in growing sugar in Queensland would be employed in factories making 1 Australian Cheaper sugar would mean cheaper jam' .and confectionery, and a lower cost of living. The high price of sugar has in--creased the cost ofliving, and production throughout Australia, so that it is almost impossible for other primary industries to compete in the markets of the world. 'This is a problem which is worthy of the attention of the National Parliament The assistance given to the butter industry was mentioned as a reason why the bolstering of the sugar industry should be continued. 1 have heard the author of the Paterson sfihem'e say in' this"" House -on more than one occasion that if customs duties were reduced, and the bounties, -embargoes, and prohibitions now imposed for the benefit of ofcbeT ifi-dustries were removed, he would be Mr Prowse. the first to propose that all artificial assistance should be withdrawn from, the butter industry. The system of bolstering industrieshas forced the wheat-grower, in self protection, to adopt an uneconomic policy.

From a defence point of view, the north-west coast of Western Australia is just as important as the Queensland coast; in fact, it is nearer to the region from which trouble may arise. which is loaded in favour of the eastern States interferes with the development of that area. The unreasonable bolstering of certain industries in Queensland is one of the main reasons for the great dissatisfaction with federation that exists in the western State. The State which has the greatest export trade per head of population deserves better treatment than Western Australia is getting. The average export production of the whole of Australia is £1.5 per head; the average for Western Australia is £37. The latest report of the Tariff Board emphasizes that the export trade is of prime importance. The people of Western Australia are struggling to produce iu competition with people in other parts of the world, and while so engaged they should not have the additional burden and responsibility of maintaining pampered industries in the eastern States. ber has asked for a wheat bounty. five economists who voluntarily reported to the Bruce-Page Government on the effect of the Australian tariff on export industries, declared that the then tariff imposed a handicap of 9 per cent, on primary production. That warning was ignored, and injury has been added to injury, until to-day the tariff imposes a burden of 15 per cent, on the export industries. At the same time, the price of wheat is lower than it has been at any other time since the 16th century. Australian wheat has to compete with the products of other peoples, black and white; yet the grower is unfairly penalized. asks Parliament for assistance in the form of a bounty on his production ? In the days of their prosperity, the farmers were robbed of their profits by having imposed on them conditions that make their costs of production greater than in any other country. The continuance of the export industries is essential to the solvency of the Commonwealth, but there is'a great risk that they will collapse. The wheat-growers have placed their case before the Government, upon which a. grave responsibility rests. A false step taken now will be difficult to retrace. able member is wandering from the subject of the bill. thing rotten in the state of Denmark. When the value of land which, nominally, is about £13 an acre, increases to £100* au acre merely because of its utilization for the production of sugar cane, honourable members can well understand that this ia a very promising industry to those engaged in it. Why should we bolster up an industry which charges twice as much for sugar-sold locally as for sugar exported? Is the industry giving a fair deal to the people of Australia? exist in respect of the butter industry. I think adequately, with that industry. The value of the sugar lands of Queensland has been enhanced because of unnatural conditions. At the committee stage I propose to move an .amendmeut which, if carried, will enable this House to review the agreement every year, and to adjust prices on the basis of the previous agreement in accordance with the index figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician. Downs) [6.7] -The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) was extremely pessimistic in, his references to the sugar industry. In view of the fact that he resided for some years in the north of Queensland and watched the development of that industry, it is strange that he should tell us, now that he has become a wheat-grower, that the land there is utterly unsuited for the production of sugar. His opinion is contrary to that Isi t any wonder that he of leading experts who have inspected the sugar-growing areas of Queensland, and have expressed their surprise at the wonderful growth of the industry there, arid its great value to Australia.

Sir LITTLET ON GROOM I agree; but because little has been done to develop the north of Western Australia, the honourable member is not prepared to support Queensland industries, which have an excellent chance of success. Because the wheat industry has recently not been too successful, he objects to supships. These men had to bring iuto porting any proposal to give the sugar . industry a reasonable prospect of success. The honourable member has certainly not considered this great problem from a national view-point. must stand on its own feet as other industries do. position of the sugar industry is somewhat different from that of other industries. It has been pointed out by almost every commission which has investigated the conditions of the sugar industry that its development is part and parcel of the national policy which we instituted at the time of federation. At that time Western Australia was faced with the problem of railway connection with the east, and South Australia with the problems of the administration of the Northern Territory and the conservation of the river Murray waters. Every State had its peculiar problems. At federation it was known that Queensland's problem of developing its large areas of sub-tropical and tropical the value of the sugar industry to Auscountry would be transferred to the Commonwealth, and become part and parcel of the national policy. The development of the sugar lands was for years a troublea somewhat narrow view of the value of some problem to the ""Queensland Government, and when transferred to the Commonwealth it became increasingly difficult of solution, hecause of the decision of the Commonwealth to set up the White Australia policy. Associated at that time with the sugar industry was the employmerit of coloured labour, and when coloured labour was removed from Australia, enormous difficulties faced the settlers in the sub-tropical and tropical areas of Queensland. Large areas of land were held, and because of the abolition of black labour, it became necessary to introduce a scheme of closer settlement, so as to enable these holdings to be developed under new economic conditions. Those engaged in the industry accepted the responsibility for the White Australia policy, and applied it to practical working conditions on the cane-fields in the north of Queensland. For the first twenty years those settlers worked hard to re-organize the industry, and they, in common with their wives and children, endured many hardactual being the ideals of the nation. No other country in the world has been faced with the problem of developing large areas of tropical and sub-tropical country under standards and conditions similar to those obtaining in Australia. Tbe industry was gradually established, and from 1920 onwards it increased its efficiency and organization. I doubt whether any other industry in the British dominions has such an effective organization. Every operation from the planting of the cane to its actual marketing is carefully regulated, and is open to the scrutiny of the public. Sitting suspended from 6.15 lo 8 p.m. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) this afternoon delivered a7> admirable speech.

He asked of what use would be the present population of northern Queensland should an enemy invade that State, seeing that no effective method of defence has been organized, and little military equipment is available.

One might ask the honourable member of what use would be the present population of Tasmania were that State attacked by a hostile fleet, seeking to make the island a base for an attack on the mainland. I doubt whether the people of Australia as a whole understand what the -sugar industry means to this country. At least £50,000,000 has been invested in the ' industry, of which £20,000,000 represents the capital value of sugar-proreturn which the industry receives. ducing land, and £10,000,000 represents the value of the mills. The last mill erected on the Tulley River by the State Government for the growers cost £800,000. It is estimated that 120,000 persons are dependent on the industry. There are 10,000 cane-growers, and about 20,000 persons are engaged in the producthey work. This is recognized by the tion of raw sugar. When we consider the population which the industry supports, the benefit derived from it by the shipping companies and the railways; when we note the growth of such towns as Cairns, with a population of 9,000, of Townsville, Mackay, Bundaberg, and Maryborough, we begin to understand how deeply rooted is the industry throughout northern and central Queensland. About £10,000,000 worth of sugar is produced each year, and the population engaged in its production provides a valuable home market for the products of southern industries. If the-sugar industry of Queensland were wiped out, a serious blow would be struck at the industries of New South Wales, Victoria, and even of Tasmania. People in the north are prone to turn their attention to the products of the south and consume a good deal of southern jams and fruits, instead of using exclusively their own tropical fruits. Large quantities of tinned fruits and jams from the southern States are consumed in Queensland. An injury done to any important industry would hurt the whole nation, so that the preservation of the Queensland sugar industry is a matter of national importance. The honourable member for Denison referred to the wages paid to those employed in the sugar industry. Mr Brigden, the economist, in a paper read in Sydney before the Australian Association for the advancement of Science, analysed the cost of producing sugar in Queensland. Por a ton of sugar, he said, labour costs amounted to £9, materials to £5, and interest and depreciation to £4, making a total of £18. It will be seen, therefore, that labour costs represent about 50 per cent, of the cost of production. We have to ask ourselves whether the workers in the north are being paid such extraordinarily high rates of wages that we are justified iu making serious inroads into the I suggest that an examination of the facts will reveal that they are not. It will be admitted, of course, that workers in Queensland must be paid rates relatively the same as those paid in the south, but something extra must be paid because -of the peculiar conditions under which Commonwealth Government, which pays its married employees in Cairns £40 a year as a tropical allowance, and single employees £20 a year. These public servants are employed in customs or other offices doing indoor work, yet they are held to be entitled to a tropical allowance. Surely the men who are doing field labour under tropical conditions are entitled to such an allowance. According to figures supplied to me by the Commonwealth Statistician, the weighted cost of living index figure for the six capital cities in November, 1931, was 1276. Por Hobart the figure was 1281, but for Cairns it was 1421. These figures cover the cost of food and groceries and a fourroomed cottage. Thusi t is evident that workers in the north are entitled to something extra to compensate for the higher cost of living. member say why the cost of living should be so high in a district which is so rich? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -Cairns is more than 900 miles north of Brisbane, and depends largely for its supplies on snipping. Those engaged in production there are not responsible for the conditions which make for high costs. The honourable member for Denison quoted the wages paid to the field workers as £4 7s. a week. That is in the northern district, but in the central district it is SA Is., and in the south, £3 17 s.",40,Marketing
139,Mr Hutchtn,"Can the honorableThe wage for field labourers works out at 2s. an hour. Included in the wage paid to sugar-workers cutting under contract is an allowance of 10s. Wages in the sugar areas are not excessive when compared with wages paid in southern States. Wages are fixed by duly appointed' tribunals, and are revised from time to time. Men working under contract earn about SOs. a day, but their work is seasonal, and they are paid an allowance of 10s. a week because of that. The same condition labourers, &c, wliose occupations are seasonal. During certain months of the year there is no cane-cutting to be done, 30 that it is not fair to compare the wages paid to cane-flutters with those paid to workers iu regular occupations, in Tasmania, for instance. they come into the cities and get the dole. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -^-General observations of that kind are unfair to the working men of Australia. It is only just that men who are employed for only part of the year should be able to earn enough-not , perhaps, to keep them for the whole year-bu t something extra to make up for the time they will be out of work. It cannot fairly be claimed that this industry is being unduly pampered. It is working under similar conditions relatively to those of the industries in the south. ber for Denison( Mr Hutchin) also raised the subject of land values. It is true and perfectly natural that when high prices for sugar prevailed, high land values existed. Is that characteristic onlyof sugar lands in North Queensland? . Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -It has general application. On this subject, the sugar inquiry committee statesThere is little doubt in our opinion that proupon it by the protection given to the indusperties have changed, hands at prices in excess of their productive value, and are based upon the remunerative price obtained for sugar prior to the time that the loss on exported sugar commenced to be felt in reduced returns to the growers and millers'. It is questionable whether this tendency is any more marked in the sugar industry than in other rural industries where there -has been a keen demand for Iand largely as a result of the encouragement f which'has been given by governments to-land settlement, the creation of a sheltered market, and high world prices for 'primary products. According to the evidence there has been a falling off in the demand for sugar lands during the past few years owing to the present low prices of sugar in the overseas market, which render the exportable surplus unprofitable and have resulted in diminished returns to the industry. The committee did not base the cost of production on high land values. It fixed a value of £46 an acre, and applied it to this land, originally jungle country, which was cleared and, by intense cultivation, brought up to its present state of perfecapplies to shearers, wharf tion. As a comparison, take potato land in Victoria, for which a price of £100 an acre is not unusual. an unusual price. in the Warrnambool district brought £130 an acre. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -When peak prices reigned, land in the south went up to £100 just as did sugar land. Land values everywhere have now come down to a normal basis. When you make an agreement which is intended to stabilize an industry, you must base it on stabilized land values. The value adopted by the committee was arrived at after exhaustive investigation by valuers, employed by the Government. I remind honourable members who represent southern parts of Australia, that a portion of the cost of carrying on the The honourable memsugar industry is represented by the amount which those engaged in the industry pay to maintain other Australian national industries. Of this they make no complaint. Professor Bridgen. subjected the matter to careful and critical analysis from an entirely impersonal point of view, and reportsThe sugar industry and its cost to AustraUa. cannot be discussed intelligently apart from other protected industries. A very substantial part of tlie gross cost to Australia is imposed tries whose products it consumes. Both thecapital and the running costs are "" inflated"" from this cause. What follows is Professor Bridgen's opinion, and does not necessarily have my endorsement;It is quite possible that the remarkable and unexampled feat could be accomplished of sustaining a white labour sugar ""industry at no cost 1 at all; if itproduced only for home consumption, and was relieved of .the costs of protecting",41,Marketing

146,Mr Riordan,"The honourable' memthan the honorahle member who interjects. He paid the price of adhering to principle by being forced to remain for three years out of Parliament. The honourable member for Darling Downs does not stand for the production of our foodstuffs by black people while our men, women and children walk aboutthe streets unemployed. He advocates decent living conditions for Australians. I was pleased to hear the honourable member put the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) right. Listening to the latter, one would imagine that the workers who cut cane in North Queensland were making a fortune from their endeavours. He would also have one to believe that, although to-day the sugar consumers of Australia will pay the same price for sugar as they did in 1922, the growers are receiving the price that was paid to them in that year. That is not sugar industry has for a long time been the stalking horse of ' the Federal Parliament. an exhaustive inquiry was held into the sugar industry, as the result of which an agreement was made which the sugar growers thought gave them security in certain respects, though not in regard to price, for three years. That committee presented both a majority and a minority report. In the minority report it was recommended that definite steps should be taken to reduce the amount of unprofitable production. The minority considered that if this were done the price of sugar could be reduced by i d . per lb. Rut why should so much fuss be made about a variation in production? If the Australian sugar consumers are to be assured of continuity of supplies there must be a surplus in some years. We cannot govern seasonal conditions. Why should a surplus worry us so long as the industry is worked on economical and efficient lines and the price is averaged? Roth the majority and the minority reports of the committee made it clear that the Australian sugar industry was conducted more efficiently than the sugar industries of many other countries. Yet we find members of the United Australia Party and the United Country Party condemning this industry. The honourable Mr Riordan. member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) has condemned it this afternoon because a certain measure of protection has heen granted to it. But this honourable gentleman held out his hand last year for the wheat bounty! If sugar were grown in his electorate he would be fighting harder for the industry than the men who were actually producing the sugar. The honourable gentleman has said that this industry is unsound because it needs protection. He thinks that industries should be allowed to find their natural level. Apparently he would like to see Kanakas in Australia growing both wheat and sugar, for both these primary producing industries are at present in need of assistance. As the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) pointed out last night, in discussing the banana industry, a great deal of employment is given to the people of Queensland by this industry. The honourable gentleman said that only white people were employed in the the case. Undoubtedly, the industry, and that the only unemployed person in one district was a black man. If the honourable member for Forrest Only last year had his way all the black men would be given employment and all the white men would be left unemployed. The honourable gentleman is one of the leading members of the Country party. It will be remembered that last year when it was proposed that the Country party should fuse with the United Australia Party, it was commonly said that the three big P's of the Country party, Page, Paterson and Prowse, would become members of the Ministry. It is interesting, therefore,. to read the comment which appeared in an article headed ""Not Natural"" in the Queensland Producer of the 9th November, 1932, on the honourable member for Forrest. I make the following quotations from the article:"" I am not supporting the sugar industry; it is not a natural primary industry. I have no sympathy with tlie development of any industry that is not natural to the country. If Australia were to do the right thing in regard to its sugar industry, it would pay attention to the possibilities of the Mandated Territory. The Queensland sugar-growers obtained their best varieties of cane from New Guinea and the Mandated Territory. There is a coloured population in that territory and they have to live. If we grew our sugartherc we should be able to purchase it at half the present priee. The unnatural sugar industry can never be of advantage to Australia."" So declared Mr J. H. Prowse, a Westwas to assure to them a reliable market ern Australian Country party member in the House of Representatives (vide Federal Hansard, 18/3/32). If the honourable member for Forrest were consistent he would not have stretched out his hand last year for the wheat bounty, but would have said that as wheat production was unprofitable in Australia he intended to move his plant, lock, stock and barrel, to the Mandated Territory, where wheat could be grown under natural conditions. from which I have just quoted continues as follows:For an example of muddled thinking this, we think, is without parallel in this year of grace. Although we have become more or less accustomed to the vapourings of politicians during the depression, and the presentation of ""wildcat"" theories, the above statement is surely the most extraordinary ever emanating from an individual outside of Bedlam. In this connection the following jingle from the pen of Stephen Leacock, is particularly apposite:"" When the politicians' politics are written that the Australian sugar consumers are out in ink, And their true convictions set in black and white, Then a chemical analysis of what they really Java, Cuba and other black-labour think Would leave nothing hut a vacuum in sight."" "" Vacuum"" certainly seems to be the right word to apply to the weird views expressed by the honourable member from Western Australia, and "" vacuum "" fittingly describes the mind that is responsible for them. Those comments were made by a newspaper which supports the party of which the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) is a shining light, and, in fact, one of the three big P's. able member told us this afternoon that he had lived for 2£ years in Queensland, but he was there as an insurance agent, not as a sugar expert. When he knew the country now under sugar cultivation' it was impossible to cut a way through it with a scrub knife, and it was thought that it would never be settled by white men. The honourable member would have found it impossible to get an insurance policy in these areas at that time because the White Australia policy was not then in force there. All the country along the Queensland north coast railway is now population. These people are livin g on land which is their own and developing an industry which is of great value to Australia. The object of the sugar agreement made by the Scullin Government for their products. I shall now make some reference to a public servant of this country, the Commonwealth Auditor-General. This gentleman is not an expert in the sugar industry, but he has seen fit to poke his nose into a business of which he knows nothing, and he has been allowed to do so without being challenged by the Government. I believe that he was challenged The article by Mr Curlewis, of the Australian Sugar Producers Association, and Mr Doherty, of the Queensland Cane-growers Council, through the Assistant Minister( Mr. Francis), but this honourable gentleman did not stand up to the fight, and was not prepared to bring the Auditor-General to his bearings. This public servant having stated, in his official report, that the old-age pensioners of this country were getting too much when they were getting 17s. 6d. a week, went on to say paying too much for their sugar, and should be permitted to buy sugar from countries. In my opinion, the Government should have taken him definitely to task for his comments on the sugar industry. The Country party prates often enough about being the friend of the man on the land. If it would join with the members of this party and certain other honourable members of the Housei t would be possible to compel the Government to protect the interests of this section of The honorthe primary producers. We are faced with the position that an agreement reached by two governments can be broken on a change of government. Although the Scullin Government made an agreement with the Queensland Government, the Lyons Government has seen, fit to interfere with it to such an extent that it was not worth the paper it was written on. This Government has dealt with this agreement as it has dealt with the determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator. If this kind of thing is allowed to continue our people settled permanently by a white will soon think that even 'agreements made between governments cannot be relied upon even for 24 hours. Eveni f this bill were passed and a double dissolution occurred to-morrow, with , a consequent change of government, we might find the new government interfering again with this, the sugar industry. I wish .to place on record a statement made by the Secretary of the Australian Sugar Producers Association Limited, Mr F. C. P. Curlewis, and the Secretary of the Queensland Cane-growers Council, Mr W. H . Doherty, dealing with the remarks of the Auditor-General on the sugar industry. I should like afterwards to hear the views of the Assistant Minister( Mr Francis) on the same subject. The statement readsI t will be remembered that that section of the annual report of the Commonwealth Auditor-General dealing with the sugar industry was recently reproduced in every paper of importance in Australia, with the result that leading articles and general comments that are unfavorable to the industry have been published iu most of these journals. A statement hy the secretaries of the two sugar organizations, dealing with this report and commenting upon its many inaccuracies, appeared in the Brisbane papers, and it is undersugar available, in store in Sydney or Melstood that this statement was telegraphed to tliq southern papers, though, iu most cases, it of duty: appeared in a condensed 3orm only. One of the statements of the Auditor-General that called for particular comment was as follows: ."" To import the sugar required for Australia would cost about £2,000,000."" Tho Hon. J. Francis, a Queensland member nf the House of Representatives, and Assistant Minister for Defence, was asked to tiring the matter before the Federal Cabinet with a view to the Auditor-General being asked to review the sugar section of his report. Figures were ((noted in the communication placed before tlie Government, showing that on the latest determinations of imported sugar values, the Auditor-General was in error to the extent of £2,000,000 on a duty free basis. On the 20th March, a communication was received from the Hon. ,T. Francis, advising that the Auditor-General had replied to a letter from the Prime Minister On the subject, to the effect that he (the Auditor-General) had nothing to add to his report. As a public servant, the Auditor-General should have been asked to adduce facts and figures in support of his statement that sugar could' be imported more cheaply than it is being supplied by the local industry. He implied that both the majority and minority reports of the Sugar Inquiry Committee were false, and that the members of the committee Were scoundrels who were working in conjunction with the sugar industries to defraud the people of Australia. The Government having failed to make the Auditor-General stand up to his allegaMr Riordan. tions, this Parliament should do so. The statement continuesThe Auditor-General stated that, '""""Toi m port the sugar required for Australia would cost about £2,000,000."" This, on his own estimate of local consumption, is equivalent tostating that sugar can be landed in Australia for £0 13s. 4d. per ton. Now, on the l s t February, about three weeks before the issue of the Auditor-General's Report, the official committee whose business it is to -determine the price at which sugar can be landed in Australia, held its usual monthly meeting. This committee consists of three representative men, namely, Mr A. R. Townsend, representing the Commonwealth Government, Mr O. J. Matthews (of Matthews, Thompson &, Co., Sydney), representing the export manufacturers, and Mr W. J, Short, representing theQueensland Sugar Board. It has been functioning for many years, .and as the result of its determination each month, the rebate payable to manufacturers using Australian sugar in goods for exportis arrived at. This committee, at the meeting above referred .to, found that to land Czechoslovakia refined sugar, which at that time was the cheapest refined bourne, would cost £13 7s. 6d. per ton, free ""Whose w o r d is P a r l i a m e n t to accept? If the A u d it o r G e n e r al is r i g h t , the m e m bers of the committee of in q u i r y m u s t be discredited. The y were appointed to look a f t e r the interests of the C o m m o n wealth.

He suggests t h a t t h e y are three crooks. If t h e i r r e p o r t is bona fide, they m u s t r e g a r d h i m as a crook, or at any rate, as one whose statements cannot be relied u p o n . I continue the .quotationThe committee also found that to land Java raw and to pay all refining expenses, would cost £14 13s. 2d., 'free of duty. This plainly shows tliat to land 300,000 tons of refined jugar in Australia would cost over £4,000,000 free of duty, and to land and refine 300,000 tons of Java raws_ would cost over £4,300,000 free of duty, and not the £2,000,000 stated by the Auditor-General. It must he particularly noted that the above calculation is on a duty free basis: but, there has been a duty of £9 6s. Sd. per ton on raw sugar, and of £14 per ton ou other sugars since 1922; so, to land foreign sugar under the statutory conditions that have obtained in Australia for the last ten years would, at present, cost £5,700,000 in the case of Java raws (to which would have to be added the cost of refining£1.250.000) and £8.200.000 in the case of refined sugar. And yet the Auditor-General says that he has nothing to add to his report. And the Government allowed him to evade his responsibility in that way. Was his statement regarding invalid and old age-pensions and other social services as unreliable as his statement regarding sugar? The statement continuesTlie calculations set out in this statement are confirmed in a memorandum furnished by Mr A. R. Townsend relative to tlie price of sugar in connection with the f r u it industry, and which recently appeared in the press. We know Messrs. Townsend and Short; every member of the House would back their knowledge and experience of sugar against those of the Auditor-General. Continuing, Messrs. Curlewis and Doherty sayl t is therefore to be borne hi mind tliat the figures submitted herein are based, not on information supplied by those interested in the sugar industry, but upon the official finding of a special committee, and that they are supported in a statement prepared by an officer of the department administering the sugar industry control. There is no question, therefore, of a special cose being stated iu the interests of the sugar industry. l u view of the attitude taken up by the Auditor-General we are, not only in justice to our industry but to the community generally, constrained to bring this matter under public notice, and we therefore ask that the fullest publicity be given to this statement, because if the Auditor-General's assertions arc not challenged, they will naturally be accepted as the true basis of the comparative costs of producing sugar in Australia, and of importing it. If the Government will not accept the reports of Messrs. Townsend and Short, 1 hope that it ""will give ci-edence to the information here furnished by Messrs. Curlewis and Doherty, both of whom are actively engaged in sugar production, and understand the industry from A to Z. mates were wrong, the exporters would soon have cried out. Messrs. Curlewis and Doherty continueThere are one or two points in the statement just issued by us dealing with the Auditor-General's Report which evidently require further explanation. It has been pointed out, and rightly so, perhaps, that our rejoinder deals with the landing of refined sugar and is not comparable to the Auditor-General's figure, which deals with the cost of landing raw sugar. As can be seen from figures quoted by us later in the statement, it would cost £5,700,000 to land Java raws, duty paid. Deduct from this the present duty of £9 0s. 8d. per ton, and it will be found that even at the present low -world's value of sugar, tlie cost of landing 300,000 tons of raws would be £2,900,000 duty free. The Auditor-General is, therefore, £900,000 out on a hypothetical basis of free trade. A t this stage, it is well worthy of note thut if free trade were the policy of Australia, costs of production in Australia would necessarily be lower, as wages and all living costs, as well as implements and machinery, would be much reduced in value on the present system or wages determination. In that case, .sugar could be produced in Australia at a lower rate than at present, and therefore, the margin between the value of the imported article and the Australian article would be considerably diminished. It must, therefore, he granted that the figure , of £7,000,000, as the annual cost of the sugar industry to the community, so often quoted in southern publications, is not based upon sound premises. The opinion of these experts cannot fairly be challenged. Anybody seeking reliable information regarding the sugar industry would not go beyond Messrs. Townsend, Short, Curlewis and Doherty. The Australian people are pledged to the maintenance of a White Australia, and surely the people in northern Queensland have some rights under this national ideal. How can we have a White Australia if our people are to carry on their industries under black conditions? We have proved that by efficient control of industry, Australia can compete in the production of sugar with black labour countries, for the statement. I have just read shows that imported sugar would cost a great deal more than the Auditor General has stated. Let us compare the development in northern Queensland with that of the Northern Territory, which is in the same latitude. In 1890, the Northern Territory had a population of 5,000 whites; to-day the number is reduced to 3,000, notwithstanding that the Commonwealth has expended £8,000,000 upon the upkeep of the territory. In the same period, the population of northern Queensland has increased by over 200 per cent. It would pay the Commonwealth to move the 3,000 white residents of the Northern Territory into northern Queensland, and establish them in the cane-growing industry or to the metropolitan areas, and there maintain them on the basic wage with nothing to do. Some critics of the sugar industry ask why an embargo on imports is necessary. If the embargo were withdrawn, surely the industry would be entitled to reasonable protection so that it could compete on a ""business basis,"" as",43,Marketing
147,Mr Scullin,-If the committee's esti,47,Marketing
148,Mr Riordan,"That is true.the British manufacturers are to be permitted to do under the Otttawa agreement. With reasonable protection of the local industry, tlie people would not be getting their sugar more cheaply than at the present time. At the retail prices now ruling, sugar costs a family of four approximately £1 9s. per annum; the reduction of \d. per lb. under this agreework ment will reduce the cost to £1 6s. If the many members of this House, and demands of the Housewives Association were conceded, the husbands of many of those women would be robbed of their employment. The Sugar Bounty Act was repealed in 1913, but Australia is pledged of the conditions which prevailed before to the maintenance of the White Australia ideal, and surely our people are prepared to pay an additional ^d. per lb. for sugar to preserve the industry of the white people in the north. I remind the one-eyed city protectionists that the machinery installed in the sugar industry has cost about £10,000,000, of which £3,000,000 worth was bought from the United Kingdom, and the remainder was produced in Australia by Australian artisans. Where do the representatives of the workers engaged in the iron and steel industry gard Nearly £2,000,000 worth of sugar is exported each year and to that extent the sugar industry is helping to balance Australia's accounts. In addition, the raw sugar for home consumption is worth about £9,000,000. If this were imported, we should have to pay for most of it in gold. We have exported practically all our gold, and if we were dependent on imported sugar and could not pay for it in gold, we should have to do without sugar. Some people take sugar in tea, some in beer, and others in sweets. I, for one, should not like to do without sugar. Over 20,000 people are employed in the sugar industry, many of them coming from the southern States. It is estimated that after the crushing season the sum of £1,000,000 in wages is taken out of Queensland to the southern States, in particular to Victoria and Tasmania. Did the honourable member for Denison( Mr are affected by boom periods. For Hutchin), when he visited the sugar areas of Queensland, compare the conditions of the workers there with those obtaining at the zinc works on the Derwent River? Did he inspect the workers' huts, which iir. Riordan. have been built under the Hut Accommodation Act of Queensland? I can assure him that there is nothing elaborate about them and that they would not compare with, say, a room at the Kurrajong Hotel. The worker of this country should be given reasonable conditions. The misfortune of having to may, before long, befall those who are to-day criticizing the cane-cutter may, to-morrow, be anxious to obtain his job. Many honourable members would like to see a return legislation was passed compelling employers to provide proper conditions for their employees. At least 120,000 people are directly, and probably 250,000 indirectly, dependent on the sugar inindustry. I am making these facts known to honourable members and to the public generally so that the people of the southern States may refuse to heed the propaganda that is being spread there in an effort to injure the sugar industry of Queensland. It has been suggested that that industry could be replaced by other stand in reindustries. One honourable member has to the sugar producers? suggested that it could he replaced by the dairying industry, but I assure him that that would be impossible. I admit that the sugar lands could be used for the growing of citrus fruits and maize, but the difficulty would be to find a market for those products. Even the maize growers on the Atherton Tablelands cannot find a market for their products. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) has declared the value of the sugar lands to be far too high. Land values in Australia have previously boomed and declined. In the 'nineties they boomed and collapsed. A few years ago there was another boom in land values, and many people burnt their fingers by overcapitalizing thei-r lands and securing bank overdrafts. When the owners are ultimately sold up by the banks, their lands will resume their normal value. Cane farms, like all other lands, a well improved farm, equipped with up-to-date farm implements and buildings, with a standing crop ready for harvest, £100 per acre is by no means an excessive price. The average price of cane farms, however, is about £40 per acre. A well-equipped cane farm of 40 acres, cleared for cultivation, with buildings, implements, and horses, will cost £80 per acre without a crop of cane. Tbe cost of clearing stunted timber on tobacco areas is £14 an acre, and ofclearing scrub areas about £30 an acre. The raw sugar industryreceives for the sugar consumed in Australia a fraction over 3d. per lb. That sum is divided between the producer and the raw sugar manufacturer on a basis of approximately two-thirds to the grower, and one-third to the miller. The grower, therefore, receives for his sugar for home consumption about 2d. per lb., or the price at which the manufacturing companies say that the same class of sugar can be imported from Java where men, women and children are employed at less than Is. a day. In 1931, because of the exports of sugar, the average price of raw sugar was £18 6s. 6d., which represents a fraction over l i d . per lb. to its high standard of efficiency. As the the grower. Queensland is interested in refined sugar only to the extent of the requirements of that State, because the balance of Australia's requirements is refined in the other States. Therefore, the sugar industry of Queensland provides considerable employment in the other States, and if it wore allowed to languish, those engaged on the refining process would become unemployed. sugar experts from all over the World, that our mills compare at least favourably with factories in other sugar countries. In no other country in the world is less cane required to mate a ton of sugar. The output per acre has increased. About 30 years ago, Queensland produced l £ tons of sugar per acre, and to-day it produces over 2\ tons per acre. A tribunal was appointed by the Federal Government to ascertain what was a fair and reasonable price for raw sugar. That tribunal consisted of two accountants appointed by the Federal Government, one representing the consumers, and one the Federal Government, and two representatives of the raw sugar industry. It inquired into the wages paid under the ""White Australia policy, the cost of cultivation, harvesting, the capital required to establish a sugar farm, the cost of manufacture, including overhead charges in' the mill, interest on capital, and depreciation of plant, and after a most exhaustive inquiry decided that raw sugar could not be produced in an average season in an average district at under £27 per ton. Of course, as in all other industries, there are exceptions in especially favorable circumstances. member's time has expired. Minister for Defence) [9.12] -As one who has always been a keen supporter of the sugar industry in Queensland, I was particularly pleased to hear honourable members, on the first occasion given to them to discuss the sugar agreement, express their general approval of it. There has been practically little or no hostile criticism of the industry. On the contrary, there has been a general appreciation of it3 national importance, and particularly of The sugar industry of people have gained a knowledge of this industry and its problems, it has grown in their estimation. Honourable members have discussed the details of the industry. They have referred to its growth, the number of persons employed, and the capital invested in it. I propose not to traverse that ground, but merely to reply briefly to the criticism which some honourable members, particularly the It is admitted by honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), have levelled at the industry. He had the audacity to say that the price charged to the ponsumer in Australia was three times world parity. If this agreement is approved by the Parliament, the price of sugar on and after the 5th January next, will be 4d. per lb. The average retail price in the six principal countries of Europe is 3.8d. per lb., which almost equals the price that will rule in Australia under the agreement. In effect, the European price will be much higher than the Australian price, because the standard of living, and the purchasing power of money in Europe are much lower than they are in this country. The honorahle member for Forrest, in his criticism, was a lone voice Crying in the wilderness. He was practically the sole opponent of the agreement. The honourable member -for",47,Marketing
149,Mr Speaker,The honourable,49,Marketing
150,Mr Francis (Moreton,"AssistantDenison( Mr Hutchin), although he made a carefully prepared and able speech, erred glaringly in his criticism of the bill. He intimated that the tendency in Queensland was not to favour reciprocal trade with other States. That is not so. The balance of trade between Queensland and the other States is definitely in favour of the latter. During 1931, the latest year for which figures are available, Queensland imported goods from the south to the value of £11,332,617, and exported to the southern States only £9,314,658 worth of goods, of which two-thirds was raw sugar. The significance of these figures lies in the fact that, while the balance of trade in favour of the southern States was something over £2,000,000, two-thirds of Queensland's exports was represented by sugar, which does not come into competition with any of the goods manufactured in the other States. In all the capital cities of the southern States refineries and processing works have been established which handle Queensland sugar and give employment to large numbers of workers. Every year considerable sums are paid in freight to the shipping companies and railway services of other States on sugar produced in Queensland. In order to show the value of the sugar trade to Tasmania, I quote the following extract from The Australian Sugar Journal of Queensland :Another light on inter-State affecting the sugar trade is seen iu the latest report of the Registrar-General, Porter. whilst exports from Queensland to Tasmania were valued at £12,034, the imports into this State from Tasmania amounted to £179,751. Mi"". Porter, of course, recognizes that sugar does not come into the returns of our exports to Tasmania, from the fact that her supplies aro receivod from the refineries in Melbourne and Sydney, and these amounted to £421,000. A substantial proportion of this sum was due, however, to refining charges earned in Victoria or in New South Wales. Owing probably to the depression as well, perhaps, as to seasonal vicissitudes, 1'930-31 was an unfavorable year for Tasmania's trade with Queensland. Tasmania found a market in Queensland to the amount of over £250,000 sterling, little of which would have been available hut for tlie .existence of tlie sugar industry in this State. labour employed in North Queensland canefields is probably the largest source of demand for Tasmania™ respect of fresh fruit; tout fruit in otlier forms Mr Framcif exported to Queensland .in 1929-30 represented a total of nearly. £72,000, and of this 'the largest item was for jams and jellies, which, of course, included quite a substantial proportion of the sugar manufactured in Queensland,,, refined, say, in Melbourne, and processed in Tasmania, returned to North Queensland in Australian manned ships, wliose home ports are in the southern States. Perhaps no -more striking example of the wide distribution of benefits from the Queensland Bugar industry could be quoted. I trust that the honourable member for Denison is beginning to understand that, far from it being a fact that Queensland will not trade on a reciprocal basis with the other States, the balance of trade is definitely in favour of the southern States, while the trade with Tasmania is overwhelmingly in favour of that State. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) complained because the price of sugar had been reduced by only 11 per cent., whereas the general reductions provided for in the Premiers plan averaged 22£ per cent. I remind the honourable member that this industry began to suffer cuts as long ago as 1915. The moderate peak price of sugar, which stood at 6d. per lb., was reduced by Id. per lb. in 1922 ; and by a further -&d. in 1923. Thus the industry has had applied to it a series of financial emergency reductions which did not begin to apply to other industries on anything like the same scale until 1930. During the war, when the price of sugar in Australia was 6d. per lb., the price in Great Britain and European countries relations as varied from Is. 6d. to Is. lOd. per lb. At Mr George that time the price of wool went as high It appears that in the year 1930-31,as 44d. per lb., and wheat went up to 9s. a bushel. The present reduction of £&. per lb. brings the price down to 4d., which is 33 per cent, below the peak price. The Commonwealth Statistician's figures show that the average retail price of commodities is now 32 per cent, below the peak period in 1920, showing that the new price for sugar is in line with, the average price for all food and groceries. During tlie period 1920 to 1930'co.nsumers have enjoyed the benefits, of a lower price In 1929-30 the primary industries of relatively for sugar than they paid for other commodities. At 4d. per lb.., the but price of sugar is only S3 per cent, above the usual pre-war price, whereas the preIt is liable to be forgotten tliat the sent prices of other commodities are 40 per cent, higher. Moreover, the price of 4d. per lb. is uniform throughout all the products, except,, perhaps, in States of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) took exception to the fact that there was no reference to sugar in the Ottawa agreement. V remind the honourable member that, as a result of the Ottawa agreement, the sugar mdustry will continue to benefit to the extent -of the £1,000,000 preference w h i c h it has been e n j o y in g for some years past. In t h is connection, the ResidentM in is t e r in L o n don has cabled to tlie Government^I have now received a letter from the British Government giving the following assurance that so long as the agreement (five years) with Australia remains in force the existing preferuntial margins on sugar and wine (except those otherwise provided in -the .agreement) will not be reduced without the consent of the Commonwealth Government. The honorahle member for Capricornia is the pnly one who has endeavoured to make this. agreement a football in the party political game, and I regret that he has done so. He contended that r.be agreement had .been forced upon the growers at the point .of the pistol. I .rpmjnd him, and other honourable. members, thai the .agreement was entered into yojuntarily. Melbourne, the Prime Minister .stated definitely that if there was, to be any alteration of the sugar agreement it must be' a voluntary one, arranged between the parties concerned. A t the conference held in Brisbane, and also at the conference in .Canberra, that statement was repeated again.and again. If honourable members choose to look through Hansard, they will see -that the Prime Minister, in reply to numerous questions on the subject, said that there would be no alteration to the agreement except with the consent of the parties. I have before me the notes of the last conference held in Canberra between the Prime Minister and the representatives of'. the sugar industry. The lionorable member for Capricornia made quotations from this report, but he chose to omit some vital passages. Here is one of themassuming, I think-, that if your government do review it (the old agreement) in two years time that they would he fair and reasonable. THE would, nqt think that because you people do not agree, of punishing you for it , No suggestion of the kind, but we would take a l l the. fac^s into consideration, and the circumstances of other industries in the country. Do not ibe afraid that any punishment w ill be inflicted if we cannot come to an agreement, but I point out that you have got to take all the political chances of the future in -regard to that matter, because suppose even the price w ill be fixed to the end of the term,, you have no guarantee whatever that this whole thing will not be turned up. That is the point. You have no guarantee that it will remain. You have got my promise that this Government w ill take no part in that. In so far as we .can do it we will maintain it . The otheT Government committed us, and we -have simply taken their place, as a new set of directors of a company as it were, and -we .are under the same moral obligations. But we cannot answer for Parliament, nor for the law. I tell you this, if the law said immediately, "" This thing is not valid,"" that would not alter .my attitude. Here is another extract in which the Minister refers to the terms of the proposed new agreementI f the industry prefers that, we cannot touch it (the agreement), because I refuse to.touch it without your consent. It is evident, therefore, that the Prime Minister made it clear that no alteration would ""he made without the consent of the growers. The delegates to the At the Loan Council in conference voluntarily agreed to a reduction, and forwarded their recommendations to the growers, who later decided to accept the agreement we are now discussing. The agreement was drafted and sent to the Queensland Government. The Premier of Queensland signed it, and returned it for the Prime Minister's signature. There was no alteration of the agreement, and no recommendation for any alteration. It was suggested by the honourable member for. Capricornia ( Mr Forde) that bogies have been, raised to scare those in the sugar industry. In my judgment, no. other industry is better organized or controlled, or has more efficient officers. They were satisfied that the difficulties under which the industry laboured under the Scullin. agreement were not bogies. There is no doubt that the so-called bogies were carefully considered at the conference by representatives of the growers, whose members were perfectly satisfied that the decision of the High Court in the Wool Tops case made it possible that the old agreement might Court indicated clearly that, though the individual who took action to try to have the agreement offset had no standing in",49,Marketing
151,Mr Dohekty,"-We w ill he quite right i nthe eyes of the court, "" the public is not nor should be without a remedy; the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of any of the States sufficiently interested might take proceedings necessary to protect their rights and their interests"". It is well known that the Attorney-General of at least one State was quite willing to assist in taking proopposed the ratification of the agreement ceedings for a variation of the old agreement. Growers and every one else who know the facts of the case will admit that, had that action been taken, it would not have been possible to maintain the industry in its previous position. I also point out the dangers to which the industry would have been subjected had the amendment been made to the Customs Act which was proposed in another place. All those factors played their part in influencing representatives of the industry to arrive at their decision. To the sugar-growers the main advantage of this agreement is that it gives them ing sugar under White Australian confor at least four years a security which cannot be challenged. Even the honourable member for Kennedv( Mr Riordan) declared that the other agreement was not worth the paper it was written on. More than £30,000,000 is invested in the sugar industry, and thousands of growers, and many towns and cities in northern and southern Queensland are entirely dependent upon it. If , because it had no security, it were abolished, the damage to those cities, those people, and Australia generally, would be incalculable. Therefore, I commend the growers for having accepted the agreement and gained a four-years' security of tenure. I am glad that the growers have voluntarily amended the old conditions and ensured the industry against any proceedings of the court designed to destroy the previous agreement. In conclusion, I am particularly glad that honourable members have adopted an entirely new attitude towards the Queensland sugar industry, due, I feel sure, to a greater knowledge of the facts, gained as a result of the investigations by the Sugar Committee inquiry, and subsequent negotiations and conferences in Brisbane and Canberra. I feel confident that, under the new agreement, the industry will live to experience greater security fication of the old agreement, and obtainand prosperity than ever before. [Quorum formed.] Mr Francis. [9.36] -We are considering the ratification of the sugar agreement, which was formulated by the Commonwealth and Queensland Parliaments in co-operation with the sugar-growers. When we consider the past history of the sugar industry, we must admit that anybody who would be doing a disservice to Australia and an injustice to the people who are inhabiting the tropical and sub-tropical portions of Queensland. And when we think of the money that has been expended in a vain endeavour to populate, the Northern Territory, and compare with that expenditure the value which has been won from the soil by the producers of sugar, we must concede the immense advantages that that industry has conferred upon the people of Australia. Those stout-hearted pioneers have set an example to the world by proving that the white man is capable of producditions. We must think, too, of the enormous sums of money that the sugar industry has saved the people of Australia since its destinies have been guided by the Commonwealth Government. Undoubtedly, we are under a moral obligation to those engaged in the industry to ratify this agreement. I greatly appreciate the criticism of the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin), whose contribution to the debate was valuable and interesting. His criticism was intelligent.. But the honourable member based many of his arguments on false premises. It was conceded by the sugar-growers that the old agreement was not watertight, that there was a possibility of the enemies of the industry at any time nullifying the privileges that were given to the growers as a right. That was emphasized by the action taken in another place, when an endeavour was made to amend the Customs Act and cancel the sugar agreement. The decision of the High Court in the wool tops case showed that the sugar industry was in jeopardy. I believe, therefore, that the representatives of the growers were right in agreeing to a modiing security of tenure, even though it meant a loss of £1,300,000 to the growers",51,Prime Minister Of Course We Be Scrapped The Decision Of The High
152,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"and a like advantage to' the consumers. I regret that that reduction was a necessary condition of the new agreement, for I know perfectly well the benefits that the sugar industry has conferred upon the people of Australia. During the war, the sugar-growers were the only section of the producers of the Empire who did not benefit by the extraordinary conditions then prevailing. If the Australian consumers had been required to pay . the price actually paid by British consumers during the years 1915 to 1921, their sugar would have cost them £40,000,000 more than it did. Of course, the British prices were increased by varying amounts of customs revenue duties during most of that time, but, on an absolutely free trade basis, Australian sugar cost, during that period, a'bout £15,000,000 less than black-labour sugar. The following is «.n interesting table showing the respectire. prices in Great Britain and Australia during the term I refer to:Date. per ton. £ s. d. 3rd June, 1915 . . 22nd September, 1915 . . 5th April, 1910 . . 29th May, 1917 . . 22nd April, 1918 29th 1919 . . 22nd March, 1920 (£114) 17th May, 1920 . . 112 0 0 (£160) 1st 1920 . . 27th December, 1920 . . 21st 1921 . . 30th June, 1921 . . 57' 15 0 The minimum retail price in England during those years was Is. 2d. per lb., and in Canada and the United States of America Is. 3d., while it reached Is. 6d. per lb. in France, Italy, and other countries. During most of that period the maximum Australian retail price was only 3-Jd. From March, 1920, to November, 1921, the price was certainly 6d. per lb. in Australia, but Id. of that was required to reimburse the Commonwealth Government for the huge expenditure it incurred in buying foreign sugar during the war period. Our importations of .sugar grown Dy black labour cost us £50 a ton, but [84] the sugar was sold to the Australian consumers at 3^d. per lb. Critics of the Queensland sugar industry should remember these facts: Theyshould, also remember, that sugar is being, .held inblack-labour countries to-day. which can be bought at a price at which it. could not possibly be produced now. This' is not our refined sugar, but "" mill white "" or some inferior quality which our people would not use. The critics who attack the Queensland sugar industry are usually speaking for such organizations as theSugar Consumers' Association, of Temple Court, Melbourne, the Town and Country Union, the members of which are also connected with the first mentioned organization, or certain housewives' associations. The former organization issues the infamous literature, which I regard as piffle, that is so frequently distributed throughout Australia. Such criticism should be compared with the reasonable criticism of the honourable member for Denison. British Australian per ton. £ 8. d. The value of the sugar industry to 27 10 0 . . 25 10 0 Australia will be better understood when it is realized that there are 10,000 sugar : 32 5 0 .. 25 10 0 growers in the industry, and 35 raw41 12 0 .. 25 10 0 40 15 0 .. 29 10 0 sugar mills, and that 20,000 persons are 57 15 0 .. 29 10 0 employed in it, including engineers, December, mill workers and others in the 66 0 0 .. 29 10 0 towns adjoining the sugar districts. 80 0 0 .. 49 0 0 Large numbers of men are also engaged .. 49 0 0 in transporting sugar throughout Australia or in refining it in the November, capital cities of the Commonwealth.. 96 0 0 .. 49 0 0 The capital expended in farms alone 72 0 0 .. 49 0 0 has reached the colossal figure of February, £20,000,000, and the expenditure on 67 10 0 .. 49 0 0 plant £10,000,000. A huge sum has also .. 49 0 0 been spent on tramways, roads, and workshops in the towns and farms in the sugar districts. In a normal year, we produce no less than 4,000,000 tons of sugar-cane, which yield 550,000 tons of raw sugar, practically half of which is exported to assist Australia to maintain her trade balance. This exported sugar brings £2,600,000 of foreign money per annum into. Australia. The industry is also worth £500,000 a year in coastal freights. In view of these facts it is not too much to ask that this industry should be regarded from a national and not a parochial point of view. Queensland purchases at least £12,000,000 worth of goods from southern States, while she exports £9,000,000 worth *o them, £6,154,000 of which is in sugar. The industry will also be contributing, under this amended agreement, no less than £315,000 a year to the fruit industry of Australia.. The Australian manufacturers who use sugar are getting it for less than world parity price. During the war period our exporting industries were in the happy position of being able to obtain sugar at a lower price than the manufacturers of any other country in the world. All these considerations must force any unbiased person to the conclusion that the sugar industry is of immense value to Australia. A good deal has heen said at various times about the distance of certain Western Australian towns and districts from the centres of population in the eastern States, but Cairns and the sugar growing districts are further away from the capitals of the eastern States than even Perth and Premantle, and the districts within 100 miles of them. The cost of transporting boots from Melbourne to the Queensland sugar-growing districts is quite as heavy as is the cost of sending them from Melbourne to Western Australia, but the Queensland sugar-growers do not squeal about it as the people of Western Australia do. It has heen said during this debate that sugar can be bought in England for 2^d. per lb., but it has to be remembered that the British duty on sugar is £11 13s. 4d. a ton and the bounty for the encouragement of the beet sugar industry of Great Britain is £6 10s., making the total impost £18 3s. 4d. per ton. This works out at about two-thirds of a penny per lb. which must be added to the 2-Jd., making the price three and one-sixth of a penny per lb. values into consideration, we must put the English price of sugar down at 4d. per lb. which is the price the Australian consumers will be asked to pay under this agreement. The average price of sugar in European countries is 3.6 pence per lb. If this amount were expressed in Australian currency it would be 4.5 pence per lb. It Will be seen, therefore, that the Australian consumers will actually be paying less for their sugar after this agreement comes into force than the conMr Bernard Corser. sinners of European countries pay for their sugar. This is to the credit of the Australian sugar producers. Moreover, it is a complete answer to the lying propaganda which is circulated from Temple Court to disparage the sugar industry and inflame the minds of the people of Australia against the sugar growers. I must offer objection to some of the inferences of the honourable member for Denison, although I admit that his statements were reasonable enough from his point of view. The honourable gentleman said that if Queensland exploited the other States in regard to sugar, the other States should be permitted to exploit Queensland in regard to wheat. The position is, however, that Queensland has taken steps to assist the wheat-growers of that State by establishing an organization to control the local marketing of wheat, with the object of increasing the price of looally consumed wheat. I wish that the other States of the Commonwealth had also established an organization for this purpose; but, as they have not done so, it is not fair that they should be permitted to exploit the Queensland market, where the price is higher solely because of the organized marketing arrangements iu force there. Queensland should be complimented, not criticized, for the steps she has taken to assist her wheat-growers. The honourable member for Denison also argued that it was erroneous to say that the sugar agreement was of valuable consideration from the defence point of view. I disagree entirely with the honourable member on that point. The people o.f Australia approved of the conversion of the Queensland sugar industry from When we take sterling a black-labour to a white-labour industry in order that the national policy of a White Australia could be implemented. In dealing with the unsettled areas of North Queensland from the stand-point of defence, the royal commission which reported on the sugar industry in 1912, statedThey are not only a source of strategic weakness; they constitute a positive temptation to Asiatic invasion, and may give the White Australia policy a complexion which must inevitably weaken the claims of Australia to external support. As we have already remarked, the ultimate end, and in our opinion, the effective justification of the sugar in North Queensland. The statement industry, lies beyond questions of industry and wealth production. It must be sought in the very existence of Australia as a nation. The Commonwealth Sugar Inquiry Committee of 1931 endorsed this view, for it stated that the opinion expressed by that royal commission had not been refuted or shaken by the evidence given before the committee. That, I submit, is a complete answer to the honourable member for Denison. I appreciated the honourable gentleman's reference to the high cost of the rails used to construct tramlines on our sugar farms, but the sugar-growers have never complained about these exorbitant prices. They have, without protest, bought all their commodities from the southern States at the ruling prices. It might interest honourable members to know that more than 1,000 miles of tramlines have been laid in the Queensland sugar districts. The observations of the honourable member on the wages paid in the sugar industry of Queensland were misleading. The ruling wage in North Queensland is £4 16s. for a week of 48 hours. This is not high in comparison with the wages paid in certain other industries of Australia. Under the Queensland shearers' award, shed hands and station hands are paid £4 Is. a week, and get their keep, which is valued at 27s. a week. In the meat export award, it is admitted that slaughtermen were earning 32s. a day for a day of six to six and a half hours. Under the Brisbane abattoirs award, made last November, slaughterhouse assistants are paid 16s. 4fd. a day, and slaughterhouse labourers, 15s. 6d. a day, and they work only 44 'hours a week. In the sugar districts of the southern districts of Queensland the ruling wage is 14s. 4d. a day. It should be clear, therefore, that the wages in the sugar industry are not high compared with the wages in certain other Australian industries. Reference has been made to the fact that land has been sold in the sugar districts of Queensland for £100 an acre. A few years ago I was in the Warrnambool district of Victoria a fortnight after a sale at which land for onion-growing was sold for £200 an acre; but reports of that nature do not evoke adverse criticism that Queensland sugar lands are worth £100 an acre is erroneous. The average value in 1929 was £46 ah acre. The land had to be cleared of dense jungle, and before it was suitable for ploughing, stumps had to be removed to a much greater depth than is necessary for wheat growing. Included in the £46 was £28, representing the original cost of the land plus the cost of clearing, and £18 for fencing, sheds, tractors, implements, horses, &c. No reasonable objection can be taken to this industry. On the contrary, it is entitled to the confidence and gratitude of every section for the efficiency it has developed in all its branches, from the field to the refinery. Even the great Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is the subject of so much adverse criticism, charges only one-twelfth of a penny per lb. for refining, arid returned to the growers last year as a gratis payment £30,000 in excess of what it thought was a fair return. That vast organization is deserving of praise for what it has done to develop an important Australian industry. Eor the education of critics of the sugar industry, I shall briefly review its history. The facts will show that if blame is attachable to anybody for the claim which the industry undoubtedly has upon the Australian people, it is attachable to the Commonwealth Parliament and not to the producers. In 1901 the newlyopened Coriimonwealth Parliament repatriated the Kanakas from the sugar plantations in Queensland and passed legislation imposing an excise duty on all raw sugar produced, subject to a rebate of £1 a ton on sugar produced hy white labour. This rebate was wrongly called a bounty. That arrangement lasted until 1913, when practically all the coloured labour had been removed from the Queensland cane-fields and the growers were carrying on the industry with white labour under a guarantee of adequate protection by the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth had then collected £6,591,870 in excise duty, and, after payment of the rebate to the growers, the revenue had benefited to the amount of £2,692,329. That was the first windfall to the Commonwealth Treasury from the sugar industry under white-labour had also imposed a customs duty of £6 per ton on foreign sugar and £10 per ton on beet sugar. In 1922 these rates were reduced to £9' 6s. 8d. and' £14 respectively, and the revenue further benefited accordingly. In 1913 this Parliament abolished tbe excise duty. Throughout the war the industry was wholly controlled by the Commonwealth Government and did not participate in the inflated conditions enjoyed by other industries. As a result, the people of Australia were saved £40,000,000 if the local price is .compared with that paid in Great Britain during that period. Erom 1915 to 1919 the wholesale price did not exceed £29 10s. a ton, and the retail price, from which the growers had to be paid, was only 3£d. per lb -the lowest price in the world, notwithstanding that Australia is tbe only country producing sugar by white labour. The price of sugar in the United Kingdom was £102 a ton, and in Canada and America the retail price was Is. 6d. per lb. The cheap sugar supplied by the Australian industry enabled fruit processors and manufacturers of condensed milk, confectionery, and biscuits in the southern States to undersell all foreign competitors, and to market overseas their surplus products to the value of £17,772,129. Direct Commonwealth control, with varying prices, lasted from 1915 to 1923. In 1920 the Commonwealth realizing the serious diminution of production, increased the low price of raw sugar from £21 to £30 6s. 8d. The Government, not the growers, raised the retail price to 6d. per lb. to recoup itself for the loss incurred in importing dear foreign sugar to make up the shortage. Erom this increase the grower received no direct advantage. The Government having been reimbursed, the retail price was reduced to 5d. per lb. in 1922. In the following year, the financial and marketing control was transferred to the Queensland Government, under certain conditions, including a reduction of the price of raw sugar to £27 per ton, and of refined sugar to 4$d. per lb. retail. Later the industry itself granted a concession of £6 5s. Id. per ton on sugar used for fruit processing. In the 1928 and Jfr. Bernard Corser. 1931 agreements those prices and the conditions. Parliament rebate were renewed. Now we are again ratifying an agreement which takes from the grower a further -Jd. per -lb. Even' when the wholesale price was £30 6s. 8d. per ton, and until recently, when sugar was being exported at a loss of £18 a ton, the growers' returns were not nearly so generous as critics of the industry suggest. The Assistant Minister( Mr Guy), when moving the second reading of this bill, saidI t was contended that the sugar industry should agree to share in the practically universal sacrifice. It has always done that. He continuedI t is a tribute to the fairmindedness and patriotism of the sugar producers of Queensland and New South Wales that they have given consideration to the plight of Australian consumers generally by deciding to render a contribution to the spirit and purpose of the Premiers plan. The reduction now being effected represents a concession of £1,300,000 to the consumers and the manufacturers. This amount is being taken from an industry which, during the war, was prevented from enjoying world's prices for its product, and, by supplying the Australian public at a fixed price, saved to them over £40,000,000 during that period. It has relieved the pockets of the consumers, has been a great employing medium, and has facilitated the extension of .many other industries. I hope that the critics in and out of this Parliament will appreGovernment, ciate the national value of the industry, and not indulge in petty attacks in the endeavour to secure sugar produced by black labour in other countries in preference to the product of an efficient enterprise conducted' by white labour in the Commonwealth. [Quorum formed.] congratulate the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Guy) on the excellent speech with which he explained the first bill he has introduced. He did an excellent job with material that is not of the best. So far the bill has had a smooth passage; apparently honourable 'members are disinclined to debate it, because of the agreement which has been made between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Governments. A matter which will meet with the approbation of",52,Prime Minister Of Course We Be Scrapped The Decision Of The High

The agreement made by the Scullin Government had no parliamentary sanction, and, consequently, its validity was challenged, and a good deal of litigation occurred. problem has agitated the minds of the Australian people for years. The Queensland representatives have stated their case very well; but there is another aspect of the subject. members other than those from the northern State have participated in this debate, and it is significant that all of them have objected to even this generous agreement. The Queensland representatives are fortunate, indeed, that this House has been asked to ratify the agreement embodied in the bill, and they would be ill-advised to offer any objection to it. ""We have heard from honourable members the views of the growers, and now we want to hear the views of the consumers, who are receiving a raw deal in respect of the price of sugar in this country. It is estimated that the other States pay annually to Queensland the sum of £7,000,000. contributes £750,000 per annum. That is no mean sum. The sugar agreement is one of the factors that has from time to time caused South Australia, in common with Western Australia and Tasmania, to approach the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance. The present proposal is to reduce the price of sugar by ^d. per lb. It should at least be reduced by Id. per lb. I had hoped that the sugar industry would be able by this time to stand on its own feet like the wool, wheat and other industries. The term of the agreement should be one year and not four years as is proposed in the bill. An inquiry should be made into the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is a profitable concern. The company started with a capital of £5,800.000. bonuses, the whole of the money subscribed by the shareholders. The market value of the concern is £16,000,000. The value of the original shares was £20 each and to-day their market value is £55 each. The reserves of the company amount to £7,198,000. point to any other industry in Australia industries that are supposed to be sound are not even in a position to pay dividends. A full inquiry should be made into the operations of this company to ascertain whether the assistance which it The sugar will receive under this agreement is necessary. Most of our industries have had to make sacrifices under the Premiers plan, but the sugar industry has escaped scot free. I protest against the fixation of the Few honourable price of sugar for another four years. The term of the agreement should be not more than one year. The clause which prevents price reductions should be eliminated.' I hope that when the bill is in committee it will be amended in the interests not of one section, but of all sections of the community. day we have heard the praises of the State of Queensland sung from all parts of the House. Honourable members representing that. State have referred in glowing terms to its productivity and prosperity. The boast has been made that there is no opposition to the agreement, but I myself do not see eye to eye with South Australia alone its supporters. The agreement has been challenged by no less an authority than the Auditor-General who, in his report of last year, saidAs the sugar agreement is not specifically authorized hy any legislation of the Commonwealth it is presumably ultra vires. Section 99 of the Constitution providesThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. That provision has not been seriously challenged. What also would be the attitude of honourable members .if, as the result of an inquiry, it were shown that the price of sugar could be still further reduced? I believe that I can answer the question for them. OverI t has returned in cash and over again in this House we have heard them, especially those who comprise the group from New South Wales, declaim their solicitude for the poor and distressed, the widows and children.

154,Mr Write (Balaclava) [10.18],"Toforced to admit that any possible reduction of price should be brought about. Why, then, should we unanimously accept this agreement, and extol it? There is nothing to congratulate ourselves upon, in having secured a reduction of i d . per lb. We can go much further. Recently, in this House, I presented a petition on behalf of Mr Purbrick, of Surrey Hills, Melbourne. I am not competent to say whether the matter that it contains is unchallengeable, or the figures accurate. I submit, however, that honourable members should read it, so that they may learn whether there is even a smattering of truth in it. If they accept as facts the statements made, they should insist upon a full inquiry, with a view to a further reduction of the price of sugar. I can add to the figures quoted by the honourable member for Boothby. ( Mr Price) with respect to the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It is with those operations that the petition that I have presented deals. The shares issued total 292,500, at £20 each, and they equal the present capital of £5,850,000. But no fewer than 186,250 of them are bonus shares, which were paid for out of surplus profits after provision had been made for the usual dividends and cash bonuses. the operations of the company in F i j i . There arc also included the enormous depreciations that have been made. Who has been responsible for those bonuses, and the increase from the initial value of £20 in the case of the shares that were paid for, to a value of £54 or £55. Have those profits descended from the air ? Or have they come from overseas? extent have they come from overseas, because the export price is considerably below the Australian price. They have been taken from the consumers of £7,000,000 more than would have been the case but for this agreement. A reduction of i d . per lb. in the price of sugar represents a difference of £1,750,000 to the Australian people. If , as the result of an inquiry, the reduction could be made Id., and thus double the saving, would not honourable members support it ? If those who cry "" Down with capitalism "" consider that the people are being given a fair deal in regard to the price of sugar, let them laud every claim that has been made to-day on behalf of the industry. I have been absolutely consistent in this matter. When I was in opposition, I opposed the agreement, and moved an amendment to it with the object of reducing the price of sugar. I received strong support, but it was not sufficient to carry the amendment. Honourable members are aware that a large quantity of sugar is used in manufacturing processes, and that certain concessions are given in that direction. But a large quantity is used also by the members of that association which the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) attempts to deride, the Housewives Association. He says "" Give the leaders of this women's organization a job, and they will quickly forget all about sugar"". That is an insult to an organization which voluntarily, in conjunction with other organizations, primary producers, and manufacturers, has endeavouredto prove that the price of sugar is too high. There are many pertinent facts awaiting disclosure. Honourable members who represent Queensland electorates are well acquainted with views of the growers, and have elaborated them admirably. I am aware of that. But unquestionably inordinate profits have been made. If it can be proved that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a monopoly, and as such is exploiting the people, there is room for inquiry. Monopolies are one of the greatest evils that arise out of excessive protection or embargoes. I support an embargo that will maintain a White Australia. Our White Australia policy is more than a policy; it is a doctrine as sacred to us as the Monroe doctrine is to the people of the United States of America, and we must defend it at all costs. It was established, not by any action or legislation of Australia, to the extent of recent parliaments, but by men of vision who many years ago initiated measures that would protect Australia from the influx of a horde of Asiatics. We must support it, not only by embargoes, trade agreements, and adequate defence, but also by every other means that will enable us to keep our community fit for",57,Prime Minister Of Course We Be Scrapped The Decision Of The High

Small industries have adequate local competition; but an industry which enjoys a monopoly and requires immense capital for its development-the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is only one of a number of such industries in Australia-is able to exploit the public by means of price fixation. I think that price-fixing is wrong, and it is wrong for this Parliament to support the practice. Sugar Refining Company has not fixed the price; that has been done for it. being asked to approve of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government, the object of which is to fix the price of sugar. believe that a royal commission should be appointed to inquire into this matter. [10.36] -On e cannot be otherwise than pleased at the tone of this dehate. The bill has been received favourably by honourable members generally, and the speeches have consisted largely of a review of the history of the sugar industry in Australia, with references to its importance and efficiency, regarding which there is no room for complaint. I desire briefly to refer to some of the statements of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr fore, that the Customs Act might be Forde). He repeated the old phrases about intimidation, and holding a pistol to the heads of the producers. member for Capricornia withdrew those statements at the request of the Chair. tarily reviewed by the parties concerned and the new agreement, as drafted by the Commonwealth, was accepted by the Premier of Queensland without request for alteration.

The Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis) has already referred to the risks which the industry would have run had it insisted on retaining the old agreement. .In the first place, there was a danger that the High Court might decide that the agreement was ultra vires. It has already been held by the High Court that the Commonwealth Government cannot effectively bind itself by an agreement which has not received specific parliamentary sanction, and no sugar agreement has ever yet been approved by this Parliament. When a case was before the High Court, in which certain parties sought a declaration that the agreement was ultra vires, it was demonstrated that if the Attorney-General of I of the Commonwealth or of any of the States were to approach the court on behalf of the people, seeking the annulment of the agreement, there was every possibility that the agreement would have to go. It was also pointed out by the Assistant Minister that there was a possibility that Parliament might amend he Customs Act in such a way that the sugar industry would be no longer protected hy an embargo on the importation of foreign sugar. amended by this Parliament, in which the Government has a majority.

This is an annual report which has to be supplied in accordance with the terms of the agreement. It has been certified by the Auditor-General, and I hope to have it laid on the table of the House before the sitting is ended to-night. It has been suggested that the new agreement is not so advantageous to the fruit processors as the old one, so that it is well, perhaps, that I should explain that the fruit processors will be better off under the new agreement. sugar agreement provided that the sugar £ industry should contribute £315,000 per annum for the benefit of the fruit industry. Out of this fund a domestic sugar rebate of £6 5s. I d . a ton, involvo t n e r ing about £175,000. per annum, had to be paid to manufacturers in respect of the sugar used in the production of frui t products-the balance of the fund being available for the ordinary export sugar rebate, which costs about £30,000 per annum, and for special export assistance, costing about £110,000 per annum, The domestic sugar rebate had the effect of reducing the ordinary manufacturing price of sugar from £36 l is . 9d. a ton to Bruce purely as a temporary expedient, £30 6s. 8d.. a ton net to fruit processors only. The old agreement, however, providcd that, when the ordinary manufacturing price of sugar was reduced, the fund of £315,000 per annum had to be reduced by such an amount as the Commonwealth Government might determine, provided that the reduced amount did no.t exceed £315,000 per annum, less the value of the reduction of the ordinary price, multiplied by the consumption of sugar by fruit processors. It also provided that, in the event of such a reduction, it had' to be applied specifically ' to the domestic rebate Mr Guy. of £6 5s. Id. a ton. This is exactly what is being done under the new sugar agreement, with the exception that the Commonwealth Government made only the consequential reduction in the old fund rendered mandatory as a minimum by the old sugar agreement, whereas, in view of the very large reduction made in the income of the sugar producers, the Government might well The ..honourable have further reduced the special temporary concessions to the fruit industry, T n e c o m in g r e d u c t i o i l in the ordinary manufacturing price is SA Is. a ton, and t h e n e w d o m e s t i o r e b a t e 0 n f r u it pro ducts will be £2 4s. a ton-the odd I d . w as disregarded. Similarly the total f^d n as D e e n re d e d by £115,000, UC m a k in g the contribution £200,000 per a i m u m .

The new ordinary manufacturing price of sugar will be £32 10s 9d. a ton, and the fruit The old processing rate will be £2 4s. less, or 30 6s. 9d. a ton, which is virtually the same as at present. The Id. difference w as agreed to quite readily by H . Jones and Company Proprietary Limited, and leading manufacturers, The old sugar agreement was given very wide publicity, and it is known that most manufacturers concerned were well aware of the automatic reduction to be made in the domestic marginal rebate of £6 5s. I d . a ton in the event of the general sugar price being reduced. Most of them were doubtless equally well aware that this rebate was originally given by the Right Honourable S. M. pending the recovery of the fruit industry from the depression caused by overproduction, and that its continuance was recommended by the 1931 Sugar Inquiry Committee for a limited period only, Under the new sugar agreement, fruit processors will obtain their sugar at £2 4s. per ton less than the price charged to all other manufacturers. Even this smaller preference has been strongly opposed by other'industries which claim that they should not be required' to pay more for sugar for home consumption than is paid by the fruit processors, since the' latter are protected by prohibitive duties, and have advantages at least equal to those of other manufacturers in selling their product in the protected Australian market. In addition to this particular advantage, the new sugar agreement gives the fruit industry £110,000 per annum for special export assistance. The export sugar rebate constitutes a long-standing right enjoyed by all exported goods, and is therefore not peculiar to the fruit industry. The combined value of the domestic sugar rebate, and the special export assistance to the frui t industry, is £170,000 per annum, which is equivalent to that industry heing allowed for .the next four years to receive its sugar at £6 per ton less than the price charged to all other industries. I add that the Government has just arranged with the principal exporting sections of the fruit industry to forgo for one year £30,000 of their share of the special export assistance. This sum will be paid to manufacturers of jam and canned fruits on next season's output, in addition to the new domestic sugar rebate of £2 4s. a ton. The following statement shows the concessions to the fruit industry under both the old and the new agreement :New Agreement and Old Agreement. Per annum. £ Domestic rebate £6s. 5s. I d . per ton oil the price price paid by paid by all other manufacturers Expert rebate to reduce net Australian price to equivalent of world's parity Special assistance, apart from above refrom above rebates Total under new Agreement Tariff preferences from Agreement on canned fruits, about Abolition Sales Tax on Jam and canned fruits, at least 136,000 Total at least £91,000 per annum better off than before, without taking into account considerable savings from the recent abolition of sales tax and primage on agricultural implements, fertilizers, lime, and many other items used on orchards. F r u it processors w ill still have the sole advantage of . the specially low net price of £30 (is. 94. per ton for home consumption (""worth in future £00,000 per annum compared with what all other manufacturers w ill pay). They w ill also enjoy a continuance of the exceptional privilege of the £110,000 per annum for export assistance. These two valuable concessions are equivalent to f r u it processors receiving sugar at £6 per ton less than the price to be charged to all other manufacturers. This advantage is extraordinary when one considers that the f r u it industry is as completely protected in the Australian market as any of the other industries which have no such concessions. The claim for the retention of the old temporary f r u it concessions at their former grandiose scale would, if granted, permit of the price of jam being reduced by only Sd. per dozen tins, and canned f r u it by the negligible amount of l i d . per dozen tins. Instead of granting this claim, which was untenable in view of the explicit terms of the old sugar agreement, the Government gave a much greater concession by abolishing the sales tax on f r u it products-thi s being worth about 7d. per dozen tins on both jam and canned fruits. The largest organizations of fruit-growers, and very prominent processors have accepted exactly what the Government has provided in the new sugar agreement and expressed their appreciation. The rejection by Parliament of the new sugar agreement would result in one of two things(a) it would leave the old agreement to continue-in which case housewives Government Policy. would lose the saving of £1,000,000 Per per annum and ordinary manufacannum. turers the £300,000 per annum now .£ Bugar Domestic sugar , provided under the new agreement; of rebate of £2 4s.

' The statements of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) and the honourable member for Boothby( Mr stage, I intimated that in committee I Price) regarding the affairs of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company have been investigated by the department and found to be quite inaccurate. [Quorum formed.'] In 1931, the Sugar Inquiry Committee, comprising Mr John Gunn, Mr A. R. Townsend, Mr Dutton, of MacRobertson's, Mrs. Morgan, of Western Australia, representing the Housewives Association, Mr W. Young, of Victoria, representing the fruit-growers, Mr (CHAIRMAN-MR . BELL.) Curlewis and Mr Short, representing the sugar industry, and Mr Fallon, representing the Australian Workers Union, after a ful l investigation, unanimously found that the net profits of the company were only 5£ per cent, of all the capital employed in its Australian operations. The basis of the statement contained in the petition referred to by the honourable members was that practically the whole of the profits were made on the company's Australian undertakings. That is wrong. It has been established beyond doubt that from 45 per cent, to 75 per cent, of the company's profits have been earned outside Australia from time to time during the last fifteen years. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Gander, J. H . Nairn) complained of the proposals in relation to industrial conditions which are set out in paragraph 16 of the schedule. That provision is similar to clauses contained in every bounty act. Only once has the Government been approached to set up a Commonwealth tribunal under clauses of this kind, and only as a last resort would it do so. Under the sugar agreement, the State tribunal fixes wages and conditions for the industry. Should it not do so, the employers and employees may come to an agreement among themselves. The Government is of the opinion that, not only should the benefits of the sugar agreement be reserved for the employees, but that they should be shared by employees being given reasonable wages and conditions of employment in the industry.

A saving of about £3,000 a year will be effected that an important measure like the bill by the passage of this bill. We hope that prosperity will soon be restored to such an extent that the resuscitation of the committee will be necessary; but I urge honourable members to agree to the passage of the bill to-night so that the public work to which I have referred may be put in hand without unnecessary delay. .Bill agreed to, and reported without amendment; report adopted.

I do not think that any honourable member anticipated that the Sugar Agreement Bill would take more than a day, for it was not regarded as contentious by the great majority of honourable members. It is unfortunate for the ratification of the Ottawa agreement should have been bludgeoned through the House yesterday, and that now we find ourselves with a day on our hands. I can see usreaching the stage again in a week or two of having to rush business, and the Government may desire to apply the guillotine again.

This is natural, for honourable members who have views to express are denied the opportunity of expressing them. I ask the Prime Minister to take steps to arrange the business of Parliament, so that it will be unnecessary to curtail debates by the use of the guillotine. The Opposition has been reasonable, and has facilitated the conduct of business, and it expects the Government to be reasonable in submitting business. I make this early protest against a repetition of the use of the guillotine. Twice recently that unsatisfactory method of expediting public business has .been adopted. On one occasion eleven clauses of the Financial Emergency Bill, which amended six acts of Parliament, were forced through the House without any discussion whatever. ber think that the Ottawa Agreement Bill would have been available for the Senate to-day if the guillotine had not heen applied ? had submitted the measure to the House earlier, it would have been unnecessary to curtail the debate. ""We certainly lost a week recently. business ready for to-morrow and only two or up for consideration on Tuesday. What are the Government's intentions with regard to its other measures? A few days ago we had what was, in effect, a second budget speech, in connection with which there will be incidental legislation. Then, doubtless, we shall be told that the Senate is waiting and we shall again be subjected to the guillotine. I warn the Government that we are not going to submit, without a strong protest, to the application of the guillotine to important measures. This afternoon we were asked how many speakers from this side of the House would take part in the debate on the Sugar Agreement Bill, and the information was supplied. I am not at the moment concerned about the Government's proposal to adjourn over tomorrow, but-1 am concerned about the limitation of the time allowed for the discussion of the more important bills that come before this chamber. If the guillotine is to be applied, ample notice should be given to honourable members, so that they may occupy less time in the second reading stage of a bill and allow more time for consideration of the bill in committee. Nothing like that was done in connection with the bill which was passed through this chamber last night. Full time was allowed for the second reading debate, but the fixing of the time for the consideration of the committee stage gave rise to a situation that was a discredit to the Government. Ministers should know what their policy is, and they should have their measures ready. We have been informed that there are to be certain remissions of taxation. Bills dealing with those matters should be ready for presentation to the House. If the House were sitting to-morrow we could take the second readings then and resume the debate on Tuesday; but as the Government is not ready and the House will not meet to-morrow, I assume that the taxation bills will be introduced on Tuesday. Reasonable time should then be allowed before resuming the debate; but I suppose that we shall be told that the Senate is waiting for this legislation, so we shall probably have another all-night sitting, or the application of the guillotine. I urge the There is no Government to get its bills ready and allow the House a reasonable time for three small bills will come their discussion. protest against this procedure. Yesterday the Government closured the debate on the United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement Bill and prevented honourable members on this side from saying certain things which they intended to say. This is the second time that we have been subjected to this kind of treatment. The most important legislation which this Parliament has been called upon to consider for a long time was forced through this House by the application of the guillotine. To-morrow, because the Government has no business ready, I , and other honourable members from distant States, will be forced to remain here in idleness. There is to be a t long week-end adjournment because some one has gone away to do propaganda work in Adelaide.

184,Mr Martens (Herbert) [11.28.],"Isuit the convenience of the Government, which is not prepared to go on with its legislation. complaining of the decision of the Government to adjourn over to-morrow, but I complain of the time occupied on unimportant legislation. In view of the approaching end of the session, the Prime Minister should indicate to the House what new business the Government proposes to introduce. Certain legislation will, of course, arise out of the financial visit Brisbane at the week-end and atstatement delivered a day or two ago. I am within a few hours' journey of my home in Sydney, so that a short notice of a long week-end adjournment does not mean so much to me as it does to honourable members from distant States. They should receive more than a few hours' notice so that they may make the necessary arrangements to use the time during which the House will not sit. Personally, I should prefer the House to meet to-morrow, as usual, instead of adjourning until Tuesday next. As we are approaching the end of the session, the Government should arrange the business so as to make the most of every hour that is available in Canberra for the benefit of members from South Australia, ""Western Australia and Queensland, and endeavour to dispose of its legislation as early as possible before Christmas. I protest against the action of the Government in failing to give notice earlier of the intention to adjourn the House until Tuesday next. It is important that members representing Queensland constituencies should be advised promptly of any contemplated alteration of the usual sitting days, because we all have a considerable amount of work to do in Brisbane. If we had been informed before 8 o'clock to-night that the House would not be meeting to-morrow, we could have got away by the night train, and spent the week-end in Brisbane attending to business which cannot very well be done by correspondence. Some honourable members, particularly those from Sydney and Melbourne, can board the train to-morrow night, be in their homes on Saturday, and leave for Canberra on Monday night. also are deserving of consideration. Those from distant States should have been advised of the proposed long weekend adjournment. Yesterday, we were led to believe that certain Government business was so urgent that the use of the guillotine was necessary. There is not sufficient business on the notice paper to keep the House busy beyond the middle of next week. What will happen then? If the House were to adjourn on Friday until Wednesday, Queensland members would have an opportunity to tend to public and private business, including matters affecting old-age pensions,, repatriation, and taxation. I hope that in future the Opposition will receive from the Government the courtesy that is usual between parties. thank the honourable member for Cook( Mr Riley) for his consideration for members from far-distant States. Western Australian representatives have no chance during the sessions to return to their homes, and they are always here to assist the Government in the transaction of business. The long adjournment' at the week-end is very convenient for some honourable members, but those from Queensland and Western Australia have to idle their time in Canberra. I shall be glad if the Government will indicate what business if proposes to transact during the next few weeks, and when the session is likely to terminate. urge the Government to withdraw the motion, in order that the House may sit to-morrow. The consideration of the tariff schedule is a gigantic task, and we should clear the way for it by disposing of other business as quickly as possible. Yesterday, Ave listened to an undignified debate. No fewer than 57 speeches were delivered on the motion for the second reading of the bill to ratify the Ottawa agreement. Perhaps some of the time occupied at that stage might have been more usefully devoted to the consideration of the measure in committee, but there was no justification for the unseemly demonstration that occurred yesterday. ter) [11.40] I cannot accede to the Other members suggestion that the House should meet to-morrow.

Whip endeavoured to advise all honourable members of the intention of the Government, and I am sorry if , through a misunderstanding, members .from Queensland and other distant States have not been able to take advantage of the long week-end adjournment. I was of the opinion that, if certain bills were disposed of to-night, it would suit the convenience of honourable members if the House were to adjourn until Tuesday instead of reassembling to-morrow to deal with matters that might occupy only a comparatively short time. In regard to the protests of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) against the application of the guillotine yesterday, I assure him that that course would not have been adopted but for the fact that the Government particularly desired that the Sugar Agreement Bill should be disposed of early, so that arrangements could be made for the colossal task of distributing the sugar supplies throughout Australia. sideration of the bill dealing with the Ottawa agreement have been postponed for a day to enable the Sugar Agreement Bill to be disposed of? ment had already been dealt with by the British Parliament, and the Government desired that it should be -ratified by the Senate as early as possible.

LOAN. ter and Treasurer) [11.44] I move That the House do now adjourn. indicate on what date the House will be likely to adjourn over the Christmas holidays ? sitting fairly continuously, and the Government proposes that it shall rise as early as possible in December. It will endeavour to so arrange the business that the adjournment may take place even earlier than the date which has been tentatively mentioned, namely, the 15th December. desire some information regarding the loan now being raised by the"" Commonwealth. In the first place, I should like to know whether the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) can indicate what measure of success is being obtained. I understand that half of the money proposed to be raised is to be used in carrying out public works for the purpose of providing employment. A noticeable feature of this loan is that the publicity given to it has been extremely meagre. Apart from a few posters placed outside banks, and several trifling advertisements, in newspapers, no enthusiastic effort seems to have been made, as in the case of previous loans, to arouse public interest. Perhaps the Prime Minister is in a position to inform the House what progress has heen made. I not the "" conrealize that at the present time it is not easy to obtain loan money, and the difficulty is considerably increased because the rate ofi interest offered is lower than has previously been offered. Is it intended_ to allow the period during which applications by investors are invited to lapse without further publicity being given to the matter? It seems to me that, for the sake of the credit of Australia, we cannot afford to permit this loan to f a i l ; but I fear that . if enthusiastic publicity is not given to it, failure may result. If the Government is serious in its statement that the money is required partly for the purpose of relieving unemployment, we should certainly advertise the loan more extensively, in order to make it a complete success. ter and Treasurer) [11.48] I am unable to state exactly what progress has been made, but I shall endeavour to",66,Special Adjournment

It is not always advisable to publish from time to time the amount subscribed towards a loan; but, in the matter of publicity, we have followed the procedure that has been adopted in connection with other loans in normal times. The Government is doing everything that it can to bring under the notice of possible investors the advantage of participation in this loan, and if it is possible to do anything further to promote its success, that will be done. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr 2. £3,060, plus an amount for old steel rails Rosevear) said that we should make sure that the full amount asked for is obtained. I point out that the loan is underwritten, and, therefore, cannot f a i l ; but I sincerely hope that none of the money will be left with the underwriters. The Government is doing everything possible to make the loan a success. able gentleman consider that the publicity now being given to the matter is sufficient, in view of the difficult times through which we are passing? the officials of the Treasury, who have handled loan business in the past, and they are particularly keen on ensuring the success of this loan. any suggestions in regard to increased publicity, will the Government place no obstacle in their way? we can to achieve success.
