11,Mr R. Green,"The Minister saidexcept by actual boring operations. My experience on the Public Accounts Committee has convinced me that it is of little use to employ geologists to make surveys for oil fields. There is no need to appoint any further officers, because geologists are employed by all tbe States. Victoria bas the ablest geologist in Australia. A great deal of money has been paid to Dr. Wade for his services in respect of oil research work, but I am satisgiven us sufficient information on this fied that the result has not justified that bill, and until he does so I intend to expenditure. If tbe amount appropriated by this Parliament is to be absorbed by the maintenance of a staff, then Parliament has been misled. Honourable members were under the impression that the money was to be expended on subsidizing oil boring operations. Australia will never riroperly progress until a flow of oil has been discovered within its territories. Under the bill there is a danger that the money appropriated for assisting oil boring operations will not be used for that purpose. Why not avail ourselves of the services of the State officers? The States will have to be consulted, because they control the land. The Constitution prohibits the Commonwealth from trespassing on State lands for prospecting or boring purposes. object to the money that has been voted for boring for oil being spent in setting up boards. words when the estimates are under consideration to show honourable members how much money this Government has spent in setting up boards of one kind or another. Although our expenditure is increasing by leaps and bounds, it is proposed that we shall evacuate certain fields of taxation. I suppose very few honourable members realize that a man with a wife and ten children is estimated to pay no less than £6 a week in Customs and excise duties. expect to have a surplus when we have debts amounting to nearly £400,000,000? Personally I object to the expenditure of public money without the most searching inquiry. Honourable members opposite may be quite willing to agree to anyAustralia. Of that amount £22,500 was thing which the Government proposes, but I wish to make it quite clear that at present I am opposed to this bill. Whatever money we may have to provide for oil prospecting should be spent on actual boring operations. Oil is not likely to be found in the back yards of Melbourne or Sydney, but it may be discovered in certain distant coastal areas. Victoria has spent a great deal of money in boring, and has I understand sunk something like 9,000 bores in her search for coal. I am sorry she has not succeeded, for bad she done so she would not be involved in the Yallourn electrical mess. The Honorary Minister has not oppose it. Minister have a discretionary power in the expenditure of this amount? really have carte blanche in the matter. I know a good deal about oil prospecting in Australia, for I have seized every opportunity to inform myself on tbe subject. able member will admit that a thoroughly trained geological staff would be useful in advising, at least, where not to bore for oil? I as the geologists where oil is most likely to be found; and the men who are engaged in oil prospecting are experts. I propose to say a few It is very lDcely that an oil flow will be struck in tbe Hunter district. Boring for oil ought to follow the various coal seams, as oil, like coal, is a vegetable matter. I want the vote for oil boring guarded, and for that reason I ask the Minister to give us a little more information as to the intentions of the Government. do not intend to oppose the bill, but I How can we should like the Minister to give me a little information on the matter. Earlier this year he introduced, and Parliament passed, a bill to provide a sum of £60,000 to assist in boring for oil and in making'geological surveys throughout to be spent in the Fitzroy River aud Price's Creek districts; a similar amount in the area known as Belford Dome in the Hunter River district; and £5,000 ia assisting to making a geological survey of the Longreach, Blackall, and Ruthven districts in Queensland.

16,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [11.43],"Ito know whether the £6,000 to be provided now to assist the Lander Oil Company to continue its boring operations at Roma is in addition to the amount of £5,000 I have already mentioned. Most honourable members realize that oil will probably be struck first in Queensland. A good deal of work has already been done there, but disasters have always occurred at important stages in the operations. At Roma the bores have been choked on several occasions when the prospectors considered they were on the point of striking oil. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) made some startling revelations in this regard in this House early this year, but as his speech was delivered near midnight very little notice was taken of it. The first bore put down by the Queensland Government was taken to a depth of about 3,703 feet, and then it was practically ruined, a portion of the boring tools being dropped into it . Then two other bores were sunk, to about the same depth, but similar misfortune was experienced. I wish to know whether the proposed expenditure of £6,000 to assist the Lander Oil Company will result in a reduction of the sum allocated for geological survey work in Queensland, and to what further extent the Government will be prepared to assist the Lander Oil Company to carry out additional prospecting work in the vicinity of Roma. I understand that this company, after spending £S0,000 in boring operations, had to abandon the work owing to lack of funds. It seems to me that the £60,000 expenditure, provided under a previous bill, is not a sufficiently generous inspector temporarily. His salary will sum for assistance to oil prospectors. If oil can be found in Australia, too high a price cannot'be paid for its discovery. I hope that the prospecting companies will be protected against influences from outside Australia that seem to have operated against the development of the Roma field. It was stated almost openly that such acts as those mentioned by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr on the advice given us by the State minPorde) were perpetrated. have been some ulterior motive on the part of those who set oil bores on fire, or dropped portions of the plant into them. ister) [11.50] -The honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) asked me why no provision had been made in the present bill for Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. I point out that the Government has in no way receded from the statements made by me in enunciating its policy with respect to the subsidies to be paid for oil boring. While we have provided £60,000 under the principal act for oil subsidies and geological surveys, the budget proposals this year make a further sum of £100,000 available. amount allocated for assistance to prospectors for precious metals? £100,000 is to be provided to enable assistance to be given in boring operations in the Mandated Territory and Papua, apart from the work being carried out there by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. ceeding ? ceived good reports; but it is not wise to be too sanguine. bring in another bill to provide for the Mandated Territory ? why the House is asked to deal with this bill as an urgent measure is that we are anxious to appoint the expert that we have in view.

The payment of £6,000 to the Lander Oil Company, and of £22,500 to other companies was simply made in the form of subsidies on the quantity of boring done. I do not agree with the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West), who said that he knew where oil could be found. had my choice in the matter, I should concentrate attention on the operations in the Hunter River district. provided for assistance in that field. It is almost essential that oil should be discovered in Australia, and it would be worthwhile prosecuting vigorous efforts in that direction in order to fight the oil combine that is charging exorbitant prices to Australian consumers. The expert to be appointed will advise the Government with respect to applications for assistance, principally in the Northern Territory, the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, and Papua. liberty to disclose his name? fore me at the moment, but he has excellent qualifications. The honourable member for Capricornia wished to know whether the £5,000 to be made available to Queensland would be additional to the £6,000 granted to the Lander Company. If favorable reports are received from the Queensland' Government on the prospect of discovering oil in that State, the Federal Government will not be backward in assisting legitimate operations apart from those in the Roma district, and will not restrict the subsidy to £5,000. I hope that the bill will be passed without delay. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

It is stated that there is great likelihood of oil being discovered in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. I hope that that report is reliable. I also trust that oil will be first discovered in Australia. I believe that most of the companies are making genuine attempts to locate oil, but some of them are out to catch the unwary investor. paid to the inspector? in securing his services for the equivalent of £1,500 a year.

The object of the original act was to provide a bounty for genuine prospectors for oil, and honourable members did not understand that the money would be at employed for any other purpose. We have a council of Scientific and Industrial Research, which employs experts that could do this work. The money provided should be spent exclusively in the way Parliament intended. am surprised that there should be any opposition to this bill, which is necessary to protect the interests of the Commonwealth. No person or company would think of spending £100,000 on any project unless it employed a capable person to see that the work was done properly. I regret that provision for this appointment was not made in the original act; the necessity for it has probably only dawned on the Government since. It is impossible to obtain a competent man for this sort of work unless a reasonable salary is paid.

I suggest that it was not the intention of this House that present justices of the H i gh CourtI should not have the opportunity of retiring upon f u l l pension. Another point has arisen in connection with the amendment. I ask the particular attention of honourable members to tbe fact that one effect of the amendment would be that any of the justices who, after the age of 70 years, retired by reason of ill-health, would receive no pension at all. If the justices retired by reason of permanent infirmity or incapacity before the age of 70 they of a life tenure would be entitled to the pension provided after service of five years, in accordance with the length of their service; but they would not, under the amendment, be The entitled to any pension at all if they retired after the age of 70 years on tbe grounds of permanent infirmity or ill health. 1 clause refers to a justice retiring on permanent disability or infirmity "" before The reaching the age of 70 years.""

62,Mr Charlton,"There is no error;provided that the pension of a judge who retired after reaching 70 years of age should be reduced by one-tenth for every year be continued 'on the Bench after that age. That is a wise provision. The object of tbe b ill was to assure to judges an income in their declining years, when retirement from the Bench was becoming necessary. I say nothing against the -judiciary. Nobody should, unless absolutely necessary, criticize the administrators of justice, and it is desirable that the very best men available should be appointed to the Bench. It must be recognized, however, that the present judges of the H i g h Court accepted appointment without any expectation. of a pension. The amendment if agreed to would affect only those judges who attain or have attained the age of 70 years. Not one of the present occupants of the H i gh Court Bench when he was appointed to that position expected to receive a pension when he retired from office. This matter was debated years ago when two of the present judges of the H i g h Court were members of this chamber, and they both voted against providing pensions for tbe judiciary. Since then there has been no attempt to provide pensions for judges. The amendment is for the purpose of insuring the retirement of judges when they attain an age at which tbeir mental capacity may be such that the continuation of their service is not in the best interests of the country. There should certainly be some provision in the bill to ensure that judges retire on reaching a certain age. Otherwise, they will continue in office until they are 80 or 85 years of age, and perhaps in a state of dotage. after reaching the age of 70 years the pension of a judge shall diminish by one-tenth each year that he remains in office. It would be difficult to stipulate in an act of parliament that H i g h Court judges should retire at the age of 65 or 70 years of age, and therefore we could not do better than insist upon the amendment carried by this committee. Court judges are the interpreters of the Constitution under which, we live, and therefore they must be capable and alert. The amendment is wise because if inserted in the bill it would indicate to the occupants of the High Court Bench the period at which their services were no longer desired. ifr. Charlton. tally and physically better at 75 years of age than others are at 65 years of age. cording to this morning's press, the Government is dispensing with the services of a deputy president of the Arbitration Court at the age of 60, although no pension has been provided for him. The argument of the Attorney-General( Mr. Latham) , that the bil l cannot be amended, because we have already passed similar legislation providing for the appointment of arbitration judges w i th l if e tenure and with f u l l pension on retirement, is no justification for refusing to accept the amendment. Legislation can be altered at any time if thought necessary, and to my mind it is necessary to include the amendment in the b ill before us and also in the measure providing for the appointment of Arbitratio n Court judges. I was not here wben the honourable member for Boothby moved the amendment, but 1 read his speech and I thought that he gave good grounds for his action. The committee acted wisely in supporting the amendment, and should insist upon it even though it has been rejected by the Senate. orable member suggest that we should k ill the bill by insisting on this small amendment? of the Government to accept the decision . of the committee. ment .has made it clear that it will reject The amendment provides that the bill if the amendment is insisted upon. the honourable member has come under tbe lash of the Government's whip. of passing a bill through the committee The High stage if the decision of the majority of honourable members is not to be insisted upon ?

70,Mr Charlton,"W h a t is the useAttorney-General himself on the second reading of the bill. He said, in effect, that be did not wish to reflect on members of the judiciary, but he thought that there was a time in their lives when their retirea young man. ment would be in tbe best interests of all concerned. Surely a member of the judiciary should not be allowed to retain bis position until he goes to the grave. A t present we have no control over a High Court judge respecting the period at which he should retire, but the provision of a diminishing pension, as proposed by the amendment, might induce him under ordinary circumstances to retire from office at the age of 70 years. I admit that some men at 65 years of age are more capable and alert than other men at 45 years of age, but we should indicate to the High Court judges that at 70 their Services would be no longer desired. They occupy a responsible position, and it is necessary that the people of Australia should continue to bave the confidence in the High Court Bench that it bas had in it ever since federation. The judges themselves would admit that some provision should be made for them to retire on a pension. I am sorry that tbe honourable member for Boothby does not intend to insist on the amendment that was carried by this committee. Perhaps, on reflection, he will see how necessary it is for him to stand by bis previous decision. I am not speaking in a party view, because it is well known that the Labour party is opposed to paying pensions to judges. That principle has been established, and is not now at issue. We of this side will certainly stand by tbe amendment as it previously left the committee. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m The attitude adopted by the honourable Hughes) surprising. on a question, I do so on principle; but apparently the honourable member for Boothby had no principle supporting him in this instance. Evidently he likes a second thought on these subjects, for the action of the second chamber suited him. I am jealous of the powers of this House. If I could I would take such action as would prevent the Senate from amending bills of this character. I suppose I ought to be .charitable to the honourable member for Boothby over this inconsistency, for he is The Attorney-General gladly fell in with the request of the Senate, for its acceptance will restore the bill to its condition when introduced. In my opinion, our High Court judges will not worry whether the request is accepted or rejected A judge who retained his position until he reached the age of 80 years would, during his last ten years, draw £35,000 in salary, whereas a judge who retired at 70 years would draw only £17,000 in pension. I shall not at the moment express an opinion on the wisdom of fixing 70 years as the retiring age for judges. Possibly, as their experience increases, judges, like members of Parliament, become more efficient. No doubt the Senate, in making this request, is acting under instructions from the Government. This Government, like various State Governments, uses the second chamber to achieve its own ends. I can well remember Sir Henry Parkes, Sir John Bobertson,. and Sir Alexander Stuart using the Upper House in New South Wales to achieve objects which they could not attain in the Lower House; and this Government is taking a leaf out of their book. I understand that honourable members opposite are prepared to accept the request, but it is regrettable to me that they should do so. Although there are judges at present on the High Court bench who are over 70 years of ageI understand that one is 72, another 1Z, and another 74-the y are not likely to worry over our attitude on this question. Judges, in consequence of their high salary, are well able to make adequate provision for their old age. Besides, they are not in the position of honourable members of this Parliament, who have to towards this request is meet .many and varied calls for help. When I take a stand Nobody comes to them, and asks for his fare to his home town, or the like, but that happens every week to honourable members. Parliament is spending public money much too freely in these days, and the Government appears to have no hesitation whatever about bleeding the taxpayers.

During the last two and a half years the loan operations of the Commonwealth and the States have been conducted in accordance with agreements made by the Australian Loan Council, whicb at present consists of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurers of the States other than New South Wales. The Australian Loan Council was originally formed in order that the loan business of the various governments might be carried on without clash or competition, and experience has shown the wisdom of this policy, as the treasurers acting in concert can secure better terms than if they acted independently. lating borrowing in a systematic manner it has been possible to give the money market definite periods of freedom from government issues, and thus more money has been made available for private enterprise. general policy of the Loan Council, and, briefly, it is that every maturing loan shall be converted in the place where the original loan is domiciled. money the States are to rely on both the Australian and overseas markets, the amount to be raised overseas being determined by the Loan Council after consideration of the amount of money which will probably, be available in Australia.

Under the act passed last year, the Commonwealth floated a loan in Australia for the States, of £5,100,000. The rate of interest offered was 5J per cent., or £ per cent, below the rate at which £67,000,000 of our own war loans-, which matured on the 15th December, 1925, had been converted. The 5£ per cent, loan raised for the Further, by reguStates was over-subscribed, a total of £6,274,810 having been raised. Later, the Commonwealth was able by private negotiation to secure a further sum of £1,640,000 on the same terms on behalf of the States. As regards borrowing In the budget I set out the overseas, the States participated in tbe £15,000,000 loan raised by the Commonwealth in New York to the extent of £5,008,733, so that the total borrowing For new for the Statesi n Australia and overseas' under the act passed last year reached the sum of £12,923,543. This measure does not contain any authority for tbe Commonwealth to borrow moneys for its own purposes.

If to-day I am in the rare position of being in agreement with the Government, it is because the Government has -adopted an important feature of the Labour party's policy. A few features of the bill call for comment. The Minister told the House that annually 4,000,000 dozen tins of f r u it , of which only 850,000 dozen tins are from Australia. supplies only 20 per cent, of Great Britain's requirement of canned f r u it s , and that is not at all satisfactory. The present Government is undertaking to provide land for migrants, many of whom, no doubt, will engage in fruit-growing. Tkat being .so, the United Kingdom has a moral obligation to provide a better market for the products ef its own people who isettle in Australia. resting on the British Government. I hope so, because these immigrants are English people A t present, Australian canned f r u it s represent 20 per <cent. .and Californian f r u it s 80 per cent, of Great Britain's consumption. I am credibly informed that 40 per cent, of the workers engaged in the dried f r u it s industry in California are Asiatics. The other day. in answer to a. question, the Minister said that under the bill the Government would accept no responsibility whatever, the arrangements for the marketing of f r u it resting with the board. There is great danger in the Government handing over every for m of responsibility to boards. I quite understand' that f r u it experts and fruit-growers should be represented on the board, but, to bring about a better understanding between Governments, they should have some say in the arrangements made respecting the marketing of our produce overseas. The Minister, when introducing t h e ' bill, to show how necessary it was to control She export of canned f r u it , referred to the success of the butter trade since the D a i r y Produce Export Control Board had taken control. He saidI f tbe I was very interested recently in a graph showing the fluctuations in the price of dairy produce during the first six months of the board's operations, and for the same period of the previous year. The graph for the period prior to the establishment in London of an agency of the Dairy Export Control Board, was like a series of mountain peaks and valleys; whereas for the six months just ended, when the marketing was under the'control of the board, there were slight fluctuations only; in no case did they exceed l i d . per lb., although previously they were as much as 4d. Great Britain imports or 5d. per lb. That statement gave the impression that In other words, Australia everything was well w i th the butter industry, and that the arrangements were working smoothly under the control , of the board.

108,Mr Parkermoloney,"T h a t isJuly, shows that the position respecting the export of butter is not quite so satisfactory as the Minister has indicated ONE MILLION BOXES IN COLD STORAGE. Like fresh f r u it , butter is suffering from excessive retail prices. Despite the recent low wholesale values butter is still being retailed at from Is. lOd. to 2s., but the most important factor keeping down prices is tbe excessive supply, both colonial and Continental. Never before has there been such a large inquiry for Continental butter, while the policy of storing colonial butter in an attempt to maintain prices has resulted in unprecedented accumulations. Official figures, which do not reveal the contents of private cold stores, show that at present there are 1,000,000 boxes in cold storage. In view of this fact and the heavily reduced consumption in the industrial areas owing to the strike, it is the considered opinion of many importers that low prices have come to stay, at any rate for some months. The time has come when we should control the export of fresh fruit. While this form of legislation is desirable to enable us to deal with our surplus stocks, yet it appears to me that the Government is beginning at the wrong end. I have always maintained, and the Labour party too, that tbe best market for our primary products is the local market. Thei'e are thousand of families in Australia to-day who do not know the taste of good fruit. Standing between the producers and the consumers arc certain agents who secure large profits. In this way, the consumers are deprived of good fruit and the producers of a fair return for their labour. the producer and high to. the consumer. position has obtained for years, but, unfortunately, it is becoming more pronounced. Most of the trouble in the export of our primary produce would be obviated if we built up the local market. When speaking on the Dried Fruits Export BillI quoted the case of a returned soldier who is engaged in the dried-fruit industry in the northern part of Victoria. He sent 80 boxes of fruit to the Melbourne market, and after naying for freight and cases, his profit for the consignment was 19s. 6d. not an isolated case. time the newspapers were ful l of such tion in Australia. cases. A similar position exists in keted here at a reasonable price ensuringEngland respecting the marketing of fruit. On the 19th July the Age also published, this paragraphWe are approaching the end of the Australian and New Zealand fresh f r u it season. As far as aggregate shipments are concerned, it has been a record season, for Australia and New Zealand exported over 3,000,000 cases, about 1,000,000 more than they have ever sent before, but financially the season must rank as the most calamitous in the history of the trade. Hief r u it has shown less signs of disease than usual, but there has been an exceptionally high percentage of small-sized f r u it . As far as the condition of the f r u it is concerned, except for a disastrous turnout in one hold of the Port Adelaide,, the amount of ship damage to apples has not been great, but pears were not so fortunate. The market had never been good ""from the beginning. Without doubt the arsenic scare, due to the condition of American apples prior to the first Australian arrivals, definitely reduced the popularity of apple-eating throughout the country. The season was marked by an expensive advertising campaign financed by the growers, the Commonwealth Government, and the Fruit Traders' Federation, but as things turned outit appears that the retailers alone profited from it-thei r prices to the consumers were the same as in previous years, when the wholesale prices were at least 33 per cent, higher. Since tlie strike the average wholesale price of apples has been about 2*d. per lb., but the average retail price was seldom less than 7d. The general strike produced a tremendous congestion of all fruits.

The bill when given effect will no doubt do a great deal to overcome the high cost of distribution and marketing; but a greater measure of responsibility should be placed upon the Government. I want the people overseas to obtain our frui t at a reasonable price ensuring to the Australian producer an adequate return, and also the Australian consumers to have the advantage of a reduction in the price of all classes of primary produce. We should exploit our own market before devoting too much attention to those overseas. I 'realize, of course, that the local demand for some of our primary commodities has been overtaken, and we must make provision for exporting in such cases. I should like tbe Minister to let ine know whether it will be possible for any canned fruit to be exported except under the provisions of this bill. highly regrettable that although boards of this kind are set up to handle our export trade, some producers will not link up with them, but remain outside to the detriment of the industry generally, and their fellow producers in -particular.

When the Dried Fruits Export ControlB ill was before the House some time ago I urged that action should be taken to compel all dried fruit producers to hand their produce over to the board for marketing; but the Government, at that time, could not see the force of my argument, nor, apparently, does it yet see it, although I hope that ultimately it will. It is not fair that a few growers should be permitted to exploit the local market to the detriment of the industry generally. have to participate in this scheme for export. will be able to sell locally. ever that may be, I must congratulate the Government upon adopting at least a portion of the Labour party's policy in regard to the marketing of primary produce ; but it will have to go all the way before both the producers and the consumers are completely satisfied.

The bill proposes a distinct improvement in our methods of marketing Australian primary produce overseas by putting into operation a principle which I have advocated for many years of creating an advisory body overseas. It would be dangerous, however, to allow an unsympathetic government to veto the export of our primary produce; but the constitution of a board from the industry such as is now proposed is highly desirable. have been favorable, for a long while, to the establishment of a board composed of a government nominee as chairman and representatives of the individual growers aud the co-operative and State canneries. The system was tried by the last Parliament, and I understand that it is working very well. Of course, any board is liable to commit errors of judgment and to cause congestion and dislocation in the world's markets by withholding supplies at the wrong time. It is always dangerous to allow produce to accumulate. I had personally to decide when I was Ministerf o r Trade and Customs whether to place on the market a pack or portion of a pack of produce, or to withhold it , and a Minister is in an unenviable position when he has to rely upon the advice of parties abroad in such a matter. It is not a proper function for a responsible Minister. I have a clear recollection of the Eromanga consignment of f r u it , which was sold overseas greatly to the detriment of Australia's good name. was confronted with the term ""damaged goods"" during my term of office, and I know that it took us a very long while to regain our good name. We had to recast all the regulations, set up a better grading system in regard to butter, f r u it , I believe that this and meat, and generally to remodel our marketing arrangements because shipments of inferior produce happened to get abroad. A lost market is extremely difficult to regain. I had the privilege of founding the Australian Meat Council, the Australian Dairying CounI cil, and tbe Australian F r u it Council, which set up the new export standards. The Dairving Council, among other things, determined on a national brand for our butter. Australia should follow her goods overseas. Instead of having them thrown on the market at any time and under any conditions, as is the position at present, an. organization in London w ill be able to advise the board in Australia regarding the state of the market and tbe standard of each season's pack. Irrespective of the regulations which may be in force, f r u it will sometimes be faulty and flavourless. Thef r u it of different seasons w ill bave different features. ' A board on tbe other side of tbe world could I render great service to Australian f r u it growers. I commend the Government whole-heartedly on having decided to establish an agency in London. In doing this, we are following the excellent example set by the people of the TJnited States of America. They follow their goods here, and put them right into our hands. W it h such a system in operation, no one can say that the goods offered are those of another country than that from whicb they purport to come. While this is a step in therigh t direction, it is somewhat dangerous to place in the bands of a body inferior to Parliament the power to veto the export of goods from this country. I do not expect this board to be . free from mistakes. Every trader in the markets of the world must allow for a proportion of failures. The primary producers of Australia can only hope to obtain average prices, and f a i r opportunities for their produce in the world's market. The man who always expects to get tbe top price w ill die w i th I his hopes unrealized.

There is a good deal to be said for the contention that greater efforts should be made to develop tbe home market. Unfortunately, in the early days of the fruit-growing industry, tens of thousands of trees were planted, the fruit of which no one now wants. That was one of the fundamental mistakes made in that industry. Because of the natural objection to uprooting trees that had taken years to grow, it has taken a long time to remedy that error. During recent years things have greatly improved, but we have not yet equalled our great rivals in California, who place their goods on the stand, usual for the pearling fleet to lay market in the most attractive and saleable manner. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned. and Minister for External Affairs [3.51]. -In movingThat the House do now adjourn.

Green), when speaking on the Supply Bill, urged, in the interests of the pearling fleet working off the north-west coast of Western Australia, the desirability of establishing a storm-warning station at Browse Island. This matter has been the subject of consideration by the Commonwealth Meteorologist, who reports that the storm-warning system instituted by the Meteorological Bureau in 1912 meets requirements, and that the slight advantage which would be derived from the establishment of a station on the island would not justify the expenditure which would be involved. Since the establishment of the existing storm-warning system, 24 cyclones have been recorded on the north-west coast, and on only two of those occasions were losses of boats recorded. On the 15th April, 1920, two luggers were wrecked but no lives were lost, and on the Sth March, 1923, two luggers foundered 'and 'one Malay was drowned. Although it is, I underup during the hurricane season, consideration has been given to the question of instituting some means whereby warnings of impending storms may be conveyed to fleets at sea. In response to a suggestion made by the Commonwealth Meteorologist, that sound signals be used for the purpose, the Western Australian bomb rockets to the president of the Pearlers' Association, Broome. In addition to reports received from Koepang and north-west coast stations, the Weather Bureau receives, daily, wireless reports when the vessels are at sea, from five vessels running regularly between Perth, Wyndham and Darwin, and from six vessels trading between the EastI n dies and Singapore, via the Timor Sea and Sydney. These reports, although intermittent, are of much value to the bureau, in framing its forecasts and warnings for the north-west coast and adjacent waters, and to some extent take the place of reports from an ocean island station. I desire to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to a report which appeared in the Melbourne Age, of to-day's date, as follows:MR. S. M . BRUCE'S N EW RESIDENCE . Job May be Declared"" Btacfe.""

In that case union labour would not be available to 611 positions for which non-unionists could not be obtained. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister, during the last election campaign, sought the votes of trade unionists on the ground that his Government was prepared to assist every class in the community, I consider that the press report referred to demands an explanation from him.
