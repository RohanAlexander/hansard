(2) How many ABNs have been: (a) associated with the lodgement of a GST return in the last 12 months, (b) not associated with the submission of a GST return in the last 12 months and (c) found by the ATO to be inactive or no longer operational. (3) What are the criteria for determining the continuing use or functionality of an ABN. (4) Has the ATO found cases of the issue of multiple ABNs to any registered entity; if so, (a) is there any legitimate reason for any entity being issued with multiple ABNs, (b) how many instances of multiple ABN issues have been found, and (c) what is the highest number of ABNs that have been issued to a single entity. (5) Does the issue of multiple ABNs provide opportunities to attempt the commission of taxation fraud. (6) Does the ATO undertake any data matching to reduce the instances of multiple issue of ABNs (7) What steps has the ATO taken to eliminate or reduce instances of multiple ABN issue. (1) As at 8 September 2003, the ATO had issued a total of 4 751 448 ABNs.

It should be noted that not all entities with an ABN are required to be registered for GST. Further, GST lodgement can be monthly, quarterly or annual depending on certain criteria. Therefore a proportion of recent registrants’ GST lodgement may not yet be due. (c) The number of ABNs inactive or no longer operational ie cancelled is 491 933. (3) In general, an entity can continue to use its ABN unless the enterprise: has been sold has ceased, or is no longer carried on in Australia or not making supplies that are connected to Australia.

163,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Yes. (a) There are some legitimate circumstances where an entity can be issued with more than one ABN. For example, a person can be entitled to an ABN in their own right and another in their capacity as trustee of a trust. In each of those capacities the person is taken to be a different entity for the purposes of issuing an ABN. (b) 12 723. (c) These matters are sub judice. (5) See answer to 4(a) above. (6) Yes. (7) The ATO’s registration systems routinely validate the identity of the applicant (and associates where appropriate) as an integral part of the registration process via the matching of information with existing ATO identity data. Further data matching and detection systems are run regularly across the ATO’s registers to identify potential multiple registrants. The ATO has, and continues to undertake, data matching and cleansing activities targeting the improvement in the integrity of both the tax file number and ABN registers. This includes specific attention to the identification and elimination of existing multiple ABNs as well as further investment in enhancing their prevention and detection systems. Taxation: Evasion (Question No. 1640) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 March 2003: What investigations are currently being undertaken in the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) with respect to (a) breaches of the Income Tax Assessment Act by barristers with residential addresses or normal places of business located in the State of Queensland and (b) with respect to use of the following legal instruments for the express or substantive intention of avoiding or evading taxation: (i) Family Trusts in equity law, (ii) Property Orders under the Family Law Act, (iii) Debtors’ petitions under the Bankruptcy Act, (iv) any other legal instrument, lawful in itself, yet with the intention of being used to put the assets of the barrister out of the reach of their sole or principal creditor, the Commissioner of Taxation; if there are no investigations into these issues, why not. (a) (b) It would be inappropriate to detail the nature and extent of Australian Taxation Office investigations. The Commissioner of Taxation continually monitors all occupations for breaches of the tax laws and takes appropriate action where cases are identified. Taxation: Employee Incentive Trust Scheme (Question No. 2071) Mr Windsor asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: (1) What action will he take in response to the issues raised in the editorial in Taxpayers Australia on 28 April 2003 that posed the question “Has the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) become a law unto itself”.",119,Questions On Notice
164,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) What action is the ATO taking in response to the Federal Court’s decision on Essenbourne Pty Ltdv Commissioner of Taxation [2002] and can he explain the implications of this action. (3) Is the Australian Taxation Office ignoring the Federal Court’s decision on the Essenbourne employee incentive trust scheme case by pursuing taxpayers who have been involved in similar employee incentive trust schemes; if not, will he explain why; if so, will he intervene to direct the ATO to treat all taxpayers in similar circumstances in a manner consistent with the Court’s decision and in light of the concerns expressed in the Taxpayers Australia editorial. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that a senior ATO officer has responded directly to Mr McDonald, addressing the issues raised in the article. (2) The Commissioner of Taxation advised that in the case of Essenbourne Pty Ltdv Commissioner of Taxation, [2002] ATC 5201; (2002) 51ATR 629, the Federal Court upheld the ATO’s decision to disallow a deduction claimed under the general deduction provisions of the tax law, in respect of a payment to an employee benefit trust. While the Court also found that neither FBT nor Part IVA applied, the ATO felt that not enough clarity was given to these issues, but saw no point in appealing as the court confirmed that the scheme did not create allowable deductions. The ATO is continuing to deny deductions and to decide objections in similar cases, in accordance with the Essenbourne decision. However, the ATO has offered reduced penalties for taxpayers involved in these arrangements who agree to settle. The implications of these actions are that taxpayers will either settle with the ATO on the basis of a single taxing point, or they will choose to litigate, in which case the courts will determine the appropriate single taxing point. Because of the structure of EBAs, they generally involve multiple possible taxing points. The ATO issued multiple assessments to ensure that all the relevant legal issues will be considered by the courts in the event of litigation. (3) The Commissioner of Taxation advised that the Federal Court’s decision in Essenbourne affirmed the ATO’s view that payments made to these types of employee benefit trusts do not create allowable deductions. The ATO’s settlement offer to participants in these arrangements is entirely consistent with the court decision. Office of Film and Literature Classification: Selection Processes (Question No. 2171) Ms Plibersek asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 11 August 2003: Was Ms Maureen Shelley’s position at the Office of Film and Literature Classification publicly advertised and subject to public and objective selection processes; if not, why not.

(2) Does the Act direct how the airport-lessee company should plan for dealing with the environmental issues which flow from the assessment of those environmental issues, if so, which parts of the Act apply and how do they operate. (1) and (2) I have dealt exhaustively already with matters relating to New South Wales environmental issues and the Long Term Operating Plan in the context of the Airports Act in response to questions previously asked by the Honourable member.

(4) Has the Government given consideration to the duties owed by legal practitioners with regard to the preservation of documents which might be relevant to anticipated legal proceedings in the course of its work on national regulation of the legal profession; if so, what steps is the Government taking to ensure that the federal administration of justice is not undermined by the destruction of documents which might be relevant to anticipated legal proceedings. (1) The former Attorney-General received a request from the Attorney-General of Victoria. As there was no Constitutional issue involved, the Attorney-General could not have intervened in the proceedings as of right. He decided not to seek leave to intervene having regard to the limited responsibility of the Commonwealth in relation to the matter before the court. (2) On3 October 2003, the High Court, in refusing leave to appeal, expressed no view on the correctness of the Victorian Court of Appeal’s statements as to principle. It is unclear whether legal proceedings in relation to this matter may continue in the Victorian Supreme Court. Accordingly I do not propose to comment publicly on issues that may be in dispute in any such proceedings. (3) See the answer to (2) above. (4) Regulation of the conduct of legal practitioners is a matter for the States and Territories. The National Legal Profession Project, conducted through the Standing Committee of Attorneys General and chaired by New South Wales, will address the development of a uniform definition of ‘professional misconduct’ for the purposes of State and Territory disciplinary processes.

If cat or dog fur were imported as apparel then it would be subject to labelling by regulations made under the CTD Act. These require that articles of apparel must be labelled with the name of the country in which the goods were made or produced and a true description of the goods. The CTD Act also requires that any labelling about composition applied to any imported or exported goods must not be misleading. (2) and (3) No. The Government currently is considering a number of options to address concerns with the import and export of cat and dog furs. The options under review include an import and export ban; domestic market controls, along the lines of that adopted in the USA; labelling of goods and making representations to the Governments of the alleged source countries.",122,Questions On Notice

The information that was stored on the missing servers is currently being reconstructed and analysed by the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD). The DSD findings will be documented in their final report. Until this work is completed it would be premature to answer parts a, b, and c of the question.

The Commissioner of Taxation, as a creditor in the estate of Mr Cummins, has funded the trustee in bankruptcy to pursue assets transferred to Mrs Cummins. The matter was before the Federal Court and a judgment was handed down on 24 September 2003 which will result in a recovery of about 97 cents in the dollar by the trustee. Taxation: New South Wales Bar Association (Question No. 2447) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further the answer to question No. 1886 (Hansard, 15 September 2003, page 19412,) has the Commissioner of Taxation’s communications with the New South Wales Bar Association included communication about the professional misconduct of particular barristers; if not, why not; if so, what are the details. The Commissioner has communicated to the Bar Association his findings in aggregated form in respect of activities undertaken by certain barristers without divulging their identities. Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 prevents the Commissioner of Taxation from discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers with others except when expressly empowered to do so under the Act. The Bar Association of New South Wales is not an entity to which the Commissioner can provide such information.

Since that time, persons enrolling and changing their enrolment details have been required to provide their place of birth so that their entitlement on citizenship grounds could be established. Only those British subjects enrolled on the 25 January 1984 who have updated their enrolment details since that date have been identified as such in the AEC’s records. (1) (a) There are currently 173,802 electors on the Roll who were identified as British subjects at the time of their re-enrolment. Some of these may have become Australian citizens since they last updated their enrolment. There are also a number of British subjects who were enrolled at the relevant time but who have not since changed their address or updated their enrolment details and who, as a consequence, the AEC cannot identify as British subjects. The AEC has no way of accurately estimating the number of these electors. (b) The number of electors on the Roll, identified as British subjects at the time of their reenrolment in Queensland is 30,866. (c) The number of electors on the Roll, identified as British subjects for the Division of Bowman is 1,382. (2) The AEC is unaware of any proposed changes the Government may be planning.

(6) Were two differing transcripts of the same tape recording made by the AIT and were both withheld from the Coronial inquiry. (7) Is the Minister aware that Captain Mackelmann claims to have evidence indicating that the tape has been manipulated in a way which would explain the seven second time difference. (8) Can the Minister explain how the transcript of the tape used at the Board of Inquiry (BOI) and provided to the Coroner put F/Lt Riley further back behind Craig Mackelmann than he was in the transcript used by the AIT. (9) Has the possibility that F/Lt Riley committed a breach of Air Force Orders and was being protected been investigated; if not, why not. (10) Is there actual evidence which supports the RAAF assertion that no guns were fired; if so, why does the RAAF refuse to provide it to Captain Mackelmann. (11) Did the RAAF witnesses interviewed by the Ombudsman regarding the downloading of the returned ammunition unload F/Lt Riley’s aircraft; if not, who did and why were they not interviewed. (12) Did the BOI inquire into whether proper radio procedures were being followed at the time of the accident; if so, what were its findings; if not, why not.

(17) Why did Defence try to prevent Captain Mackelmann obtaining a copy of Air Commodore Ford’s interview with Senator Durack. (18) Was Air Commodore Ford’s interview with Senator Durack instrumental in challenging Air Commodore Ford’s testimony to the AAT. (19) Did the AAT ask the RAAF to conduct a further search for the gun camera cine film from the returned aircraft.

(21) Is the Minister able to explain (a) whether a breakdown in radio procedures occurred prior to the accident, (b) whether it is correct procedure for a pilot to hear an “off safe” from the previous pilot on a banner before calling “in live”, and (c) what the purpose is of the “off safe” and “in live” calls. (22) Does the AIT transcript of the radio calls show F/Lt Riley “in live” 32 seconds after Craig Mackelmann called “in live” with no “off safe” call made by Craig Mackelmann; if so, will the Minister explain whether this is a breach of range safety standing orders. (23) Has the possibility that F/Lt Riley had made an incorrect “in live” call and been too close to Craig Mackelmann been investigated; if not, why not. (24) Has Captain Mackelmann’s hypothesis in respect of the accident been considered; if so, what evidence (a) supports it, and (b) contradicts it; if not, why not. (25) Do the Range Standing Orders state that it is preferable for the Range Safety Officer to be a nonparticipating pilot. (26) Was F/Lt Riley the Range Safety Officer at the time of the accident and what authority, if any, did the civil pilots in the tug aircraft “with Range Safety Officer responsibilities inherent in its role” have over F/Lt Riley. (27) Should the civil pilots have reacted when F/Lt Riley called “in live” before Craig Mackelmann called “off safe”; if so, how; if not, why not. The information sought in the honourable member’s question is not readily available. To collect and assemble such information solely for the purpose of answering the question would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure and effort that would be required. Mr Mackelmann, the father of Pilot Officer Craig Mackelmann, who was killed in the accident, has corresponded for the past 17 years with Defence. Defence has done everything possible to assist Mr Mackelmann with his requests for information so that he may have closure on the matter. I am satisfied that the loss of the Mirage aircraft A3-40 has been adequately investigated. The Mirage accident has been the subject of an Accident Investigation; Board of Inquiry; Coronial Inquest; Ombudsman Investigation; Review of Structural Management Practices; Senator the Hon Peter Durack, QC Review; Defence Science and Technology Organisation Aeronautical Maritime Research Laboratory Structural Integrity Review; and Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The matter has also been the subject of a considerable number of Freedom of Information requests. Crime: Money Laundering (Question No. 2713) Further to the answer to question No. 2211, has the Reserve Bank of Australia conducted a symposium on money laundering; if so, (a) when was it held, (b) where was it held, (c) who attended it, and (d) was a presentation made on behalf of the Reserve Bank to that symposium; if so, is a copy of the presentation publicly available. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has not conducted a symposium on money-laundering. The RBA provided a venue for a symposium (on 30 September 2002) on money-laundering which was organised by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC). The RBA was not represented at this symposium.
