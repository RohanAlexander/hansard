In view of the effect that this is having, particularly on the junior tennis-playing community of this country, to whom tennis is a very important game, can the Minister give any information to the House or will he seek information and provide it later? the same article that is used in the manufacture of sausage casings? Mr J. R. Fraser -No. what is the present position with respect to the import of sheep gut, but I will ascertain the position and let the honourable member know. Labour and National Service a question relating to what has been described as an authorized stop-work meeting of waterside workers in Brisbane last Monday. Can the Minister say who authorized the stopwork meeting? In view of the fact that a notice was issued to various waterside workers indicating that if they did not attend the stop-work meeting they would be fined, will the Minister examine the position in order to see what can be done to curb this exercise of Soviet-like tyranny? viously had my attention directed to this particular matter. The authorization of stop-work meetings is normally the function of the representative of the authority, I understand-certainl y of some appropriate body constituted with jurisdiction for that purpose. As to the rule which might give a union power to fine a member for failure to attend a meeting, there is a provisionor there was until quite recent times-for a challenge before the Commonwealth Industrial Court to any rule which is deemed to be tyrannous or unreasonable. Jurisdiction was transferred to that court after the decision in the Boilermakers case, but unfortunately, the legal position has become, if not more confused, a little more involved as to the practicability of dealing with the type of matter to which the honourable member refers. The High Court has not a judicial function to be exercised by the Commonwealth Industrial Court. We are having a look at the consequences of that decision, but it would appear, at the moment, that there is no tribunal clothed with jurisdiction for this particular purpose. The question of whether union members should be required to attend meetings is one, of course, upon which there can be differences of view. I have no doubt, in my own mind, as to the desirability of members of unions attending meetings which have been called. I believe that much of the industrial trouble which occurs in Australia could be eliminated if only the individual rank and file unionists would attend meetings and take an active interest in the issues which are discussed. spread interest throughout industry in the effects of the Japanese Trade AgreementI do not desire in any way to exaggerate those effectsI ask the Minister for Trade: Will he consider making periodical statements containing information as to the increases in licences granted for imports from Japan in the different industrial categories, and also as to the work done by the adviser appointed to consider the effects of the Japanese Trade Agreement, in order ,to acquaint industry with what is happening and so remove the possibility of exaggeration or any kind of unreasonable reaction? mind, for some of the reasons stated by the honourable member and as a result of the general interest displayed by honourable members in the Japanese Trade Agreement, to make a statement not precisely of the characted suggested by the honourable member but along those general lines.

In view of the wide incidence of rheumatoid arthritis, especially amongst age pensioners, and the success of the drug in relieving the disease, together with the high cost of the drug, which is from 8s. to 12s. a day over a period of treatment, will the Minister state why the advisory committee has rejected this drug as a pharmaceutical benefit? Will the Minister refer the matter back to the advisory committee with a view to the drug being made available free as a benefit to eligible sufferers of this painful and crippling disease, which is so prevalent in Australia? tion is that the Government is advised by a highly expert committee. The committee makes its decisions on clinical grounds. I do not propose to justify the decisions of the committee, because that would involve a great deal of technical argument. Obviously, if the Government is to be advised as to what drugs should be made available for specific clinical conditions, it must be advised by its chosen experts. The committee has frequently reviewed the question of arthritis and has always been of the opinion that other drugs are available which are in some respects as satisfactory as, and in others, perhaps, more satisfactory than, prednisolone, to which the honourable gentleman referred. The committee is always willing to receive fresh representations, and I have no doubt that it will from time to time review the indications for the use of this drug. forcing people to suffer! a question of saving money at all. The committee has nothing to do with the question of expense. As I have said, the committee makes its decisions entirely on clinical grounds, and surely it is reasonable that, if public funds are to be expended in providing drugs, the expense should be incurred on the advice of experts and not on the advice of those who consider themselves to be experts. question, which is directed to the Treasurer, is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Adelaide. Is it not a fact that the original suggestion for the inclusion in the programme of the Prime Minister of Japan of the item mentioned by the honourable member was made by a governmental authority in Canberra?

I refer also to proceedings that took place before Mr Commissionei Portus in August of this year. I shall outline the claim in order to make the point that I want the Minister to consider. In a claim against the private trading banks, the Bank Officers Association asked that an award be extended to cover bank officers in New Guinea, that the daily spread of hours be between 8.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. and that extra remuneration be given for Saturday morning work.

Before coming to our decision, we ascertained the views of representatives of the trade union movement and of management, and we had regard, as best we could, to the experience of the functioning of these provisions, where they existed, and to the outcome of the absence of such provisions in some of the State jurisdictions. Therefore, the policy was determined after thorough consideration and adopted by the Parliament.

The honourable member has referred to factors which, in his view, suggest that grounds for the appearance of counsel were not sufficiently strong. Although he may have put forward his comments in all good faith, I cannot assume from what he has said that the factors referred to by him were the only ones which exercised the mind of the commissioner. Having said that by way of general comment, I shall take an opportunity to examine the case to which the honourable member has referred to see whether I can derive any guidance from it. to the Minister for Air, and refers to his four months often elapse before pensions recent statement concerning the developbecome available to applicants for the age ment of strategic airfields in Australia.

Further, will he see whether it is possible to have all outstanding applications for the age pension lodged one month or more ago dealt with before Christmas, so that the applicants concerned may enjoy Christmas as other people do? consider any immediate amendment to the Social Services Act as suggested in the terms of the honourable member's question. To my certain knowledge, there is no undue delay when the age pension is applied for. It is necessary to make certain investigations in order to apply the means test in the normal course of events.

It is never honestly meant, and it is always brought down for the purpose of curtailing discussion. This Government has a disgraceful record with respect to the use of the guillotine. It has used it on 22 occasions. This will be the twenty-third. It has applied the closure, or the gag, on no fewer than 520 occasions. Yet it claims to be a democratic government! It claims Is leave to have respect for the rights of members of the Parliament! It claims to govern in accordance with the best traditions of democratic governments everywhere! I am sure that, if this sort of thing happened in the House of Commons, or in the United States Congress, there would be widespread expressions of indignation against it. The Opposition is opposed to the use of the guillotine. It always has been. It will vote against it. was surprised to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) say that he was opposed to the use of the guillotine in all circumstances and at all times. That is the greatest misstatement that I have heard since I have been a member of this House. Those honourable members who sat here when the Labour government was in office know that that government often used the guillotine. The present Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who was a Minister in that government, did not oppose the use of the guillotine, or speak against it, on one occasion when Labour was in office. So the statement that he has just made, opposing the use of the guillotine, is a gem of a misstatement of the facts. Question putThat the motion be agreed to. The House divided.

You, Mr Speaker, told us at question time to-day that the bill had been passed by this House at 6 o'clock yesterday and that at 7.30 a message transmitting the bill and asking the Senate for its concurrence in the bill had reached the Senate. But the bill has not been discussed in the Senate. It has disappeared somewhere in that portion of the building between 7.30 p.m. yesterday and now. In other words, it is not really an urgent measure. The declaration of urgency was a sham. It was urgent in this place but, in another place, every step is being taken to avoid a vote on it. The Government is attempting to avoid a vote on it because some members of the Opposition in the Senate who are ill are now present. One of them in particular has been seriously ill, and is still far from well, and the Government is delaying putting the bill to a vote in the Senate in the expectation that that senator's health will deteriorate. order, Mr Speaker, I should like to ask you whether the matter being discussed by the Leader of the Opposition relates to the bill before us-the Banking Bill 1957-o r whether it concerns entirely a bill which passed through this House a couple of days ago? gentleman is in order. right honourable gentleman in order in discussing in this House business that is proceeding in another place? gentleman would not be in order in discussing business that was proceeding or pending in another place. I ask the right honourable gentleman to keep that in mind. Dr. Mohammed's coffin, is suspended between heaven and earth. The bill is being kept from the other chamber because the Government does not want the Senate to decide it except after the failure in health of an Opposition senator. That is a scandalous state of affairs. I pass now to bill No. 2, which was passed by this House at one o'clock this morning. Fourteen hours have elapsed since that bill was passed. No doubt that bill is also intended to reach the Senate; so far it has not appeared there. The Government's objective is to inconvenience people who have come specially to vote under conditions so adverse and difficult that they would cause pity in the heart of the least compassionate person. NowI come to the bill before the House. The Opposition feels that the sham should end and that we, as a House or as a committee, should deal with this bill as soon as possible. I suggest to the Minister that the committee stages be taken as a whole so that we can have a third chance Mr Harold HoltI rise to order. I have now had an opportunity to examine the record of the House with regard to the matter I raised with you, Mr Speaker, earlier. You said then, Sir, that there was nothing in the Standing Orders that would prevent the right honourable gentleman from speaking to this measure. I remind you that on 24th October last the House agreed to a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders dealing with this very matter. The terms of the motion wereThat so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the right honourable the Treasurer and the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition each speaking without limitation of time on the second reading of each of the following bills:-Reserv e Bank, Commonwealth Banks, Banking, and Banking (Transitional Provisions).

Therefore, the right honourable gentleman House may work smoothly, that he keep to the point. mittee stages be taken as a whole, which will save some time.

The Minister was reported as having charged the Opposition with bringing to the ParUament the lame, the halt, and the sick, in order to obstruct the Government in another place. Has anybody ever heard a claim that smacks so much of dictatorship? The right honourable gentleman is referring to persons who are senators, elected by the people. He says that they have no right to be there. They are the lame, the halt, and the sick, and they are there to obstruct the Government, says the Minister. Therefore, if the Senate defeats legislation, that is obstruction of this Government. But if the Senate decides a matter in the Government's favour, that is a wonderful piece of co-operation on the part of the Senate. The right honourable gentleman has two standards. He applies one form of language to matters that help him, and when he is under criticism and fire he sees things quite differently. I think that this situation that has arisen is a most serious one. I hope that what I say will not be misunderstood.

My complaint is that the Government in this House, and Government representatives in the other place, have conspired to prevent the Senate from discussing this matter. As I understand the Standing Orders, when Mr Speaker's message reaches the Senate and is read it must be at once put to the vote. The Government does not want a vote. It wants to delay the matter until some person's health breaks down, hoping, by such a disgusting and disgraceful strategy, to avoid defeat. The Opposition has carefully considered this matter and it feels that it should take every possible Fraser, Malcolm step to see that the scandal is ended, and that the legislation is voted upon in another place. For that purpose R -[100 ] direct statement of what is to happen in another place. I submit that the right honourable gentleman should be ordered permanently to resume his seat. which I direct the right honourable gentleman's attention, provides that any reference to anything pending in another place, or the proceedings in another place, is out of order. I ask the right honourable gentleman to bear that in mind. ment from this House requesting the Senate's concurrence. Steps have been taken to prevent the decision of this House being considered in another place and receiving concurrence or dissent. This is the first time in the history of this Parliament that such a thing has happened. The result is to hold up the very bills that the Government, through the Minister, says are urgent. The truth is that the bills are urgent if the Government can slip them through in another place, but they are not urgent if the Government has to face criticism and defeat elsewhere.

106,Mr Osborne (Evans,"Minister forfor re-equipment purposes, and that it was proposed to eliminate the wasteful effects of uneconomic competition on trunk routes by strengthening the rationalization provisions of the Civil Aviation Agreement. Under these conditions the Government believed-and still believes-that the trunk route operators will be able to make profits and yet provide at the same time the efficient type of service for which the Australian airlines are noted. I should now like to review, very briefly, the protracted negotiations concerning the future of A.N.A. At first these negotiations centred around a series of proposals submitted by the A.N.A. board for the formation of a holding company. Initially, Mr for replacing the DC3 aircraft. The Haddy, chairman of A.N.A., suggested as a basis for negotiation a holding company, having an issued capital of £15,500,000T.A.A. receiving £7,000,000 in shares; A.N.A. shareholders receiving £6,500,000, half in shares and half cash; and other operators receiving up to £2,000,000. It should be clearly understood that whereas T.A.A.'s assets have a net worth of at least £7,000,000, A.N.A.'s assets were encumbered to the extent of £3,600,000, and had a net worth of between £3,000,000 and £3,500,000, so that the relative shareholdings in the holding company proposed by Mr Haddy bore no relation whatsoever to the net worth of the assets of the two undertakings. Subsequently, the A.N.A. board submitted a revised proposal under which the holding company would have an issued capital of £12,000,000, of which A.N.A.'s holding would be £4,500,000, and T.A.A.'s £5,500,000, with the proviso that A.N.A.'s shareholders would withdraw properties and investments having a current value estimated at £2,000,000 and that tax in respect of such investments, estimated at £500,000, would be remitted. It has already been indicated in Parliament that these proposals were rejected, and there were quite decisive reasons why this should be the case. The concept of a holding company was quite inconsistent with the Government's philosophy of two major operators competing on trunk routes under equal conditions and would inevitably have led to a monopoly. Quite apart from these fundamental objections, the financial basis of the proposals was in any case unacceptable because the level of capitalization proposed was too high to achieve anything like advised to withdraw the interjection. the A.N.A. target of 8 per cent, return on shareholders' funds, and the respective shareholdings proposed by the A.N.A. board were heavily weighted in A.N.A.'s favour and involved the A.N.A. shareholders withdrawing some £2,000,000 worth of assets from the air transport industry. Following rejection of the holding company the A.N.A. board indicated that its shareholders were unwilling to accept the measures which the Government had made known to the board, and subsequently announced in its policy review. It will be recalled that these measures included the subsidization of unprofitable DC3 services to rural areas and the granting of assistance A.N.A. board then indicated that it would proceed to liquidate unless a satisfactory offer were made for the purchase of the shares in A.N.A. by any of the various groups which had made overtures for this purpose. The position was complicated because A.N.A. had in the month of June defaulted in the repayment of the loans which the Commonwealth had guaranteed under the 1952 Civil Aviation Agreement.

116,Mr Speaker,"He could be wellessential air services while A.N.A.'s shareholders completed their arrangements to either liquidate or sell their shares, the Government facilitated an extension of the time for paying the instalments due under the loans which it had guaranteed. Of the several groups which made overtures for the purchase of the shares only Ansett Transport Industries Limited was prepared to proceed on the basis of the Government's declared policy of subsidizing unprofitable feeder services, a strengthening of the rationalization provisions of the agreement and, in appropriate circumstances, granting financial assistance in the form of guaranteed loans for the purpose of re-equipment. There were numerous reasons, of course, why a sale of the shares of A.N.A. was preferable to a complete liquidation of the company. The latter would have involved the disruption of essential air services, unemployment of many of A.N.A.'s skilled and loyal staff of some 3,500 and the extinction of a great airline which had pioneered air services in Australia and had over the years made a vital contribution to the development of air transport in this country. Following detailed negotiations between Ansett Transport Industries Limited and A.N.A., on which the Government's stated policy had an important bearing, the A.N.A. board finally decided on behalf of its shareholders to sell all the issued shares arranged. Since 1952, the Commonwealth to Ansett Transport Industries Limited for the sum of £3,300,000. The sale agreement was signed on 3rd October and the new Ansett-nominated board assumed control on that date. I should like to emphasize that the new civil aviation agreement is fully supported by both Ansett Transport Industries Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission, and suggest that this is perhaps the best indication that the Government's policy as embodied in this agreement is in the best possible interests of both Australian Mutual Provident Society, was a trunk route operators and of the air transport industry as a whole. I turn now to the detailed provisions of the proposed legislation. Briefly, the purpose of the bill is threefold(i) Firstly, to authorize execution of the agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth. (ii) Secondly, to authorize the commission to execute the agreement and to do whatever the agreement requires; and (iii) Thirdly, to authorize the Commonwealth to guarantee the balance of loans outstanding under the 1952 agreement, following a re-arrangement of the periods of the loans. The first clause of the bill requiring comment is clause 4, which empowers the Australian National Airlines Commission to enter into the new agreement, and to carry out its obligations and avail itself of the rights conferred under the agreement. The commission was not a party to the 1952 agreement, but is required by section 5 of the 1952 act to do everything which the agreement provides that the commission will do. Accordingly, while effectively bound, the commission was not a voluntary party to the 1952 agreement. On the other hand, the commission not only has no objection to the new agreement, but, on the contrary, has indicated its willingness to become a voluntary party, provided that the Parliament empowers it to do so. Clause5 of the bill is necessary to obtain parliamentary approval to guarantee amounts payable under existing loans granted in pursuance of clause 3 of the 1952 Civil Aviation Agreement which, following default by A.N.A., are to be rehas guaranteed three loans to A.N.A., totalling £4,350,000, to purchase two DC6 and four DC6B aircraft. The first loan from the Commonwealth Bank was a sum of £1,500,000, and as at 30th June, 1957, a balance of £600,000, plus interest for the preceding six months was outstanding. The second loan, also from the Commonwealth Bank, was a sum of £1,500,000, and as at 30th June, 1957, a balance of £1,019,000, plus interest for the preceding six months, was outstanding. The third loan, from the sum of £1,350,000, and as at 15th June, 1957, the full amount of the loan, plus interest for the preceding six months, was outstanding. Originally, the three loans were repayable over a period of five years, with the principal to be reduced by ten equal instalments at six-monthly intervals. A.N.A. defaulted",36,Civil Aviation Agreement
117,Mr Osborne,"In order to maintainin the three instalments totalling £435,000, plus interest, due in June, 1957. During the negotiations for the sale of A.N.A., the Commonwealth facilitated a period of grace to enable A.N.A. to determine its future. It will be appreciated that, by purchasing all the shares in A.N.A., Ansett Transport Industries Limited automatically assumed the obligations, as well as the benefits, of A.N.A. under the Civil Aviation Agreement. Before concluding its purchase, Ansett Transport Industries Limited therefore entered into detailed negotiations with the Government to obtain a re-arrangement of the loans in default, and to allow a reasonT.A.A. competes only with Ansett Transable period in which to discharge the outstanding obligations it hereby assumed. Briefly, Ansett Transport Industries Limited sought the following re-arrangement of the loans:-It requested that the A.M.P. Society loan of £1,350,000, and the two Commonwealth Bank loans, of which balances of, £600,000 and £1,019,000 are outstanding,"" together, in each case, with accrued interest, should be re-financed over afive-yearperiod commencing on the date of execution of the agreement for the purchase of all the shares in A.N.A., and that the first instalments in repayment of these loans, as re-financed, should be due and payable, together with current interest, six months after the date of execution of that agreement. On Ansett Transport Industries Limited agreeing to execute the new agreement in the schedule to the bill, which, as indicated, gives effect to the Government's policy and, in particular, preserves the philosophy underlying the Civil Aviation Agreement 1952, it was considered proper and reasonable that the Commonwealth should facilitate the re-arrangement of the loans on this basis, particularly as the security for the loans substantially exceeds the balance still outstanding. Clause5 of the bill seeks parliamentary authority to guarantee the loans as re-arranged. The schedule to the bill sets forth the proposed supplementary agreement. The parties are the Commonwealth, the commission, A.N.A., Ansett Transport Industries Limited, and Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited. The recitals indicate the relation of this agreement to the 1952 agreement: That Ansett Transport Industries Limited has purchased all the shares in A.N.A. and controls Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited; that the parties desire to establish decide issues after all other avenues of a rationalization committee to supplement the rationalization machinery under the old agreement and, in particular, to state the Commonwealth's policy of two, and only two, trunk route operators, one being the commission, each capable of effective competition with the other. Clause1 of the agreement substantially extends the scope of the routes which are subject to rationalization. The 1952 agreement relates only to routes on which T.A.A. and A.N.A. were competing in 1952. It does not extend to routes developed thereafter or, of course, to routes on which port Industries Limited and its subsidiaries, other than A.N.A. This clause extends rationalization to all competitive routes, namely, routes on which the commission and any one airline in which Ansett Transport Industries Limited has a controlling interest, including A.N.A., operate or propose to operate. Clause3 of the agreement establishes a rationalization committee comprising a co-ordinator nominated by the Minister for Civil Aviation, and two additional members nominated by the commission and the company respectively. Clause4 sets out in some detail the functions of the proposed committee. If the commission and the company are unable to agree on questions of routes, fares and freights, time-tables and other related questions, the matter in dispute may be referred to the committee and if, after further consideration, the airlines are still unable to agree, the co-ordinator decides the matter. His decision is binding, but either airline, if still dissatisfied, may appeal to the independent chairman, Sir John Latham, in which event the co-ordinator will furnish the reason for his decision in writing to the chairman. There are several reasons for this supplementary rationalization machinery. The present machinery is unsuitable for obtaining day-to-day decisions on rationalization matters and, in some respects, unsuitable for broad policy decisions, since this type of issue has to be considered in the light of overall air transport policy, and no procedure has existed for placing such policy considerations before the chairman. It is believed that the supplementary machinery will cure both these defects while retaining, as I believe is essential, a completely impartial chairman to agreement have been exhausted. The informal co-ordination committee can meet at very short notice on matters of detail which are in their cumulative effect of great importance, but which would not justify separate references to the chairman and, indeed, in practice would not be referred to him, but could simply snowball into uneconomic operations. I refer to such matters as the take-off time of a particular flight and the increase of frequencies, or the introduction of an additional stopping place on a particular route. Where major policy issues are involved, the chairman will now have the advantage of detailed reasons for the co-ordinator's decision which will no doubt survey national civil aviation policy considerations, as well as the views of the partisan operators. I take this opportunity of placing on record recognition of the valuable services already rendered by Sir John, as chairman, and to express the appreciation of the Government, and indeed of all parties, for his advice that he will continue to be availbelieves it should bring much-needed able, not only for the purposes of the 1952 agreement, but also for the new agreement. Clause5 of the agreement requires Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited to cease operation of airline services and is necessary to achieve the Government's policy of two, and only two, major trunk route operators, one being the commission. A period of 25 months is allowed for the complete merging of Ansett-A.N.A. operations, since the terms of the sale of A.N.A. extend over a period of 24 months. It is believed, however, that complete integration should be achieved much sooner. Under clause 6 of the agreement, Ansett Transport Industries Limited undertakes to ensure that airlines in which it has a controlling interest will not act inconsistently with the objects of the agreement. Clause7 of the agreement deals with past omissions by A.N.A. The object of this clause is to preserve the right of A.N.A. to obtain, in certain circumstances, further financial assistance. During the first ten years of the 1952 agreement, A.N.A. is entitled to further guaranteed loans, provided that such loans are necessary to achieve heavy equipment parity with the commission, and provided also that the balance outstanding at any time does not exceed £4,000,000. However, the Commonwealth is discharged from the obligation to facilitate any further loans if there has been a default on the part of A.N.A. This clause has the effect of removing any disqualification on Ansett Transport Industries Limited for eligibility for further loans which could have resulted from the default of the previous owners of A.N.A. Finally, it will be noted that nothing in the agreement requires or permits operators to act inconsistently with the Air Navigation Act and Regulations-claus e 8-and that the period of agreement has the same duration as the Civil Aviation Agreement of 1952, and therefore will continue in force until October, 1967-claus e 9. This legislation has, I think, the distinct advantage of being accepted quite voluntarily by all the airlines which are parties to itT.A.A., A.N.A. and Ansett Transport Industries Limited-as being not only in their best interests, but also in the best interests of the industry as a whole. In these circumstances, the Government stability to air transport and, in the long term, assist greatly in the promotion of a self-sufficient industry. I commend the bill to the favorable consideration of honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr. Evatt) adjourned. AIR NAVIGATION (CHARGES) BILL 1957. Second Reading. Air) [8.21] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of this bill is to increase by 10 per cent, the charges payable for the use by aircraft of aerodromes, air route and airway facilities, meteorological services and search and rescue services provided by the Commonwealth. Air route charges were first introduced in 1947, and the present scale was introduced by the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952, which this bill amends. Under present conditions, the 10 per cent, increase will yield an additional £50,000 in revenue, and will increase total recovery to some £550,000 per annum. It is proposed that the increase in charges shall become effective from 1st January, 1958.",37,Civil Aviation Agreement
118,Mr Osborne (Evans,"Minister forThe increase is a relatively modest one, and, spread over the entire industry, will -not have any severe effects. However, the legislation is important because it reaffirms the objective of achieving a more self-supporting air transport industry. It is proposed to keep the scale of charges under periodical review with the object of progressively reducing the gap between the cost of providing facilities and the revenue obtained from the users. Tne opportunity is taken to amend the schedules to the act to provide for a number of situations not contemplated when the 1952 legislation was enacted, and also to bring up to date the table of nights contained in the First Schedule to the act. Broadly, charges for airline operations are calculated by multiplying the unit rating of an aircraft which is based on its all-up weight by the factor specified in the act for the flight in question. The factor has been calculated having regard to the extent of facilities, including aerodromes, provided along the route of the flight. Flights for which a factor is specified have been increased from 219 to 310 to cover all flights at present being operated by regular public transport services. In this connection I should mention a significant change in the regulation-making power. Section6 of the 1952 act authorized regulations amending the schedules to the act. In the light of five years' experience there is no longer any justification for vesting such wide powers in the executive. The power to amend the schedules by regulation is therefore repealed, but if a new route is developed the regulations may specify the factor applicable to a flight over that route. In view of the comprehensive coverage of 310 flights in the new table, this power to specify the factor for new flights is a very narrow one indeed. I now mention briefly other minor amendments. Provisions are added in clauses 4 and 7 of the bill to permit a charge where a transport aircraft lands and takes off from the same aerodrome without an intermediate stopping place. Airline operators frequently conduct sight-seeing flights over capital cities, and such flights will now be the subject of charges. The present act authorizes a refund of charges where this is considered "" just, having regard to the nature, locality or extent of the operation of the aircraft"". Typical cases for exemption in whole or in part would be aircraft operated for search and rescue operations, or other humanitarian purposes, or in remote areas where few, if any facilities are provided by the Commonwealth. Clauses9 and 10 of the bill will authorize remission in advance as well as reimbursement of charges actually paid, and will thus provide a more convenient procedure for reducing or waiving charges where the circumstances are appropriate. Finally, in the case of charter, aerial work and private operators who usually pay charges in advance on an annual basis, clause 11 ensures that the charge is not increased until the expiry of the current period for which a charge has already been paid. I commend the bill to the consideration of honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr. Evatt) adjourned. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 20th May (vide page 1576, vol. H. of R. 15), on motion That the bill be now read a second time. seems to me to be appropriate that the Government brings this bill forward, after so much delay and interruption, immediately after the House has dealt with measures designed to establish an economic dictatorship under which control of the country will be given over to the private bankers. By this bill, the Government proposes to establish a security service equivalent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the United States of America, in order to establish a police state and enable the Government to have at hand an instrument with which to crush the people in the event of anybody trying to arouse indignation against it, or to protest against its actions. Let us consider what the Government proposes to do. The second-reading speech of the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), would lead one to imagine that this was a most innocuous measure. According to him, all that it involved was the amalgamation of what is known as the Commonwealth Investigation Service and the Commonwealth Peace Officers, for the purpose",39,Civil Aviation Agreement
119,By Mr Cramer,,40,Commonwealth Police Bill 1957
120,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [8.26],"I tof eliminating overlapping of functions, and in the interests of efficiency. However, it is well known that both of these organizations are already amalgamated under the one department-the Attorney-General's Department-and that the director and the deputy director of the Commonwealth Investigation Service are also the supervising officer and the deputy supervising officer of the Peace Officers. What closer amalgamation of these two organizations than already exists could we have? It is obvious that this is only the first step in a scheme planned by the Government, and that the Administration hoped that it would pass unnoticed, and without criticism. The Minister said that proper training facilities, and opportunities to recruit suitgation similar to the American F.B.I. He able officers into these Commonwealth forces, were lacking. When considering any proposal to establish a Commonwealth police force, one must remember that there is already a State police force in every State always available for the enforcement of Commonwealth laws. Why does the Government want this additional overlapping service? As I have pointed out, the Minister stated that proper training facilities were lacking. But the various State governments have offered to the Commonwealth, for the training of Commonwealth officers, the use of the facilities used for the training of members of the State police forces, and, for the last two years, the Commonwealth has not availed itself of the opportunity to use the training facilities in New South Wales. Some of the best Commonwealth officers have been recruited from State services, and there has never been any difficulty in getting suitable State officers to transfer to the Commonwealth service. I should like the Minister to give us some illustration of the difficulty which he says has been encountered in that respect. One of the things to which I strongly object is that it is now some considerable time since this measure was introduced into this House. In the meantime, without once obtaining the approval of this Parliament, those who are concerned with building up this Commonwealth police force bave been anticipating the decision of the Parliament in regard to it, and have been proceeding with their organization. In Sydney they have already acquired land on North Head, in the Manly district, for the purpose of setting up their police training centre, or barracks, if that term is preferred. Further than that, they have been going through the State police services picking out the best officers and offering them higher salaries than they are now receiving from the States. So you can see that the men who are concerned with building up this empire have been very active during the period since this measure was first brought before this Parliament and before we have had an opportunity of discussing it. One other matter which is rather important is this: Who is to be the commissioner of this new police force? Apparently it is io be a Mr Whitrod. Now, Mr Whitrod has been very active in developing this idea of a Commonwealth bureau of investihas had himself selected as the commissioner to take over this service. Has Mr Whitrod proved himself to be such an efficient officer that he should be permitted to select himself automatically as the commissioner of the new Commonwealth police force? If we examine his experience and record we find this: He was a very junior officer in the South Australian police force. Then he joined the Commonwealth Investigation Service. I understand he was in charge of its activities in South Australia. Then he was relieved of his position in South Australia and transferred to Melbourne. While he was in Melbourne he applied for the position he now occupies. I am given to understand that Mr Whitrod's application for his present post was received four months after the applications had closed. So how did he become eligible for the position? How did he obtain the appointment which he at present has? And what has been the experience of the Commonwealth in regard to this man who is selected to be the commissioner of the new Commonwealth police force? Honourable members will well recollect the occasion when the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) announced in this Parliament that he had discovered a nest of traitors in his own department, and how we pressed him time and time again for some definite information as to what action had been taken regarding the matter. There was an investigation into an alleged leakage of information from the Department of External Affairs which had actuated the Minister in making a statement in this Parliament regarding a nest of spies. I invite the Minister now to produce in this Parliament, and make available, the report of the special officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Servicevery experienced officers-wh o made the investigation on what the investigation disin. the measure-that is, as a mere amalclosed. As the report will indicate, if it is gam of the Commonwealth Investigation produced in this Parliament, the alleged leakage of information to a Communist newspaper in New South Wales was not a leakage at all. It was something deliberately designed to make it appear that the Communist party was receiving information from the Department of External Affairs which could come only from people who were spying on behalf of the Communists and a foreign power. What did the investigation disclose? It disclosed that a Miss Maria Masson, who was then the secretary of this same Mr engaged in examining applications for imWhitrod, had actually handed the information out to the representative of this newsthis great and ever-expanding organization. paper. So the Government panicked. Mr Whitrod must have known something about this particular matter. If he did not know which can be noted in the bill before us. anything of it, then he is not fitted to be The officers of the Commonwealth Police the head of either the proposed new ComForce are not to be covered by the Public monwealth Police Force or the CommonService Act. They are to be appointed by wealth Investigation Service. What does the Government propose to Honourable members should not be foolish do with this new Commonwealth Police enough to believe that this idea of the Force? Does it intend to have a force like Attorney-General conferring with the the American F.B.I, by means of which it Public Service Board will give any security can continue and I use the word to the people of this country in regard to "" continue "" deliberately-to tap telephone the selection of officers of the Commonservices in this country, including the telewealth Police Force, because who would phone services used by members of this imagine that the Public Service Board Parliament? I ask that, because there were would ever dare to oppose an opinion instances raised in this Parliament regardexpressed by the Attorney-General? That ing that very thing. I remember one that provision is put in only with the idea of was raised by the honourable member for making it appear that there will be some Kingston( Mr Galvin), who proved beyond protection in regard to the selection of all doubt that telephones in this country officers for this service. Whoever hapwere being tapped, and that telephone calls pened to be the Attorney-General of the by members of this Parliament to their conday could select any type of individual in stituents from this building were being Commonwealth Police Force. We have tapped and recorded. Surely we must look already had experience of what the Auswith great horror on the possibility of this tralian Security Intelligence Organization type of thing becoming a common practice can do in respect of engaging special agents in Australia. It is not as if the telephones for special work. It has engaged as agents were being tapped for the purpose of prein the security service of this country variventing espionage or the leakage of ous kinds of people. It has tried to enlist information to a potential enemy. The the services of university lecturers to spy telephones were being tapped in this counon students attending universities and to try for political purposes in an attempt to report on them. We have had illustrations get some evidence against members of this Parliament and members of the Labour party. Does the Government propose to leave this organization in the form provided for Service and the Peace Officer Guard? Of course it does not intend to do that! This is only the commencement of the building up of this empire which Mr Whitrod is so anxious to head. As time goes on Commonwealth security will become part of the organization's functions. We will find that the officers who to-day are engaged in dealing with breaches of the custom law, those who are engaged in investigating breaches of pensions legislation, those who are engaged on investigating theft in the Postmaster-General's Department, and those migration will be eventually absorbed into There are a few rather interesting things the Attorney-General after he has conferred with the Public Service Board. the community to be a member of the of its engaging the services of a certain type of unscrupulous medical man to give information regarding patients. Are they to be the type of people wbo will be Tecruited into the Commonwealth Police Porce? Strangely enough, the terms and conditions of employment of officers of the new service will not be within the power of the Parliament to vary, because, according to a provision in the legislation, determinations made by the Attorney-General are not to be regarded as statutory rules in accordance with the Rules Publication Act. What does that mean? It means, in effect, that the Government, in making a determination regarding this service, does not even have to publish it, does not even have to send it to the Government Printer, and that the determination does not even become an ordinary regulation, as we understand it in this Parliament, to be tabled here and in the other House and be subject to the veto of the Parliament should -honourable members or senators decide to reject it. This is to be a special police force operating under very special -conditions. I was rather interested to note that the Attorney-General can appoint special Commonwealth police officers. He does not even have to confer with the Public Service Board. There is no limit as to the number he may appoint. He can appoint as many as he likes, and I can imagine that an unscrupulous anti-Labour government would not hesitate to use this power to appoint special Commonwealth police officers if it wanted them as strike-breakers in the event -of being unable to obtain the co-operation Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) asked of State Labour governments in the use of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) a quesState police. Would not that be a use to tion regarding the report which had been which the special Commonwealth police made in the United Kingdom on telephone could be put? I think honourable members would be well always in the past indignantly denied that advised to examine this measure very there was any such thing as telephone tapthoroughly because it is not just the simple ping in this country, and who had even measure that the Minister has indicated. I expressed the view that it would never be believe that the Government has a sinister considered by the Parliament, is a little purpose in introducing this legislation. Why more receptive to the idea now. He did do we need a Commonwealth Police Force? not reject the suggestion outright. He said Has any Minister or Government supporter that he would examine the report and see to told the House of any difficulty that has been what extent that kind of thing might be experienced with respect to the enforceintroduced into Australia. It is for the ment of Commonwealth law under the Americans to decide whether they need present arrangement? What are these police to be? Are they to be uniformed police? The House has not been told. Are they to patrol the cities and the country looking for those who are committing breaches of Commonwealth law? If they are not to be engaged upon that work-if that is still to be reserved to the State police-wha t will be the functions of the Commonwealth police? Why are they required? Why has Mr Whitrod, who has not had a great deal of experience, been selected as commissioner of this force? Mr Whitrod is well kown in Australia as being bitterly opposed to the policy of the Labour party. An organization such as this should be kept apart from party politics. Why has this man, who has already displayed his vindictiveness towards Labour, been selected as commissioner? The Government's purpose is clear. This is to be a political police force. It is to be a force that will send its agents into the trade unions, into the various religious orders, and into the universities for the purpose of building up dossiers and damning the reputations of people in this country. The' Opposition will fight this measure. We have all seen what has happened to prospective immigrants to this country who, having been reported upon by the security service in respect of their political activities, which might be regarded as being a little to the left or supporting democratic political organizations overseas, have been refused a permit to enter Australia. No reason is ever given for their rejection. That is typical of how the Government aims to use this police force. Recently, the honourable member for tapping. The Prime Minister, who had their Federal Bureau of Investigation, and it is for us in Australia to decide whether we need a Commonwealth police force. Has any evidence been produced that we do need it? To my knowledge, no complaint has ever been made with regard to the enforcement of Commonwealth law by State police, unless we go back to the famous incident of the Warwick egg, when, at a political meeting, somebody threw an egg and hit the late right honourable member for North Sydney, Mr William Morris Hughes. That was the only occasion that I can recollect when any difficulty was occasioned to the Commonwealth with respect to the enforcement of Commonwealth law. There can be no justification for this measure. The Government has established a special committee. Why? To inquire into the various public service structures in intrusion into, what we regard as basic this country with a view to eliminating overfreedoms of the Australian community. If lapping, to obtain efficiency, and to do away honourable members examine the measure with empire building, which has"" been adding thousands of pounds to the public payroll. Nobody objects to these people being employed in the Public Service if they can be adequately and efficiently employed. But the Labour party does object to this form of empire building. The Government has set up a special committee of the kind I have mentioned with the intention, in my opinion, of doing nothing at all, but merely rinding some excuse to present to the people in order to make them believe that it has had a thorough investigation of the Public Service structure with a view to eliminating waste. Now we are to have a new organization. I have no doubt that as' this organizathey are fighting for a principle. The tion expands and develops we shall have a new department. We shall have a new departmental head. Under the present set-up in Australia, this new police force is not needed. The States have efficient police services. The States are able to discharge the functions that this new body will, it is said, carry out on behalf of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will not proceed with this legislation, but if it does the general public will want to know the reason for building up this new empire under the control of Mr Whitrod. I have pointed out to the House the enormous powers that are given to the Attorney-General and that will be exercised by the commissioner of this police force if this measure becomes law. I hope that in the committee stages the various clauses will be thoroughly examined. As the member of the Labour party leading the debate in opposition to this measure, I say that the measure should not be imposed on the Australian democracy. The Labour party rejects it, and indicates that when it takes office-and I hope it will not be very long before it does so-thi s organization will receive our immediate and earnest attention, because we could not permit it to continue. Australians arefreedom-loving people. They are also law abiding people. The Labour party has no objection to whatever organization is necessary to see that law and order prevail in Australia, but we on this side of the House do object to any interference with, any they will be aware of the enormous powers to be possessed by the new Commonwealth police officers. They will not be limited in their activities by any restriction imposed by State law, because the legislation specifically provides that they do not have to wait on any approval from any State authority before carrying out their functions on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. The Parliament and the people will not realize what a danger this force is until they begin to have some experience of it. Just imagine what will happen in the future to workers who are striking or withholding their labour from some undertaking because Attorney-General then will recruit the special police officers, without limit as to number, and without limit as to particular qualifications. Those matters are to be left entirely to the discretion of the Attorney General. He does not even have to consult with the Public Service Board. I hope that the Parliament will continue to direct attention to this very sinister organization that is being established by the Government. Although Labour may not have sufficient numbers to reject the bill in this chamber, I hope that the senators in another place, when it is returned to them in an amended form, will have the good sense to do with this bill what they intend to do with the Government's banking bills. -Up in the Gulf of Carpentaria the crocodile is usually accompanied by a small bird which lives by picking the creature's teeth. What it does also, is that when any danger, real or imagined, is approaching the crocodile, the bird from its vantage point gives warning so that the animal can go to cover under the surface of the water. It has always seemed to me that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) performs something of that kind of service for the Communist party because whenever anything is done which, in the honourable member's mind, would have the effect of threatening the security of the Communist party or revealing its machinations, he is up in his place in this House, at the centre table, raising a clamour, endeavouring to divert the attention of the House away from the Communist party and also to cover up for it. It seems to me that on this occasion he is off the beam in several respects. First, it is quite vain for him to hope to use his power over the senators in another place to have this bill rejected. The honourable member has evidently failed to notice that this bill has already passed the Senate. Of course, it may be necessary to send it back for amendment and, to that extent, he may be right, but the fact is that the bill has already such as the honourable member for Parkes passed the Senate. The second thing is that in spite of the honourable member's apprehension, this bill is not primarily directed again the Communist party. It does not relate to that part of the Commonwealth police or security force, whose operations are exposing the operations of the Communist party. But I agree with the honourable member that it is possible that in the performance of its duties, this force might at some time perhaps be able to find out something of what the Communist party is doing against the security of this country and to inform the authorities correctly in regard to it. That is one of the reasons why I have risen. I am hoping, at the committee stage, when clause 5 is under consideration, to move a small amendment which I hope the Government will accept. The amendment will require recruits to this new force, before they are accepted, to make a statutory declaration that they are not, and have not been, members of a Communist party. Perhaps it is unreasonable for a provision of this kind to be inserted in a bill which is directed to the establishment of a security force whose prime function will not be to deal with bodies such as the Communist party. [Quorum formed.] Before the quorum was formed, I was pointing out to the House that there are several honourable members, notably the honourable member for East Sydney and, of course, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), who are very quick in their endeavours to work here for the Communists or to cover up for them by raising irrelevant issues when any proposal is made which might operate against the Communist party. I was remarking also that I hope to move an amendment to this bill at the committee stage which would make it mandatory for each recruit to this force to make a declaration that he is not a member of a Communist party and had not been a member. Adermann) -Order! There is too much audible conversation around the chamber. proposal will give grave offence to people ( Mr Haylen) and the honourable members for Hindmarsh and East Sydney, who usually run the Communist line in this House. But it is an amendment which should commend itself to the Labour party because if we are to believe its story, that party has, directed to itself, been a victim of Communists who have been infiltrated through the Public Service on to the staff of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). 1 think that I should remind the House that in the dim, distant past-the old, unhappy past, it seems now-ther e was an organization called the Australia First Movement. A number of its members were arrested and the Labour party was not terribly tender about its evidence when they were dealt with. Subsequently, when a royal commission was appointed, I think largely owing to the efforts of the honourable do not think he should be associated with the misdeeds of his party, fully, in regard to this organization-som e reparation was made to some of the people concerned.",40,Commonwealth Police Bill 1957

124,Member For Melbourne ( Mr Calwell),"IHowever, the terms of reference of that commission were carefully drawn so that it was not made the function of the commissioner to inquire into the real purpose behind this movement's activities. There was very little doubt that the Australia First arrests were part of an organized Communist plot involving the use of the machinery of government by Communist agents working inside the Public Service. There is little doubt that there was connivance between the "" Tribune "", which was then, I think, the official organ of the Comthe Minister for External Affairs. The munist partyI am not quite certain whether it was being published legally at the time-and the Commonwealtii authority. There appeared in the columns of that organ prior disclosure of information which should have been known only to the Government. The objective of the crime was pretty clear. It was as follows:-U p to June, 1941, members of the Communist party had been co-operating in the HitlerStalin plans against our war effort. They were actively treasonable. In June, 1941, when Hitler turned unexpectedly against his ally Stalin, the Communist party had to switch over. In order to blanket its criminal and treasonable past, it required scape-goats Mr Clyde CameronI rise to order. Perhaps, Mr Deputy Speaker you might ask the honourable member to tell the House what the war between Hitler and Stalin has to do with this police bill. the honourable member's tenderness for the Communist party, but in this case, unfortunately for him, what I am saying is very relevant. My foreshadowed amendment is necessary because, in the past, Communist agents have infiltrated into organizations of mentation and assembly of data for the then this kind. WhatI am saying is right on the ball and relevant to the point that I am making. At that time it was necessary for the Communist party to get another scapegoat to cover up its own treason in the popular mind. An agent provocateur was sent to Western Australia. I will not weary the House with the details. He was a man who had had considerable connection with the Communist party. When one looks at the situation as a whole, there can be little doubt that a Communist setup was operating inside the department. It is necessary that that kind of thing should not be allowed to continue or to be repeated. If the Opposition is honest in its desire to keep Communists out of things, it will support the amendment that I hope to move in committee later this evening. AlthoughI started by citing something of the distant past, it is not my intention to leave all things in that distant past. The Royal Commission on Espionage showed quite conclusively, as a result of a full inquiry by judges, that Communist agents were operating on the staff of the present Leader of the Opposition, who was then right honourable gentleman has said that these things were done without his knowledge. Let us accept his word for it for the time being. If one accepts his word, surely he should be anxious to prevent any repetition of the misdemeanour that was perpetrated against him. He has said that he was an innocent victim. If he was innocent, he will be anxious not to be a victim again. Let me remind the House of one or two things. At page 159 of the report of the Royal Commission on Espionage, appear some findings in regard to a man called Maclean, who was a journalist. The Moscow entry wasMaclean-journalist , sympathetically disposed towards us, a very well-informed man. In' T's' opinion, he will give information. The report statedMaclean was formerly an officer of the Department of External Affairs. . . . We were informed that he was too ill to make a declaration or a written statement, and we therefore had to rely for much of the information concerning him on an oral statement which he made to two Commonwealth officers on 10th November 1954. The following are the particulars of his service in the Department as supplied by it. He was born in 1912. In May 1947 he was appointed a temporary First-Secretary to work on docuMinister. That would have been the present Leader of the Opposition, I think. The report continuedOn llth July 1947 he left for Japan with the Minister, as a member of his staff. On 28th August 1947 he took up duty in the Department in Canberra as press officer in the Political Intelligence and Information Centre. On llth February, 1952 he reported sick and was continuously on sick leave until 6th February, 1953 . . . Maclean is by training a journalist. Prior to the war he worked on various newspapers in Sydney. During the war he sought to enlist but was rejected for active service on account of a physical disability. Later he was employed in the Finance",45,Commonwealth Police Bill 1957

During this period he contracted the illness from which he is still suffering. said she took documents to Clayton on a number While in the Army he joined the Communist party and paid subscriptions for two or three months, but he said that he never attended any meetings and that he dropped out because he disapproved of the Party's pamphlets. After the war he returned to his newspaper work. He said that he was selected by a group of newspapers to accompany Dr. Evatt on his election campaign of 1946 and to report that campaign; that Dr. Evatt was pleased with his work and later suggested that he accept the appointment in the Department of External Affairs to which we have referred above. Here is a man who, on his own admission, had been a member of the Communist party and who was appointed by the Leader of the Opposition. I think that the Leader of the Opposition has stated that he did not know that this man was a Communist. Well and good. If that is so, the right honourable gentleman will be anxious to be protected from this kind of thing in future and he will, therefore, support the amendment that I shall move. On page 123 of the report of the Royal Commission on Espionage, we find information on a Miss Bernie, whose code name in the Moscow files was "" Sestra"", and who gave evidence before the commission. The report statedShe was employed by the Department of External Affairs from 20th November, 1944, to 12th April, 1946 as a stenographer in the Sydney office of the Minister, who at that time was Dr. Evatt. She was born in 1922. In 1941 she joined the Communist Party. At the direction of the Party she became a member of the Federated Clerks' Union of Australia and a committee member of the Clerks Union Youth Section. In this capacity she helped in the formation of the Eureka Youth League, of which she became the full-time paid administrative secretary. Her health broke down and she had to give up the Eureka Youth League work, but she still remained a member of the Communist Party. She said that in 1944 she answered an advertisement calling for applications for a clerical position in the office of a member of Parliament. In response to her application she was interviewed by Dalziel, one of Dr. Evatt's secretaries, to whom she did not disclose her Party affiliation, and she was appointed to a temporary position as a stenographer in the Sydney office of the Department of External Affairs. She informed the Communist Party head-quarters of her appointment and volunteered to report anything she came across which might be of interest to the Party. She was told to take any such information to Clayton. Thereafter, throughout her period in the Department she made copies of departmental documents which she thought might be interesting to the Communist Party and took them to Clayton and to Clayton only. For much of the period she had a room to herself which adjoined the Minister's room with a connecting door. She of occasions, She professed to be able to remember very little of their nature. Clayton did not tell her that the information would go to the Soviet. She regarded herself as giving it to the Communist Party, and did not concern herself with the use that might be made of it. Whatever was the nature of the information given, the entry showed that the M.V.D. regarded it as "" interesting"". If the then Minister was innocent, he was taken for a ride. He will be anxious, surely, to prevent that kind of thing from happening in future. It is no use saying that a person in a junior position such as that of secretary cannot be an effective spy or cannot be an effective agent of the Communist party. Even the documents which came across the Minister's desk and were on the other side of that connecting door would have been of vital interest to the Soviet and Miss Bernie gave them to a Soviet agent. It may have been done without the knowledge of the then Minister. I do not for a moment say that it was done with the Minister's knowledge, But, having been taken for a ride, does he not want to stop this kind of thing from being repeated? Is he not anxious to keep Soviet agents out of the federal Public Service? The amendment which I shall move does not in any way infringe the rights or liberties of anybody. It is not directed against a person who is not or has not been a member of the Communist party. The amendment merely proposes that a person joining the police force must make a statutory declaration to the effect that he is not and has not been a member of the Communist party. I know that this provision will not correct every evil, but it will correct some. If the two public servants I have mentioned from the report of the royal commission had had to sign statutory declarations, as required by my amendment, before being appointed to the Public Service, they would never have been appointed. The provision would have been of great value in those two cases, and they are by no means the only two cases that could be cited. The provision would have prevented the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), if he is as innocent as he says, from being taken for a ride by the Communists. Does he not want to prevent the same kind of thing happening in the future? It may be said, and truthfully said, that this is a small measure, and that it is, perhaps, inappropriate to introduce into it a principle which does not hold good throughout the Commonwealth Public Service. I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this principle will be adopted throughout the remainder of the Commonwealth Public Service, which is a field in which we have complete constitutional power. The proposal imposes no hardship on any person except a Communist party member. It does not touch even "" fellow-travellers "" if they have not been members of the Communist party. The only person that it touches are members of the Communist party or those who have been members of that party. I believe we have a duty to protect the community against those persons. We have to start somewhere, and I hope that this principle will be imported into the bill, and that later it will be applied behind him. We have heard the honourable more generally throughout the Public Service. I am not suggesting an inquisition. I am not suggesting something that will operate harshly against any person except those who have been members of the Communist party. The requirements of security inside the Public Service cannot be met simply by employing people of this kind in what are called insensitive posts. I do not believe that there are such insensitive posts in the Service, because even a stenographer who has access to documents may be able to copy those documents. Even a cleaner may be able to obtain material from the Minister's waste-paper basket which could be of interest to Communist agents-and those agents still exist in Australia. I hope that the Government will not only accept this amendment, but also that it will apply the principle, as opportunity occurs, more widely throughout the Commonwealth Public Service. I hope, with, I must admit, only a very little amount of confidence, that my friends of the Opposition who have been taken for a ride by the Communists-innocently , they say-wil l themselves support this most salutary and necessary principle. [9.13] -The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has indulged, as usual, in 0 tirade of abuse of the Opposition party ""ccusing all and sundry of being Communist agents. This is the role that he usually plays in this Parliament. As a result, he has now become such a laughingstock, not only to honourable members on this side of the House, but also to those on the other side, that no one really takes him seriously. It is a pity that the staff of "" Hansard"" and of the Government Printer are compelled by law to record the stupid utterances that he makes in this Parliament. If the honourable gentleman could have seen the cynical expressions on the faces of members sitting behind him, he would not have continued with the remarks that he made to-night. ting behind him. He is in the back rowThose who sit on the same side of the House as he does are hoping that they will not be compelled, even in theory, to sit member brand as a Communist the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council, a former High Court judge, a former World President of the United Nations General Assembly, a former Acting Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, and a former Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia. How much more silly can an honourable member be than to hurl imputations of that kind across the chamber at such an honourable citizen as the right honourable member for Barton. The honourable member for Mackellar has described as a Communist stooge the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), a gentleman whom Ernest Thornton, speaking in the Sydney Domain, described as the greatest cheer-chaser ever born. Can anybody imagine that Ernest Thornton, who was then the leading Communist of Australia, would have described a fellow Communist as the greatest cheer-chaser ever born, if in fact the honourable member for East Sydney was what the honourable member for Mackellar has alleged him to be? The more I listen to this honourable gentleman and his protestations against the Communist party, the more I am reminded of the Shakespearean comment, "" Methinks the lady doth protest too much"". I am beginning to wonder whether the honourable member is not himself a very clever undercove '""'' Mrimunist agent. It is all very well r",46,Commonwealth Police Bill 1957

128,Mr Clyde Cameron,"That is right.for the honourable member to laugh, but it is well known that one of the great weaknesses of the Communist spy system in the past has been the candour with which Communist agents have displayed their sympathy for the Communist party. It could very well be that Khrushchev has given instructions, through the newly reformed Cominform, that Communist agents must, from now on, disguise their true feelings towards communism, in very much the manner as the honourable gentleman has attempted to-night to disguise his feelings towards the Communist party. I notice the embarrassed look on his face now that I am accusing him point-blank of being a possible Communist agent. If we study the -record of the honourable member before he came to this Parliament, and consider his behaviour on the south coast of New South Wales, we see a direct link with the Communist party of Australia. We need go no further than the occasion when this honourable gentleman, who has talked so much about communism to-night, awarded a cup, Known as the Illawarra Star Cup, after the newspaper that he was conducting on the South Coast. think that this has any relevance to the bill before us. Sir. I shall talk about the amendment which the honourable member has foreshadowed. The amendment is to the effect that no person who has ever been a member of the Communist party may be appointed as a member of the Commonwealth Police Force. How can it be proved that a person has been a member of the Communist party? The most dangerous Communists are not those who can be proved to be members of the Communist party. They are people such as the honourable member for Mackellar, who disguise their true sympathies for the Communist party behind a spate of anti-Communist propaganda, while secretly and silently doing the work of the Communist party from behind the scenes. Is it coincidental that the rate of the Russian advance in the field of power politics since the honourable member came to this Parliament has been out of all proportion to what it was prior to his election? Is this a significant fact? Or is it mere coincidence that since this gendeman has reached a position of power, influence and knowledge, the advance of Soviet Russia in the field of power politics has been beyond all its previous expectations, so that now-tb e honourable member is probably the only person in this Parliament who can secretly gloat over it-Russi a is in a position to challenge the whole world because it is leading in scientific development? This gentleman, who professes to be an anti-Communist, gave a £10 donation towards the alleged Communist-inspired strike on the "" Dalfram "", a vessel on which the alleged Communists refused to handle pig iron at Wollongong. Is it not a fact that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin) accused the honourable member for Mackellar of being a financial member of the Port Kembla branch of the Communist party? I can produce a copy of "" Hansard"" which includes the accusation made by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith some five or six years ago; but the honourable member for Mackellar sat silently in his seat and did not have the courage to rise and deny the accusation made against him that he was a financial member of the Communist party. the point of order the honourable member for Hindmarsh himself took some time ago, he is entirely out of order in every word he has uttered so far. He has not been in touch with the bill. The contents of this bill do not call for continual abuse of another honourable member, imputing improper motives. he took the point of order? the honourable member for East Sydney interjects again while I am giving a ruling I shall name him. I will not allow him to interject continually while I am speaking. to clause 10 of the bill, which statesThe Attorney-General may, at any time and on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit Honourable members should realize thaton terms and conditions that the Attorney General thinks fit.

134,Mr Clyde Cameron,"I turn nowand-and this is important-thos e regulations may be in any form that the Attorney General thinks fit. That is the charter which the act gives to the person issuing the the honourable member for Mackellar, this regulations; he can appoint any persons he wishes to appoint to the secret police force which is being established under this bill. The secret police so established will comprise people who are, or can be, secretly appointed by the Attorney-General in accordance with clause 10. If the bill is further amended as proposed by the honourable member for Mackellar, the only other necessary requirement is that the appointee is not or never has been a member of the Communist party. The honourable member should inform the House how it is humanly possible to implement the amendment which he has foreshadowed, because we can have the case of a person who says, "" I am not a member of the Communist party "". That does not prevent the honourable member saying, "" Yes, you are ""; because we recall that he has on previous occasions accused Dr. John Burton of being a member of the Communist party. Despite that accusation, Dr. Burton was appointed by Sir Percy Spender as Australia's diplomatic representative in Ceylon. very long. position; he was not dismissed. The Government should inform the House how anything can be proved against a person who says that he is not a member of the Communist party because, providing he has never been silly enough to take out a membership ticket in the Communist partyalthough he may be just as dangerous a Communist-the fact that he is a Communist cannot be proved. I remind the honourable member for Mackellar that he was not as smart as he thought he was when he chided the honourable member for East Sydney about this bill having already passed the Senate because, if he proceeds with the amendment he has foreshadowed, it still will be necesmotives that actuate his movements and the sary for this bill to go back to the Senate. I am pleased to know that the Senate has rejected already two of the bills that this Government sent forward to it in connection of telephones. This measure gives to fhe with banking. Returning to clause 10: If secret police force that is to be established the Attorney-General is given the power the right to tap the telephones of every which this bill seeks to place in his hands, fortified by the further abuse of power contained in the amendment foreshadowed by House will allow the kind of character assassination for which the honourable member has made himself famous in the past as, for example, when he accused Susannah Prichard of being the de facto wife of a Victoria Cross winner-whe n he talked of her as Susannah Prichard, alias Mrs. Hugo Throssell, V.C. On that occasion he had to come into the House and admit that his reflection upon the honour of not only the good lady but also of the Victoria Cross winner, was a fabrication and a complete tissue of lies. But that is the kind of thing the Government will perpetuate if the honourable member's amendment is passed. Under that amendment Laurie Short would be ineligible for appointment as a special policeman because he was a Communist at one time and disagreed, and fell out, with the Communist party, not because he disagreed with their theories of dialectic materialism or surplus value, but because he was a Trotskyite and disagreed with the Stalinists on the question of tactics. At that time the Communist party was following the Stalinist line of establishing communism in Russia before attempting to foist it on the rest of the world. But Laurie Short said, ""This is not fast enough for me. I am a Trotskyite and I believe in capturing capitalism and forcing communism on the world now that capitalism, after World WarI . , cannot defend itself against a revolutionary onslaught on a world-wide level"". That is the only reason why Laurie Short left the Communist party. The Stalinists who then controlled the Communist party were not moving fast enough for him. Under this proposal Laurie Short, the great friend of the honourable member for Mackellar, would be ineligible for appointment. The more I think of the friendship of the honourable member with people like Dr. Lloyd Ross and Laurie Short, both ex-Communists, the more suspicious I become of tbe true utterances he makes in this Parliament. I turn now to the question of the tapping",49,Commonwealth Police Bill 1957

136,Mr Clyde Cameron,"He left thecitizen in the community. I asked the Prime. Minister( Mr Menzies) the other night whether he was prepared to give to this Parliament and the community at large the same guarantees as were recommended in the special report of the Privy Councillors delivered recently to the House of Commons, namely that no private or public telephone should be tapped except true? cillors recommended there should not be any telephone tapping. able member has not yet read the report. The honourable member will find out his mistake later. able member should read the report and not simply have it put in front of him. At the back of the report he will find a recommendation that there should be no telephone tapping in future except on a warrant able member for Moreton will have the chance to speak later. mendation is that the warrant should indicate not only the name of the person whose telephone is to be tapped, but also the period of tapping; that the warrant should not be issued except in a case of a suspected ment, some of the most active foreign criminal offence or subversion; that the name of every person against whom a warrant for the tapping of a telephone is issued shall be supplied personally to the Prime Minister so that the Prime Minister shall, in the ultimate, be personally responber that the day could very well come, as sible for allowing the telephone of any individual in the community to be tapped or continue to be tapped. In reply to my question the Prime Minister said that he would examine the matter, but the important part of the reply was in these wordsIt may be that the time has come when the tapping of telephones ought to be placed on a last war, then the activities of the security statutory basis. That statement indicated that the tapping of telephones of which the Opposition has repeatedly accused the secret police, is already going on, and that the practice oi tapping private telephones is rampant in this country. What exaggerations! Ambassador-elect to the United States knows very well that what I say is perfectly true. He knows very well that what I say is perfectly true. He knows very well that this Government has been tapping telephones and by that means has been obtaining information against trade unions. He knows very well that the Government has engaged in that practice ever since it took office. Yet, every time a question has been asked in this Parliament, the Prime Minister has either refused to answer the question at all, or has said what I believe to be untrue, that tapping is not in fact going on. He tried to placate honourable members on one occasion by saying that he could give an assurance that the telephones of members of Parliament were not being tapped. I do not want members of Parliament to receive special privileges that are not extended to other members of the community. If a member of Parliament is suspected of having committed a criminal offence or an act of subversion, his telephone ought to be tapped, if tapping for this purpose is to be allowed at all-and I do not believe it ought to be allowed. If tapping is permitted, the telephone of a member of Parliament ought to be tapped as much as a telephone belonging to anybody else. As I said at the beginning of my speech, it is quite possible that, inside this Parliaagents in this country are sitting, pretending, and hoping to persuade the people, that they are anti-Communist, whilst all the time acting on behalf of the Communist party or some other organization. But, rememit did in 1940 and 1941, at the time of Stalingrad, when our allies will once again be the Communists, and our enemies the fascists. If that day does come, where will some members of this Parliament stand? If this country is ever engaged in a war against a fascist power, as it was during the organization would not be directed against the allies of this country, but against the fascists.",50,Commonwealth Police Bill 1957

It seems that the greatest qualifications that a person seeking a position in the security police or the secret police of this country can possess to-day are, first, that he is anti-Communist and, secondly, that he is a Fascist. The great majority of them are Fascists in mind and have no sympathy whatsoever with democratic processes. I want to refer to some actual cases of telephone tapping that have occurred. The honourable member for East Sydney and I have frequently had telephone conversations which, within minutes, have been conveyed to the security service. able member confirms what I have said. Mr Harold Holt -What evidence have you of that? pose to give the evidence because if I did I would have to break a confidence with a certain officer who is, fortunately, still employed by the security service. This officer is a friend, not of mine but of the honourable member for East Sydney, and he has told us repeatedly that conversations between the honourable member for East Sydney and me are conveyed to security head-quarters within minutes of the conversations having taken place. I can recall another occasion when I discussed with an inspector of the Division of Aircraft Production in Adelaide, who was employed at Chrysler (Australia) Limited, a certain dispute that was to come before the Parliament concerning the manufacture of Canberra jet bombers. Within twelve hours of the telephone conversation that I had with this gentleman, an officer of the secret police called on him and was able to interrogate him about the conversation. Yet this is supposed to be a free country! Members of the secret police attend union meetings and even join unions. We had a case recently of a member of the secret police who was able to worm his way into a union, occupy a prominent position in the its activities. He conveyed to the secret police information about everything that was said and done on an executive level in the union. of the Communist party. honourable friend tells me, at the same time he was a member of the local branch of the Communist party. A Labour member of the Parliament cannot hold a meeting in Botanic Park in Adelaide without having a member of the security police sitting in the audience and listening to every word he says.

I do not blame him for his mirth. I have the case also of a gentleman who wished to be naturalized. He had lived in this country for seventeen years and had a university degree, but he was refused naturalization although his father, his brothers and his sisters were naturalized. He was refused naturalization simply because the secret police had given a report to the Department of Immigration that he was a member of the West Norwood branch of the Communist party. It is to the eternal credit of the Leader of the House( Mr Harold Holt)I am sorry to have to admit this-that he was big enough to ignore the report of the security police. The man was allowed to be naturalized because it was proved beyond all doubt that the security police were not referring to the man who was not naturalized but to his naturalized brother who was the member of the Communist party.

Honourable members opposite may laugh, but this is not a laughing matter. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) usually has a good sense of humour and to-night is no exception. been ""red"". because he grew tomatoes. That shows the mentality of honourable members opposite. His Excellency says the man must have been red if he grew tomatoes, and that is about the level of their mentality. That is the basis upon which they decide whether a person is a Communist. The person to whom I have referred was told that, although he was naturalized, he could not bring his wife out from Bulgaria. Why? Because he had voted against the Government at the anti-Communist referendum! The department told me that it had to reject his application to bring his wife to Australia because he was known to have handed out how-to-vote cards opposing the referendum question on the Government's anti-Communist legislation. If the Government thinks it will defeat communism by adopting the methods of Communists, its success will be a Pyrrhic victory. The Government cannot defeat totalitarianism merely by adopting totalitarian methods. No wonder the people of Hungary revolted against the abuses of the secret police in Hungary! The revolution in Hungary is symbolic of what will happen in other countries which are subject to the kind of tyranny that inevitably follows the establishment of secret police forces such as the Government is now proposing to establish in this country. We must use every possible means to fight against the establishment of a secret police force in this country. I repeat what my honourable friend from East Sydney said: The Government may pass this bill, but the day will come when Labour will be the government and it will not hesitate to review every section of this legislation which cuts across fundamental British rights, freedoms and liberties. personal explanation. member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) made certain remarks about me which were grossly defamatory and utterly untrue. First, he said that I had described Mrs. Throssell as the de facto wife of the late Hugo Throssell. What happened was that, in drawing attention to the fact that in her Communist activities-sh e is a Communist agent and has been for very many years-sh e had used the names of both Throssel and Prichard, I described her, I think, as "" alias Mrs. Throssell "". She on this, but had to withdraw it and did not proceed, f insisted, as one of the terms of settlement, that I should reiterate and republish the affirmation that she was a Communist agent. There was not the slightest question about that. Secondly, the allegation that I was a member of the Port Kembla branch of the Communist party was completely false and stupid. But most stupid and foul of allI do not know whether it was more stupid or more foul-wa s the allegation that since I had been in this Parliament Russia had been prospering exceedingly, with the imputation that I had helped in that prosperity. This is so absurd that I consider it scarcely worth denying. It is completely absurd. But I do not think it is right that the honourable member for Hindmarsh, even in his wilder and more fantastic flights, should be entitled to say something like that in regard to myself or, indeed, in regard to any honourable member. House and the country wanted a really good argument in favour of this bill being passed, it was provided by the two speeches from the Opposition benches to which we have listened this evening. I refer to the speeches of the honourable members for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron). The honourable member for Hindmarsh, who preceded me, clowned his way through his remarks. It is a role, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the honourable gentleman plays to perfection. When the honourable member for East Sydney entered the debate, he revealed a new-found sensitivity for democracy and, with his characteristic charm, thundered that he was the great defender of democracy, the great lover of liberty.

160,Mr Killen (Moreton) [9.42],"If themember for East Sydney. His attack this evening on the security service of this country was characteristic. It was an attack that I have heard him make on a number of occasions. Only a few weeks ago, 1 drew attention to the fact that, since the revelation by Vladimir Petrov of the operation of a Soviet espionage system in this country, the honourable member for East Sydney had attacked the security system repeatedly and had sought to slander and defame the three judges who were members of the Royal Commission on Espionage in Australia. He has sought to destroy the bona fides of Petrov and of every one associated with the royal commission. On that occasion, I referred to the honourable member for East Sydney as a political vandal, and I so refer to him again this evening. He never has mentioned, and I venture to say he never will mention, the fact that Vladimir Petrov has identified more than 500 M.V.D. agents throughout the world. This man who sits over here, this political vandal do not think that the honourable member should use that term in referring to another honourable member, and I ask him to withdraw it. honourable member for East Sydney has no affection at all for sound security measures in this country. He is not interested in maintaining security in Australia. I hope that the people of the Commonwealth take heed of the speeches of the honourable members for East Sydney and Hindmarsh this evening, because they show, in the boldest of relief, that the various sections and fragments of the Australian Labour party, when and if returned to office, will destroy our security system. The honourable member for East Sydney asked, "" What is the Commonwealth police force to be?"" He answered his own question by saying, "" It is to be a political police force He went on to say, "" It is to be a strike-breaking force "". That is a strange charge to come from the honourable member, who sat behind the late Mr Chifley in this Parliament when Mr Chifley turned the troops on the coal-fields to break a strike! Then, of course, the honourable gentleindeed, foul charges made by the honourable man could not resist the temptation to deal gentleman this evening. As support for with telephone tapping and, in typical his arguments, the honourable member for fashion, he embellished his remarks on that subject. I wish to refer to the report of the three Privy Councillors who were members of a committee which was appointed in the United Kingdom to inquire into the interception of communications. I propose to make two brief references to it. In paragraph 168, the commissioners reportedWe recommend that the powers of interception should continue to be used subject to the conditions and safeguards we have set out in Part III. and in this summary of conclusions, but that there should be no extension beyond those we have so carefully defined. . . . Mr Gordon Walker has reservations on this recommendation-as set out below. Nowhere in the report is there a categorical asertion by the three Privy Councillors that there should be no telephone tapping. IfI did the honourable member for Hindmarsh an injustice when I questioned the truth of his statement, which I thought was going to be unqualified, that the three Privy Councillors had said, in effect, that there should be no telephone tapping in the United Kingdom, I apologize to him; but quite clear and implicit in this report is the recommendation that telephone tapping, as a means of protecting the country and maintaining national security, should be continued. What are the reservations by Mr P. C. Gordon Walker? These are the main ones that I findEven in the field of security the strictest possible limits should be set to the use of the power to intercept communications. It should in my view be allowed for two purposes only(1) direct counter-espionage and protection of high secrets of State; (2) the prevention of the employment of Fascists or Communists in connection with work, the nature of which is vital to the State. I put it to the House that even Mr Gordon Walker, who dissented from the broad recommendations of the committee, agreed in substance that telephone tapping, as a means of preserving and maintaining a nation's security, should be continued. The honourable member for Hindmarsh resorted to the old stratagem, that we have come to know so well from him, of smearing and attacking the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). The honourable member for Mackellar has taken most of the sting out of the fantastic and",53,Cameron Yes Subsequently Endeavoured To Found A Case

162,Mr Killen,"I withdraw it, Sir. TheHindmarsh fell back on the reputation of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt). He adverted to the fact that Thornton had attacked the honourable member for East Sydney, an argument that will convince no one. What does it mean? Then the honourable gentleman said that the honourable member for Mackellar reminded him of a Shakesperean excerpt. The honourable member for Hindmarsh also reminds me of a quotation. It is thisFate, fantastic fate, Once wedded fast to some dear humbug, Hugs it to the last. The honourable member is hugging to the last this smearing of the honourable member for Mackellar and is using it to bolster the declining force of his wretched arguments. Then the honourable member for Hindmarsh made the monstrous assertion that Soviet advances have been due to the honourable member for Mackellar. I shall tell the House why I believe Soviet advances have been so terrific over the last ten years. It is because there have been so many befuddled, dangerous-minded individuals comparable with the honourable member for Hindmarsh sitting in democratic parliaments. I suggest that it is about time some one referred to the bill. The honourable member for Mackellar dealt with it, but we certainly Childs, Jack Kling and others, we were schooled have heard very little about it from Opposiestablished Government. tion speakers. Its purpose is the establishment of a Commonwealth police force. The honourable member for East Sydney has inquired why it is necessary to have such a force. The purpose of the force is perfectly plain. It is for the protection of Commonwealth property. AmI to understand from the honourable member for East Sydney that Commonwealth property is not worth preserving? AmI to understand that, in time of crisis, telephone exchanges, aerorecalls the Communist party training dromes, and wharfs are not to be safeguarded and watched over? It is all very fine for the honourable gentleman to say, "" Those duties can be performed by State police forces "". That is not the position al all, Mr Deputy Speaker. A Commonwealth police force, dedicated to, and entrusted with, the responsibility of safeguarding Commonwealth property is an objective that commands my support to the utmost. What would be the value of Commonwealth property throughout Australia? R -[101 ] I believe that this question has some pertinency. The value of Commonwealth property would run into many thousands of millions of pounds. A m I to understand from the two Opposition members who have spoken in this debate that that property should be dismissed as being of no account, and that it should not be safeguarded? Sir, sabotage is the essence of Communist activity. I would have hoped that every one in this Parliament would have recognized and accepted that fact. In this connection, I want to refer, briefly, to an affidavit made by Oliver Kenneth Goff, now a Christian minister in the United States of America. This gentleman, by the way, was at one time a member of the Communist party in that country. Here is an extract from an affidavit made by him only a few months ago. It statesI, Oliver Kenneth Goff, was a member of the Communist Party and the Young Communist League, from May 2, 1936, to October 9, 1939. During this period of time, I operated under the alias of John Keats and the number 18-B2. My testimony before the Government is incorporated in Volume9 of the Un-American Activities Report for the year 1939. While a member of the Communist Party1 attended Communist underground training schools outside the city of New York; in the Bues Hall, and 113 East Wells-street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The East Wells-street school operated under the name of the Eugene Debs School. Here, under the tutoring of Eugene Dennis, M. Sparks, Morris in the art of revolutionary overthrow of the We were trained on how to dismantle and assemble mimeograph machines, to use for propaganda purposes during the revolution; how to work on guide wires and fuel lines of aeroplanes so that they would either burst into flames or crash to the ground because of lack of control; how to work on ties and rails to wreck trains; and also the art of poisoning water supplies. It may be said-quit e properly-that there is nothing particularly novel in the assertions made by the Reverend Goff, if one manual, if one throws one's mind back to the report of the Canadian royal commission that investigated the activities of Alan Nunn May, and if one pauses for a moment and thinks on the deeds and the massive betrayals of people such as Fuchs and Pontecorvo. Those names, I know, are ridiculed and held in very casual regard by some members of the Opposition, but they are names that are firmly embedded in history and they identify individuals who have been responsible for the most massive and most monstrous betrayals in the history of democratic countries. When one reflects on such things, and considers that this bill is designed to ensure the protection of Commonwealth property, and to provide for a force residuary to the Commonwealth security force to assist in the protection of Commonwealth property, it is obvious that this measure should command every one's support. 1 believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is high time that the people of this country discarded the idea that the Australian Communist party is an orthodox political party. I would hope that a few people who sit on the benches occupied by Her Majesty's Opposition in this Parliament would do so. member not wake up to himself? people-and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin) would recognize the fact that the Australian Communist party is an organized conspiratorial body, trained in military techniques, and dedicated to secure but one objective-the destruction of civilized authority, and its replacement by a materialistic dictatorship. I support this bill, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe that it is a very valuable piece of legislation, and that, far from being despised by the people of Australia, it will be warmly supported by them. Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory) [9.56] I contend that no necessity for the establishment of the police force envisaged in this bill has been shown. Certainly, none of the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Kilien) has demonstrated any need for the establishment of such a force. The honourable member said that it is necessary to have a force of this kind for the protection of the Commonwealth property. He may not find it extraordinary, as I do, that speaking about the existing police forces? this amalgamation of two existing organizations should take place 40 years after the formation of the first of those two organizaabout the existing police forces in the States tions to be established, and 32 years after and the Territories of the Commonwealth. the establishment of the second body, Those are the bodies that are properly although Commonwealth activity has been called on a colossal scale, compared with the pre"" police "". which has a long history, has a war scale, for almost eight years during the definite connotation in the minds of the present Government's term of office. I public, and I believe that it should not be ask the House: What has suddenly arisen applied to a force of the kind envisaged in after the present Government's eight years this bill. in office to justify the argument that this proposal is necessary because Commonwealth activities have greatly increased? Throughout the second-reading speech made by the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), in May last, there is a vagueness that gives no strength to any assertion that a force such as that now proposed is needed. There are assertions, but there is never any proof to go with them. One has only to quote the Minister's second-reading speech to illustrate that. He saidIn recent times, the demand for the services of the Commonwealth Investigation Service has been far greater than can be expeditiously met by the existing establishment, which is small, and which has no readily available source of competently trained people to draw upon. 1 suggest that there is a very strong moral to be taken from the phrase "" no readily I would hope that the available source of competently trained people to draw upon "". The Minister continuedMoreover, the extension of the field of Commonwealth activities since the establishment of the Commonwealth Investigation Service and the wide range of matters now falling to the officers of that service for investigation is making demands upon skill and ingenuity which can only be expected of properly trained officers of the highest ability. I point out, Mr Deputy Speaker, that each State and Territory has its own highly organized and well equipped police force, with a central criminal registry, and with international police contact through Interpol, in Melbourne. It is common knowledge that, throughout the nine police forces in the Commonwealth-thos e of the six States, and those of the Northern Territory, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, and the Australian Capital Territory-ther e is a shortage of trained officers. It is common knowledge that the shortage at present aggregates about 4,500 men. Dr. Evatt -I s the honourable member Mr J. R. FRASER I am speaking "" police forces"".

164,Mr Killen,"The existing functions of the Commonwealth Investigation Service and the Peace Officer force are not clearly known to the public. Those two bodies have no clear territory in which to undertake the duties normally discharged by the police as understood in domestic usage of the term "" police "". Under the Peace Officers Act of 1925, the Peace Officer force had all the powers and functions of police within all the States and Territories, and has had those powers since 1925. Colonel Jones, the first director of that force, is believed to have decreed that these powers were not to be used, as Commonwealth offences generally could be well dealt with by departmental officers concerned with customs and immigration, for example, the Postmaster General's Department, defence, agricultural matters, and the like, in conjunction with the police of a State or a Territory, as the case may be. The same policy was continued under Colonel Longfield Lloyd, who succeeded Colonel Jones, but, with the appointment of the present director, peace officers began to lay informations, make arrests, and perform other duties normally associated in the public mind with. State or Territory police. Cases were heard however in the State or territory courts. Some of these cases could be cited. Some are of quite recent occurrence in the territory itself. The need for the proposed police force then arises either from the fact that the State and the territory police are not able to discharge the duties imposed on them-and they have been discharging Commonwealth police functions for years -o r from the fact that the Commonwealth has, or anticipates having, some territory for which no recognized police establishment is available. As no information is available to support that possibility it might be well to consider just why the word "" police "" is used to classify these organizations which are to be united as a result of this measure. At present, and quite correctly, no crime reports, no reports of modus operandi, fingerprints or documented records are available to those two units except such as are, at times, perhaps improperly, shown or made available to them. I suggest that all those records of the State or territory police forces would be properly open to members of a Commonwealth police force. The lack of necessity for the establishment of this force, however, is amply illustrated in the words of J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States Department of Justice. I have here some of the law enforcement bulletins of that organization. In the editorial in the issue of February, 1952, Mr J. Edgar Hoover had this to sayThis nation has no place for a national police force. Such an instrument is typical of the centralism of the totalitarian State, where all authority, absolute authority, is vested in one all-powerful national government. It is quite well adapted to the needs of tyranny, but is not adapted to the needs of democracy. In the great area of self-government left to States, counties and cities, the enforcement of laws and ordinances is not only their own duty but also their own right, and it must be left to them so long as their legislation and enforcement fit within the fundamental guarantees provided by the Constitution. I suggest that what applies to the United States of America in that sense can apply to this country also. Mr Hoover went on to develop the theory, speaking, of course, of the American nation, in the following terms:Nor does this nation need a national police force. Modern methods of police training and communication can be utilized in every community. Scientific assistance from the FBI laboratory, finger-print arrest records from our Identification Division prepared from arrest records submitted by law enforcement agencies all over the nation, are freely available. I suggest that there is no need for the creation of the force proposed in the measure unless perhaps it is being created for the reason advanced by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), who referred to it as an act of empire-building. It is something which has been on the stocks for two or three years, as is known to the people of this community. The first threat of the amalgamation of these forces and the establishment of the Commonwealth police force was made long before this. I repeat that this force is to be given the name "" Police"", which has a very well defined meaning for the people of this country and of countries everywhere. But the officers of this force will not, or should not, have the duties normally associated with the police of the uniformed forces. In the February, 1956, issue of the "" FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin"", Mr J. Edgar Hoover said in a leading article which appeared over his signatureThere is absolutely no place in our democratic system for a national police force. He hammers that theme in editorial after the performance of police duties. No such editorial throughout the journals, which are safeguard is provided in this bill in relation addressed to all law enforcement officials. to appointments to be made to the ComFor instance, in the August, 1953, issue he monwealth Police Force. In fact, I suggest wroteProperly performed, niodern police work is a profession which requires the constant application bill who have been rejected on application of experience, skill and devotion to duty. When for appointment to State and territory police an officer with these qualifications is removed from forces, and there are even in them men his position simply to make room for a political favourite, the community loses a valuable part of who have been dismissed from those forces. its investment in peace and security. I suggest that the converse also applies. In the recruitment qualifications in any State the force that is to be created, appointments or territorial police force.

The creation of the force is unI suggest that a statement made by the necessary. No argument has been put forLeader of the Opposition in the Senate ward by the Government to support the (Senator McKenna) when he spoke on this claims that were made in the second-readmatter, is worth repeating. McKenna had this to sayWhen this force is removed from control of the Public Service Board and the act under which the board functions there will be the widest opportunity for nepotism and the widest opportunity for favouritism. Under the proposed legislation the Attorney-General may fill the new police force with people of his own choosing. No examination will be required. It will be a matter of his own individual judgment and choice. Senator McKenna went on to sayI am not suggesting that the Attorney-General of the day will do it, but quite obviously the power is there within the bill and a future Attorney-General may exercise the power in just that way. The bill seeks the widest possible Federal police authority and surely that is a dangerous thing to do. I suggest that the quotations I have made from the publication that I have here support that view. Senator McKenna went on to sayThe Parliament should be very concerned before it agrees to the establishment of this organization, Forbes, A. J. the members of which can be appointed by one man-becaus e it boils down to that. That is far too dangerous a proceeding for this country. I suggest once again that no need has been shown for the establishment of this force. I say it is wrong that the'Tfbrce, even if it were needed, and even if the need for the amalgamation of the existing Commonwealth forces could be demonstrated, should be given the title of "" Police "", because that term has a very well defined meaning in the minds of the public. The title "" Police"" has alwaysdenoted trained and experienced officers skilled in the arts of detection and that there are members of the two units which are to be amalgamated under this There are certainly men who could not meet Senator ing speech with which the measure was introduced.

Supply and Minister for Defence Production) [10.15] I know that the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr a Commonwealth Police Officer unlessWentworth) wishes to move. an amendment to the bill, but it is necessary for me to rise at this stage to mention one or two matters that were raised a moment ago and which are relevant to this bill. It is a simple bill to amalgamate two existing branches of the Government's service. The bill has nothing to do with espionage. It has nothing to do with telephone tapping. It has nothing to do with fascists or anything of that sort. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr After paragraph (c) of sub-clause (3.) add the Ward) to-night mentioned everything except ""the Brisbane line."", and it is a wonder that honourable members did not hear about that also. Out of this largely procedural bill has emerged a sinister story which just is not true and is not borne out by the terms of the bill. In the course of his observations the honourable member for East Sydney made an attack The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lawrence) -Order! The Minister may not comment on what was said in the second reading stage. at least advert to an office which is provided for in this bill, and if in doing so I chance to refer to something that was said in the course of debate, I submit that is perfectly in order.

G. W. A. for some years. I speak of Mr Whitrod, Edmonds, W. F. who was attacked in the House to-night without any right of reply. him at the second-reading stage? I refer to clause 5 which states, in part(3.) A person is not eligible to be appointed (a) he is a British subject; (b) except as prescribed, he has passed a medical examination as to his health and physical fitness in accordance with a standard approved by the Attorney General; and (c) he makes and subscribes, before a person authorized by the Attorney-General, an oath or affirmation in accordance with, the form in the Schedule to this Act. and movefollowing paragraph:"" (d) he makes a statutory declaration by which he declares either(i) that he is not, and never has been, a member of a communist party; or (ii) that, except as previously disclosed by him to the Attorney General in connection with his proposed appointment, he is not, and never has been, a member of a communist party."". This amendment is very necessary in my view. It is designed to ensure that undercover Communists do not enter the Commonwealth Police Force that is to be set up under this bill. Let me direct the committee's attention first to the fact that, under sub-paragraph (ii) of this amendment, machinery is provided whereby a man who, having been a Communist, has genuinely ceased to be a Communist can still enter the force. The committee will notice that there are requirements, every one of which will be satisfactory.

That gets over the objection that was raised earlier in this debate to the effect that people who had been Communists and had genuinely ceased to be such would be ineligible for appointment if this proposed amendment were carried. The machinery is available whereby a person who has been a member of a Communist party and has genuinely ceased to be such, can be appointed. Mr Clyde Cameron -What about a Communist who is not a member of a party? that point in a moment. The first point is that there will be no hardship on the person who has genuinely left a Communist party. The second point is that this amendment will definitely get some Communists. Under the bill as it stands, there is no reason why a Communist should not make the oath of allegiance. Although it may be morally wrong for him to make it, apparently it is not legally wrong for him to do so. But having done that, he would be entitled to go into the force. Under this amendment, however, if he makes a statutory declaration that he is not a Communist, and does so falsely, he will be guilty of perjury and by the normal process of trial before a jury he will be prosecuted for perjury. That might deter many people from making such a declaration. Thirdly, I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that this clause would not get every Communist. But it is carefully drawn so that no possibility of a false accusation exists under it. I know, and honourable members know, that many people who are not formally members of a Communist party are Communist inclined. We should like to be able to get all of those, but it is not practicable to do so. But because we do not get all of them is no reason why we should not get some of them. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that this proposal will not get all of them. But because it gets some of them it will reduce our problem. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh has a mechanism which will get the rest of the Communists, let him put it to the committee. If it is an effective mechanism, I will most definitely support him. I am reminded that during the referendum campaign on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill the Labour party, of which the honourable member is a member, said, "" We are not going to support this referendum because we know of other means of dealing with the Communist party. We will support amendments to the law, without extra constitutional power, which aim at getting members of the Community party."" Of course, the Labour party did not do that. Here is an occasion on which it can do so. I am wondering whether the Opposition will support this amendment or whether its members will admit that they were lying in the referendum propaganda which they put out. There is not very much more that I need say in this regard. Here is a proposal to which no conceivable reasonable objection can be made. It does not impede any innocent person in any way. It gives to persons who have belonged to a Communisi party and have genuinely left it all the opportunities that exist for them under the measure. It does not penalize one innocent man. Secondly, it does get some guilty men, if membership of the Communist party can be assessed as guilt as I assess it. In the third place, I agree that it does not get all the guilty people; but if the honourable member for Hindmarsh can suggest an effective mechanism for widening this proposal to get other members of the Communist party, and that is effective, I shall be most happy to support him. I wonder if I can ask the honourable member for his support of this amendment, because by supporting it he will only be doing the very thing which his party promised to do during .the referendum campaign and what it put forward as perhaps the dominant reason why the people should reject the proposal submitted to them at that referendum. The Labour party at that time said there was ample power under the Constitution and that it would use it. Here is a power which can be exercised under the existing Constitution. As this amendment is drawn, it is not open to abuse, and I ask the committee to support the amendment. Supply and Minister for Defence Production) [10.27] -The Government has",59,Pairs

172,. Mr Beale (Parramatta,"Minister forgiven careful consideration to the amendment. I realize that in propounding it, the honourable member for Mackellar is anxious, as he always has been, for the security and safety of this country. I , personally, pay tribute to him for his zeal in that respect. But the Government cannot accept the amendment. I believe there has been some misunderstanding of the position in relation to this proposed organization. I emphasize again that it will have nothing whatever to do with security or with the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, which is set up under an entirely different statute. The work which this proposed police force will do must not be confused in any way with that of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. The committee should have that fact impressed upon it. Therefore, the need for a declaration of this sort is by no means so obvious as it might be in a purely security organization. Yet, if one turns to the act dealing with the Australian Security Intelligence Organization one finds no provision in it for any such declaration. The Government has given a great deal of sympathetic consideration to the honourable member's proposal, but having regard to the fact that no similar requirement is included in any other Commonwealth act, not even in the act covering the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the Government considers that it would be wrong to impose such a condition, piecemeal, in respect of this proposed police force. But the Government does not rest upon that alone. In considering this matter it has sought the advice of the Public Service Board and of other government instrumentalities, including the Defence Department. The unanimous advice which the Government received was not in favour of insertwe are not divided on that issue, Sir. This ing this proposal. Therefore, while sympathetic to the aims of the honourable gentleman, I want to say on behalf of the tion by any parliament. But because of the Government that we cannot agree to import his proposal into the bill. To import it into be looked at with the greatest caution by this bill would raise the whole question of policy with respect to all public servants and Government departments and we do happened in the past, that there are elements not believe that this matter should be approached in that way. There is a case over the country. Those members use the for that sort of proposal and the Government is giving consideration to the matter. I believe that it will give due weight to by the Minister for Supply; but it is worth what the honourable member for MackeU/tr discussing because of the looseness of its has said. Some of his remarks carry considerable weight. But since we are dealing with a small and simple bill with circumscribed and limited purposes the view of the Government is that we should not impose this particular form of statutory declaration which could be very simply evaded, as we know, and could catch only a very few in the net, not including, perhaps, those we would want to get. But the Government, while reserving its right to reconsider the whole matter of policy generally, cannot accept the proposed amendment at this stage. Minister for Supply( Mr Beale), of course, had no alternative but to reject the proposed amendment because of the naked nature of the McCarthyism which it displays. Every government in the free world, except the Australian Government, has rejected this sort of thing. Therefore the Minister, while making great play on the generosity of the Government towards the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), nevertheless flopped him hard to the boards and said, in effect, ""This is what we got belted on when we lost the red referendum. This is what we tried to do in the Petrov Commission. This is what we tried to do in the Browne-Fitzpatrick case"". I assume, Mr Temporary Chairman, that we are taking the amendments as a whole. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN We are taking the bill as a whole but the only amendment before the Chair at this stage is that moved by the honourable member for Mackellar. whole bill and the amendment. For once legislation would require serious consideracomplete lack of the spirit of civil liberty displayed by the Government, the bill must the Opposition.

The Communist who would be gathered into the net would be the small "" c "" Communist and in that case he could be an ordinary leftist. It could be that an ordinary policeman on his beat, looking at Sputnik, could be guilty by association. The Opposition opposes this bill and the proposed amendment because we fear that there is something behind them which has not been revealed. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) drew attention to the appointment of the commissioner and his capabilities. He also mentioned the employment of additional police without reference to any one but the commissioner. What a dangerous thing that would be. It would not be dangerous in normal times but it would be dangerous now because of the habits and predilection of the present Government to do things which are against the code of civil liberty observed in Australia and in the whole of the free world. For that reason clauses which would normally be innocuous have to be looked at very closely. The provision for the immediate appointment of police, either of a temporary or permanent nature, would enable the establishment of a strike-breaking force. The honourable member for East Sydney pointed out how dangerous that could be. The basis of the whole opposition to the bill from this side of the chamber is that the Government, judging by its previous conduct, is not fit to bring in a measure of this sort. We cannot trust the Government, nor can the general public trust it to deal with these matters and have regard to the rights, privileges and civil liberties of the Australian people. In many cases, particularly the three paramount ones that I mentioned, the Government has breached these rights, privileges and liberties with great arrogance. So, when there is the slightest hint of McCarthyism in legislation-and it appears in this bill and appears violently in the proposed amendment of the honourable member for Mackellar-it must be rejected by this side of the chamber. The Petrov case was an instance of a breach of civil liberties. The Brown-Fitzpatrick case was the most horrible thing in my memory in this House. Members elected by constituencies sat as judges and jury and condemned men to prison. name of Heaven has the Brown-Fitzpatrick case to do with the Commonwealth Police Bill in committee? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member for Parkes is not in order in discussing that case. for Mackellar quoted from the report of the Royal Commission on Espionage and porary Chairman, the debate was much wider. However, I bow to your ruling, although it circumscribes the matter under discussion. I am very pleased indeed that the Government has been brought up short of the lengths to which the honourable member for Mackellar would go in fulfilling his insatiable phobia for "" com "" catching. I made a note of the loose phraseology which the honourable member used in his speech. He said, "" This does not get everybody, but it will get somebody"". Is not that the epitaph of the honourable member? He is after everybody if he can get them because of his fear that the world is rapidly being peopled by Communists. He has a complete fixation about it. So, he says, "" If we cannot get them all, let us get some of them "". We had the pitiful spectacle of the honourable member for Mackellar appealing to the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) to help him with the proposed amendment knowing, as he has been told by his Minister, that it was not even acceptable to his own side. When amendments of this sort are moved they are more than straws in the wind. They indicate how dangerous are some supporters of the Government in relation to this vexed and tremendously important problem of civil liberty. The Minister for Supply, trying to under-sell the idea, said, in effect, "" This is only a police bill. This is only to get some flat-foots into the service. This has nothing to do with civil liberties"". And it would not have anything to do with civil liberties except that the conduct of the Government has been so bad. The implications of any of its legislation that smacks of security or the protection of the community have been over-laden with a fear of the Communists and a desire to place an impost on the liberty of the Australian people which cannot be borne.

If the police force is not to be used as a strike-breaker-and some honourable members of the Government seem to ridicule the idea that they may be so usedI suggest the Government reconsiders its attitude to this particular measure because the special peace officers are not required to conform to any particular standard in regard to physique, health, educational background or standing in the community. The Attorney-General is to be completely free to appoint anybody whom he desires to the Commonwealth police force. Such appointees may remain in the force under whatever conditions are laid down by the Attorney-General and for as long as the Attorney-General may determine.

Haylen) has once again made himself one of the four or five regular mouthpieces for Communist policy on the Opposition benches. That is not to say that he is a member of the Communist party, but unfortunately he takes the Communist line. He started to talk about McCarthyism. What could possibly be wrong in the amendment? No person is to be called upon to make any declaration which is not fully within his own knowledge, and no person can be penalized unless it is proved before a jury in accordance with the normal course of justice that he has committed perjury. I take it that the Opposition would not openly support the proposition that perjurers should go scot-free; but that apparently is the line it is taking. I regret that the honourable member for Parkes has now, as so often in the past, identified himself with the line of policy that the Communist party would like to have peddled in this Parliament. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has failed to note the crucial point that under this proposal nobody can incur any penalty except after conviction in the normal course of the law before a jury. That is. the safeguard which all Australia enjoys and which I , for one, would not like to see broken down in any way.

It is important that sometbing be done about this matter. Not only the evidence that was established during the hearing of the Royal Commission on Espionage, part of which I read to honourable members earlier, but also other evidence shows that in Australia and other places Communist agents are infiltrating into key positions, sensitive positions or positions which may not look to be sensitive but which give them the opportunity for subversion.

Clause6 is designed to confer upon Commonwealth police officers, in relation to the laws of the Commonwealth, all the powers and duties of State police officers either at common law or by the statute law of the States. The formula used in the original bill follows in substance the provision which has existed in the Peace Officers Act since 1925. Since the bill was drafted, doubts have been expressed by a New South Wales magistrate as to whether, by reason of the particular wording of certain State laws, the present formula really achieves the desired result. I am advised that the present formula should be held to be adequate, but I see no advantage, a question having been raised, in allowing such a provision to be open to any doubt. The new clause, which has been circulated, has therefore been drafted to cover the point. Opposition) [11.1] -When the Minister",65,Pairs

Order! The Minister will resume his seat, if he is simply answering, by way of interjection, a comment that has been made. contains many powers. The Minister has said that the existing powers are sufficient. Therefore, the powers created in the new clause may be quite unnecessary. I shall refer to one of the powers. Sub-clause (4.) readsA Commonwealth Police Officer is not required under, or by reason of, a law of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth(a) to obtain or have a licence or permission establishment of a Commonwealth police for doing an act or thing in the performance of his duties or the exerwork will be duplicated and much overlapcise of his powers as a Commonwealth Police Officer; or . It is almost impossible to place limits on such a power. If a police officer thought that, in the performance of his duties he should break into a dwelling, this subclause would almost give him licence to do so. I do not mean so much to argue the clause, but I wish to point out to the committee a matter which was mentioned by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser). This measure is most important. It provides for the establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force and gives to the Attorney General power to appoint members of the police force. That has never been done before, as far as I know, and it is completely wrong. Officers entitled to act in this capacity should be members of the Public Service and should be appointed according to law, not according to the discretion of the Minister. This organization could easily embrace a system that is completely in derogation of liberty. As the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory said, the Commonwealth Investigation Service was never intended to be a police force. Officers, such as Colonel Jones and Colonel Lloyd, were men of long military experience and had a great reputation. Every one knew that they were not political. The chief characteristic of their officers was that they were civilians. It is perfectly true that the officers had military experience, but they had the characteristics of the ordinary civil police force. We have such a force in Canberra and that force has had many distinguished officers. Similar police forces are established in other territories and in the States. It seems unnecessary to set up a new Commonwealth Police Force when the Commonwealth, under the Constitution, can deal only with certain matters. It cannot deal with the whole area of criminal law. That is a matter for the States. The Commonwealth has a limited jurisdiction. What is being done in this bill-and make no mistake about it-is to set up an organization that may have very bad effects in the community. We have the State police forces, the Commonwealth Peace Officers and other officers in the territories. The force means, I submit, that much of the ping will be caused. This will be a body . . . . . . not affected by the ordinary standards of, and not subject to the ordinary checks exercised by, the Public Service Board. Why is the change being made? Why should these appointments be made? Under clause 5, the Attorney-General may make appointments. The amendment now before the committee, of course, deals with, powers after the appointments are made. This legislation raises many difficulties and the criticisms that have been made about the exercise of the powers, broadly speaking, are correct. Powers should not be given unless we are quite certain that there should be powers. The tendency in this country should be towards complete civilian control of peace or police forces. The Attorney-General and the Premier of New South Wales do not appoint members to the police force. Those appointments are made in a proper way under an act of Parliament. Under this legislation, the Attorney-General, who is a political officer, makes the appointments. Although the Minister may be right in his interpretation, all he is doing is to quote some officer who says, "" Well, on the whole, I think these are not unreasonable powers to grant"". I submit that before these powers are given we should know",66,Pairs

If he had read the original clause and then the proposed gentleman has not been listening to what I amendment, he would have seen that 99.9 have said.

I refer honourable members to officers of the Commonwealth Police Force the schedule, which readsoperating in States shall have powers similar to those exercised by State police officers.
