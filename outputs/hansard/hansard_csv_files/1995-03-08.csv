I think there is a very acquiring land or making a grant to acquire real danger in a complex subject such as this land. That was a very important reform. to do one of two things. The first is to take Why? Because there are parcels of land in the the anthropological position as it may have various states of Australia, particularly Westbeen in place, say, 200 years ago and to try ern Australia, which are held by Aboriginal to apply that in the modern age. I think that communities or Aboriginal families on which can be a fundamental error. Secondly, it can other Aboriginal communities may themselves be an error for an alien social system such as have claims under this legislation. the British system to be applied holus-bolus It would be a very sad day when the unity to Aboriginal traditional cultural values. of purpose which this legislation is meant to There is no denying the fact that Aboriginal be trying to establish would in fact divide Australians must be part of the mainstream of Aboriginal communities from each other and this n!:ltion. Their rights as Australian citizens, have them arguing over land in this manner. therefore, must be totally respected as are the So it is a very important issue, but again rights of all other citizens, irrespective of ignored by the government. from where they may come. The point I am It is perfectly obvious that the government making is that there are now in Australia has talked to some people,but it is equally significant numbers of Aboriginal people who obvious that it has not talked to enough. As are still living geographically within the a former shadow minister for Aboriginal confines of their traditional lands but whose affairs back in the 1980s, I will refer to some social and occupational lifestyles are in many of the issues which I think are important in respects far removed from the land tenure this overall problem. I want to quote from systems in place 200 years ago. Walking together: the first steps which is the I want to give an example which was report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconbrought to my attention at Bourke when I was ciliation to the federal parliament. It referred shadow minister. I studied the situation out to the issue of land because the council, quite there and, frankly, found it very distressing in rightly, saw this as one of the key issues in many respects. WhatI also found very disthe reconciliation process. The report stated: tressing was to meet a number of Aborigines For Aboriginal and Torres StraitIslanderpeopleswho had made every possible attempt to uplift whether they live in cities, towns or the bush-their themselves and their families to become part traditional and historical connection to land is of the mainstream of Australia while, at the central to their identity, community and sense of same time, being totally committed to their Aboriginal traditions and cultural values. In traditional to their own culture and moieties, a sense, they were a bridge between the yet they have been effectively excluded by the conventional Aboriginal community and the weaknesses in the current land council system. modern Australian. Another thing which has concerned me for The interesting thing is that they wanted some time in relation to this legislation is that land but could not have it. Why couldn't they the government has tended to present this land have it? It was because they did not have the fund legislation in the context of the billion political power in the local Aboriginal land dollars to purchase land for Aboriginal comcouncil which was dominated by a number of munities which otherwise have been excluded families of which they were not members. from the benefits of the Mabo legislation. legislation which makes the point: Unfortunately, in its effort to be all things to all men and all women, the government in The purpose of this Bill is to establish a Land Fund this legislation has once again failed to adand an Indigenous Land Corporation to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to dress this critical social problem which goes acquire and manage land in a way that will provide to the very heart of some of the amendments them with social, cultural and economic benefits. which we put forward in the initial legislation. On that point, there is no distinction between We are simply saying that in the granting of the Liberal Party, the National Party and the land title it cannot be presumed that all the Labor Party.

But, as I pointed various Aboriginal communities that we wish to support are made up of individuals who out, how we achieve those three excellent objectives purely in the context of a corporate necessarily fit a given paradigm.

It being 8.00 p.m.,Wednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1883 Wednesday, 8 March 1995 Data-matching Program Report Debate resumed from 11 October 1994, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. speak on the report from the Department of Social Security entitled Data-matching Program. I particularly want to ensure that the social security aspects of the report do not pass without comment. Data matching has been an important issue over a long period. It is important not to lose sight of the assurances that were given by the government at the time data matching was developing. It was the view of the parliament that data matching, because of its intrusive nature, ought not to proceed without question. I was interested to read again an Australian Labor Party policy speech which was made in 1984. It was made after some changes had been made in the area of assets and income testing and the government wanted to reassure people about the likely impact of its new assets test. One ought not to forget these things and it is interesting to look back at some of the government's comments. The government gave commitments, firstly, that people would never see social security inspectors in their homes, and, secondly, that information gathered for the purposes of the assets test would not be used for any other revenue purpose. Interestingly enough, the third commitment was that the assets test will not be made more stringent by this government. In relation to the second of those assurances that the government gave, data matching is the basis upon which information is provided for the assets test. It also provides all the government's information for the purposes of testing eligibility and for saving revenue in relation to Social Security and to other government departments. Of course, information is provided under this legislation to other agencies for their purposes. The third issue which was adverted to was that the assets test would not be made more stringent. I do not know what the government is intending to do in the context of the forthcoming budget but it is interesting that one of the major issues relating to stringency was the extent to which unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments were treated as income for the purposes of the income test. If that did not mean that the tests were not given greater stringency, I do not know what was. Notwithstanding the assurances that were given, the government moved rigorously and enthusiastically into this area of data matching. It gave certain assurances as to what it thought would result from the implementation of data matching. It predicted that the data-matching program would result in something of the order of$300 million in savings. That was in 199293. Over time, the department downgraded its savings estimates. It did so in Senate estimates to a $70 million figure. At a later point, when the matter was the subject of a more detailed",134,Radiocommunications Receiver A Tax Component Based On The Value Of The Licence Tax Amendment Bill Spectrum Used
261,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,,135,Representatives Main Committee
262,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (10.00 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take the opportunity toMC 1884 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,8 March 1995 comprehensive review by the Auditor-General in the efficiency audit, Audit report No.7 199394, that was downgraded even further to a saving of $17.3 million in that period. It is also interesting to go back and look at what was being said. The parliament has been saying that data matching was intrusive; there needed to be very significant cost benefit to proceed with a program that was going to be intrusive and it was necessary to be able to demonstrate that. Of course, the demonstration was to be occasioned by detailed and comprehensive reports and the role of the Auditor-General was crucial in relation to that. A sunset clause was also placed in the legislation, a clause that the government keeps on wanting to take out and that the opposition in its usual cooperative way has extended to give the government an opportunity to come up with a proper justification for the data-matching program implementation and to demonstrate its effectiveness. So it is important in the context of looking at the paper that we have before us today to review what the Auditor-General had to say, particularly in relation to benefits. On page 11 of the report's summary-and I think it is easier to understand it in that context-the A uditorGeneral made this point: The original estimate supporting the introduction of the Data-Matching Program suggested full""year savings of $300m per annum. The estimate did not include savings arising through partial downward variations in fortnightly rates or recovery of overpayments. These original saving estimates were not achieved, and were revised downwards in October 1992, and again this year. And the report went on to make the point that I made earlier: The downward variations in payments, which were the basis of the original estimates, represent only $17m of the 1992-93 savings of $75m (as at the date of the audit). The AN A0 considers that the value of overpayments is likely to reduce in future years. As a consequence DSS has reduced the value of overpayment amounts since projected savings estimates. It talked about the 'deterrent effect' because the department argued that if you proceed with data matching, while the savings may not be so significant, it would have a deterrent effect, which would in fact save money. The Auditor-General had some comments to make about that: At the time of the audit, there had been no effective estimatesofthe deterrent effect of the DMP. Whilst recognising the difficulties in isolating and quantifying the deterrent effect due to the DMP (and TFN collection), the ANAO considers that a more considered evaluation of this effect is necessary both for assessing program savings and the costs/ benefits of the program. The report indicated that: The Department will be presenting available evidence in its October 1993 Progress Report. And it made some comments on program performance, some comparisons: Program performance is variable when examined across a spectrum of baselines. It is effective in its identification of overpayments, reflecting benefits which have been incorrectly paid for some time. The program is also effective in identifying incorrect family payments not detected by other DSS review methods. This reinforces the view that the program provides a valuable vehicle for review of client circumstances that would not otherwise be as readily detected. But it goes on: However, the data-matching program outcomes have fallen well short of DSS predictions. Current circumstances in the client population together with changes in DSS control and review activities may have contributed to the shortfall in achieving predicted outcomes for the program. These considerations, as well at the unquantified deterrent effect, make conclusions about the overall cost Wednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1885 effectiveness of the program difficult, and reinforce the need for a more comprehensive costlbenefit analysis. They also highlight the scope for more efficiency to be pursued in Data-matching work. I think it is important to recognise the nature of those comments because the department was being very severely criticised by the Auditor-General. It was not satisfied that there had been an effective cost-benefit analysis. Now we have the department's report on data matching, which attempts to deal with these matters, and· I simply want to make some comments on that. The first concerns the fraud control strategy. The department, on page 5, is saying that data matching is now not an important end in itself. It now puts the first point of emphasis on encouraging voluntary compliance. So we are moving away from the idea that one can justify the argument that there are effective savings resulting from data matching, because the evidence is that that has not been achieved, to the more esoteric view that one can justify it because we are getting additional compliance that we would not otherwise have got, because people are more afraid that they might be ascertained by the effectiveness of the data matching the department is undertaking. Then the report deals with detecting people who are receiving incorrect payments, as a secondary matter. Verifying the accuracy of incomes declared is shown as being of even lesser importance, and the final matter is the detection of fictitious or assumed identities. I think it is important to recognise that, because the department has produced some tables. In the appendices that I find particularly interesting-on page 81, at table 5-was the direct cost-benefit summary. What one sees there is that there is a persistent view that there is going to be a very high level of direct cost-benefit. Looking at the net benefit figure for 1993-94, the government's view was that it was going to be $63 million-still nowhere near the $300 million originally held out. What is interesting is the way in which that tails off. In 1994-95, the department thinks, it is going to drop to $38 million; in 1995-96, it will drop to $23 million. I do not know how these figures were achieved, but one must consider them somewhat random, because they are the same for 1996-97 and 1997-98-a mere $21,183,000 for each of those years. What one sees is an effort to develop a cost-benefit summary which includes savings associated with voluntary compliance, and that comes out in table 6. Of course, what one sees there in the projections is an estimate that voluntary compliance is yielding something in the order of $42 million worth of savings, and that it will go up next year, such that we will still get approximately the same total amount of savings even though the direct cost is falling. The voluntary savings will go up to $71 million and, in the following year, to $83 million. Again, in 1996-97 and 1997-98, it is going to go to a similar figure for each year: there, it is rounded off to $90 million. So the government seems to have set out the rather imaginative view that there can be direct cost-benefit analysis-including voluntary compliance, which is going to yield somewhere between $120 million and $130 million a year, ad infinitum-and has rounded off some of the future projections to achieve it. My problem is that I do not know how accurate those matters are. I read with great interest the way in which the department tried to deal with the criticism developed by the Auditor General. In chapter 4, there is an assessment of the program. It deals with the Australian National Audit Office efficiency audit. As one goes through each of the recommendations that the audit office made, one finds a series of fairly esoteric arguments in which the department MC 1886 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,8 March 1995 is taking issue with the audit office. Page 29 indicates that they are having 'discussions'. But, at the bottom of page 29, the report states that the department has: ... disagreed that recording individual project costs would help identify effective projects. What one finds is a series of conflicts-almost interdepartmental conflicts-between the specialists of the Department of Social Security and the Auditor-General. I am not able to resolve these matters. It is clear that the Department of Social Security is using this report for taking issue with the Auditor-General, but there are no further Auditor General's comments. I want to conclude my remarks in relation to this matter by noting that there was a report of the Auditor-General tabled yesterday and that report did not deal with this matter, but it did reveal poor performance in relation to others. (Time expired) a.m.)-I was not going to rise to speak on this report of the Department of Social Security on the data-matching program because I thought the honourable member for Berowra( Mr Ruddock), in speaking here in the Main Committee, was actually going to do so in praise of what has been achieved by the Department of Social Security. We have references back to 1984 and decisions that were made then.! must repeat for the record that the Department of Social Security's legislation is very much a people's legislation that cannot be set in concrete. It must continue to evolve and it must particularly take on board the concerns of the electorate at large regarding the disposing and expenditure of taxpayers' money. There are a number of points made by the honourable member for Berowra. I would not like to think that any person reading the Hansard and not reading the complete data-matching program report would in any way at all think that those remarks were critical in the report. For example, the honourable member referred in the closing part of his speech to the bottom of page 29. I would like to bring people's notice to the very beginning when the Australian National Audit Office report indicated that the program is a valuable compliance and control technique which addresses areas of risk and which other review activities do not cover as effectively. It is noted that the savings originally estimated may not have been achieved. We acknowledge that, but the Audit Office has confirmed that the department and the datamatching agency effectively-and I emphasise that, effectively-fulfil their obligations under the act and certainly under the privacy guidelines. I think that is a very important point to make because the department as a whole, since data-matching came into being with a change to the act of 1991, has very effectively brought about changes to the whole structure of how we monitor and perhaps control fraud within the department itself. The data-matching program itself is designed to correct incorrect payments of income support. Of course, that is done by the checking of the integrity of the information that people provide to us about their identity. They provide the information on identity but they also provide information as required on income. The program itself is also used to identify those in receipt of basic family payment who have declared income to the Australian Taxation Office and who may be eligible for extra assistance in the form of additional family payment. I might add that that cross-checking is only done with the concurrence of the person. In all but exceptional cases our Department of Social Security does contact those who are the subject of an apparent match, to verify information before they even contact a third party. I think that",135,Representatives Main Committee
263,Mrs Crosio (Prospect,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (10.15WednesdaY,8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1887 is important to note. It is also important to note that there have been occasions where those people who are perhaps entitled to family payments have not been receiving them, and we have been able to detect that as well. The honourable member for Berowra made mention of some of the tables in the report, and I think it is pertinent to look at those. In 1993-94 five data-matching cycles were conducted and 61,636 reviews of entitlement produced substantial direct savings of $79.8 million. I do not think that is small bickies. A lot of taxpayers' money has been saved because of the action we have taken. Furthermore, there is evidence that the level of voluntary compliance with the social security system has increased since the department began collecting tax file numbers and using them in the data-matching program. In one of our reports we have the estimate that on an ongoing basis an annual amount of about $120 million will be saved through people voluntarily surrendering their payments. In other words, they are aware of the action the Department of Social Security now takes. They are being given a backup of assurance that, if the information that is being provided is in any way incorrect, through data matching we have means at our disposal with which to pick that up. All in all, Mr Deputy Speaker, the report covers very succinctly those particular cases. Some people say, 'Why have we ever had a need of it? Are you saying that people either fraudulently or incorrectly are receiving these payments?' No system we have which actually administers taxpayer's dollars, whether it be the Department of Social Security's system or any other system, can always be 100 per cent perfect. We try continually in the department to monitor the programs that we have in place, but most particularly we try to be observant of changes both in technology and in the receipt of information which can be utilised to make sure that that protection to the taxpayer's dollar is there at all times. The honest people who receive the payment-the honest people who make up 99.9 per cent of the population who are receiving payments for the Department of Social Security-appreciate this. Time and time again we have had both individuals and bodies praise the Department of Social Security for the very sure way in which it has administered this particular data-matching program. Most particularly, there is praise for the very caring way in which the department's officers have gone about their role; and certainly, in the requiring of information and evidence, there is praise for the way it has been treated privately. Most particularly, there is praise for the savings that have been afforded, as this report indicates. I thank the honourable member for Berowra for his statement that he certainly appreciates sections of the report and what has been achieved by them; but I think that rather than being critical just of certain lines and taking certain paragraphs out of context, which he has a tendency to do, what is required is the taking on board of the whole report. We must not just summarise a line in the report. It is far more beneficial to the appreciation both of the reader and of any person who may be listening to this debate to take on board the whole report. It is very easy for all of us to take a line or a sentence and then misconstrue the meaning, whether it is the auditor's meaning or the department's meaning. In all fairness, the report itself, as tabled in the House, is a very fair report. Certainly, at no time have we ever said that we are 100 per cent perfect, but we are acknowledging the work that has been achieved. We have brought to light, as required, the achievements within the department on the processes of the matching as far as it affects Social Security. MC 1888 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 1995 We compare the clients' identity details with the records of a number of other Commonwealth and state bodies and private insurers. We do that mainly to identify income changes or even changes in circumstances which clients may not have declared. I am not saying that at all times they do it purposely; sometimes inadvertently a client may not put in all the particulars required. That is where the data-matching process comes into being. It is a very good backup for the Department of Social Security. Most particularly, it provides the department with the means to monitor at all times, and respond to those numerous questions that are always being asked by the population at large. Are we sure that our taxpayers' dollars are being spent wisely? We have very much a needs based payment system. Because of the safety net that the Department of Social Security has, there is a need to make sure that we are giving those payments to those who are in need and to those who require them. That is what this, as part of our program of implementation, is all about. I certainly appreciate the report being brought before the Main Committee, because it enables us to put forward those extra facts that may not be written into the report. Debate (on motion by Mr Vaile) adjourned. Performance Standards 1993-94 Report Debate resumed from 23 March 1994, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. to the matter that has just been concluded indirectly by saying that I hope that we may see a further Auditor-General's report on the matters that are at issue. I think that is particularly important if we are able to make sensible Gonclusions on the disparities that I raised. I turn particularly to the issue of the paper that we are now discussing, which is the Performance standards 1993-94 for the Department of Social Security. Since that document was tabled and discussion was adjourned I have seenthe proposals for 1994-95 performance standards, and in my comments I will draw attention to both documents. I want to make a number of comments on this because the issue of performance in the Department of Social Security is of the utmost importance. The timeliness with which people receive their payments is a matter for which one ought not only have targets-which these papers give us-but also actual performance. I am a touch surprised. There were some changes between 1993 and 1994, and one of the interesting changes was that we had for the disability support pension in 1993-94 a target to pay, within 56 days of the claim, only 60 per cent of the claims made. In the new document that has been raised to 70 per cent. Consider the importance of this particular payment: it is, in effect, the payment made to severely handicapped people. When you consider that we have something of the order of 400,000 people receiving the disability support pension, given this target, it would suggest that in 1993-94, if they had all been coming onto the pension at that time-and perhaps they were not, but if they all had been-somewhere in the order of 160,000 people would have had to wait longer than 56 days before receiving their first payment. That is an incredible degree of hardship that people who are, prima facie, in very difficult circumstances are going to have to face.",138,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (10.25 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps I may just advertWednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1889 Mrs Crosio-There is a lot more testing required. and I would imagine that that is probably the reason that it takes so long-because, no doubt, one has to get advice from medical officers, and the Commonwealth medical officers are involved-but it does reflect upon the performance, and that is what we are looking at. In relation to the child disability allowance, which is a similar matter, 56 days is the time thought reasonable for considering claims, so it is quite a long time-almost two months-and 80 per cent is the target. When one starts to measure these claims against performance-and one has to go to some other documents that are produced in the budget to look at performance issues-it is very interesting that, in relation to the child disability allowance, the report commenting on 1992-93 had this to say: The timeliness standard for the Child Disability Allowanee (CDA) is to pay claims within 56 days of lodgement. The target for meeting this standard is that 80 per cent of claims paid are paid inside the standard. Collection of data against this standard only commenced in September 1992. In the 1992-93 financial year performance result (since September 1992) for CDA is that 62 per cent of claims paid were paid inside standard So the government is saying that even though they had a target of 80 per cent, they were only able to achieve payment of 62 per cent of the claims within that time. The comments I want to make here relate not only to the importance of meeting standards but also to satisfying the relevant criteria. I am told that, in fact, in an effort to address performance, certain changes have occurred in relation to the way in which these matters are considered. It is interesting that, when one looks at the program performance statements of the department, one finds that the largest area of health that is considered for qualifying for the disability allowance is, in fact, asthma. Asthma can be a particularly serious disability. I have known very close family friends who have lost loved ones through asthma. It can be quite tragic, but the very nature of it means that it can also be very mild. Some of it comes and goes. When my daughter was swimming actively she was seen as an asthma sufferer and was given one of those little squeezer things. There is no doubt that for a point in time she was a mild sufferer of asthma, but, if we were recipients of social security payments, given the nature of the condition that she had, there is no way that the child disability allowance would have been payable. I am told, in order to get the performance up, what has been happening is that a lot of the determinations in relation to eligibility for this payment are being made by social workers. In other words, if people refer the claimant to the Commonwealth medical officer it reflects upon their performance. When people are worried about their performance, they do not send the person on for assessment-the social worker makes the claim. It is interesting that the claims for asthma, where the judgment can be so esoteric, have been rising rapidly, as can be seen in the performance statements which the government produces. In relation to performance standards, I am concerned that the government tells us in the paper that is tabled what the target is, but to find out what the performance is we have to hunt in other documents. Mrs Crosio-You only have to ask. Social Security. I would like to see it taken out in relation to each of these matters. I would",140,Representa Tives Main Committee

266,Mr Ruddock,"I welcome the offer of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister forMC 1890 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,8 March 1995 also like to know why we are seeing certain changes occurring. WhatI found particularly interesting in the 1993-94 program statement on page 2, under 'Review and Appeals', is that there was a national standard when matters were raised between authorised review officers. The statement says: The National Standard 14 days to finalise (where the client left without income) after request lodged at Regional Office-95% 14 days to finalise after request lodged at Regional Office (all types of review) ... . And there the objective is only to achieve it by 40 per cent. When I look at the 1994-95 performance standards, and I look at that particular table, I find that there has been a change. They now leave out altogether the area in which the target is low at 40 per cent. So people now cannot find out. There is no target for 14 days to finalise after request lodged at regional office for all types of reviews. There has been a continuation with the other national standards where people are left without adequate means of support, but, in relation to the 14 days to finalise, that information is no longer provided. LestI run out of time again, I will move quickly to the concern I have as to what happened over the Christmas period in relation to performance. One of the concerns I have is that these tables with targets suggest a very high level of performance by the Department of Social Security, but over the Christmas period I was really quite concerned when it became apparent that the Department of Social Security was telling people that it was too busy to be able to process claims. We had something of the order of 42,000 families that the department acknowledged had been affected. I have copies of the letters that were sent out by people in the department at that time. What they did was send out letters which told people that they were, in effect, unable to process their review forms. A letter about family payments that I have before me, dated 19 December, said: Dear ... I am writing to you about your Family Payment. We cannot pay you Additional Family Payment and Family Payment any more. This is because, although you have returned the review form we sent you, we have been unable to process it yet. We will process your review form as soon as possible and you will be paid any arrears owing to you. If you have not received your payment by 19 January 1995 or you want to know more about your Family Payment, please phone the number at the top of this letter after that date. This has been decided under section(s) 880 of the Social Security Act 1991. I find it absolutely abhorrent that, at a time like Christmas when people had additional commitments they would ordinarily be expected to meet, the department was unable to process information that it had sought and received, and that it simply took people off benefits. It said, 'If you are still entitled, we will put you back'-at some later date. But at the very time when hardship was most likely to have been endured, people were left without funds. Mrs Crosio-This is old news. It's three months ago. Parliamentary Secretary: this is the first opportunity, when we are looking at the department's performance, that members get to raise these matters. AndI also point out that there were no announcements by the Department of Social Security that made this news at the time when it occurred. The person who had to raise it was me, as the shadow minister!",141,Representatives Main Committee
267,Mr Ruddock,"The Parliamentary Secretary says it is old news. I say this to theWednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1891 The fact that 42,000 families had been taken off payments would not have been known except that, in response to my press release, the government had to come clean. That is the situation. It is. quite indefensible that it occurred, and it reflects very poorly upon the department, and on the government's administration of the department, that that could happen. You see, the department was out on a massive recruiting drive over the last few years. The department has record numbers of staff-something of the order of 21,000 people. We are at a time when the government tells us that unemployment is coming off. In that situation, it could have been expected that people who would otherwise have been paying unemployment benefits would have been freed of those tasks and the government could have prioritised this activity, which was crucial to people's income support over the Christmas period, if it was really concerned about the issue. Quite frankly, when the test came, the government was wanting. When the test was there, the government wanted to hide it; it did not want people to know. There were no press statements on it. I watch what the Minister for Social Security( Mr Baldwin) says. There were no statements by the minister on this matter. I asked the minister to come out and speak on it himself, at that time. And what did he do? He sent out the departmental officers to make the explanations. I regard it as a very poor standard of performance. We need to hear a lot more from the government, not only in terms of the standards that are set, but also in terms of the need. for them to publish comprehensive details about the way in which they measure up against these performance standards. That is the information that is not available; it is effectively hidden. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security( Mrs Crosio) says that I can come along and ask for it. To my way of thinking, it is not a matter that I should have to ask for; it is a matter on which the government ought to come clean and provide the information. If its. performance is up to standard, I would be the first to congratulate the government on it. But when its performance is as wanting as it has been in this area, it ought to expect and anticipate that these matters will be raised in the parliament at the first available opportunity. note of the Department of Social Security performance standards 1994 report and to follow on from the comments made by my colleague, the member for Berowra( Mr Ruddock). As a member of the Procedure Committee, I want to start by making the observation that the Minister for Social Security( Mr Baldwin) ought to be here for this particular debate. In saying that, I make no personal reflection on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security( Mrs Crosio), who is present and who I know is a hard worker. In the creation of the Main Committee as the second chamber of the Hou-e of Representatives, we on the opposition side were at great pains to point out that unless this chamber were treated seriously it would become a second-class debating forum in which whatever occurs is treated as second best, or of less significance than a debate occurring in the House itself. It behoves the minister to come into the Main Committee. Perhaps he would find it a little bit degrading to come here and listen to this debate and take note of the comments being made by members participating, because he would then learn of the immense difficulties being experienced by Australians all round the country in relation to social security entitlements and the departmental service. He would also learn of some of the comments and complaints of his own staff, who, in the case of the JoondaJup Department of Social Security office, are working under enormous strains.",142,Representatives Main Committee
268,Mr Filing (Moore) (10.40 A.m.),"I rise to contribute to the debate on this motion to takeMC 1892 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,8 March 1995 From time to time one listens to the minister in the chamber, when he is asked a dorothy dix question and makes some lengthy dissertation on the social progress being made, or talks of the social justice of this government. He would no doubt be mindful of the conference that is taking place in Copenhagen in relation to social justice.·But I imagine also that he would be very defensive if we were to point out, as we have done from time to time. I know the honourable member for Berowra has done so---that under this government we have seen an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor in our community, a community that, when I arrived here in 1971, was renowned for its fairness and equality. When I first arrived in this country there was little difference in real terms between the salaries, or the standard of living, of people who were in middle management or in responsible positions, and those people who had physical jobs or service jobs. Unfortunately we have seen, in particular since 1983, following the election of the federal Labor governments under Hawke and Keating, an ever-widening gap between the poor and the rich in Australia, to such an extent that there are now about 8million people in this nation who depend, either in full or in part, on some form of income from the Commonwealth government. In a modem, vibrant democracy, with all the resources that we have available to our community, that is obviously a national disgrace. The grinding edge of this particular problem is at the front counter of the DSS office. In my electorate-which has within it the fast growing region of the city of Wanneroo---l2,OOO new people arrive each year. This is an increase of approximately 10 per cent each year. As a consequence, there is an enormous strain on the services that are available within our region. We have within the electorate of Moore the highest concentration of children up to the age of five. We also have one of the highest concentrations of children between the ages of five and 15. Significantly-or ironically I suppos-we also have the greatest concentration of fourbedroom homes, but I do not think that has got as much to do with prosperity, as it has with the number of children being raised in the region. Consequently, in my electorate there is a great demand for services from the Commonwealth government and, in particular, from the Department of Social Security. At various times I have become aware of significant problems with the office at Joondalup. The problems are those referred to by the member for Berowra: the difficulty in the interpretation of rulings and particular criteria, and also the sheer increase in demand. I recently became aware that people were being referred to me by staff at the department's Joondalup office. Because their cases were difficult, they were being told, 'You really ought to go and see your local MP.' In my constituency office, we take a great deal of pride in providing a good service to our constituents but I might say that this is placing quite a bit of strain on my office. We are basically having to deal with the by-product of the enormous strain on the Department of Social Security's office at Joondalup. I would particularly like to commend the staff at the Joondalup office of the Department of Social Security. They are working under extraordinary pressure. AllI can do on their behalf is ask that the parliamentary secretary and, through her, the minister look immediately at the workload that is being undertaken by officers at the Joondalup office to see whether there is some way to alleviate this additional strain so that the office can provide a better standard of service to my constituents. I also raised the issue of the teleservice centre with the parliamentary secretary. In fairness to her-and I meant no personal reflection when I mentioned the minister-I must say that Wednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1893 she has been prompt in responding to my queries and I appreciate that on behalf of my constituents. I complained to her about the teleservice centre arrangements. This is another issue that, as she would know from her own constituents, causes almost insufferable frustration on the part of people who are trying to get though on the help line to get basic information. Because of the rapid changes in circumstances in the Department of Social Security, or because of changes in the various legislation within the department's jurisdiction, people require-as much as possible-instant service so that they can take full advantage of their entitlements, even when changes occur sometimes in circumstances that may well militate against the individual constituent. I also point out that, with respect to the office at Joondalup, I have had complaints from people who have recently had to wait up to 1Y2 hours to get attention there. I think that is something that I would like to see remedied as quickly as possible. Again, I make no reflection on the staff at the office. I know many of them personally and I have a great deal of respect for them. I know that they are operating in difficult circumstances and that they are endeavouring to do their best on behalf of my constituents. Nonetheless, I would like to see the situation improved as quickly as possible. I would like to touch on a matter that relates to performance. It is not quite in the area of direct service to clients, as they are euphemistically called; basically, they are recipients or applicants. I do not like the term 'clients'. Mrs Crosio-The correct title now is 'customer' and I don't like that either. called them citizens or people, rather than calling them by some euphemistic phrase which covers the fact that they are unfortunately placed in the situation where they need to have social security payments to help them get by. I now go to an issue that arose in 1991, which is long before the time of the parliamentary secretary's tenure as the parliamentary secretary. I want to address a matter that continues to represent a gross injustice for another group of people in my electorate. They have suffered as a consequence of joint exercises conducted by the department, the DSS, the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Federal Police. In 1991, some so-called 'visits' -they were actually raids-were made to some strawberry growers in my electorate. Only a small number were visited, or raided, but as a consequence of those visits or raids many of their workers fled. I do not want to go into great detail about why these people may have felt alarmed or intimidated by the presence of police officers and other officers in the early hours of the morning at the strawberry fields in my electorate. AllI can say is that many of those workers came from countries that have long suffered under Communist regimes. I believe they have a natural instinct to feel afraid or worried in the presence of authoritarian or authoritative officers. As a consequence of these raids, my constituents' strawberry picking period-the peak period which is in the latter part of the year, in the summer-was severely impeded by the then consequent lack of labour. In some instances, constituents lost up to $1.5 million-in particular, one particular constituent who is the largest strawberry grower in Western Australia. He suffered the most and he has ever since been trying to exact justice as a consequence of these losses.",143,Representatives Main Committee
269,Mr Filing,"So we are now calling them customers. I think we would be better off if weMC 1894 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 1995 Let me point out some of the things that this gentleman has had to do. I have spoken on a number of occasions here in relation to this matter. I have made representations to the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Gear) and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer ( Mr Elliott). I have spoken in previous debates on data-matching programs and I have made interminable representations. One particular thing I did was to take out freedom of information requests in relation to the Australian Taxation Office relating to meetings that had been held-I will show members where this is relevant-with officers of the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Social Security and the Australian Federal Police prior to these raids taking place. To my great consternation, when seeking these freedom of information documents, we could find no evidence of the notes of the meetings that had taken place with the officers of the three bodies. In particular, these notes would have related to or reflected upon the actual complaintsMrs Crosio--A long, long bow. particular case. WhatI am saying is this: in this particular instance, officers of the three bodies have failed to keep notes of meetings in which allegations against my constituents-r, for that matter, others-have allegedly been raised and discussed. That means that my constituent was unable to seek further information that would allow him to take legal action in order to get retribution for the enormous financial losses he has suffered. I implored the previous Minister for Social Security, the Hon. Neal Blewett, to look at this matter with a sympathetic view towards an ex gratia payment of compensation to those of my constituents who have suffered these losses. The reason I asked for this is, quite frankly, that they were entirely innocent parties. There has been no allegation of offences against them and no charges, nor has there been any suggestion of charges. Yet this situation was a consequence of this joint exercise. I might add that the Department of Social Security strangely dropped out of the exercise at the last moment. My constituent had actually complained to the Department of Social Security prior to the raids taking place. The DSS officers dropped out of the exercise and only A TO and AFP officers were present at the time. Nonetheless, it was a joint exercise and I can only urge the parliamentary secretary to ask for that matter to be looked at again. I am only too happy to provide the particulars so that she may do that. In conclusion, may I just urge, as I urged earlier, the parliamentary secretary-who I know is an efficient person-to make the necessary inquiries to ascertain what extra resources are required at Joondalup and to make sure the minister is aware of the grinding edge, as we said, of that new problem area we fmd with this unfortunate greater dependency of many Australians on social security payments. At the front counter where these performance standards are supposedly being measured people should have equal access to highly efficient service from the department's officers. In areas like Joondalup and Wanneroo where the growth is so phenomenal, those resources should be beefed up to the maximum to ensure that people do get equal access and fair access to the service. a.m.)-I was not originally going to reply but a number of points have been made both by the honourable member for Moore( Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Berowra( Mr Ruddock) so I feel it is necessary to reply.",145,Representatives Main Committee

271,Mrs Crosio (Prospect,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (10.54Wednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1895 I think I will start with what the honourable member for Moore has raised. I had to look again at the Main Committee's agenda. It is clearly marked as 'Department of Social Security-Performance standards 1993-94'. He did use a very broad brush to bring in the concerns he had in 1991. It would be on the record that in the department we were not even publishing our standards until 1992. It does take a lot of understanding to see how what the member was talking about related to the actual report before the Main Committee. A number of other points have been raised. Certainly, I will investigate them on his behalf. He has raised concerns, as a member rightfully should, over a particular office within his electorate. I do also take note of the teleservice centres. This is something that is continually being reviewed within the department. But I would put my comments on record as to why that review is constantly taking place in the teleservice centres. I agree with the honourable member about frustration arising when people cannot get on, and they get a busy signal. That is something that we are always bringing to notice. At the same time, the idea of having a teleservice centre was first agreed to in 1992, and .we then started erecting the centres around Australia. I believe that one of the things we must look at now, as we divide our areas up, is having a teleservice centre in everyone of those areas and having area managers take more note of what is happening, particularly in relation to the distribution of the labour force in the areas at the time of need. But, at the same time, we must acknowledge that there are something like 15 million calls expected to go through our teleservice centres this year. Teleservice centres started as an idea to relieve the pressure on our counter staff. They have evolved to such an extent that I now feel sure that if people are an hour late in getting their age pension payments they are ringing up our teleservice centres. We are certainly looking at our voice review units, to see whether there is some way we can get an extra message on. We have changed the lines, as honourable members are aware. We have given more direct lines to pensioners. We are also continually looking at the available technology and at the possibility that we have not got enough Telecom lines coming through in certain areas. We are continually monitoring the situation. We are aware of the concern of the constituents, because that is continually being raised in the department and by all members of the House. It is certainly something we are doing our best to overcome. We acknowledge that there is a problem there. But we also must acknowledge that if complaints come to our offices-there are something like 147 members of parliament-there are perhaps two or three of them, while there are up to 300,000 or 400,000 calls going through, at that one particular time, around Australia. So the number of complaints coming in is not large in comparison to the number of calls going through the centres. Nevertheless, they are a cause of concern and, if they are a cause of concern, they need investigation. We certainly need solutions to the problems that have been experienced. The other areas I would like to touch on include standards. I emphasise the fact that the standards were actually put into place for publication to make sure that they provided a broad approach to improving client services for our general staff. The honourable member for Berowra touched on a number of areas that were causing concern to him, such as the disability support pension. Sure, we had originally set a target, but I think I must go on to the new figures here. The original target we set for 1993-94 was something like 60 per cent of payments within 56 days of claim. We know that that 1993-94 year reached 78 per cent. MC 1896 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,8 March 1995 As the honourable member well knows, disability payments take a long time because they involve not only the checking of the relevant departments but also the requirement for proper health checks and ensuring that those health checks comply with what is required. Anyone can walk in with a doctor's certificate and say, 'My doctor says I have got a, band c. Therefore, I have got to go on a disability support pension.' It requires a lot more than that. It requires a very exacting decision making process, which needs to be put into place and continually updated. Certainly, it requires further medicals, and it requires medicals throughout particular time frames suitable for particular people going through the actual process. The honourable member for Berowra raised the subject of asthma. I would like to see the records showing where social workers are approving disability support pension for asthmatic patients. I find that quite extraordinary. the minister. As the member for Berowra well knows, even with disability support pension, if it is refused you have the right to a full appeal before an independent tribunalwere being made available by social workers in regard to people suffering from asthma. I found it was rather disconcerting to have that there. The other issue which the member for Berowra raised, which I also found a little bit disconcerting, was the child disability allowance. Again, we had set a target-something like 80 per cent-which we would have liked to have achieved within the time frame that we had set ourselves, and we did not get to that. We did get to only 70 per cent. Again, that was because there is caring approach required in order to grant a disability support pension to a child, and there is a lot of investigation required. I would not like to think, at any time, that because we have rushed through decision making some person is being denied access to a pension. But, at the same time, we must make sure that performance standards are in place, and that the payments are made accordingly. The Department of Social Security has published a series of client service performance standards only since 1992. It is good to have that on record and also to have on record the reason that the department is doing this. It is doing it because of this broad approach to improve our client service. The standards themselves need to be understood to appreciate why the publication is as it is. The standards are set mainly because we want to look at the timeliness and the accuracy of the decisions made to pay those particular claims, whatever they may be. We also want to continue a review on the timeliness of processing the inquiries that come through, including our telephone inquiries and office· inquiries, the provision of interpreter services and ministerial correspondence. All these things are part of standards which the department sets for itself. We also want to make sure that we cover the timeliness of answers to parliamentary questions. We look at processing our reviews and appeals-that is, how authorised review officers of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are handling them and how quickly they are dealing with them. This is all part of a standard process that we are virtually policing ourselves in the department so that we can say, 'We have reached our goal now; we are doing very well.' We believe, with reviews and technology, that perhaps we can do a little bit better.",146,Representatives Main Committee

275,Mrs Crosio,"No. The honourable member mentioned the actual disability pensions thatWednesday,8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1897 Of course, one of the important things is the timeliness of overpayment raising and even prosecution referral. That is why it is important to understand that standards are not just a wish list; standards and performance standards are not just there as a figure. I sometimes wonder whether we set too high a standard, particularly in the teleservice centre. I have raised this with the department and it is public knowledge .. I think we need to review continually the causes of interruptions and programs and identify what is causing a particular downgrading in that standard expectation. The honourable member for Berowra also raised that particular correspondence. I can assure him that he is not the only one who raised it. A number of us, including me, have raised it. Our constituents who have had this type of letter have come to us. I tell them that we look continually at review processes and at how those letters are put together. It is inexcusable; I am not defending it. correspondence should go out to a constituent in a case like that. How many pieces of correspondence does the Department of Social Security deal with? There are something like 4million payments of one form or another. Every time a review process is required or legislation is changed, our clients need to be notified. Correspondence is dealt with on a daily basis, let alone a weekly or a yearly basis. We cari all pull out a page or a letter that one of our constituents has brought to us that can be viewed with concern. We are well aware of the particular matter that the honourable member for Berowra raised. We did not need him to raise it. It is old news; it occurred just before Christmas and it is certainly something that we are very concerned about. I give him a similar example whenariother review was raised in our teleservice centres. It was absolutely chock-a-block all over Australia. It occurred because the ANZ bank delayed payment of the pension at that particular time and it caused a problem, certainly a major hiccup, within our teleservice centres. When we are critical of what our department does, we must also take on board the number of people we have to deal with; the number of people who are employed both at the counter face and through the teleservice centres; and, most particularly, the nature of the work involved in this area. While we should not have mistakes, none of us are perfect. Nor is the legislation perfect and never to be changed. I repeatedly say in Department of Social Security debates that the legislation should never be set in concrete. We should evolve: we should continue to change to meet people's needs. The same thing applies with correspondence and the way we deal with our constituents and clients. If we have a mistake, we must acknowledge that mistake, rectify it and, most importantly,make sure that that type of mistake does not occur again in the future. That is what standards are all about. In 12 months time, when we again talk about the standards that we have started to publish since 1992, if we have incurred the same problems in those same areas, we will certainly need to take on board why that has occurred. I give assurance that I am continually aware of that. I know my minister is, because he at all times is very mindful of the concerns of the constituents coming to him and the types of changes and the long-term goals which we set the department for the department's people to meet and achieve. It is very much a people's department; it is very much people we are dealing with at all levels.

Debate (on motion by Mr Hicks) adjourned. Data-matching Program Report Debate resumed from 18 October 1994, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. the data-matching program and the report from the Department of Employment, Education and Training which has been supplied to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training( Mr Crean) explaining what the position is at this stage with data processing in that department. It is a pretty important area, which we need to highlight. I understand the honourable member for Moore( Mr Filing) was going to speak on it earlier but obviously his other commitments have kept him from doing so. SoI will just take a few moments of the Committee's time this morning to make a few points about it. One of the important things to note about the whole data-matching program is that it does not function just to pick up students who are receiving payments they are not entitled to but also looks at other ways to stop the rorting of the system. That is pretty important, as is the fact that it also serves to identify students who may be entitled to other payments. Quite often we hear that students who are looking for assistance, and rightly should have that assistance, do not know what their benefits or entitlements are. It is an important aspect of the program that they are well aware of those. The program is a powerful tool for the department to use to pursue the entitled level of financial assistance to those students. However, the primary function of the data-matching program remains to detect incorrect payments. That is something that, from the public accountability point of view, I think we are all aware of. Before the 1990-91 budget, data matching for cost recovery purposes was costly, time consuming and quite ineffiCient. That budget introduced the requirement for most people claiming government assistance to provide tax file numbers as a prerequisite to payment, which has been an important part of the data-matching program. Increased computerised matching of data held by various Commonwealth agencies has been of assistance here as well. It is not only the Department of Employment, Education and Training that uses the data-matching program. The Department of Socia1 Security, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Housing and Regional Development, and the Australian Taxation Office itself are very interested in that area. It is important to look at some of the benefits that have come from the data-matching program, as well as the costs associated with that and the cost recovery program. The cost since 1981 has been $1.8 million; in 1993-94 it was $630,650. Of the 1993-94 cost, 83 per cent was for computer support and staff salaries. When we compare that with the savings that have been identified by the program since April 1981, it is interesting to note that $12,338,238 has been saved. When the cost factor associated with that saving is deducted, the overall net profit is $10,512,075. There are some other significant benefits. There was $102,685 identified",149,Representa Tives Main Committee
278,Mr Les Scott (Oxley) (11.05 A.m.),"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Wednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1899 as underpayments since 1981. That just concerns those people who have been underpaid who need that assistance. As well as the financial savings benefits, an efficient data-matching program provides a significant deterrent to people who would try to claim assistance for which they are ineligible. It acts as an incentive to tell the truth, which is a real plus for the public purse. The department and the government actively publish the program and publicise it, which is very important. The department is of the opinion that this has led to a significant increase in the degree of voluntary compliance among clients, particularly in the case of changing circumstances that may affect their eligibility for student assistance. While this is not the appropriate time to debate the advantages or shortcomings of the student assistance scheme, it should be appreciated that an efficient data-matching program that catches out those who are claiming undeserved assistance frees up the total pool of financial resources for those worthy students who are deserving of additional assistance. As I mentioned before, it is important that those students actually receive the assistance they need. The argument can always be put for increasing the level of student assistance. Having four sons of my own in that field, I am reminded of it pretty regularly, particularly of course in the pursuit of our national drive. for increased access to, and funding for, higher education. In states such as my own state of Queensland there is a shortage, which we keep reminding the minister about. The fact that he is addressing the problem is certainly welcomed by most Queenslanders and acknowledged by the Queensland government. However, we acknowledge that, as with everything else, the provision of funds is subject to budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, the minister has certainly made some positive statements in that area. The more money that can be provided through other means such as identifying undeserved overpayments, the more students will benefit, and we will have a pool of funds from which those in the greatest need can obtain assistance. Of course, on the other side of the coin, the application process for student assistance is large and very complex. From my family's point of view, when one of my sons went to university in Sydney one of the first things that happened was that he was given an Austudy form to fill out. As he filled it out I expressed my doubts that be would be entitled to Austudy in view of his age and my income. Sure enough, he has been through the process, is not eligible for it and obviously does not get it. I just thought it was a waste of time his going through the exercise. We could probably find a simpler way to identify whether people are eligible-some sort of ready-reckoner for applicants to use to describe themselves-rather than have them go through the whole process and waste the time of the department when clearly there are students who are not eligible who probably could have ticked a few boxes and concluded they were not eligible for whatever reasons. That is something I would like the department to look at at some time. It does not really relate too much to the data-matching program but I wanted to make the point that some of those forms are somewhat daunting for people to fill out as well, and it would not be surprising to discover that, because of the forms, many students would not claim all the assistance they are entitled to. It is important that those who need the assistance are encouraged to apply for it. I welcome the data-matching program's ability to identify those underpayments as a significant social justice measure but we need to make sure we have that right balance. It helps MC 1900 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 1995 those most in need, which is important to the government and to all members of the parliament. Such a system would benefit disadvantaged minority groups in our community. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are particularly important as far as education is concerned, and it is important that they know what is available for them and that they are encouraged to apply as well. Students from non-English speaking backgrounds also run into some difficulties from time to time, as do migrants and others from groups whose social position may have hindered them or anyone in their family from attending higher education. The whole system, at least at the outset, might appear to be something of a mystery to some of these groups, and they need to know that they should apply for assistance. People who really need the added assistance to help them improve their position and opportunities must be encouraged to do so. Many people may take such opportunities for granted but no-one on this side of the House takes access to higher education for granted, given that we had to fight for so long for it. Everyone in this House would be pleased to see the number of students who are going on to higher education now. With the number of young people finishing high school-nearly 80 per cent of secondary students-and attending some form of higher education, keeping tabs on them all would be impossible without an effective data-matching program. Using the new technologies to advance processes is extremely important, and in some areas governments need to be able to change how the technologies are used, for the benefit of all departments. The privacy question, of course, is something that we always need to be conscious of, to ensure that the Big Brother allegations are not highlighted and pushed too much. The Privacy Commissioner's office, of course, has conducted regular inspections of the program, and it has been important in ensuring that people do not feel intimidated in any way. I understand that the latest inspection was in 1993-94, when the Privacy Commissioner's office actually visited several of the data-matching programs around the country, and it is good that it goes out and looks at ensuring that privacy provisions are being maintained. I do not want to take too much of the time of the committee, but I wish to make a few points in relation to this paper, and emphasise a few points about the benefits of data matching. Not only in DEET, but also in all the other departments, it is a good initiative and one which we should take the opportunity to advance, while at the same time, of course, ensuring that the individual's privacy is always respected. The main thing in this particular area is to ensure that students who need assistance actually receive that assistance. Debate (on motion by Mr Hicks) adjourned. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report Debate resumed from 27 February, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its visit to Thailand and Laos, and I am grateful that the opportunity has been provided for the matter to be canvassed in this Main Committee. Unfortunately, I was unable to be present in the House",150,Representatives Main Committee
279,Mr Sinclair (New England) (11.17 A.m.),"I want to make a few remarks on the reportWednesday,8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1901 on 27 February when the matter was debated there. The prime reason I wanted to rise was that there was a recommendation in the report which I thought needed to be addressed. The recommendation is on page 20 of the report. It reads: 1. the Department of Employment, Education and Training examine all the issues relevant to its funding of the National Thai Studies Centre at the Australian National University, with a view to ensuring its continued operation under conditions no less favourable than those which have applied to date. I want to say a little about that recommendation and about the importance, as I see it, of maintaining a capacity for us to teach Thai in Australian universities. The Thai studies centre at the Australian National University has done an outstanding job. I understand that there is some scepticism within DEET as to whether or not funding should continue, and I think that is a great pity. From my knowledge of Thailand and the communications we have there, it is foolish for us to ignore such an important trading partner and a country so important to our relations with ASEAN, and to not have the continuity of such an excellent centre. I will come to that in a moment. Before dealing with that, I want to comment on a few other aspects of the report. Obviously, in this year of remembrance of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, it was particularly moving for those of us who had not previously visited Hellfire Pass or the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery to do so. The present surrounds in the tropical Asianjungle are very benign, and it is very hard to envisage the trauma and suffering of those Australians who worked on the Burma railway. . We saw, of course, only that small part of the railway where Weary Dunlop's ashes were scattered, where the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) opened a memorial and where-thanks to the work by a number of members of the Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce, including Mr Rob Beattie and Major Allan Lowe and others-there is a very worthwhile facility which ensures that those who are Australian or have an interest in the area will be able to visit in an appropriate way. That is something that needs to be recognised more widely in Australia. The honourable member for Casey( Mr Halverson) referred to access to Hellfire Pass and to the facilities that have been installed there. The events at Hellfire Pass forged a special relationship between Thailand and Australia during World War II. It is a relationship on which we can still build in 1995 and in the years ahead. Certainly, there is recognition of the deaths of those young Australians in Thailand. The relationship that was developed at a personal level at that time gives us the opportunity to develop our relationship in the future. I reiterate that anyone who visits a war cemetery, wherever it might be around the world, could not help but be impressed by the way in which the cemeteries are maintained. Those whose relatives died in battlefields overseas, wherever they might be, can be assured that their loved ones have been cared for in an appropriate manner. The delegation also visited Laos. The leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Reid( Mr Ferguson), has already made some observations about that visit. I will not say a great deal, except to point out that Laos is an important country in the region. It has a special relationship with Australia. We were very grateful to the Australian ambassador in Laos for his assistance during our visit, and that gratitude is referred to in the report. It is important to distinguish between Thailand arid Laos. As a result of the Friendship Bridge, there is greater contact between the two countries. Because the people are ethnically similar and their languages are akin, the Laotians tend to feel that they are going to be overwhelmed by the Thais. I do not think that fear is surprising, considering the nature of the MC 1902 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 1995 respective peoples. However, it is important that Australia provides help wherever it can in developing the infrastructure which will enable Laos to develop its capacity to make decisions for the future. I, for one, am very impressed with the way in which Australia has provided help in a meaningful way in the past. The type of AIDAB aid that has been provided needs to be developed in the future as we look at ways in which the benefits that flow from the Friendship Bridge, which crosses the Mekong"" can be used to bring the countries of Asia, and certainly Laos and Thailand, closer together. As the honourable member for Reid observed during his speech on Monday, when the delegation visited Thailand there was a good deal of controversy over a statement that had been made by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) regarding relationships between the Thai military and the Khmer Rouge. That was definitely a matter of considerable sensitivity to the Thais. Almost everype'rson we met made some reference to that, and there were several fairly strong verbal attacks on us and on Senator Gareth Evans as a result of that comment. On each of those occasions we explained the circumstances. We stressed that the matter was of real concern because of the nature of Australia's commitment t6 Cambodia. We said that we hoped that across-the-border aid was not being given. My concern was with the way in which Senator Gareth Evans made the remarks and then had to virtually withdraw them. I felt that that acted contrary to the way in which Australia should deal with Asian people. Asians are very conscious of face. I suppose we all are-and probably none more so than politicians. However, loss of face is a real problem when dealing with Asians. Ifan allegation is to be made, it really needs to be dealt with in a way where the accusation can be made and can be registered with those who might be able to do something about it. I was concerned about the way in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs raised the allegations about the association, and with how his withdrawal meant that it was Senator Gareth Evans who lost face. I do not know the detail of the time at which the Thais ceased having that contact with the Khmer Rouge. But from the very reaction of the Thais, I suspect that there has been quite extensive contact between at least the Thai military arid the Khmer Rouge. I do not doubt for one minute that the accuracy of Senator Evans's. comment was such that he verified the comments before he made them. This situation indicates yet again the relevance of the recommendation we made about the National Thai Studies Centre. A recommendation I made long since to the Australian Defence Force Academy was that it should be a prerequisite that every young sailor, soldier and air force officer going through that academy have at least one year of training in an Asian language or in Asian culture. It is paramount that, as we move into a world where demonstrably we are going to be dealing much more significantly with Asia than we have in the past, we understand how to deal with the Asians. We have to understand that there are so many ways in which they are fundamentally different from us: not only are the languages that they speak different but also they have a different cultural base and from that culture they so often have a different vision of the future. Those of us who have had contact with people in Asian countries wiII understand that when a Japanese person, for example, says 'Yes' he means that he has heard you but not that he Wednesday,8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1903 approves of what you say. Other Asian races have different mannerisms and they react differently from the way that we Westerners tend to react. It is important that we try to deal with them in a way which takes account of their sensitivities, their prejudices, their religious backgrounds, their cultural ideas and any other aspects. It is for these reasons that the National Thai Studies Centre is so important. I would be very disappointed if the Department of Employment, Education and Training withdraws funding from that centre. From what I have seen of that centre-and representatives of the centre have given evidence to the committee on a number of occasions-I think it is doing a remarkable job. Sadly, while there has generally been a growth in Asian languages in our schools and our universities, Thai is one of the lesser. of the languages and yet it is a very important vehicle to understanding when doing deals with the Thai people. Of course, there are great opportunities for the development of relationships with Thailand and one aspect of that emerged in discussions we had with the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce. I have been one of those who have been very critical of Westpac in recent years but Gary White, the Chief Representative of Westpac in Bangkok, almost restored my faith in that bank. Westpac was one of the first banks to enter into local business dealings in Taipei and in Taiwan. In fact, Westpac had established quite a significant network. Being the first bank there, it had acquired a very good reputation. It was doing business and it was operating profitably. But blow me down if Westpac did not decide to withdraw from the Taiwan market ata time when we were trying to promote our commercial contacts, and Taiwan is a very important market for Australia. Not only did Westpac withdraw but it sold its business to a Belgian bank. Here we are saying that we have got continuing interests, and Westpac sells out to a Belgian bank and we allow the Europeans to come in under our neck. I felt that was totally inappropriate. Therefore, when I m-t Gary White, the representative of Westpac in Bangkok, I was more than a little apprehensive. However, I thought that Gary White was outstanding, as were each of the members of the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce who met us that day. Mr Terry Adams of Linfox Logistics Thailand gave an excellent overview of the transport potential there. Without going into it too much, in Thailand, people unfortunately use 10-wheel trucks which are grossly inefficient. They clog the streets of Bangkok and they contribute to all of the traffic problems. There are ways by which, demonstrably, the traffic flow in Thailand, and particularly Bangkok, can and should be improved. I was quite fascinated to see a stranger making recommendations, one of which is to get rid of these 10-wheel trucks and to start introducing a reasonable means of moving goods and people around the place. At that meeting of the Australian-Thai Chamber of CommerceI thought each of us learnt a great deal. I have only identified two members but there were a number of other very impressive representatives, including Will Hamilton of Thai Leighton, Alex Tan of Telstra, and Chris Leon of Thai Industrial Gases. They all brought to us a refreshing approach. I mention that morning meeting because I know the honourable member for Throsby( Mr Hollis) adverted to it. It is important that, in dealing with politics, we understand the different prejudices of those who are in business. Gary White, in his address, raised the issue that Senator Evans's comments had affected Australian business contacts. In no way should a government be inhibited in making comments on political issues, but, at the same time, it is very important that the Australian government takes into account the sensitivities of people in the region. This is, again, a fair stretch of the MC 1904 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,8 March 1995 bow, but I know that, in some of the Middle East countries, some of the comments which have been made have prejudiced Australian business which is done in those communities. I am worried that the foreign minister, in making those remarks-no doubt with absolute verification of what he said-has prejudiced Australia's standing in Thailand in an .unfortunate way. Perhaps if Senator Evanswent along to the National Thai Studies Centre at the AND for a little while it may give him some better understanding of how to deal with Asian people. Australia's J;""elations with Thailand are very important to us The meeting with the Australia-Thai Chamber ofComrrierce gave us an idea of the excellent job that Australians are doing in Thailand. There are great opportunities in Thailand, but it is unfortunate that some of the commercial contacts which came about as a result of the construction of the Friendship Bridge do not seem to have brought on the flow in construction work that we hoped for. Of course, wherever you are in Asia, or indeed wherever you are overseas, Australian companies have got to understand that they have to persist in their efforts. You cannot go for a one-week visit and think that everything is going to flow from that. You have got to be able to provide a backup service and to recognise the sensitivities of the countries concerned. Companies cannot take business for granted just because there may be a window of opportunity. Australia has a great future in Thailand. The report by the· Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the visit to Thailand and Laos will help towards putting Australia's relationship with those countries into perspective for the future. I commend the chairman of the committee, and I thank Patrick Regan, the secretary of the committee, for the help he provided to the members of the committee during the visit. Debate (on motion by Mr Hicks) adjourned. Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Exposure draft on section 53(3) of the Constitution Debate resumed from 6 March 1995, on motion by Mr Melham: That the House take note of the paper. which the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs considered relevant to the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. I also briefly outlined a number of the committee's major recommendations, and I will now discuss some aspects of the committee's report in more detail. As the third paragraph of section 53 is part of the scheme of that section, it is often impossible to discuss the paragraph in isolation from the other paragraphs in section 53. The fifth paragraph of section 53 states: Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. The third paragraph of section 53 is one such exception. It provides: The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.",152,Representatives Main Committee
280,Mr Melham (Banks) (11.38 A.m.),"During my tabling statement. I outlined the factorsWednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1905 The broad purpose of section 53 of the constitution is to preserve the financial initiative of the House of Representatives. This is the focus of a number of the committee's recommendations. Under the constitution, it is the prerogative of the House of Representatives to initiate taxing and appropriation bills. This principle derives from sections 53 and 56 of the constitution. Section 53 prohibits bills which appropriate revenue or money and bills which impose taxation from being originated in the Senate. It also limits the power of the Senate to amend bills. Section 56 of the constitution gives the executive government holding the majority in the House of Representatives control in relation to the expenditure of public money. The initiative in relation to money matters is vested in the lower House in all Commonwealth countries. This rule is regarded as a safeguard against unrestrained and politically competitive financial proposals by members of parliament who do not have the responsibility of government. However, despite this rule, all financial bills must pass both houses before being presented to the Governor General for assent. While the House of Representatives has an exclusive right of initiation, the Senate has the power of veto. There appeared to be general agreement among participants in the inquiry that the purpose of section 53 is to preserve the financial initiative of the House of Representatives. The clerks of both houses agree with this principle. In a submission to the committee the clerk of this House, Mr Lyn Barlin, quoted House of Representatives Practice in stating that the financial initiative rule vests the right to initiate and the right to move to increase appropriations and taxes with the government-see page S191 of volume 1 of submissions to the inquiry. The Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, also agreed with the financial initiative rule. In a submission to theinquiry, commenting on the government's interpretation of section 53 in relation to Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994, Mr Evans noted that the purpose of section 53 is to preserve the financial initiative of the House of Representatives-see pages S65 and S219 of submissions to the inquiry. If senators also agree with this fundamental principle, the prospect of the houses drafting a compact embodying that principle may be likely. As part of the process of examining the issues associated with the inquiry, the committee held a seminar in Canberra on 28 October last year. The participants in the seminar included Mr Dennis Rose QC, Professor Cheryl Saunders, Professor Anthony Blackshield, Dr Jim Thomson, Ms Hilary Penfold, Mr Barlin, Mr Evans and the committee's consultant, Professor Michael Coper, as well as members of the committee. One of the issues discussed at the seminar was the justiciability of section 53. This issue is important in determining the scope of the houses to negotiate a compact concerning the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53. The traditional view is that section 53 is not justiciable. That is, a court cannot intervene in a legislative process if the requirements of .section 53 are not being complied with. Furthermore, a law which has been passed by both houses and has received royal assent is not invalid if it does not comply with section 53. The traditional view is based on the deliberate reference to 'proposed laws' in section 53 and section 54. This view is supported by the convention debates and case law. During the convention debates it was suggested that the term 'proposed laws' should be used to indicate that a matter is a question of order between the two houses. . . In Osborne v. the Commonwealth (1911), 12 CLR 321, Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith commented that se.ctions 53 and 54 deal with proposed laws-that is, bills or projects of law MC 1906 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,8 March 1995 still under consideration and not assented to-and that they lay down rules to be observed with respect to proposed laws at that stage. Whatever obligations are imposed by those sections are directed to the houses of parliament, whose conduct of their internal affairs is not subject to review by a court of law. Members of the High Court have supported the view that section 53 is not justiciable in a range of decisions. For example, section 53 has been referred to as merely directory and for parliamentary guidance only. While most of the evidence received by the committee supports the view that section 53 is not justiciable, there are some factors which may support the alternative view, namely that section 53 may be justiciable. I will briefly outline some of these factors. The factors are dealt with in more detail in the committee's exposure draft. The first factor is the declining persuasive value of relevant precedents. In Cormack v. Cope (1974), 131 CLR 432, a declaration was sought that the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill 1973 was not a proposed law by reference to which the Governor General could dissolve both houses under section 57 of the constitution. Ultimately, a joint sitting was held, and the bill was passed by both houses, sitting together. The validity of the act was then challenged in Victoria v. the Commonwealth and Connor (1975), 134 CLR 81, which is known as the PMA case, on the ground that there had not been compliance with section 57 of the constitution. I do not propose to outline the judgments in each of those cases, but only to comment, in the light of discussion of those cases held during the committee's seminar on section 53. During the seminar, Professor Cheryl Saunders suggested that in Cormack v. Cope and the PMA case the court made it clear that the Australian constitution was a controlled constitution. The court showed a willingness to scrutinise the compliance of the parliamentary process with the constitution, and to intervene, at least once legislation was enacted. Professor Saunders went on to suggest that earlier High Court precedents on sections 53 and 54 might be less persuasive, following the decisions in these cases-see page 4 of the seminar transcript. A second factor which suggests that section 53 may be justiciable is the interrelationship between section 53 and other sections of the constitution. In Osborne v. the Commonwealth, His Honour Justice Higgins queried why an act is invalid by reason of its substance under section 55 if it deals with matters other than the imposition of taxation, when a bill appropriating moneys for the ordinary annual services of the government is not invalid by reason of its substance under section 54. This comment was referred to on a number of occasions during the committee's public hearings, and lends support to the argument that section 54 should be considered justiciable. It has been suggested that there may be some lack of logic in finding the rule in section 55, but not that in section 54, justiciable. If section 54 were found to be justiciable, that could, arguably, open the door to judicial review of section 53, as well-again, see page 4 of the seminar transcript. . The third factor relevant to thepossiblejusticiability of section 53 is the increasing emphasis on principles of responsible government. During the seminar, Professor Blackshield suggested that the justiciability of section 53 has become more of an open question, because the High Court is shifting ground, to some extent, in terms of basic constitutional theory. The traditional model of responsible government involves judicial deference to parliament. But Professor Blackshield suggested that, when the High Court discusses representative government, it has in mind a strong conception that all arms of government have their own Wednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1907 direct responsibility to the Australian people. As part of that conception, the High Court may be more willing to insist on adherence to the constitution, even by parliament itself-see pages 10 and 11 of the seminar transcript. There have also been two recent High Court cases where the justiciability of certain constitutional provisions has been at issue. The justiciability of section 54 of the constitution was raised in Northern Suburbs General Cemetery Reserve Trust v. the Commonwealth (19921993), 176 CLR 555, known as the Northern Suburbs case. The joint judgment referred to the traditional view that failure to comply with a procedural provision, such as section 54, is not justiciable. However, as there had been compliance with section 54, the court did not deal with whether the section was justiciable. Issues concerning the third paragraph of section 53 are currently before the High Court in the State of Western Australia v. the Commonwealth, the native title case. It was argued by Western Australia that three Senate amendments to the Native Title Bill contravened the third paragraph of section 53. One of the amendments concerned the insertion of a clause establishing a parliamentary joint committee on native title. Counsel for Western Australia submitted that establishing such a committee would involve a burden on the people, as it would involve various administrative costs and other expenses, revenue for which would be raised by taxation. The parliament awaits with interest any comment on the third paragraph of section 53 by the High Court. The possibility of comment on the issue by the High Court raises further issues. During the seminar, Professor Blackshield suggested that, even if there are justiciable issues associated with section 53, those issues may be limited. The question of whether the High Court has power or jurisdiction to pronounce on certain issues is interlocked with the question of what those issues are. Professor Blackshield went on to say that, in order to have a justiciable question before it, the High Court must be able to identify fairly precise legal questions which are capable of reasonably objective answers, and it must be able to formulate questions without venturing too far into the intramural· business of parliament-see page 7 of the seminar transcript. However, despite the factors which may support the poss.ible justiciability of section 53, the weight of opinion and evidence to the committee suggests that the section is unlikely to be considered justiciable. The committee agrees with this body of opinion. That is a view that I hold, and I hold strongly. As it appears unlikely that section 53 will be the subject of judicial determination, it will be undesirable if there remains no authoritative pronouncement on the interpretation and application of section 53, particularly the third paragraph. That is not to say that section 53 does not impose any constraints on the parliament. As is noted in the report, disregard of these constraints may be immune from con;ection by the High Court. However, an interpretation that flouted section 53 would obviously be unacceptable to both houses. But if the houses did agree to a compaCt that was in flagrant disregard of the constitution, the High Court might then be interested in considering the matter. If the parliament is the judge of whether there has been compliance with the constitutional rules for the passage of money bills through parliament, this puts the onus on the houses to reach agreement in light of the spirit and letter of section 53. . In the committee's view, a compact between the houses would show parliament's fidelity to the constitutional requirements of section 53. The objective of any compact would be MC 1908 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,8 March 1995 twofold-namely, to assist in the practical workings of the parliamentary process, and to define and limit the constitutional powers of both houses. The committee reiterates that any interpretation should be based on a sensible and practical view of section 53 that is reasonably sustainable within the words of that section, and reasonably consistent with history and parliamentary practice. The exposure draft includes a statement of principles for possible inclusion in a compact. It is the committee's view that these principles could form a useful basis for discussion between the houses. However, the committee recognises that both houses will need to be prepared to make concessions to reach a workable agreement. I hope that the exposure draft and the principles contained in it promote discussion both within the parliament and beyond. I look forward to discussions on this matter with members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee and with other interested parties. Following discussions with the Senate committee I look forward to the possibility of the House reaching a formal and workable agreement on the application and interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. I emphasise that this matter should be treated seriously as, in my view, section 53 is almost certainly not justiciable; the onus is on the parliament to interpret that section of the constitution. Consequently,each house should take steps to ensure that it discharges its responsibility in this area. It is not good enough to look for excuses and to say that it is too hard to reach a compact and a workable agreement. I believe it can be done. I believe that it is in the interests of the parliament that it should be done, and that people should not walk away from it. I have taken my time to outline the arguments for and against justiciability because, as I said earlier, I am firmly of the view that section 53 is not justiciable and, in my opinion, that places more emphasis on the parliament to look at it and to work towards a compact. That emphasis is not on the government and the Senate, but on the House. of Representatives and the Senate. That is what constitutes the parliament. And if a compact is reached, that is what will be unique about it: it will be a compact between the House of Representatives and the Senate. I believe that it is achievable. To date, the process that the committee has embarked upon has shown that there is goodwill between all interested people involved; that there is a difference of opinion, but that the difference is not so marked or so stark that a workable solution is not achievable. It is achievable. I think that there are some basic principles that can be adhered to and that we can come up with a compact. That is a great step forward for the parliament. I do commend those who have been involved in the preparation of this exposure draft, and I commend that draft to the parliament. of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report The third paragraph a/section 53 a/the constitution: exposure draft. I wish to express my appreciation to the committee chairman, the member for Banks( Mr Melham), for the way in which this inquiry was conducted. ThoughI was a sometime participant, it is an area that anybody who has parliamentary duties must be interested in because it relates so intimately to the comparative powers and responsibilities of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The committee examined the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution, which states: The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.",156,Representatives Main Committee
281,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (11.53 A.m.),"I welcome this opportunity to speak on the HouseWednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1909 The processes the committee adopted were salami-like-and very appropriate-in slicing through the areas of contention and possible interpretation of that paragraph. In August last year, the committee prepared a summary of issues which outlined some of the practical measures that could be confronted by the parliament. I want to mention some of the issues raised when we first came to examine this matter. Is the difference between an amendment and a request for an amendment important in practical terms? Should the Senate refer an amendment to the House of Representatives, or a request for amendment? Are they both regarded as being the same thing? Another issue raised was whether it would be desirable for two committees-one of the Senate and one of the House to draft a protocol detailing the procedures to be implemented when questions concerning the third paragraph of section 53 arise and establishing a mechanism for dispute resolution in such cases. We came to a conclusion. I will read recommendation No. 13, which is the final recommendation of the exposure draft. It says: The Committee recommends that there should be a compact between the Housesthat is the Senate and the House of Representativesin relation to the interpretation and application of provisions of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution. The Committee further recommends that there should be consultation between the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee and this Committeethat is, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairsin order to determine how negotiations in relation to the compact will proceed. So right at the beginning, where we were looking at the issues, there was the concept that it might be possible for the House and the Senate to work towards an understanding. It has been called a compact. Initially, I think that might be too grand a term. If there is a memorandum of understanding, I propose that that may not cover all possible or foreseeable instances where there is a reference where we can lay down a series of protocols as each issue arises. I would need to refer to the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. Over a period of time we will develop a firm understanding, in the form of a series of agreements, which are much stronger and more binding than sheer conventions, but are agreements gradua,1ly reached by the two Houses-an evolutionary process. It may not be possible for the two committees or for the House and the Senate to reach complete agreement on all areas that relate to section 53. But over a period, as we get particular circumstances arising, we will deal with those and add to the fund of information and the various determinations that go to constitute, finally, what could be called a contract, or a compact, an evolutionary process that may take some years to arrive at. I have no problem with that. The thing to do is make a start. The last thing I would like to see is this area being thrown to the High Court for the High Court to interpret the relationship between the House and the Senate. The committee has come to a conclusion that this area is not justiciable. I think that is the right decision. There appears to be no evidence which would provide an opportunity for the High Court or any other court to become involved in the affairs relating to the charges or burdens decided by the House of Representatives and the Senate. People are very fond of giving responsibilities to the parliament for us to find solutions to things but then, having given those responsibilities to the parliament, people quickly want to MC 1910 MAIN COMMITTEE WednesdaY,8 March 1995 re-claim their rights. So the people with the responsibility have their powers to act diminished and are criticised for not being able to do anything. We need to be conscious that the High Court and others, through the process of claiming their rights, are extracting from the parliament powers that they originally wanted the parliament to perform and are thereby diminishing the power and the capacity of the parliament to take action. This is one area that the High Court or any other court should never get into. It must be a matter that is settled between the two houses and the committee. The exposure draft comes to that conclusion. I hope this exposure draft draws a lot of comment and close examination from the community. I have dealt already with some of the practical issues that were raised in the initial stages of our inquiry, the second one being the prospect of two committees joining together and drafting a protocol. With the hindsight of nine months, that is pretty good identification of what can be the issues for the House of Representatives. That issues paper went on to query whether or not a court could intervene if it is considered that a proposed law does not comply with the third paragraph of section 53. Again, the issues paper proposed: What are the consequences for an Act if the requirements of the third paragraph of section 53 have not been complied with? .. Can the Senate press a request for an amendment to a bill? ... What are the legal consequences of the Senate introducing a charge or burden in a bill (which has already been passed by the House of Representatives) and which initially contained no proposal to place a charge or burden on the people? And so, point by point, every possible ramification of the third paragraph of section 53 was dealt with at an early stage, drawing out the prospects of what the interpretations could be. Gradually, through a process of seminar and evidence, the committee reached its conclusions on each one of those areas and finally came to a conclusion that the responsibility does lie with the House and the House should accept those responsibilities; bills that impose charges should not be introduced in the Senate. We moved right away from any loosening up of what the House regards as its full responsibility. The recommendations include that a compact be attempted but some of the other conclusions reached by the committee are as significant as that one. They include: The Committee recommends that the third paragraph of section 53 should be regarded as applicable only to bills that have originated in the House of Representativesand alsoThe Committee recommends that, in relation to appropriations, taxes and other charges, a request should be required where an alteration to a bill is moved in the Senate which will make an increase legally possible (even if the net effect of the alteration is a decrease). That is an absolutely proper interpretation, in my view, of what the third paragraph of section 53 stands for. This is, in some ways, a landmark report that will only be of interest to a narrow number of people until a dispute of some sort arises. When that happens, the whole nation will want to know about the third paragraph of section 53 and why the row is between the Senate and the House and why the House is jacking up because the Senate is seeking powers that do not properly belong to the .senate. Then, I suspect, the government will get involved. Wednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1911 It is the recommendation of this committee that I think will ultimately be the real test of how it should go, and that is the recommendation to look at the areas of problem, draw up a compact on which should be handled and how, and leave to one side those areas where there is not going to be an agreement. Let the disputes arise and at that point, if it is necessary, reach a conclusion and the government of the day may get involved. It is not possible to foresee every instance where there will be a dispute or a problem. It is not possible to foresee every interpretation that may need to be placed on the third paragraph of section 53 but the attempt should be made and a compact written. I believe that with goodwill we can confine the area of possible conflict to something that is reasonable. Finally, as a member of the House of Representatives, I think it would be completely inappropriate for governments to put their interpretation on what should happen. This is a matter between the houses-between the members of the House of Representatives and senators: It is what we stand for in our chamber and what they stand for in theirs that has to be settled. It is not a matter where a government or the Attorney-General's Department or anybody else can come along and say, 'This is what we believe should happen.' It should be a vote that is not taken on party lines. An establishment of support for a compact of any type should be a free vote with members acting independently. I see the member for Banks jerk back. Today he has put his name to another landmark report which may not advance his popularity in all quarters, but which is a very important report. If we can consider it as parliamentarians, I do not believe that there are divisions of ideology on this matteL It is only how we feel as members of the House of Representatives. I cannot see the basis of an ideological difference here. The same should apply in the Senate. If we do it in that way, as professional parliamentarians, we will reach a good conclusion. If there is external interference of any sort, the prospect of our reaching that solid base of understanding will be diminished . . I compliment, in particular, the member for Banks and the member for Tangney( Mr Williams) for their effort, and also the staff of the committee. The report is a valuable contribution and I trust that we will have the opportunity of moving ahead with a compact at an early opportunity, perhaps not in this parliament but maybe in the next parliament. Perhaps it might be possible within this parliament to reach an early stage of an agreement between the houses. If that were the case it would be most desirable. It would be a most worthy goal for the legal and constitutional affairs committee of the House of Representatives to achieve an agreement. If we can, it will benefit not only this parliament, but the next one, and the next one, and all parliaments to come. ( Mr Cadman) when he said that this report would be of little interest to the wider public. It is an esoteric report. That is the best way to describe it. It is of interest to lawyers, constitutional lawyers particularly, to the clerks of the houses and to those who like to pore over constitutions, whether they be the constitution of a small association or the constitution of Australia. It is probably noteworthy that the member for Banks( Mr Melham) and the member for Tangney( Mr Williams), both of whom were previously lawyers--one a solicitor like myself, the other a QC and barrister-have churned out some reports just like this one, which are esoteric but interesting. I found this report particularly interesting. I think the member for Mitchell was a solicitor in a former life as well.",160,Representatives Main Committee

283,Mr Cadman,"No, no, but I've been converted.MC 1912 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 1995 next election, like the member for Robertson ( Mr Walker). An inquiry into the operation of section 53, paragraph 3, is an important inquiry. It is important because it goes to the relationship between the Senate and the House of Representatives. That is why I wanted to support it and do it and be involved with it. It goes to the reasons for the formation of our constitutional relationship as a nation, dividing up the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate was to have important power because it represented the states in a federation. Therefore· it was given overwhelming power to reject legislation-even money bills-and to deny a government supply, as it has done on numerous occasions. On the other hand the Senate was not given the power to initiate money bills and to form policy for government, because it does not have the responsibility of government. Therefore the financial initiative remains with the people's house, the House of Representatives. Primarily, this was designed to avoid the possibility of rivalry between a house that represented the states and a house that represented the people. I know the member for Banks and I share many views in this respect, perhaps unlike some of my other coalition colleagues. It was a very important distinction to make, because the Senate is becoming less and less of a states house, as it was originally designed. It was not to have the same power as a government responsible for financial and taxation decisions. What was the catalyst for the current inquiry? I will quote briefly from the report at paragraph 1.7.1. It sums up the catalyst for the inquiry and the importance of this inquiry: ... the interpretation and application. of the third paragraph of section 53 is a matter of fundamental substantive importance, as it preserves the financial initiative of the House of Representativesas intended by the framers of the Constitution. Proponents of this view suggest that to describe the provisions of section 53 as essentially procedural tends to downplay their importance, as they are requirements of the Constitution which must be respected. I think that is very true. One of the interesting things in this inquiry was the divergence of opinion between the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Clerk of the Senate. One Of them was sugge-ting that it was a procedural matter and, by being procedural, it was no less important than if it were regarded as an important part of the constitution. I think that also demonstrates the view of the Senate with respect to procedures and form and substance-that the House of Representatives is more the house of form. Perhaps the Senate is more the house of procedure and substance and people standing up on minor points and having some victory, whereas the House sees its role very much as the defender of the rights of the people in choosing their government. The specific catalyst for the current inquiry was the dispute over the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1993. In that bill the Senate proposed changes to the income tax provisions that would provide deductions for expenditure incurred by life insurance companies and registered organisations in obtaining premiums which are excluded from assessable income. The view was taken that this, and another amendment dealing with taxpayers paying instalments earlier, could fall within the ambit of section 53(3) and was therefore yet another example of disagreement between the houses; and so the committee established its inquiry. The broader issue was touched on at that time by the Speaker in the House when he reported that there was disagreement between the houses over this bill. That was the historic relationship",163,Representatives Main Committee
284,Mr Melham,But I'm now a barrister.,164,Representatives Main Committee
285,Mr Pyne,"You will probably make yourself a QC at some point, just before you lose theWednesdaY,8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1913 between the houses, which he also wanted to be canvassed in the report; and the report does so comprehensively. One could say that a substantial part of the report deals with our historic relationship with the Senate and the place that the House of Representatives has in the Australian democracy. The principle behind section 53(3) is to ensure that the democratically elected lower house maintains its financial imperative over the democratically elected upper house that does not bear responsibility of government. I repeat that, because it is extraordinarily important to understand that in the end this report comes out very much as a House of Representatives report. One of the things I want to touch on briefly later is that the Senate committee established into this matter is more than likely to come out with a different type of compact from the one the House of Representatives has come out with. That is because we in the House of Representatives understand that the responsibility of government is overwhelming; and that while the Senate might sometimes spend 38 hours in discussion, and spend two of those hours on legislation-while senators can speak at great length, and can drag things out for years in some circumstances-in the end the responsibility for whether governments rise or fall is in the House of Representatives. That is what the people are watching on election night to see who wins the election. That is very keenly felt by my colleagues, particularly in marginal seats. Of the member for Banks, the right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair) and I, I have the most marginal seat, but I am grateful to say that I am not particularly marginalnot less than two per cent. This principle also reflects the fact that Australia is not similar to Britain in its make-up, but is more akin to the United States. One of the historical misinterpretations of the past 100 years is that the Australian system is based on the British system of government. While we have a Westminster style government in terms of its executive and so on, when our federation was formed it was formed around the concept of a federation of states. That is nothing like Britain. Australia does not have an unaccountable upper house, because we do not have the hierarchicalstructureofBritain. Our system was formed around the United States system, with the federation of states electing senators to a democratically elected upper house, not an appointed one. That reflects the fact that we have a diverse population, that we are geographically enormous compared to Britain, and that in the late 1890s we were unwilling as a people to tolerate an appointed, unaccountable upper house. The principle goes back to our roots. It goes back very early in our formulation as a Commonwealth and as 'a country, when we tried to break from Britain. I would like to endorse the availability test as enunciated in the report by the committee, which basically states that where money is to be made available to the executive that would otherwise not be available but for the amendments of the Senate, then that is naturally an increase in the burden on the people and falls within the ambit of section 53. Some in the Senate and elsewhere will say that this is an extremely narrow test, that it perhaps goes too far in maintaining the financial imperative of the House of Representatives. However on balance the committee has decided, after taking evidence from vast numbers of people and hearing particularly detailed evidence from the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, that this is the test that is most capable of application, in that it is clear and unambiguous. It does curtail the power of the Senate to amend bills that authorise expenditure. This is consistent with the principle of preserving the financial initiative of the House of Representatives and therefore I endorse it. MC 1914 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,8 March 1995 This will bean area of disagreement between eminent thinkers and between the houses. I look forward to the Senate handing down its report and to seeing what it will come up with by way of a test that it will support in the application of section 53. The House's position is a useful starting point in the compact. I also support, directly from the report, the exploration of the feasibility of a compact between the houses. Such a compact, the first of its kind between the House and the Senate-as most of the compacts so far established are between the Senate and the government-would inject greater certainty into a situation which is currently quite fluid and leads to far too many, and an increasing number of, disagreements between the Houses. There are obvious difficulties that leap to mind with the compact. I do not think we are under any illusions about those. Firstly, as the compact is proposed by the House of Representatives, it is natural that some members of the Senate will immediately respond in a less than positive fashion. Some senators will approach it with suspicion, seeing the House as trying to reduce the flexibility of the Senate in dealing with bills. The other problem is a disagreement that currently exists between the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Clerk of the Senate. This will be probably be played out through the negotiations-over' a compact. The final problem will be the tardiness of previous governments, senates and houses to reach compacts with one another because of the lack of flexibility that might give in a political and constitutional sense. I did not want to speak for long today and I have spoken for longer than I expected. In conclusion I would like to commend the report to the Main Committee and ask it to take note of the report. I would like to commend the secretariat. This has been a very long and complicated deliberation, mainly because it took such a great deal of concentration and reading and listening. The committee did not drag it out, but it took much longer than expected to produce the exposure draft and, now, the exposure draft report. We expected to 'finish this report by late last year and the members of the secretariat have shown great forbearance in their continued support of the committee. I would like to thank them, as they have done very good job. I would also like to thank the chairman of the committee, the member for Banks, for the excellent work that he has done. The committee has, in the last 12 months, been more active than it has been for a long time, particularly in its reference of bills. about all the nice things my colleague was saying about him. It is important that we understand the nature of our committee system: that there is an opportunity from time to time for reasonably important recommendations to emerge from committee deliberations. To my mind, the exposure draft on the third paragraph of section 53 released by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is such a document. I commend the chairman, the honourable member for Banks, and the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams), who has also made a very significant contribution in this debate. I would like to commend those who participated in the seminar, which was held in this very room. It was quite a fascinating experience. Regrettably I could not stay for all of it, but it was held on 28 October 1994 and it brought together academics, parliamentary staff and practising politicians in a way that, unfortunately, does not happen often enough. There was an opportunity to look at the way in which, in this instance, the constitution applies to the relationships between the two chambers.",164,Representatives Main Committee
286,Mr Sinclair (New England) (12.18 P.m.},I would also like to commend the honourable,166,Representa Tives Main Committee
287,Member For Banks ( Mr Melham),"but he should not let it go to his head: I am a bit concernedWednesdaY,8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1915 There is no doubt that a lot of people contributed to this report. In saying that, let me not omit the staff. The staff of the standing committee have done an outstanding job and Michael Wright, who has now returned to other fields in the bureaucracy, has made a particular contribution in support. He came to us from the Attorney-General's Department and was a certainly a very valuable member of staff for the preparation of this report. But I want to say something a bit beyond that, and I do not want to repeat what others have said. The first thing is that it is very important for us all to register that, as politicians, we tend very much to get bogged down in the day-to-day consideration of those matters which are either on the blue sheet or the Notice Paper and are identified for our consideration for debate within our two chambers. In a bicameral system, we do not have a great deal of contact on a day-to-day basis with people in the other chamber. There are people such as the honourable member for Moncrieff( Mrs Sullivan) who have, in fact, been members of both chambers, but she is the exception. While there are a few in our House who have been members in the Senate, and a few in the Senate who have been members of the lower house, we tend to operate very much in parallel, rather than in tandem. It was the nature of a bicameral system, and the objectives of it, that, to my mind, emerged in perhaps a new form in looking back at the proceedings of some of those early constitutional conventions. It is quite fascinating looking back at the words of Henry Parkes and Robert Garran and some of those constitutional fathers and looking at what happens in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere to see how they developed for us a constitution which has served Australia remarkably well. There, of course, are areas of difficulty in interpretation and I will deal with the particular one we are considering shortly. But the important part about it is that, essentially, in this bicameral system of ours, the constitutional fathers set down what they saw as the best way by which an effective day-to-day operation could be achieved. That was, to give both houses, as far as possible, equal powers, equal responsibilities, with a different method of election, but giving to the House alone the responsibility, essentially, for money and financial matters. In determining how far that peculiar responsibility for the administration of the economy lies within the House of Representatives, they set down a number of restraints. Section 53 of the constitution essentially identifies the way in which those constitutional fathers saw fit to define the difference. And it is important that we look back, as this report attempts, at the words that they used, and at why 'proposed burden or charge on the people' is used. That is really the only way in which you can interpret the words. It is important, too, that we understand that within that same constitution, they determined that matters such as section 53, relating to the administration of the powers of each chamber and the relationship between them, essentially are for the parliament itself to determine. From that, you come to the position of determining what is going to happen when the two houses have a different view on a particular matter. As my colleague the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Pyne) just mentioned, the origin of this reference was the most recent of those occasions when there was a difference between the two chambers. It concerned whether there should be a request or whether there could be an amendment by the Senate to a particular item of legislation. In this instance, it was the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1993. But the importance is that, if there should be an impasse between the houses, there is demonstrably a difference between the consequences of a request and those of an amendment. MC 1916 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 1995 And as a result of an amendment and a failure to pass a bill, there are other constitutional steps that inevitably lead to a process which can generate a double dissolution, a joint sitting of the two houses, and a government's capacity to implement its will through the devices that the constitution lays down. In fact, what we are looking at is a process to ensure there will be certainty to avoid an impasse. That does not mean that we are going to have confusion as to whether the Senate is or is not in the right when it wishes to refuse passage, and after 1975 I think it is important that we rely less on those reserve powers of the Governor General. People are talking about the republic, inappropriate as I believe the action of the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) to be in doing so in Germany-in fact, I think that is something that is beyond the pale. The man does not seem to have any understanding of the responsibilities that should be his as Prime Minister. There has been a long-existing convention that you do not talk about matters pertaining to domestic politics when you are abroad and he would know of that convention. It is a pity he does not observe it. The point that I am making is that in the change it becomes very important that we consider just where those reserve powers of the Governor General, as exercised by Sir John Kerr in 1975, are going to have parameters. One of the parameters, in its way, lies in this very term of reference. What we are talking about here is an area where we are trying to remove doubt as to the powers of the Senate, and the more precision we as politicians can give to the constitution, the less those reserve powers, unwritten as they are, are going to be called on. SoI think, in its way, this is a far more significant report, and the issue is far more significant, than perhaps is suggested by the narrowness of the words and the question of the definition of words and the interpretation that the courts and academics and successive clerks of the House and those who are with them have put on the sentences. I have been involved as Leader of the House on a number of occasions on matters which in fact identify some of these same problems. It is not a matter which pertains only to a Labor government. So the issues are ongoing and it is a matter which governments of both persuasions need to address. The fact that there is now a report does not mean we identify to the nth degree exactly what these words mean. There is an imprecision in them. It is any proposed law, it is not any law, and any proposed charge or burden on the people. There is an historical reference. Apparently 'burden on the people' is one of those rhetorical phrases that Henry Parkes used to effect. The difficulty was that he died before this particular convention was in fact implemented. Be that as it may, the words do seem to us a little archaic. They are not the ordinary phrases that you use in the back bar down at the Royal, but they are certainly phrases that do have a legal application and, in analysing the application of those words, we have attempted to come to conclusions on it. I see that the honourable member for Tangney has returned to the Main Committee. He raised in his contribution in the parliament the other day one of the other real issues which concerns me and which briefly we have addressed in this report, and that is the extent to which under the present government there has been a marked propensity to transfer financial responsibility from the House of Representatives to the Senate. My particular concern is that expenditure measures understanding appropriations are initiated in the Senate, and we have made a recommendation in respect to that. I think that the government needs to be very careful in the way in which it in fact structures its ministry and then allocates portfolios which require measures which have financial Wednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1917 implications. I instance Senator Collins and thportfolio of primary industries and energy. His portfolio responsibility frequently requires legislation which imposes a charge or a burden on the people. As far as I am concerned, if the minister is going to be in that other chamber, that minister has to forgo the capacity to introduce legislation which can run foul of the restraints that are imposed by section 53 of the constitution. The government has not done so and, to the degree that there is a problem, I believe the government has exacerbated it by its portfolio allocation and by the degree to which legislation is introduced at this stage in the other place when it would more appropriately be introduced in the House of Representatives. For a party that purports not to believe in a bicameral system and to want to abolish the Senate, it is even more paradoxical that it allocates portfolios in a way which means that legislation is introduced into the Senate which inevitably generates the conflict. The other issue that I want briefly to identify is that there has been-both in the seminar, to which reference has been made, and in the report-some discussion about whether or not the particular provisions of paragraph 3 of section 53 are justiciable. It is because there are doubts about the extent to which it may be. Reference has been made by the honourable member for Banks, and in the report, to those areas where, it suggested, it may well be justiciable .. The important thing is that there is a capacity for the houses of parliament to ensure that, in fact, that question does not arise, and that is by agreeing to a compact. I do not doubt that interpretations between the two chambers may well differ, and I hope that the process that has been enunciated and the draft compact that is set out in the back of the report do give a basis on which we may be able to come to some final resolution of the problem. I also commend the fact-and the honourable member for Tangney referred to it the other day-that, while there has been a compact before, in this instance the compact should be between the two chambers, rather than between the government and the Senate. The chart that is set out on page 152, which provides a flow chart of the committee's recommendations, is a chart which I hope that the Senate committee responsible for this particular area will identify and consider. If it has problems, perhaps we can enter into some discussions on those and see whether we can try to overcome the whole question of the imprecision which, in its present words, section 53 produces. I think this report does provide a basis for a compact. The chapter 13 identification of the components of it is an excellent basis; If there are problems, they are, demonstrably, for us to resolve. Section 50 of the constitution states: Each House of the Parliament may make rules and orders with respect to ... It very much embraces the idea of this compact. So we have the power to do it and we have the capacity to do it. I only hope the Senate has the will. constitution at the 1891 convention and the conventions of 1897 and 1898 spent a great deal of time debating what roles, respectively, the House of Representatives and the Senate should have in relation to finance. . The result can probably be expressed in two broad propositions. The first is that bills imposing taxation and providing for expenditure of public funds should originate in the House of Representatives and should not be amended by the Senate. This preserves the financial responsibility of the House of Representatives.",166,Representa Tives Main Committee
288,Mr Williams (Tangney) (12.33 P.m.),"The founding fathers who drafted the AustralianMC 1918 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 1995 Interestingly, this' principle probably had its constitutional origin in a resolution made by the House of Commons in 1678. The resolution was to the following effect: That all aids and supplies, and aids to His Majesty in Parliament, are the sole gift of the Commons; and all bills for the granting of any such aids and supplies ought to begin with the Commons; and that it is the undoubted and s.ole right of the Commons to direct, limit and appoint in such bills the ends, purposes, considerations, conditions, limitations and qualifications of such grants, which ought not to be changed or altered by the House of Lords. It is 1678 language, no doubt, but the similarity to the provisions of section 53 of our constitution is evident. The second broad proposition is that laws imposing taxation and laws effecting ordinary annual appropriations for government services should deal only with those subjects and, in the case of taxation laws, only with one subject of taxation. This principle protects the Senate from what is known as 'tacking': the addition of extraneous matters to a bill which the Senate cannot alter. This principle also has a relatively ancient constitutional origin in a resolution of the House of Lords in 1702. That resolution, which was somewhat shorter, in effect said: The annexing of any clause or clauses to a bill of aid or supply, the matter of which is foreign to and different from the matter of the said bill of aid or supply, is unparliamentary, and tends to the destruction of constitutional government. It is a noteworthy point that the House of Lords in 1702 thought that the technique of tackingconstitutional government and that is a point that is worthy of repetition now. The first proposition is to be found in more detail in section 53 and the second proposition is to be found in succinct terms in sections 54 and 55 of the constitution. At the time of the convention debates, it was recognised that disputes might arise. It was agreed that when the dispute concerned parliamentary procedures such as a matter between the two houses or a matter within a house, the courts had no role in dispute resolution. In order to highlight the distinction between matters which were for parliament to determine alone and those in respect of which the High Court might have had a constitutional role, the distinction was drawn in the language of the constitution between what were called 'proposed laws' and what were caIIed 'laws'. In section 53, dealing with the House's financial initiative, the expression used WaS 'proposed laws'. Somewhat anomalously, however, a distinction was drawn in section 54 and section 55 dealing with the protection of the Senate against tacking. The expression 'proposed laws' was used in respect of appropriation bills in section 54, but in section 55 the reference was to 'laws' imposing taxation. The result has been that sections 53 and 54 have generally been regarded as non-justiciable. It has been for the High Court to determine whether an act imposing taxation deals with the imposition of taxation only. Disputes have arisen from to time in relation to both section 53 and section 55. There were significant examples in 1993. The dispute in relation to section 55 occurred when the government introduced a bill which dealt with a range of taxing proposals including proposals to increase the rate of tax under the Fringe Benefits Tax 1986, the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1986 and the Medicare Levy Act 1986. This was plainly an attempt by the then Treasurer to deny the Senate's right to consider one subject of taxation in one bill uncomplicated by other",169,Representatives Main Committee
289,Mr Duncan,It's a wonderful phrase.,170,Representatives Main Committee
290,Mr Williams,"In the view of the House of Lords it tended to the destruction ofWednesday, 8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1919 matters, whether matters of taxation or otherwise. In the result, the government backed down and introduced a series of bills referred to by number as taxation deficit reduction bills. The Senate thereby preserved its privilege under section 55. The dispute that occurred in 1993 in relation to section 53 concerned the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1993. The Senate sought to make amendments to income tax provisions relating to deductions for expenditure incurred by life insurance companies in obtaining premiums which were excluded from the companies' assessable income. Another proposed Senate amendment sought to require taxpayers to pay instalments of tax earlier or in higher amounts. The Senate ultimately resolved to make requests for amendment rather than seek to amend the bill; but in doing so it indicated that it did not consider the request appropriate and it was not offering a final opinion on the effect of section 53. This action was in fact a catalyst for the referral to the legal and constitutional committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate of the subject of the interpretation and application of section 53, which is the subject of the report of the House of Representatives committee under consideration now. As it turned out, another difference of view occurred in relation to section 53 in 1994. This concerned the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1994. The Senate this time did make amendments, or purport to make amendments. On receipt of the bill from the Senate, the Speaker indicated to the House that there was doubt as to whether the Senate had the power to propose amendments rather than to request them. The House refrained from insisting on the Senate only making requests in view of the public interestA division having been called in the HoUse of Representatives.Sitting suspended from 12.42 p.m. to 12.55 p.m. start of the subject. I was dealing with. I mentioned that there was another difference of view in relation to section 53 concerning the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1994. The Senate this time did make amendments and the Speaker indicated to the House, when the bill came from the Senate, that there was doubt as to whether the Senate had power to propose amendments rather than to request them. The House refrained from insisting on the Senate making requests only, in view of the public interest in the particular legislation being properly passed. The two examples of section 53 disputes that I have referred to highlight the fact that disputes can arise frequently. They also demonstrate that the houses can, between themselves, resolve the differences by compromise. If section 53 were justiciable, that might not be possible because a court would be obliged to determine whether the requirements of the constitution had been complied with or not. That is not to say that it is to be totally excluded that a court might get involved in determination of the validity of the procedures under section 53. If a bill is non-contentious, it may not be of much practical consequence whether the Senate purports to amend the bill in breach of section 53 or whether, in compliance with the section, it requests the House to amend it. It may be otherwise if the bill is contentious. Where a request is appropriate, the Senate may determine the fate of the bill but not its form. Where the Senate has power to amend, it may determine the form but not its ultimate fate.",170,Representatives Main Committee
291,Mr Williams,"Before the suspension I was in mid-sentence, so I will go back to theMC 1920 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 March 1995 One issue considered in the report is whether the Senate could resolve any section 53 issues simply by requesting amendments instead of making them. That is not, in my view, consistent with the intention of the constitution. It has to be borne in mind that the actions of the Senate may be significant for the purposes of section 57, the double dissolution provision. In the report, this issue is actually considered. It is pointed out that, where a Senate request is not complied with, the Senate bears the responsibility of determining the fate of the bill. It may drop the request or veto the whole bill. The House may accept the request, even if it is of the view that the Senate could have amended the bill. We have a precedent of that in 1994. The contrary argument is that, if the Senate can amend the bill, it should not be able to request an amendment in order to retain its ability to veto the bill altogether. In that situation, it seems to me, and I think the report reflects my view, that it would be open to the House to refuse to consider the request and to return the bill to the Senate, requiring it either to amend the bill or to return the bill unamended. That course does not seem ever to have been taken. There may also be other implications in relation to section 57. If the Senate makes a request when it could amend, that may be considered a failure to pass the proposed law, thereby invoking or at least putting in train the double dissolution procedure. The question also arose in the committee's deliberations as to whether the Senate can press a request for an amendment to a bill. Section 53 provides that the Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting amendment, and the House may make any amendment with or without modifications. The pressing of requests is an issue which has not been formally resolved between the two houses, although there have been views expressed on the issue-and they are referred to in the report-by Sir Robert Garran, Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir John Latham. The House has never conceded the Senate's right to repeat and press or insiston'a request for an amendment in a bill which it may not amend. The fourth paragraph of section 53 permits the Senate to make a request at any stage. The view expressed by Sir Isaac Isaacs was that, once the Senate has made a request in relation to a particular issue, its power of suggestion is exhausted as far as that stage is concerned. The committee, in agreeing with that view, also agreed with the meaning attributed to 'stage'; that is, it refers to recognised stages in the passage of a bill through the chamber The effect is that a subsequent request relating to a matter may not be repeated at one stage, but at a subsequent stage. (Extension of time granted) The effect of this is that although the Senate has a capacity to repeat a request for the sa,me amendment more than once, it cannot do it more than once at the one stage in the proceeding of the bill through the Senate. , Anoth-r potential issue arises in relation to section 57 in that the pressing of a request by the Senate could constitute conduct on the part of the Senate constituting a failure to pass for the purposes of section 57. In his contribution to this debate, the right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair) referred to the financial responsibility oftheHouse. In my first contribution on the tabling of the exposure draft report in the House, I also mentioned that subject. I pointed out that it is ironic that at a time when a House committee is seeking to identify and protect the financial initiative of the House of Representatives, the House seems to be giving away any responsibility in relation to the financial scrutiny of government. In the, recent 22-year period, there has ,been a dramatic decline in the time devoted by the House of Representatives to the main appropriation bill. An average of 60 hours was spent Wednesday,8 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MCl921 in each of the 10 years prior to the Hawke government being elected. In the first 10 years of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments, that average time diminished to 36 hours. The second reading debate time went down from approximately 65 per cent of the time in the first IO-year period to 47 per cent of the time in the second 1O-year period. In 1993, the total time spent on the main appropriation bill was a mere 27 hours and some minutes. The bill was guillotined through. The committee stage at that time was guillotined in a way that, for significant departments, only six speakers could speak at an average of five minutes each. That was the sum total of the contribution of the House of Representatives to the scrutiny of the budget of those departments. In 1994, the picture was similar in respect of consideration in detail. The total time spent by the House on the main appropriation bill was a mere 24 hours and some minutes and only just over a quarter of that, six hours 45 minutes, was spent on consideration in detail. When we contemplate that the budgeted revenue was $109 billion, and the budgeted outlays were $121 billion, the amount of time spent on a dollar per unit of time basis is absolutely abysmal. SinceI am speaking in the Main Committee, I would like to repeat a suggestion I made in an earlier speech in the House, which is that there is scope for the involvement of the Main Committee in the consideration of the budget. The budget is now considered in the budget session. It is brought down in early May and then there are, at most, about four weeks projected for budget debate before the House rises at the end of the budget session. Given the legislative log jam that occurs at the end of any session-and it is no different in the budget session-time is not available for detailed consideration of the budget. The experience of 1993 was depressing for speakers-I suspect it was so on the government side as well as on the opposition side. Only five minutes per department meant that the number of speakers and the range of their subjects in the 1994 budget detailed consideration was even less than in 1993. It is a matter that I commend to Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins and to the Procedure Committee for future consideration. I would also like to see some means whereby an estimates procedure is introduced in the House so that the House, which has constitutional responsibility for financial initiatives in the parliament, exercises its responsibility instead of abdicating it in favour of the Senate.
