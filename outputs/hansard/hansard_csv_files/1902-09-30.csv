Have Such Inquiries Been Made, And, If 80, Will The Honourable Gentleman Kindly Com","municate to the House the nature of the replies which have been received ? inquiries, but should have liked to secure completeness before presenting theinformation received to the House. As. the honourable member told me of his intention to ask the question to-day, I will give him a condensation of the information now at my disposal. It has been derived from official and semi-official sources in South Africa, and from South African, English, and other newspapers. The official statement is that there is no demand! for persons seeking clerical or 'professional employment, or positions in the military, police, or constabulary. Men who enlist in the military in South Afric a do BO at Imperial rates of. pay, and there is an overabundance of local applicants for positions in the police and constabulary. There is a slight difference of opinion as. to the prospects of unskilled labour, because of a proposal, which is in the experimental stage, to substitute white unskilled labour for native labour in the mines. The terms now offered are, I understand, 5s. a day, with what are termed ""quarters"" in some instances, and ""food and lodging"" in others. The semi-official, report on this head is that the outlook is unpromising, because an endeavour is afoot to obtain the services of 200,000 natives,'who,, it is expected, can be recruited at the rate of about 10,000 a month. If enough of them can be obtained, the unskilled white labour sought to be omployed in the mines, and practically the whole of tbe unskilled white labour in the country, will be unprovided for. No land is at present available for before the Crown land, or land under the control of the Crown, will be fit for settlement, and in other parts the land is awaiting subdivision. Skilled labour, according to official information, is in good demand, and from . semi official -sources. I learn that men of character and",14,Setup

Independent testimony from other sources, however, is to the effect that all the skilled labour likely to be required until the anticipated revival of prosperity occurs is already in the country. From 12,000 to 15,000 people are now in the coastal ports, awaiting permission to proceed inland. The permits issued by the Commonwealth at the request of the Imperial Government, although authorizing the landing of the holders in South Africa, do not give permission to proceed inland ; consequently, the coastal towns are congested. With regard to permits to proceed inland, preference is given first to old residents of the country, whether belonging . to the population lately in arms or to the loyalists, and, secondly, to those who have seen military service under the British flag; so that new-comers have to take third place. Hundreds of Australians have been waiting for weeks, and some even for months, for permission to seek employment inland. That is the gist of the information whioh I have received to date. I am still endeavouring to obtain an accurate estimate of the opportunities, if any, for Australians in South Africa. My present opinion is that there are none.

11,Mr Joseph Cook,"The Acting,as to the receipts and expenditure, I have employed three of the principal officers in each of the State Treasuries as my officers, instead of taking the whole of the Commonwealth Treasury work out of the State departments, as I might have done. From these officers the States Treasurers can derive all the information available, and, further, the officials in the transferred departments have instructions that every information desired by the States Treasurers is to be afforded them, even before it is sent on to me. The Premier of South Australia, in his Budget statement, made a complaint similar to that preferred by the Premier of Queensland. I 'wrote to Mr Jenkins, and asked him what information had been denied to him, and he said that all he had asked for had been supplied except the estimates of receipts and expenditure for this year. members will understand that it would have been impossible to allow the officers to give details of the Estimates for this year until they had been dealt with by the Commonwealth Administration and by the Federal Treasurer, who naturally alter them as they may think necessary to suit financial 1900-1.

W it h this exception, however, the fullest information afforded to the States Treasurers, not only by the returns sent to them every month, and by the quarterly statements showing the detailed receipts and expenditure, but by the officers of the various departments, who have placed every possible detail at their disposal. W it h regard to the statements which are being made as to the federal expenditure, and which are no doubt considerably injuring the Federation in some of the States, I will not say that they are made deliberately, but that they are uttered without proper inquiry in the States departments or at the Federal Treasury, where the fullest information is available. The cost of the whole of tbe transferred departments in Queensland in the year 1900-1 was Honourable £606,958, made upof £63,568upon Customs, £156,796 upon Defence, and £386,594 upon the Post-office. Last year the expenditure ' upon Customs was £62,039, upon the Defence£ 145,314, and upon the Post-office £ 4 0 4 , 8 9 0; making a total of £612,243, or an increase of £5,285. The tabulated statement is as follows :"" TRANSFERRED "" DEPARTMENTS IN QUEENSLAND INTUBYEARS 1900-1 AND 1901-2. (Figures are approximate.) Customs. Defence. Post Office.

In order to be absolutely fair it is necessary to say that the expenditure for 1900-1 included £7,663 for additions, new works, and buildings, whilst owing to the Estimates being passed late in the year, we spent under this head during 1901-2 only the amount of £1,022. There was, therefore, an excess of expenditure in the previous year of upwards of £6,500 upon new works and buildings. Against this, however, the amount for 1901-2 is taken from the Treasury figures, which are £8,000 more than the expenditure shown by the Post-office department, and this is probably accounted for by the fact that some of the arrears of 1900-1 were debited in the Treasury books to the year 1901-2, in consequence of arrears and current expenditure being included in one return. If this be so, the amount should be deducted from the expenditure of 1901-2 and added to that of 1900-1. If we add the £8,000 to the expenditure of 1900-1, the total would be £614,958, and the total for 1901-2 would be reduced to £604,243, but I have taken the Treasury, figures as the least favorable to 1901-2 . In view of this, therefore, it would appear that the expenditure in Queensland in connection with transferred departments is no greater, but probably a little less, than before the Commonwealth assumed control.

NOTE -The Expenditure authorized by State Appropriation Act for the year 1901 wasCustoms, £9,701 ; Defence, £25,866; Post Office, £97,414; Total, £132,981. These figures do not include Audit Office. Printing, and Repairs, amounting to probably £2,500, but do include £2,000 Aerial Cable. The difference in the figures I have given and in those used by the Premier of Queensland aiises from the fact having been overlooked that we had to provide in 1901-2 an immense amount of arrears which properly belong to the previous year. This was one of the consequences of adopting the new practice of closing down on the 30th of June instead of following the plan previously pursued in Queensland of waiting for three months later and debiting the expenditure to the previous year. W it h the permission of the HouseI should like to give some particulars of a similar character with regard to the State of Tasmania. So far as A^ictoria is concerned, I made a statement in the course of my Budget speech, and I gave the fullest details in order that the State Treasurer might check my figures if he thought Jit. In New South Wales the same difficulty arose, but the State Treasurer sent me his calculations, and I was able to show him where he was wrong. In his Budget speech he made these remarks-:I may also add that from my observations I have every reason to believe that the transferred departments are as well and as economically managed by the Federal Government as ever they were by this State.

NOTE -The amounts provided in the State Appropriation Act for 1901 were-Defence, £25,866; Customs, £9,701 ; and Post Office, £97,414. In addition, there was provision for repairs, & c , also for Printing, in other parts of Appropriation Act. It will be seen that the expenditure for last year included some items which were not embraced within the expenditure of the previous year. This year, exclusive of £1,100, provision which has to be made for compensation in connection with the Defence department, and for £11,000 which it is proposed to spend out of revenue, upon works similar to those previously constructed out of loan funds, the total expenditure will be increased to £141,153. Even if we expend the whole of that amount-and savings-the over the expenditure of the previous year. That is accounted for by two items, namely the increments, which have been given to the public servants, according to the practice which has been followed £4,037 for the cable subsidy, which now has to be wholly paid by Tasmania, whereas it was formerly divided amongst the States. I intend to forward all these statements to the States Treasurers concerned, so that they may be checked. show that the transferred departments are being worked as cheaply by the Pederation Sir George Turner. provided for the amount that was actually expended. In 1901-2, when we had control, the total expenditure in the three transferred departments amounted to £134,134.

I wish the committee to decide, as early as possible, whether the proposed expenditure upon in Tasmania, and new works, amounting to about £571,000, should be met out of revenue or loan moneys. If it is decided that we shall'not borrow any money it will be necessary to submit additional works 'Estimates, and to considerably reduce the amount proposed I contend that they to be appropriated. I should, therefore, be glad if some honourable member who is averse to borrowing would propose the reduction of the first item by £ 1 , so that we may have a test divisionwhich would indicate the feeling of the committee. approaching wonderfully close to the position of having a Ministry acting simply as clerks, and awaiting our instructions as to what they are to do. I know that a large number of persons think that it would be much better if Ministers were merely clerks -instead of being responsible administrators. They think that our political affairs would be very much better managed under such conditions, and it may be that the Government are quietly introducing that .system. The Treasurer had an ample opportunity of obtaining a decision from honourable members in connection with the LoanB ill . that because we did not then know the state of bhe finances for this year. the finances might be, bhe Treasurer musb have made up his mind as to whether or nob he wanted a Loan Bill, because he inbroduced the measure. If bhe question of introducing' a LoanB ill had been contingent upon the sbate of the finances, the Treasurer wibh his usual good sense would have refrained from bringing in a Loan Bill until he had ascerbained bhab ib was necessary. A Governmenb should always be in a position bo submib its policy in a concrete form before it asks honourable members, even in an indirect way, bo express bheir views. We are now asked bo participabe in a discussion which involves bhe reduction of a certain item by £ 1 without any definibe proposal on bhe parb of bhe Governmenb being pub before us. I have no desire ab bhis period of bhe session bo provoke unnecessary controversy. We are all anxious to finish the remaining public business at as early a dabe as possible. BubI would poinb oub bhab bhe course proposed-is rather an inconvenient one. I quite recognise that the Governmenb musb occasionally resort bo Loan Bills for some of bhe expendibure which will be incurred in bhe carrying oub of public works. The Treasurer, however, is adopting a course which I do not like, and which I am prepared to allow only in view of bhe general desire bhab we should finish during the presenb week bhe remaining business wibh which ib is proposed bo deal bhis session. I do not .wish to take up a strong position in regard bo any matter if I can possibly avoid so doing ; but I cannot refrain from pointing oub thab ib would be much more satisfactory if the decision of the question of whether or not we are bo pass a LoanB ill were deferred until that particular measure, was under consideration. If we are to adopt the course which has been proposed, I hope bhab bhe Treasurer, in order bhab we may have a fair opporbuniby of deciding bhe mabber, will make some shorb sbabemenb of his own views upon bhe subject.. made my Budget statement. ment and honourable members cannot be expected to carry all the details connecbed wibh ib in bheir minds. I do nob ask bhe Treasurer bo make a long speech upon this We could not do matter. I merely desire thab he should give bhe committee, in a brief way, bhe salienb figures-bhe amounbs involved, But whatever the state of and the services to which bhey relabe. I can assure him bhab ab bhe presenb time. I am absolubely in bhe dark as bo bhe brue bearings of bhis mabter. Seeing bhe enormous Cusboms revenue which we are now deriving, I am rather inclined to keep down loan expendibure as much as possible. A t the same time, I should be very sorry to commit myself to the view that we may not have to resort to Loan Bills in order to carry on our reproductive deparbmenbs. I sbrongly sympathize wibh those honourable members who desire to go slow at first, and to restrict as much as possible the bendency bo resort to loans, but I do not wish to ' bake a course An. opposition bo bhe views of bhe Governmenb upon this mabber unless I am very clear as to the facts. I think bhat ib would be to bhe interests alike of the Government and bhe commibbee if bhe Treasurer gave us just a few leading figures, indicating the works which he thinks oughb bo be constructed oub of loan moneys. The resulb of a deci-' sion upon a proposal bo reduce a cerbain ibem by £ 1 is a very clumsy mebhod bo decide whether or nob a Loan Bill is necessary, seeing thab honourable members mighb be very willing bhab some of bhese works should be consbrucbed oub of loan money. A besb vobe upon a motion to reduce bhis item by £ 1 will perhaps mean that none of the public works proposed are to be constructed out of loan moneys this year, whereas a majority might be of opinion that cerbain works might legitimately be so constructed.

16,Mr Reid,"That was a very long stateway of any course which the Government desire to take to expedite the transaction of business, but I hope that the Treasurer will recall to our minds the total amounts involved under each of the different services, so that we may know exactly what we are deciding, Sir GEORGETURNER LoanB ill was under consideration I placed before the committee the strongest reasons why, under the exceptional circumstances of the case, the Government should be granted permission to borrow a certain reasonable amount for a few years instead of taking-as my colleagues and myself would have liked-al l the expenditure upon works and buildings out of revenue. Nearly all the States have hitherto adopted the practice of constructing their buildings out of loan moneys. The difficulty with which we were confronted was that in only two of the States could the necessary money be taken out of their revenue, if we were to allow of their receiving a large return. I do not know that those States would be embarrassed if we took the money required for the construction of the public works which it is proposed to carry out within their borders out of revenue, but certainly they would have a sufficiently large surplus to justify the adoption of that course. In the other States the surplus was not sufficient to justify us in depriving them of large sums. During the present year we are proposing to reverse the practice of the States to the extent of £180,000. We propose to construct buildings out of revenueworks which in nearly all the States have hitherto been constructed out of loan moneys. When this matter was previously under consideration, honourable members were in doubt as to whether the revenue of the present year would not show such a very large increase as to obviate the necessity for floating a loan. It was to enable us to ascertain what were the real facts that the debate was adjourned and the financial statement made, before we decided the question of whether or not we should raise loan moneys. To my mind it is altogether a matter of expediency. If we can construct the whole of the works out of revenue, well and good, but I wish to impress upon the committee-as I did when I introduced the Loan Bill, and as I repeated in connection with my Budget statement-that , in my opinion, four of the States cannot afford to have the works proposed constructed out of revenue. That is my great difficulty. to any of the States? Sir GEORGETURNER Certainly, some of the works included in the LoanB ill W h e n the represent a very large sum. be informed of how much. Sir GEORGETURNER I circulated the B ill some time ago, but I will give honourable members the amount. the committee how much worse off some of the States will be if the whole of the works are constructed out of revenue as compared with the position which they would occupy after paying interest upon the loan proposed ? Sir GEORGETURNER The interest upon the loan would be only 3 per cent., whilst if the amount were taken out of revenue it would represent 100 per cent. 3 per cent, at the present time. Sir GEORGETURNER Yes , we can. the total amount'Original! j ' provided in the LoanB ill been reduced ? Sir GEORGETURNER U p to the present time. I have reduced it by £75,000, which was the amount set down for the purchase of switch-boards. The general opinion seemed to be that the money necessary for making that provision should be taken out of revenue. I have not provided the whole of the £75,000 upon this year's Estimates. I have, however, set apart a sum of £32,000, which would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the present year. The balance would have to be forthcoming next year. Assuming that the total amount of the loan is £575,000, it would be distributed as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £ 2 2 8 , 0 0 0 ; Victoria, £122,000; Queensland, £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 ; South Australia, £ 4 4 , 0 0 0 ; Western Australia, £ 4 6 , 0 0 0; and Tasmania, £10,000. If we are to adopt the principle that new expenditure shall be borne upon a population basis, the result will be that some of the States will contribute a larger amount than is expended within their borders. In Victoria, for example, the expenditure would be £122,000, but the contribution of that State would be about £180,000. If we are to construct these works out of",20,Additions Newworks Andbuildings

26,Mr Watson (Bland),"I do not quiteof revenue rather than out of loans would do well to pay some attention. The Treasurer stated that if the loan expenditure is vetoed by this House then the amount spent on the works must be considerably reduced. I do not see the force of any such statement. works are proposed only because they are necessary. If the majority of honourable members, in view of the fact that we have an estimated surplus of revenue over expenditure of some £915,000, decide that revenue shall provide the funds, they do not declare that works which the Government say are necessary shall not be carried out this year. Sir GEORGE that the honourable member does not deal with the individual States, but takes them as a whole. question from an Australian stand-point. has to be returned to the States. point is that from which I prefer to regard the question ; and, as a preliminary, I say that, so far as my vote is concerned,' while I am against loan expenditure, I am against any reduction of the expenditure on necessary works. I take it for granted that the inclusion of the works in the schedule is an admission that they are necessary. In view of tbe general .economical traits of the Treasurer, we know that he is not likely to assent to any works which cannot be shown to be not only necessary, but immediately necessary. over the whole ground of discussion, traversed some months ago ; but we may, at least, congratulate the Treasurer on the fact that, according to the Estimates, he proposes a considerable increase in the amount to be expended from revenue on works, a great number of which, I am sorry to admit, have always in the States been constructed out of loans. That is a step on which those who believe in such expenditure being made out of revenue may congratulate the Treasurer. That we cannot go to the extent the Treasurer now proposes in regard to loan expenditure is, to myself at any rate, a matter of regret. I must emphatically protest against the idea that while we have an enormous balance of revenue over Commonwealth expenditurea balance which we are entitled to spend in any direction we think fit for the Commonwealth as a wholewe should go into the money market of the world' or of Australia and borrow a paltry £500,000. The Treasurer points to the probable result that the States may be in the position of having a deficit as compared with the previous state of affairs; It is to be assumed that these but if the States have obtained their balancing of accounts only by charging to loan works which should have been charged to revenue, such balancing is not a fair criterion of the state of their finances. If the States can only balance accounts in that way, why should the people of Australia as a whole, while having money at their disposal, resort to loans merely in order to save the States Treasurers, who are responture, from the necessity of raising loans 1 Even if any action we may take in the direction of causing monies to be expended out I am looking at this' of revenue does compel loans, it is much better that the loans should be raised by those responsible for the expenditure, namely, by the States Government; and even The Australian standif we spend £570,000 out of the revenue which is still at our disposal for the ensuing year, we shall return the States-no t individually, but collectively-hundred s of thousands of pounds more than we are bound by the constitutional contract to return. In view of this fact, it seems in the last degree ludicrous to find the Commonwealth, at the inception of its career, with an overflowing Treasury, practically confessingto the world that we cannot find money to carry out extensions of the mere business undertakings we have entered into on behalf of the people. It is I do not wish to go repeatedly claimed that the Post-office is a paying commercial concern, andyet it is proposed to admit that we cannot find a paltry ±'500,000 this year in order to make the department more reproductive and more convenient to the people. That,' in my opinion, is a lamentable confession in the face of an estimated surplus of £915,000. thing is that the States have not overflowing Treasuries. which, as I have contended all along, we have no control. We are constrained to hand to the States three-fourths of the revenue from customs and excise, and if we do that our part of the bargain is fulfilled. Even if the £570,000 referred to be taken out of revenue, there will be between £300,000 and £400,000 handed back to the States Treasurers in exoess of the",22,Additions Newworks Andbuildings

The revenue will fall every day, and the people will not be able to bear severe local taxation. Already they are heavily taxed by the shire councils, municipalities, and divisional boards. It is folly to think of refraining from borrowing. It was considered to be good enough to borrow nineteen or twenty years ago for the purpose of erecting telegraph lines and plant, and it is equally wise to borrow for reconstruction only for a more modern plant which will last very much longer. A wise firm, or company, if it saw that new plant was necessary for which it was not able to pay out of revenue, would not hesitate to borrow money; and what a wise firm would do may well be done by this Parliament. able and learned member is supposing that what is to be borrowed is for reproductive plant, but it is not. new plant that is to be instituted is to take the place of another plant, and that is work which, to a certain extent, is reproductive. There is very much that I should like to add to what I have said, but there will be other opportunities. I have risen principally to dispel the idea that it is not wise to borrow such a sumas the Treasurer suggests. I am not in favour of what I may term a financial-piebald policy-paying for works partly out of revenue and partly out of loan money. No ; I go entirely for a loan policy on tins occasion. appears tome that this committee is attempting to do too much all at once. In the first place, this is a very bad time to start constructing expensive works out of revenue, and in the second place these estimates provide for a very substantial reform in the direction that many honourable members desire-that is, the construction out of revenue of certain works that have hitherto been paid for out of loan money. been in the habit of paying for drill rooms out of borrowed money, has she ? financial position of South Australia and the amount of revenue which will be raised the shortage which, according to the Treais problematical. We all hope that the surer's figures, is to take place at the amount will be greater than the Treasurer The Governend of the financial year, he proposes to construct out of revenue works to the extent of £20,000, which works hitherto would have been constructed out of loan money. That is a reform in a proper direction. But to say that in the case of every State the construction of extensive telegraph lines and other important works should be paid for out of revenue, would be a line of policy about which the States would have good reason to complain, particularly since they are now struggling to make both ends meet. It is all very well for the honourable member for Bland to single out a particular State and say that it has not done as much as it might have done in the way of the imposition of taxation. But other States have utilized nearly the whole of the sources of taxation,-and.yet are faced The honorwith a deficit at the end of the year.

During the last twenty years we have in Victoria borrowed about £15,000,000, and if the figures, as given by the State Treasurer are correct, then the whole of the £15,000,000 borrowed during the last twenty years has been absolutely non-productive, since it has not met the payment of the interest involved in the obligations incurred.

I do not know whether that limit has yet been reached in Australia or not, but the State Treasurer apparently believes that it has been reached in Victoria. If that is so, we are hardly warranted in adding to the burdens of the people of the States by imposing upon them additional interest charges for Commonwealth loans. for public works will they not be in a worse position ?

If we add to the borrowings, a future Commonwealth Treasurer will find himself in the same position, and increased taxation will ultimately become inevitable. If we can avoid borrowing at the present time, we may save State taxation to a certain extent. If we proceed upon a borrowing policy we shall inevitably hasten further taxation. I do not know that any one is anxious to add to the taxation imposed upon the people of Australia. I, for one, am not. I prefer that we should have each year's debts met by each year's revenue. That is the difference between spending money from revenue and spending money from loan. If our expenditure is defrayed from revenue, the debt, once contracted, is paid and done with.

97,Mr Glynn (South Australia),"I amfifteen or twenty years. It remains for us now to be somewhat consistent with the policy to which we gave expression in the local Legislature. Nor do I share the fears expressed by my honourable colleague as to the effect upon South Australia if we reject the proposed Loan Bill. I do not think there was very much fight in the Treasurer's speech upon this point. The right honourable gentleman seemed, in making the proposition, to be balancing all the pros and cons pretty fairly. H is speech was somewhat like a proposal of marriage made by some bachelor who was praying Providence all the time that the woman would reject his suit. as I could in the Budget speech. through. amount of emphasis may be given to political statements, if the speakers are exceedingly desirous that they should succeed in. what they propose; but I noticed a certain weakness and lack of warmth in that part of the Treasurer's speech in which he asked honourable members to take up the LoanB ill again. honourable member, Mr Poynton, as to the effect upon South Australia of throwing this class of items upon revenue, because federation has left South Australia pretty well off. The Treasurer's statement of last week showed that, after deducting the new cost of the federation in 1901, we returned to South Australia £35,000 more from Customs than that State received in the year prior to federation. In other words, that State really made a profit in that year as against the year 1900. B y deducting the per capita cost-and that is the way I take the Treasurer's speech, and I think his figures bear me out-fro m the total net revenue, there was 'still an excess of £35,000 returned in 1901 as against that State's receipts in the last year under the old regime. Sir come down to £13,000 this year. this year the excess comes down to £13,000, but it is still a profit in 1901-2 as against 1900, the year prior to federation. loss of £21,000 this year as compared with 1900. gentleman quite right in saying .that of 1902-3 ? I think he said there was a minus entry of £20,000 ; but we know that in the previous year, 1901-2, there was a profit of £13,000, and it seems to me that the new cost of federation this year, on a comparison with the Customs of 1900, will be something like £8,000 to South Australia. That is to say, allowing for increased Customs receipts, that the estimate for the current year will be only £8,000 as against an estimate of about £35,000 in the 1897 Convention. I say therefore that, no matter in what way we take it, federation has really left South Australian finances in a pretty sound condition. Therefore 'we are not called upon in a petty matter of this sort, an expenditure for all States of £500,000, to follow, at the I spoke as strongly very outset of our political life, the wretched ' example which the States havefollowed for t I read the speech the last twenty years. As regards the method I know that a considerable of apportioning this money in case we borrow it, I point out again that South Australia comes out pretty well in the transaction. If honourable members from South Australia will look at page 65 of the papers presented last week by the Treasurer, they will find that, of the £174,000 to be paid out of revenue for new works, an I do not share the fears of the expenditure of £20,000 will take place in South Australia, but her contribution per capita will be £3,688 less than that. There we have one example of the financial effect upon that State of the application of the principle of paying per capita in connection with expenditure from revenue. In other words, there will be during the current year an expenditure of £20,000 in South Australia as against a per capita contribution towards that expenditure by that State of £16,417. So that if we throw the whole of the public works expenditure upon revenue, instead of £174,000 of it, and apply the same principle to the whole, we in South Australia shall actually gain by the transaction, because in respect of our share of the total we shall pay less per capita than the expenditure necessitated in that State this year. member is speaking only of South AusI was going to say that tralia, because her gain may be our loss. to the effect upon our position, because there has been a good deal of unnecessary No ; there is a timidity displayed in relation to the State finances under federation, and a good deal of unjustifiable criticism against thepolicyof the I s the right honourable Federation, and its effect upon local finances.

104,Mr Glynn,"I am speaking merely asour own States, to submit a fairer representation of the effects of federation. As regards the method of debiting this money, if the loan should be floated, I think the suggestion of the Treasurer is a very fair one, and can be constitutionally carried outinstead of debiting the lot per capita, that it ought to be regarded as transferred expenditure. I know it is very difficult to say under what category some of this expenditure should be put; whether, for instance, switchboard expenditure should be regarded as transferred expenditure or new expenditure. "" transferred expenditure."" gentleman since the LoanB ill was introduced settled the doubt, as regards switchboard expenditure, by regarding it /as transferred expenditure, and throwing it upon revenue. B ut he can with the same liberal and fair construction of the terms of the Constitution regard, for instance, as transferred item 26 in the Loan Bill-construc tion and extension of telephone lines, and item 27 construction and extension of telegraph lines. culty is that those which we took over will have to pay on a per capita basis, while those which we are constructing now will pay on a revenue basis. any difference ultimately. Sir -States will have to pay on a per capita basis. There is very little difference between such an item as a switchboard and items 26 and 27 in the LoanB ill under the head of South Australia, because they can very well be said to be part of the maintenance of the department as it was transferred. Maintenance includes something more than what is ordinarily regarded as repairs. Even additions to the military force are regarded as maintenance, though I admit the construction that the additions might be regarded as new expenditure is a plausible and fair one. Where we have these points of doubtful construction, we ought to -adopt the wise, sensible, and fair policy, which is to regard the' item as transferred expenditure, because then the whole expenditure in the State-n o more and no less-wil l be debited to the State. We shall get rid of the in equalities which were pointed out by the 46 A 2 Treasurer when he said that if it were dealt with as new expenditure, some States would contribute more than the total expenditure therein. Ifi t is regarded as transferred expenditure, the matter is comparatively simple, because each State will then be debited with the exact amount spent therein during the current year. Surely we ought not to be afraid of spending £44,000 out of the revenue of South Australia. I should prefer not to go in for the expenditure at all just now than to sanction at the very outset of our career this pernicious policy of including in a LoanB ill some of these small items. We ought not to be afraid of casting on the revenue of the The right honourable current year a little additional burden to the amount of what is really urgent of £44,000, in view of 'the very much greater -question of setting an admirable example to the financiers of the States. Look at the question of our indebtedness which has been so well dwelt upon by the .honourable member for Bourke. According to the Treasurer, we have a public indebtedness of £208,000,000. The securities for this amount are the very assets that we are now going to mortgage again. Yes , but the diffiFederation has' not added a single acre of ground or a single persoaal asset, except in the way of greater efficiency from combination, to the sum total of the resources of the States.

Surely to go into the English money market at the very beginning of our career, and .to ask for a petty loan of £500,000 when we have a revenue of about £11,000,000 going to do that; it is to be a local loan.

We are actually .going to mark the value of our securities at 3^ per cent, at par, and I defy the Treasurer, at the present time in Australia, to get money at less than that rate. . It is an extraordinary thing that Canada can borrow money in England at about 2f per cent, at very nearly par. If we go there for a loan of £500,000-the sum total is made of a number of equivocal little items-w e shall be injuring the reputation for solvency and the good financing of the Commonwealth at the very start of its career, and we shall not get the money for 2 J per cent., or probably 3 per cent., at par, whereas if we borrow the money locally we shall be setting up a value of our assets or security, which is measured by the interest we shall have to pay. State loans also 1 upon them. Let the federation wait until it is asked to offer a loan of three, four, five, noticeable that the position we have now or six millions to convert State debts, or some clearly reproductive outlay for which revenue is inadequate. Doing that will be evidence of something which will attest our solvency, which will increase bur reputation for solvency, because it will relieve by reconversions some of the burden, of State interest. We ought to be most careful not at the very outset to decide that the States are in such need that small sums of £10,000, £15,000, or £20,000 cannot be charged against the revenue of the current year. The whole of the amount need not be spent in the year. The Treasurer said in his speech that about £500,000 was the total sum which he expects to spend. If that is so, the burden will not be cast on the revenue of this year ; it may be spread over two years. Surely it is within the competency of the Treasurer to arrange such expenditure as .will throw only two-thirds, or perhaps half, the burden on the revenue of the current year. If/that is done the States will not feel very much the burden of the greater responsibility. I ask honourable members once and for all to put their foot down, and say"" Unless the loan is one that is needed for conserving our finances or debts, or cannot possibly be So that we are going to avoided, we decline in the very first session of the Federal Parliament to set an example against which we have all been crying out in the States for the last five or ten years."" General) -The last speaker complained that the Treasurer did not press this proposal with the warmth which he would have exhibited on its behalf if he had spoken with a whole-souled devotion to it. I think it is much more desirable for him to exhibit frankly exactly the feeling he had, and tbe opinion he holds than to assume an enthusiasm which would not have been warranted by his feeling, or that of the Government. We are unable to put this forward as a proposal springing from those principles which we all hope will govern the future of Australia in regard to its borrowing. We admit, as much as any honourable member can do, that there has been much undesirable precedent in the matter of borrowing, which we do not seek to follow it not deteriorate and from which we hope to distinctly diverge. The borrowing policy may have It would have an effect had its day-it is unnecessary now to discuss its good or ill results. But it is reached is one in which the continuance of that policy is neither proper nor desirable. We have to initiate a sounder system of finance, and the urgency for such a change is furnished to us by the misapplication of borrowed funds in most of the States. One of the first principles upon which the people of Australia are likely to take their federal stand is that their borrowing shall be of the smallest possible total, and be devoted with the greatest possible circumspection to particular investments justifying a departure from what I trust will be the ordinary policy of the Commonwealth-that is, to meet out of the funds of each year the demands of -that year. Only for works of great size, character, reproductive nature and Australian quality, should borrowing be allowed. It ought to be regarded from the first as an indulgence, and should not form one of the regular elements in the financial proposals of Australian Governments: All are agreed, I take it, on those broad lines. It is impossible, even under the pressure of temporary circumstances, to propose with any degree of warmth to depart from those sound principles.

I do not even urge that it is expedient in the interests of federated Australia, consider federated Australia as something separate from the States of which it is ' composed. forward distinctly as in the interests of the States themselves, considered as units of the federation, with whose prosperity ours must always be bound up, and who at the present time are associated with us financially in a very special manner. It is not owing to any action or inaction on the part of this Parliament or this Government that we find ourselves unable as yet to dissociate ourselves from the special financial policies and particular financial interests of the several States. The Constitution has not yet united us in finance. It does not create a federated Australia. It leaves us financially only a confederated Australia. It provides for an elaborate system of accounts, under which each State receives only"" its earnings within its borders, and is made responsible only for the expenditure within its borders. Putting aside for the moment the extent to which all contribute for common federal purposes-the maintenance of this Parliament and Federal Departments, each State is ""still allowed to remain relatively independent. For at least five years, and possibly for ten years, the separateness of the States is preserved, and we are therefore obliged, not by the circumstances of the time alone, although they are serious, but by the very character and provisions of our Constitution, to deal with the States during that limited period differently from the manner in which we may reasonably expect to deal with them when it has expired. For the present each State is to remain financially on its own basis, and for the time therefore the Government submit as the proper and constitutional course for this Parliament that it ought to consider the States, not in the general fashion in which we shall always consider them, but in a special manner-in a special way in which we shall not be called upon to consider them when the time of transition expires. gentleman advises us to agree to this without prejudice. sibly for ten years, we shall be called upon to regard the interests of our constituents, not merely as members of the Commonwealth, but as citizens of their respective States, and in connection with the latter capacity, we shall be bound to consider if we could the condition of the States Treasuries, and to consult State policies.

In the present year Queensland is an illustration of a State to which less than three-fourths of the amount earned is being returned, and it may be considered to have a deficit upon the return popularly expected from the Federal Government. The real strength of our proposal arises from the fact that although there is a large sum to be returned to the States collectively, practically the whole of the money must be paid to twoof them, while the other four receive much smaller amounts.' If the proposed expenditure is treated as new instead of as transferred expenditure, and the works are paid for out of revenue instead of out of loan, two. of the States will meet it out of what may be called their surplus, while the other four will have another increase of their deficits.

We could then pay back to the States the money now expended out.of revenue, so that the proposal of the honourable and learned member would be legal and ultimately equitable. The proposal of the Government is not. based upon' the assertion of a legal principle, but the contention that it would be inexpedient, impolitic, and inconsiderate, if at this moment, when four of the States are struggling with financial difficulties, we diminished the return to be made to them by spending revenue upon works, instead of postponing the payment for them to a time when the States will have more or less emerged from their difficulties. The Government contend that their policy is justified out of consideration for the position of the States, and will be regarded by the T h a t is' true. But States Governments as a proof of our sympathy with their trials, and of our willingness to interpret the Constitution, wherever we reasonably can, so as to make retrenchment and taxation more gradual. The matter should be gravely weighed by honourable members. They must decide how far it is consistent with their obligations to their constituents to recognise that the Constitution provides for an interregnum in financial administration, and whether it is fair and reasonable to agree to a special policy for that period which need not be afterwards continued. honourable policy, for the Commonwealth to intervene with a loan, or for the States to levy taxation to make good their deficits ? position, because practically all the States Governments are about to increase their taxation and to retrench their expenditure.

Mr G. B . EDWARDS so. Constitution,, we look forward to borrowing, in the future we may regard, without apprehension, the present small proposal for the purpose of granting assistance to the four States which are in difficulties. The Gos'ernment concession to them is strongly recommended to honourable members on this ground alone, but it is also an expedient both proper and profitable. It implies a patriotic view of our relations with the States Governments. It would show to them at least as much, if not more, consideration than they are inclined to extend to us. We shall set the States a 'good example by proving to them that we are willing, in order to meet the exigencies of their case, to adopt a course diametrically opposed to the policy which we would prefer to follow. This loan would assist the States during the intermediate period forwhich they are still individually and severally responsible by lightening their individual burdens for the next year or two. This is to be accomplished by constructing, at the expense of the people of Australia, works which, if' carried out at the cost of the people of. the particular Statesi n which they are to be erected, would increase, the necessities for retrenchment and taxation. I hope, therefore, that honourable members will not lightly put aside the consideration that is fairly due to the States, now passing through a period of severe trial. am sure that some of the States will be very grateful to the Acting Prime Minister for his candid declaration as to the underlying motive of this proposal. He says that it is intended to tide the States over the intermediate period, until we can obtain absolute control over the finances of the A r e we, in guaranteeing Commonwealth. A t the end of the period we may dispense with borrowing, and construct public works out of revenue. In The borrowing powers effect the Minister says that the moment we can make some of the States pay for works to be constructed in other States, we: shall be able to dispense with borrowed money. Until then, however, the GovernT h e r e is in this Parliament propose to continue the system of borrowing in order to assist the States. Surely, if for no other reason than that stated, we should reject the proposal. The Acting Prime Minister says"" It is all very well to contend that these works No one has said should be constructed out of revenue. AVe believe that this is a sound principle, and If , under the Australian that we should depart from the old-time methods of borrowing money for the construction of minor works, but we have the smaller States to consider. A t present they cannot construct their own works out of their own revenue, but the time will come when we shall be able to appropriate the funds of the larger States for the construction of works in the smaller States."" The more honest course would have been to refrain from borrowing altogether. If the smaller States are in need of bequests from the larger States as indicated by the Acting Prime Minister, we might as well begin to pay for their works at the outset. The Minister has given the whole case away by his fatal admissions. The smaller States have not made any advance to us, but the Attorney-General assumes that they would be content to appropriate the revenue of the larger States. In this respect I think he is doing them an injustice. Prime Minister says that it is necessary to borrow in order to assist the smaller States until the Commonwealth can secure full control of the revenue. Then the works can be dealt with on a per capita basis. debited with the interest upon the loan money expended within it.

I have always been under the impression that loans could be raised very much more advantageously by the Commonwealth than by the integral States of the union. Indeed, one of the reasons why a large number of people voted for federation was that under it there would be an opportunity of funding the States debts, and thus saving a large sum of money in interest. Of course, that result could only be achieved if the credit of the that is undertaken the better. Commonwealth was greater than that of the States composing it. Mr G. B .

There is no reason in the world why the Commonwealth should not occupy just as good a position as does Canada, and it is only precipitancy in rushing upon the market for a small sum under unfavorable conditions that will hamper our future operations in the direction of funding the debts of the various States, and thus securing a large saving in the amount of interest that is annually sent by Australia to other parts of the world. Under the circumstances, it is well that we should pause. I do not think it is necessary that the States should go upon the money market to borrow. In those States where it is absolutely necessary that certain works should be undertaken, means will be found to pay for them out of the ordinary revenue.

I regret that Ministers have not given us that light and leading upon this question which we had a reasonable right to expect from them. The Treasurer, who is one of our most trusted public men, and upon whose judgment in matters of this sort we rely with the utmost confidence, has put a proposal before the committee, and has declared that he requires light and leading from honourable members, instead of imparting it to them. a proper attitude to adopt, because, although the Opposition has been charged with a lack of constructive ment decides that it is unwise to borrow, the Opposition is not in a position to indicate what measures should be introduced to enable the Government to carry out the public works proposed without the aid of loan money. The Opposition is not even in a position to submit a proposal for carrying out a certain section of the Constitution which provides for the granting of assistance to the States during the few years in which their finances may be embarrassed. That is why I complain that Ministers have given honourable members such very little light and leading upon this vexed matter. To a very great extent .1 think that it is a question as between the present generation and posterity; and although a certain well known writer has said-"" Hang WhatI say that this Parliament posterity to a degree that no future Parliament laying the foundations of the future, and if inconsiderately we adopt a policy of borrowing to carry out these somewhat insignificant works, we shall do something for which posterity will have good reason to curse us. I do not say that we ought not to borrow under any circumstances. I think that would be a somewhat narrow-minded view to adopt. But there is a broad distinction admitting that for certain national works requiring a very large expenditure we should borrow, and adopting the other extreme by declaring that for the construction of every work which will last longer than a year, we are justified in increasing our national indebtedness. afternoon, delivered, a speech which augurs well for the way in which he will grace the office of a Judge of the High Court when Mr 67. B. Edwards. that tribunal is established. A more judicial speech I never heard. He showed us the rights and wrongs of this question. He balanced them and exposed all the surround-, ing difficulties. Some of those difficulties are so great as to make me doubtful whether I ought not to support the measure pro-, posed by the Treasurer. I do not look at this question from the point of view of how it affects any particular State, but from that of how it affects the whole of the States. I admit that I have been somewhat grieved to. find that some of our financial operations are I do not think that is creating a certain amount of friction and difficulty in some of the States. On the other hand, we ought to be very careful lest ability, if Parliawe remedy those difficulties too easily, because, there are certain responsibilities connected with matters of finance which ought properly to be thrown upon the States as States. It will never do for this ParliaT ment to say to the States, "" We will meet all the difficulties 'which you choose to create,"" because by so doing we should only be accentuating, the weakest feature in our Constitution. . That feature is the provision that for all time the States Treasurers, in making their financial arangements, must be in touch with the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. It is one of the weak points of the Constitution that this should be so, and, in view of the fact, we are bound to take care that we do not in any way unnecessarily upset posterity. the financial arrangements of the States. has posterity -done for mel"" Consequently, when I come to a proposal to represents carry out certain works, which in the past have been defrayed by recourse to loans, I will represeut it. We are have to consider whether, in reforming the procedure, we may not be easting a great burden on the States. But, on careful consideration of the whole question, I have come to the determination that, for many reasons, it would, be far wiser for us to refuse to go. into the money market at the present time. First of all, I do not think it is necessary that we should spend this sum of £500,000 on between works. It is not at all likely that between, now and the 30th June next we shall spend even one-half of that amount, and, consequently, we need not make provision to. the extent now proposed. In the second place, it will be eminently disastrous to probable future financial operations of the The Attorney-General, this Commonwealth if we go into the money market of the world, or even if we borrow locally so insignificant a sum as £500,000, 1 and thus set, as it were, a low standard of our value. It is unreasonable to expect that such a borrowing will not prejudice any future financial operations we may be forced to undertake. shall bejustified in borrowing money for certain Government works such as the Commonwealth will ultimately have to undertake, such as railway construction and water conservation for the purpose of making some of our great rivers navigable; but I do not think that the items which the Treasurer has placed in the schedule-would justify borrowing on the part of even the States Govern^ ments, who in the past have gone further in this direction than the Commonwealthis entitled to go. The schedule provides for placing telegraph wires in tunnels, but this is only to replace overhead wires which are now discarded. Then provision is made for the extension of the telegraphs ; but this may be regarded as ordinary maintenance, and a similar remark may be made in regard to the switchboards which are to replace appliances which are) found by experience to be utterly unfit for the increasing requirements in growing cities. There are several other items which, I believe, in five out of the six States, where less consideration is given to such matters than I hope we shall give, would be objected to. But, apart from all this, it behoves us, in the early days of federation, to avoid a policy of borrowing quite as much as to protect the States Governments in the little difficulties which may arisefrom this expenditure being met out of current revenue. the Commonwealth would be utterly unpopular if it were found that we had plunged thus early into a policy of borrowing, at a time when the States are considering how enormous has become the burden of debt throughout Australia. Later on the Commonwealth will have to. comsider the question of consolidating the debts of the whole of the States. We shall also have to consider the takingover of the railways, and probably, the question of granting -financial assistance in some way tosome of the States whose calculations have been upset by the operation of federation. Under the circumstances, we can very well postpone borrowing until Ministers have had time and opportunity, not yet afforded them, of considering the broader questions of finance which must Inevitably arise. If we have to consider, as I believe we shall, the funding of I of the evils and errors of financing which the debts of the various States, we had better keep a "" clean sheet"" until that time arrives, and thus be enabled to go into the markets of the world with a better chance of obtaining I believe that we money on the very best possible terms. I do not believe that we should be bound by the current rates on borrowed, capital. I see no reason why, in the near future, the Commonwealth should not be able to borrow money at rates on a par with those ruling for British Consols. The security in Australia is ample. The leader of the Opposition pointed out the other day that most of our debt has been incurred for the construction of railways, the value of which, so long as they are well maintained, must increase from year to year. I do not think the British money-lenders, or money-lenders in any part of the world, would ever be afraid to lend money to federated Australia, so long as we-show in our financial operations that we are governed by reason and caution, and are determined to see that our present debt is not added to unless for the purpose of large national works. I am not opposed to borrowing, but I am'opposed to this proposed LoanB ill . I believe that for great national reproductive works we shall have to borrow, but the debt thus incurred should be looked upon as irredeemablea debt without a sinking fund, and not to be taken up at a future datea funded debt, which may be permanent, with the knowledge that we have a quid pro quo to enable us to pay the interest, and something more. Throughout most of the States ever? There is no virtue in having a debt. Mr G. B . EDWARDS I shall endeavour to explain the virtue of a permanent debt. If we borrow to-day at 3|per cent.,, with a minimum of £ 9 9 or £9S, we are, by renewing and selling at a price slightly under par-becaus e that seems to be the idea and object of financiers-con stantly adding to the debt, while not constantly adding to the securities. When we go in for a sinking fund and for redeemingdebts,, the circumstances are often made an excuse for borrowing for purposes which would not be contemplated if we had an irredeemable debt. Redeemabledebts are often an excuse for meeting, out of loans, expenditure which ought to be met out of revenue, and Treasurers often makeuse of sinking funds in the production of surpluses from time to time. In this way arisemany \ in the past have been exhibited in the",38,George Turner Ultimately The Loan On The Security Of The Very Same Assets

That justifies the handing of debts on from one generation to another, and the generation which receives a debt in this way feels justified in passing it on to its successors. But where the policy miserably fails, so far as Australian experience goes, is that many of the works get worn out or become obsolete, and have to be replaced by some better invention. pass out of being, and are no longer held as securities for the debts. of railways,, by keeping up the permanent way and renewing the rolling stock from time to time, we always have the value of the money buildings and some of the defence works, water conservation works, telegraph lines, telephones, and so forth, pass away while the debt remains for ever as a charge on posterity. It is for these reasons that, after carefully considering the troubles which may arise, I feel disinclined to support the Government proposal. I would rather go to the extent finances of some of the States than support a measure the effect of which will be to plunge the Commonwealth of borrowing which has had such disastrous effects on the separate States in the past. If it should prove necessary to grant financial assistance to the States, under the provision in the Constitution, I am quite willing that the surplus which would otherwise go to New South Wales should be reduced to some extent; should take, it is not for me to say. Some of the States that have suffered by the financial operations of the Commonwealth, or which fancy they have suffered, declare that they are not prepared to take charity-that case of lending money they might just as well borrow on their own account. Mr G. B. Edwards. If a work is of such a temthere are many ways in which temporary asit may exhaust sistance could be given to the States. Such assistance might in the first instance be granted out of the sums to be received by the larger States which are better off, and that money will ultimately be returned to them. If the works now proposed I see no reason why the embarrassed States out of loan money, and should not have more consideration than anybody has yet seemed disposed to give them. Under the Constitution we give conbut, as experience in the past siderable financial assistance to Western £20,000,000 Australia, an assistance which, I believe, is The principle which far greater than any one expected when the matter was decided at the Convention ; indeed, in my opinion, it is proving greater thanthe State authorities of Western Australia expected. could not have come into the federation without that assistance.

Personally, I am quite prepared to support any liberal measure for tiding States like Queensland and Tasmania over a few. years originally spent. But of difficulty. I would go further, and say that, even in the Federal Government, we have not gone as far as we might in the way of economy, in some of the States which now suffer, or appear to suffer, from the operation of federation in the transferred departments.

203,Mr Higgins,"I sincerely hope thabborrow on the security of the population, but on the security of our public lands and works. Australia we should be able to test the value of our public lands as a security. I would remind my honourable and learned friend of a story by Max Adeler, in which he describes a town, called Goldtown, that was raised in one of the western States. Upon the discovery of gold in the district a big rush took place. A t first there were tents, then houses, and then streets. Next there came a corporation and a mayor, and then the coporation began to borrow. They caused splendid bonds to be prepared, with the names of the mayor, aldermen, and councillors of Goldtown emblazoned amid big flourishes upon them. The bonds were sent to Holland, where they were eagerly taken up, somewhat at a premium. By-and-by, however, the gold gave out, every one gradually went away, and the only one left to pay off the huge debt due under the magnificent bonds was an old negro resting on a stump. If the State of Queensland is to follow the advice of the honourable and learned member for Brisbane, it will find that a blackfellow resting on a stump will be the only person left to pay. It is not safe, to go on borrowing unless the population increases. I might remind the honourable and learned member for Brisbane that the most progressive little country in the world is Japan. Of late years it has been called upon to meet modern conditions, but it has a debt less than that of Victoria, although most of its railways are public property. Sir railways are not public property. vately-owned lines, but, at all events, the Japanese Government do construct railways. Within the last 33 years they have paid off £11,000,000, although during that time they have had a. most expensive war. There is no war so expensive as a naval war, and some few years ago Japan had to go to war with China with a full equipment of ships. ence between the population of Japan and that of Victoria. such a large population, it has a very small public debt. between' the way in which the respective populations live.' Sir MALCOLMMcEACHARN The people If the population left of Japan are perfectly happy. up what I feel with regard to this proposal. I think first that' that organization should borrow which needs to borrow. The Government are doing a great deal of harm to the Commonwealth, in the eyes of public men and financiers, in proposing to bring down a B ill to provide for a loan of £500,000 when they have not even spent the income which they have in hand. Injury has been inflicted already, but we shall be injured to a still further degree if the B ill is passed. What a pawky, miserable, niggling thing ib would be if, after all the blowing and flourishing of trumpets which have taken place, the Commonwealth were to ask in London, or even in Ausbralia, for a loan of £500,000! Ib injures a body which desires bo raise money if ib begins to borrow in this niggling way. Secondly, I consider that the present is a distinctly bad time for borrowing. The Victorian Government recently borrowed money, and obtained only aboub £ 9 2 per £ 1 0 0 . obtained only £ 8 2 10s. was once a Victorian, and the borrowing happened a long time before he left this State. departure. ing in a small way is very injurious to outstanding.

216,Mr Higgins,"Yes . It is also saidexcept for great purposes. I take it that if we are to make a new departure, now is the best time to do so. I know very well that to say there shall be no borrowing is very hard upon those who have to struggle to make the State expenditure and revenue balance at the present time, but there is a greater consideration to put before us. In starting the Commonwealth we are instituting precedents, and we do not want to have it said that the first Parliament borrowed money for the purpose of putting down telephone wires between one'city and another. To any one who takes the trouble to look into the matter it must appear very bad to be talking of raising this loan when we have not spent our income. Such a person would say at once"" You have not spent the one-fourth of the revenue to which you are entitled."" able and learned member's argument, it would be a virtue to borrow £10,000,000, but a sin to borrow £500,000. would be a virtue to raise any sum. I have said that when we do borrow it must be because of some great pressure, and for a great sum. If it came to a question of national defence, we should be justified in borrowing to the very end of our credit, in order to be in a position to defend ourselves. We should not borrow except in extreme cases, and, above all,, we should not appear before the money market as making our first application for its favours in respect of a sum of £500,000. recognise the difficulties which this question, and which have been so ably stated by speakers who have preceeded me. But there is another difficulty which has been mentioned before in this House by otherhonorable'members. I refer to the danger of handing back too much money for State Treasurers to spend. What appeals to me most forcibly in connection with this matter is the fact that by borrowing this £500,000 we shall only have so much more money to hand back to the State Treasurers. mated that he will receive in revenue over and above the amount of money required for the carrying on of the Government of the Commonwealth, If this sum of £575,000 the former amount will have to be handed over, not to the people from whom it was 4G M collected, but to the Treasurers of the States. will go to one State. State in proportion, I am inclined to agree with the honourable and learned member for Brisbane .that we ought not to go in for new public works too hurriedly, but that we should for some time be content with the existing conveniences for carrying on the Government. I would remind honourable members that if this proposed expenditure is defrayed from revenue there will still be a sum of £340,000 to be returned to the States, and that will greatly tend to reduce the indebtedness of the two States which have been specially referred to. ' Queensland we are going to hand back only £7,000 more than the one-fourth. The honourable member is dealing with the Commonwealth as a whole, but this matter must also be considered from the point of view I have not said that it of' the individual States. for South Sydney drew attention to section 96 of the Constitutkm under which financial assistance may be given to a State. I presume that section was placed in the Constitution for some good purpose, and if it is ever to be operative, the present is a good opportunity to put it into operation. The Acting Prime Minister said we should wait until we are asked, but I reply that we should act when we see that there is a necessity for action. The States at the present (Grampians) I fully time are proposing means of their own by surround which to work out their financial salvation, and those means will not involve additional taxation upon the people. We shall be imposing additional taxation if, as proposed, we carry out these works from loan. are carried out from revenue. to the position of Tasmania and, Queensland, the two States most affected, in order to return them back £135,000, we shall have to return a great deal of money to the The Treasurer has estiotherStates-£228,00 0 to New South Wales, £122,000 to Victoria, and so on. It seems to me that until a real exigency for borrowing arises, we might very well carry out a sum of £915,000. necessary public works from revenue.

For many years we have done without a telephone between Sydney and Melbourne, which, it is estimated, will cost £50,000. We have a telephone system established in Melbourne, which has served fairly well, and I really believe that a little better administration in some of the departments would be of more advantage than new instruments. The States are trying to work out their own financial salvation without resorting to extra taxation, aud we ought not to encourage them by dependence on what they are to receive from the Commonwealth to return to the old lines of extravagance.

But I think we may well wait until we see that there is a greater necessity to do so than exists at the present time. So long as we have £915,000 of surplus revenue in the year, such public works as are here proposed should be constructed out of revenue. attentively to the debate, and in the last two speakers, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honourable member for Grampians, we have a legal man on the one side and a commercially-trained man on bhe other, recommending honourable members not to encourage a loan system for the Commonwealth. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne gave us a long, theo-retical speech to show why loans are objectionable. But we know, from our experience in the various States, that the cry of the people is that the -system ofborrowing shall cease. We have now also a commercially-trained gentleman like the honourable member for Grampians advising the committee most strongly against borrowing, because at the end of the year we shall have a surplus of £915,000 derived from revenue. The honourable member points out that this is nol the time to initiate the borrowing system. It is, indeed, remarkable that the Ministry, on a matter of vital policy, have not allowed the House to decide, by accepting or rejecting a Bill, whether the Commonwealth shall go in for a borrowing policy or not. They have practically "" side-tracked"" the House, probably because it is assumed that honourable members at the end of the session may be willing to be "" side-tracked ""' into discussing a matter of policy under cover of an item on the Estimates. I should think that is unparalleled in the history of Australian Parliaments. It may have been the practice in Victoria, but it has never been the practice in any of the other States. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports assumes that anything which is said against Ministers is a joke Responsible Government may be a joke to the honourable member, because, so far as he and his friends, are concerned, they T h a t difficulty will settle have governed this State irrespective of responsible Government. But it is not a joke to representatives from the other States, or to the people of Australia, to learn that the Commonwealth Ministry, instead of testing this question on a Bill as a matter of policy, The time may come when are sheltering themselves under cover of an item in the Estimates. Werei t not that after so < long a session honourable members are tired and are anxious to get to their homes, it is quite possible that this proposal would have been met by a motion of censure. I think that at this stage of our history the Commonwealth should not enter upon a borrowing policy upon the lines laid down by Ministers-;",46,Malcolm Mceacharn All Its A Sacred Breasure For Use I N Exbreme

It is cheaper and hetter for the Commonwealth to exercise thatpowertha'n to borrow money for the purpose, while the States are squandering money. '.No civilized country, with a population of 1,000,000 souls,-has ever expended so much money as did New South Wales last year £15,000,000. Surely the Commonwealth Parliament ought to take a higher stand than do the States Parliaments, and to stop the introduction of a borrowing policy. I wish that the LoanB ill were before the committee, so that the Government could be compelled to declare their policy. I shall vote for the amendment as a distinct protest against a system of borrowing money. I believe that the people of Australia are not prepared to add to the millions of State borrowings by sanctioning a federal era of wasteful expenditure. It is a small sum of £500,000 to-day, but in a year or two this Ministry or some other will ask for a loan of £1,000,000, and in federal politics, as in State politics, Ministerial supporters will be favoured with a lavish expenditure of public funds in their electorates. I think it is wise for the committee to oppose a system of borrowing. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -If I followed aright the Acting Prime Minister, I should say that the meaning of his speech was that he was hardly in favour of borrowing, but that in consequence of the position of some of the States, it is necessary to bring in a loan the . total sum proposed to be spent in Bill. .

I nified for a Commonwealth Government to think it would be extremely unwise for the talk of borrowing a sum of £500,000. I Government to attempt to raise a loan at the am not against borrowing for carrying out present time. I believe, however, that if the large reproductive works, but I am certainly principle were now affirmed that we should against the borrowing of small sums for conborrow, a great many of the items on structing that which we should either do which it is proposed to expend money would without or pay for out of current revenue. be omitted when they were reached. Queensland, which has been referred to so« they cannot do without the proposed exmuch, is doing all it can to put its finances tension, if the department is to be properly straight, for it is. contemplating an income tax. The land in that State is already pretty heavily taxed, and it is going to .be taxed still further. The position which any State would take up, if it had not a Federal Government to discuss the question of borrowing, would be to see in what way it could stop its expenditure. It is proposed to expend £150,000 on the erection of a post-office at Brisbane. I know Brisbane pretty well, and I cannot conceive what necessity there is for spending such a large sum there. The proposal now is to spend £25,000, and the additional amount required to complete the work is £125,000. Sir GEOBG E TURNER -If I recollect aright, they had that item on their own Estimates. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN I think that if the Queensland people were to consider their own interests, and not the fact that we were likely to borrow the money to enable them to erect these buildings, they would stop the expenditure in view of their present financial position. I shall not deal with the question of the extension of telephones and telegraph lines, which are revenue-producing. If I were in favour of borrowing at all, I should say borrow for that which is revenue-producing, but certainly not for that which is not revenue-producing.' I find that there are other items proposed in connection with telegraphs, amounting to £100,795, so that altogether a sum of about £250,000 will be spent in Queensland. Queensland for this year.

245,Sir George Turner,"-In Queenslandmanaged, and we cannot take the money out of current revenue. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN tainly they can do without some of the proposed expenditure. ""With regard to the items which are to be paid for out of revenue, I find that telegraph offices are to go up all over the country. One State is as bad as another in that respect. In N e w South Wales a number of buildings are to be erected-for instance, at Humula, Newbridge, Nundle, Woouona. The latter is the only place I know, and I see no necessity for any expenditure there. In the present state of our finances, we should not rush into this extravagance. If the money were proposed to be spent in my own electorate, I should take the same view. In New South Wales alone £13,500 is to be provided for sundry offices in mining towns. Again, in the estimates of the Defence department, we"" find many works which might be done without. Our proper course, I contend, is to reduce the items on which it is proposed to expend this sum of money and to pay for the rest of the works out of current revenue. MrM c CAY (Corinella) I must confess that I have a strong predisposition, apart from the particular circumstances of any case, to look with great suspicion upon loan proposals. I feel that if it were possible-and I do not know that we can say yet that it is not possible-for the Commonwealth to set out on its career as a nonborrowing community, it would in the end work out for the good of the people generally. However much may be said in favour of loan proposals of various kinds, the sanguine expectations formed in many cases are not realized. I have no sympathy with those who . object to the loan proposalsof the Government because they are so small. In comparing large and small loans the merits are prima facie on the side of the latter, and it is quite as dignified to borrow a small sum as a large sum. wealth were in question, the material welfare of the people would not be assisted by borrowing more than is absolutely necessary. On this occasion neither the remarks of Ministers nor the schedule of the LoanB ill afford sufficient justification for entering upon a borrowing career. I am quite aware that if the B ill is not passed it will be impossible to spend a large sum of money which might otherwise be profitably invested in certain works, but I prefer to believe that the result will not be so injurious to the States concerned as to make it impossible to abstain from borrowing. I recognise that C e r in some instances the works needed cannot be constructed out of revenue at the present juncture. The expenditure of the amount proposed out of revenue! in Victoria would add considerably to an already heavy burden, and to the troubles of the Government of the State, which has quite enough on its hands at present. I do not desire to be any party to forcing the States Governments to impost taxation of any kind. I desire that they should be perfectly free so far as that matter is concerned, and if we are to choose between borrowing and leaving the works undone, I feel that the matter is not so urgent but that we can afford in the great majority of cases to allow the undertakings to stand over for a short time. I think that the case in favoiirof borrowing has still to be made out; and,, although I recognise that certain inconveniences, which I regret, will attend our decision not to pass the Loan Bill, I shall votewith those who are opposed to that measure. Sir LANGDONBONYTHON (South Australia) I intend to support the Government proposal, but I must confess that I am not particularly enthusiastic about taking this course, because I feel that all the argument is on the other sideI have been for many years, and still am, strongly opposed to heavjt borrowing by the Australian States, but I feel that upon this occasion I must bow to the necessities of the Treasurer of South Australia. In the State which I have the honour torepresent we have been careful to draw a clear distinction between works which should be constructed with borrowed money and works which should be paid .for out of the revenue. In this respect we have been perhaps more particular than some other States. In South Australia, for instance, all replacements have been provided for out Even if the dignity of the Commonof the general revenue. In order to illustrate the care which has been exercised in this regard, I may mention that at the present time a splendid building-the School of Mines and Industries-is being erected in Adelaide at a cost of £35,000, and as a gentleman in South Australia was generous enough to contribute a handsome sum towards the cost of the structure, the Government decided that the rest of the money required should be provided out of the general revenue. In view of these facts it would be very improper indeed to make the Treasurer of South Australia suffer, by calling upon him to give up a large amount of revenue, which he urgently needs to meet State requirements. I gather from the tenor of the debate that the LoanB ill is not been devised, but some work to effect the likely to be carried, and I cannot say that I shall altogether regret an adverse decision regarding it. In such an event, however, I shall do my best to see that the general expenditure is so reduced as to mimimize as far aspossiblethe inconvenience totheTreasurers of South Australia and other States. There is something very attractive about the proposal to launch the Commonwealth on its career without resorting to borrowing. I should like to see that idea carried out if it were possible, but I do not regard it as practicable under present conditions. If all our revenues were pooled, I should be happy to assist the Government. to dispense with loans altogether, but some of the States are in a very awkward position, and I should not be doing my duty to South Australia if I voted against the Government proposal. If revenue alone is to be -available for the construction of new works, a large number, most of which, I think, may be regarded as of a strictly reproductive character, will have to be abandoned for the present. Some of these works are partly constructed, and, for the most part, .they are urgently neededparticularly those connected with telephone and telegraph extensions. Although these works would undoubtedly return a great deal more than the interest upon the outlay, South Australia could not provide .the money, except at very great inconvenience. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne drew a very attractive picture of the happy position in which we should have found ourselves if all our public works had been constructed out of revenue. We should have saved all the interestthathas been paid in years past, and we should have had no public debts. It would be idle to suppose, however, that-we should have been able to carry out our public works system upon anything approaching the present scale, or that the country would have been so rapidly developed if we had entirely relied upon revenue. .For instance, the Western Australian Government would not have been able to undertake the Coolgardie water supply scheme without resorting to loans. thoroughly tested yet; it. may prove a white elephant after all. may not be the very best that could have object aimed at was absolutely necessary, and in any case the cost could not have been met out of the Western Australian revenue, buoyant as if is. Many works which may not be directly reproductive are absolutely necessary to enable the business of the country to be carried on. I might point to the overland telegraph line from Adelaide to Port Darwin, which certainly assisted to an immense degree in the development of Australia. It would have been quite impossible for South Australia, or even for the whole of the States to construct that line out of their revenues. In view of these facts, it must be recognised that the speculations of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne have resulted only in the painting of a very pretty picture. It seems to me that the Government proposals are very reasonable. It is proposed to spend out of revenue £180,000 upon works similar to those which have in the past been constructed out of loan moneys. This is a step in the right direction. The items upon which it is proposed to expend loan moneys are for the most part telegraph and telephone extensions, . and these are justifiable'from a strictly reproductive stand-point. We could better afford to do without new buildings which are intended to replace inferior or inconvenient structures than to dispense with sufficient telegraphic and telephonic extensions. *It has been urged that the States which find themselves in financial straits can economise still further, but that does not apply to South Australia, because we have had our noses to the grindstone for ten or twelve years. The South Australian counterpart of the Kyabram movement in Victoria is not a thing of yesterday, but of many years ago. Retrenchment has been carried to an extreme point in that State. We might, by reducing the expenditure upon defences, provide a great part of the money required for new works in some of the States, but,, so far as South Australia is concerned, the saving would not be very large if the whole of her defence vote were cut off That State has been so close in her defence expenditure that the Federal",49,Malcolm Mceacharn All Its A Sacred Breasure For Use I N Exbreme

I am prepared to vote against every item in the schedule, where it is proposed to borrow money for work which is notstrictly reproductive, but I do not think we should go beyond that. This is not the time to stop all borrowing. Let us not kill the patient by heroic remedies to cure his disease. MrA . PATERSON (Capricornia) I am sorry to obtrude the position of my unhappy State upon the committee, but it appears to me to be necessary to do so. It has been suggested by some honourable members that Queensland is not reducing her expenditure to meet her altered-circumstances. But I do not think that any State in the union has set a better example in that respect. The Governor has voluntarily offered to accept a smaller salary, all other salaries in the public service have been reduced, and 500 officials have been disThat is drawing a red charged from State employment. It is clear, therefore, that Queensland is doing the best she can under the circumstances. MrA . PATERSON S h e levies a very No , but if they have stiff income tax. Leaving Western Australia, which has practically two Tariffs, out of consideration, I find, from the Treasurer's statement, that of the total revenue received by the Commonwealth New South Wales tralia 84J per cent., Victoria 81^ per cent., Tasmania 79 per cent., and Queensland 71^ per cent. The average return is 80 per I am proud that in cent. If Queensland received 80 per cent, she would get back £960,000, instead of £885,300, or £74,700 more than it is proposed to give her. Owing to her enormous territory, the cost of administration and collection is much heavier in Queensland than in other States. One cannot be surprised, under the circumstances, at the indignation prevailing there because of the way in which she is being treated, and she is likely to find that she has made a mistake in mortgaging T h a t is a very a glorious and sure future. The greatness of Victoria is in the past; that of Queensland is in the future. It is all very well for honourable members to say that they sympathize with the position of Queensland. No parent in New South They have now an opportunity to give practical evidence of their sympathy. If the Commonwealth does not assist her by raising a loan, and giving her a share of it, T h a t was the old she will have to go into the money market for herself. During the debate this afternoon it crossed my mind that some of the speakers are very much influenced by the words of a famous financial writer in London who rejoices in the name of Wilson, and who systematically holds up to contempt every Australian security. But if we compare the indebtedness of Australia.with that of England, what do we find? The national debt of England is something like £710,000,000, and the only pledgable assets she could give as security for that.",51,Malcolm Mceacharn All Its A Sacred Breasure For Use I N Exbreme

The total State indebtedness of Australia, excluding municipal indebtedness, with which the Commonwealth has nothing to do, is about £206,000,000, and of this amount £130,000,000 has been expended upon enormously productive works such as railways and telegraphs, so that only 1 £76,000,000, or less than £ 2 0 per head, has been borrowed for other purposes.

Arguments of an extraordinary character have been used during the recent debate upon the LoanB ill . The honourable and learned member for NorthernMelbourne pointed out how glorious our position would be if we had paid for our railways out of revenue. But if we had tried to do that, we should have had no railways.

PATERSON The only feature about the Government proposal which I dislike is that of going upon the market, for such a very small sum. But if we are to develop this country we must begin to borrow at some time. We cannot tax the people sufficiently to provide the necessary money to enable us to undertake reproductive public works, and the only way to develop our resources is by obtaining loan moneys for that purpose. I shall, therefore, support the Government proposal. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I am very pleased that the leader of the democratic party has moved to test this question. To me it is peculiar that the representatives of the various States, both in the States Legislatures, and in this Parliament, apparently entertain the opinion that we can do nothing unless we initiate a borrowing policy. I know men in private life who are We have paid away in inimbued with a similar idea. I was acquainted with a man in Adelaide who used to accost me regularly each week with a is precisely request for the loan of 5s. or 6s., until I began to think that he regarded me as a sort of ""grafter"" for him.

The other day I had a look at this disabled rolling-stock, and I can assure the committee that for similar maladministration a private railway company in the United States would have its manager in gaol. So long as we supply extravagant financiers with plenty ofmoney, they will not economise. There is an old adage which says that ""everything comes to him who waits,"" but I have noticed that the thing for which one is waiting never comes. The time may come-and perhaps it is not far distant-whe n the Commonwealth Government will have to render financial assistance to some of the States. There may come a period when the small States will not be able to go upon the money market, and raise sufficient funds to cover their indebtedness, and, if so, they will be obliged to ask the Commonwealth to keep them solvent. Sir not likely to do that. MrO ' MALLEY America. There certain States have had to approach Congress with a request for assistance. Congress has assisted them, but, at the same time, it has placed a curb upon them so that they could not borrow. The Australian States, however, can go upon the London market, and float loans without any restriction. Every second man one meets in London is there on behalf of ,some of the States Governments. Have the various States reduced the expenditure involved in the maintenance of their AgentsGenerals' staff since the establishment of federation ? Not a bit of it ! Have they abolished the offices of States Governors, and all the tin-pot paraphernalia associated with them ? Have they talked about reducing the emoluments of their Judges, who receive salaries of which ancient emperors and kings never dreamed ? Not a bit of it ! Yet the Treasurer and his eloquent colleague, the Acting Prime Minister, declare that we must not interfere with the States. We want to save them. I represent the smallest State in the union, and the one which perhaps has sacrificed most. But I wish to teach that State, as the Statei n Western America, where I lived, was S h e has assets in taught, that she must study economy-no t tomfoolery economy-and that she must throttle the extravagant, spurless roosters who are bringing her down to disgrace. L e t us look at another aspect of this question. Supposing that we allow these State gentlemen to continue their policy of ""borrow, boom, and burst,"" without interference, what will' be the result? Unquestionably, they will borrow, boom, and burst. Y e t we are told that we must not interfere with the revenue of the States-that we must go upon the money market and borrow as much as we can, whilst the States continue to borrow as much as they can. The point which seems to escape attention is that there is no new population coming to our shores. The real trouble is that the various States, when federating, forgot that the same people would have to pay the taxes. As a result, every State, just prior to the inauguration of the Commonwealth, started to pile up its military expenditure. In Tasmania two post-offices were established, which were absolutely unnecessary, because her people were under the impression that the expenditure connected with them would fall upon the Commonwealth. Similarly, ever\ seT cond man one met was looking to the ComI have seen it done in monwealth for an increase in his salary. It was thought that we were to have a Rothschild, or some of the American millionaires, at our back, instead of the people of Australia. But the same white-faced Caucasians have to pay the taxes, and they are , the people of whom I am thinking. We are determined to stop this loan business small as it is to-night. Three-quarters of the revenue derived from Customs has to be returned to the States, but one-quarter of it must be retained by the Commonwealth to enable us to carry out reproductive public works. The ""boodler"" must go. I will admit that the money which has been borrowed in this country has enriched a lot of gentlemen.

But we shall never obtain anything from the frozen-hearted, gilded, and spurless roosters of to-day until we force them to give it.

But before I go further I should like to call attention to a remark by the Treasurer, in reply to an interjection by myself, that a loan at 3 per cent, could be floated at par. In the present state of the money market I take leave to doubt that statement; and, if I am right, that is all the more reason why the Treasurer, though he might not put a scheme immediately into force, should have a proposal ready when the time is ripe. As I say, I am not one to shut my eyes to the difficulties which are being experienced owing to the unfortunate drought and the failure of sources of revenue I am thoroughly with the representatives of the necessitous States who have spoken to-night; and the committee should listen sympathetically to the claims which these gentlemen have advanced. This is not the' time-and I can say this freelyfor the imposition of fresh burdens on the people; at the same time, Queensland, lightly taxed as the people of that State are in comparison with the people of Western Australia, must have considerable resources up thedeficit. Queensland, where the B y a reduction of indifficulty is greatest, has ample resources which have not yet been availed of by the State Treasurer. AlthoughI have every sympathy with Tasmania, South Australia, and Queensland, the proposal of the Government to raise such a small sum of money is On l y as theyfalldue. calculated rather to damage than to enhance I am -not quite so sure our credit, and, on that ground alone, I do not intend to support the authorization of a loan. The Treasurer knows quite well that in Western Australia no loan is required for works in the Postal, Defence, or Customs departments. It is possibly no news to the right honourable gentleman, that since 1895, when £11,698 was expended, no loan moneys have been devoted to works connected with those departments. £46,000 out of loan moneys.

Another reason why, from the Western Australian point of view, the proposed loan is not wanted, is that that State, .by means of the federal Tariff, and also the Inter-State Tariff, is this year receiving nearly £250,000 more than was ever before received from customs and excise. In the year 1898 the amount collected in Western Australia from customs and excise was £906,831, in 1899 the amount was £S59,915, and in 1900 it was £976,410. The amount which the Treasurer proposes to return to Western Australia, if he has not absolutely returned it, is this year £1,225,000, or roughly £250,000 more than the highest sum obtained in that State from the same sources. Australia want with a loan ? It is proposed to expend only £46,000 of the proposed loan in that State. Australia does not require a loan, but we cannot treat the States differently. Western Australia does not require a loan, and for the reasons I have given I shall be obliged to vote against the proposal of the Government. we have learned anything to-night it is that there are a great number of honourable members who have missed their avocation, and who, as Treasurers, should be showing how the finances of the various States ought to be conducted. It appears to me that there is a conspiracy both inside and outside the House to belittle the resources of Australia. about our national debt, but not one word is said about our assets. We hear nothing of the great advantages which have been derived from the expenditure of public money; not a word is said of the thousands of avenues of labour which have been created, or of the fact that in London there could be obtained, inside a fortnight, a number of financial men to take over the whole of our debts, provided the assets were also handed over. long time. Mr. POYNTON ber has not heard that in this debate. Yet honourable members are crying out, as if all the loan money had been spent on powder and shot, a way in which the honourable and learned member for Corio would no doubt be willing to spend it. In my opinion, this is not the time to adopt the drastic reform which has been suggested, and I submit that there has been a want of sincerity in a number of the speeches delivered to-night. Does any honourable member take up the position of saying that there must not be any borrowing ? and learned member take up that position ? Does the honourable member for Coolgardie say that there must be no more loans ? more loans, how is the transcontiental railway to Western Australia to be conWhat does Western structed? I ask honourable members of the Opposition how they propose to acquire the necessary land and create the federal capital unless the cost' is met out of loan moneys ? How, without borrowing, are we to construct the works on the river Murray, which are expected to be The r e is no doubt that of great advantage to. Australia generally ? Simply because some of the States have a little more money than they want, very little consideration is being shown to other States, which every day we sit here, are getting deeper into financial difficulties. Some honourable members tell the States Governments that they ought to do this and that; but what are we doing 1 We are increasing the expenditure day after day. The Treasurer will agree with me that the financial position of South Australia is this year, and will be next year, very much worse than it was last year; and yet, in the face of There is one continual howl these facts, we have what I was going to call /a brutal majority, but which I shall content myself by describing as a heartless majority. the salt duty was under discussion. £62,000 is to be taken out of revenue for loan works. In addition, the revenue of that State is built upon a false basis, seeing that some £14,000 is realized from imported material on which duty has not been previously paid, and I am right in adding We have heard that for a that sum to the £62,000, thus showing £76,000 to come out of revenue.

Of course, the South Australian Government could make up the deficit, but it would have to be by reducing salaries, the policy which has caused all the noise in Victoria, and which is opposed by some honourable members who have to-night spoken against the loan proposals of the Commonwealth Government. It is idle to say that it is a bad principle to borrow a sum of only £500,000.' Perhaps if the sum had been £10,000,000 there would not have been the same opposition ; but it must not be forgotten that there never was a time when money was more wanted by the necessitous States. To say that these States must fall back on their own resources, and have increased taxation, is not the way to encourage a proper federal feeling. I am very much disappointed at the attitude of the committee to-night. If it were proposed to lay down a hard and fast line that there should be no more borrowing, I could understand the position ; but there is hot an honourable member who would advocate such a course. We know very well that the moment the transcontinental railway is proposed, Western Australian representatives will be in favour of borrowing money for its construction, and the New South Wales representatives would be in favour of a loan if it were intended for the purposes of the federal capital, although the latter discloses no such great necessity as I have indicated in connection with South Australia. I suppose it would be of no avail if I were to stand here all night and plead for the smaller States. A t the same time, I think honourable members ought to give more consideration to the position of South Australia, inasmuch as-and I am not demurring to this-the loan expenditure has been reduced by one-third, and the revenue called upon to bear the burden to that extent. All we ask is that for this year, and until we have better times, the Commonwealth Parliament will not put the States in a worse financial position than they are in now. one who has listened to this debatehas some fault to find with many of the observations which have been made by honourable members who have taken opposite views upou the question. Those who are so .earnestly in favour of the passing of a LoanB ill at this time for the services specified, while reproving other honourable members for observations that they think tendto disparage the credit of Australia, seem to me themselves to have fallen into the same error-of making it appear that the financial soundness of Australia depends upon this item. Both of these lines of observation are open, I think, to very grave exception. We ought always to remember, whatever the borrowings and the financial management of the different States may have been, that every one of them is absolutely sound and solvent. Some of us in Australia seem to think that the moment a shadow of trouble or strain comes upon us the end of our existence is near. Why, the average state of existence in other countries is at a much greater tension than we seem .to feel, even when the worse of droughts is cursing the whole continent. We do not know what trouble is in Australia ! We have no idea of the strain which is put upon humanity in the endeavour to live in other parts of the world. I regret that on both sides observations have been made which would do this country no good in the centres of financial operations, were it.not that every sound financier, wherever he lives and in whatever country he may be, knows, if he is tolerably well informed, as one of my honourable friends has said, that instead of our public debt being represented by destruction and shot and bloodshed, we have magnificent assets to show for it. But we must not forget that we have spelt the word "" Loan"" very largely in our political history in Australia, that we shall have to spell the word "" Retrenchment "" more largely than we have been accustomed to do, and that we shall have to spell the word "" Economy"" much more largely than we have ever had to do. So far as I am concerned, I think I have the very clearest course before me. It is one of the curiosities of our public affairs that one of the most important debates in which we could' engage in this Federal Parliament-in which we are supposed to settle a great principle-shoul d be on the question of whether we shall spend £ 1 5 0 of revenue on the construction of a new oat Harbor at Newcastle. That is one of the eccentricities to which our public business is reduced. If there were any necessity for this I should have no complaint to make. We all know that sometimes there is a necessity for this convenient course to be pursued.

We have a secretary expense by being able and willing to act as receiving £ 7 5 0 per annum, a chief clerk a messenger as well as a clerk. receiving £600, a chief accountant receiving £ 5 5 0 per annum, a senior clerk (also Friday last we failed to reduce the salary of secretary to Minister) receiving £ 4 5 0 per £ 7 5 0 which the secretary to the Attorneyannum, and a clerk and shorthand writer General receives.

As pointed out by the honourable member for Melbourne, there is a sum of £65 set apart for cleaning the offices of the public service commissioner, while, with the usual economy of the Treasurer's office, the work in that department costs only £56 per annum.

The work generally should be only a compilation from the census returns, unless the Minister, in his anxiety for economy, proposes to send around a number of men to collect new names. I do not wish to say anything about the votes for travelling expenses. The total is very large, because it includes not only the sum of £650, but items of £300, £400, and £1,500. I believe that we shall be perfectly safe in cutting down the vote for the department by £15,000, and I propose to test the opinion of the committee on the point. Sir WILLIAM mendation which was made by the Acting Electoral Commissioner was that a sum of £45,000 should be provided for expenses in connection with the introduction of the Electoral Act. I pointed out to him that in South Australia, Western Australia, and New South Wales there could not possibly be as large an expenditure as he anticipated, because' we shall use the State rolls to a very large extent, of course, with the concurrence of the States. All we shall have to do with the State rolls will be to group them in divisions. the estimate of £9,000 includes £4,974 for cost of printing rolls, £121 for advertising courts, Is. per day allowance to police in cities and towns, and 2s\ per day to mounted police in the country. gistration and administration cluded in the estimate. the estimate of £8,151 includes for cost of administration of printing rolls. There must be a branch of the service in that State for the purpose of collecting the rolls, because the work cannot all be done from one centre. In Western £7,746 includes the cost of holding courts, and printing. of printing the rolls has had to be increased, because we must have rolls in nearly all the polling places, in consequence of electors being allowed to vote at any polling place in a division for the House of Representatives. expenditure for South Australia is very low-£200 registrars-because, rolls will be used. In Victoria, the estimated cost is £17,000. figures for Tasmania. Queensland the rolls will have to be made ' up, because, there is no adult suffrage. It will cost just as much to get the Pederal rolls together there as it costs to prepare the State rolls, and that is why it is that those two large States will absorb £25,000 out of the vote of £35,000. from the census? Sir WILLIAM LYNE Yes , as far as it can be done. The roll will not be made until two years after the census was taken. In the meantime, the population may increase or decrease in various parts of a State. We cannot have a fair or reliable roll unless we can revise the State roll as LYNE -The fust recomwell as use the census. I have no desire to swell this amount. I took the trouble to go into the question, and I reduced the first estimate by £15,000. If all the money is not required, it will not all be spent, but we must not be left without money. The rolls should be compiled quickly after the Electoral B ill becomes law. When that measure is brought into operation the federal rolls will be found to contain a larger number of electors than did the State rolls in consequence of its liberal provisions in every way. I hope that honorIn New South Wales, able members will accept my assurance that this estimate has been cut down as low as possible.

MrM c CAY the Commonwealth comes under the term of "" other expenditure "" and is payable on a population basis. I think it should be kept down as low as possible. I confess that if occasion offers I shall use my pass, but I .never could see what justification there was for honourable members to have a pass over all the railways of the Commonwealth. I think that an honourable member is entitled to be conveyed all over his constitutency, and from the seat of government to his constituency and home. We should be very chary in incurring this expenditure, for the reason that a great many electors attach to it an importance which.to my mind is much greater than it warrants. the honourable and learned member ever took the allowance of £400 a year. He is too sensitive. MrM c CAY being personally sensitive upon the matter, but a question of how it affects the estimation in which this Parliament is held. I hold that the unwarranted odium which is caused to Parliament by an expenditure of this kind far outweighs the possible advantages to individual members, and that consequently we should exercise the utmost care in passing such items. learned member thinks that a Member of Parliament ought to know nothing about Australia. MrM c CAY Member of Parliament, either in the Commonwealth or in a State, expends a large amount of time in travelling over Australia or his State for purposes directly connected with his legislative work.

I am objecting to the proposed expenditure upon a special trip to Western Australia, because I think it is right that honourable members, unless they are travelling strictly upon legislative business, should pay their own expenses. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have listened to the speech of the honourable and learned member for Corinella with some regret, because he takes a very broad view of most subjects, and his speeches are listened to with great attention. If the honourable and learned member had to live in the It is a wonder that north of Queensland, or in Western Australia, and had to travel from those States to Victoria to discharge his parliamentary duties, he would find it absolutely imI t is not a question of possible to defray his own expenses. cost of conveying honourable members to and from Melbourne should be paid by the Commonwealth. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not quite understand the honourable and learned member on that point. He said, however, that an importance which was wholly unwarranted was being attached to this subject. I do not know what importance is attached to it in Victoria, but I know that in New South Wales-and I think also in other Statesit has been the practice for a great many I do not think that a years to pay a large sum of money for the conveyance of Members of Parliament and their wives upon the railways.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I. am speaking from memory only, but I believe that the cost of conveying school children over the railways represented a much larger amount. large sum of money is appropriated at the present time for the purposes to which I have referred. If it is right that honourable members should have every opportunity to become acquainted with the conditions existing in every State; now is the time that facilities should be afforded. A large number of honourable members are acquainted only with the State which they represent, and yet they are called upon to legislate for the whole Commonwealth. I feel, therefore, that it would be good policy for us to afford every opportunity to honourable members to visit during the recess any States with which they are not acquainted. saved to the Commonwealth by adopting this course than by compelling members to remain in ignorance of what is required in other parts, unless they are prepared to pay their own travelling expenses. more we spend the more we shall save. Sir WILLIAM LYNE lar case the more we spend within reason, to enable honourable members to understand the subjects upon which they are required to legislate, the better it w ill be for the Commonwealth. The expense involved will be a mere bagatelle compared with the amount which may be saved in connection with some of the items honourable members are called upon to consider, and it must be remembered that every year we have to deal with an increasing volume of work and a larger expenditure. I feel very strongly, also, that it would be niggardly on our part' to prevent honourable members' wives from going to and from any part of Australia. In most cases the free travelling of honourable members' wives has been confined to the one trunk line to and from the home, but I do not think that even this restriction should be continued, because no abuses are likely to occur. The money which we spend in this direction is being contributed to the railways of the various States. country. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is being kept in the country ; and it is not to be placed in the same category as that which is sent abroad for the payment of interest 1 think not. on loans. I am not interested in this matter personally, because I have used my own pass, and nothing more. The members of my family have nottravelled one yard on A t a l l ' events, a the railways at the public expense. I think, however, that it is highly improper that there should be any carping at the expense involved in bringing honourable members' wives from other States to Melbourne, when we consider the long distances honourable members have to travel, and the great expense -to which they are put. Some sarcastic remarks have been indulged in with regard to the proposal to afford facilities to honourable members for travelling to the various States during recess. I may mention that I have already received a telegram from Western Australia heartily approving of the proposal, and making certain suggestions with reference to it, and I More money will be know that a similar feeling will be evinced in the other States. of New Guinea are looking out for us. Sir AVILLIAMLYNE The amount voted last year was £10,000 ; but all that The has not been spent, because a balance of about £1,000 remains. Honourable memI n this particubers will, therefore, see that we have not spent the money lavishly. I propose, and I am sure my colleagues will agree -unles s the committee determines that honourable members and their wives are not to be permitted to travel free from State to State-to follow the course which'has been pursued in the past, and which was adopted fit my instance. after the manly, patriotic, aud generous address we have heard from the Minister, all opposition to these Estimates should be withdrawn. glad that the Minister takes such a liberal view of the proposal which I recently placed before him. The honourable and learned member for Corinella, and one of the daily newspapers of Melbourne, have referred to the proposal as another example of extravagance ; but I do not think they have fully considered the need which exists for affording honourable members opportunities to",64,William Lyne I N New South Such As He Refers To I Recognise That We

332,Mr Kirwan (Kalgoorlie),"I am veryacquaint themselves with the requirements of the Commonwealth. WhatI suggested, was that during recess honourable members who desire to visit Western Australia should be supplied with free passes by the steamers trading between Adelaide and Fremantle. I ' also mentioned that whilst I was in Fremantle a few weeks ago I saw the Premier, and other members of the State Ministry, and many other prominent citizens, all of whom were delighted at the prospect of seeing as many members of this Parliament as could visit them during recess. The honourable and learned member for Corinella, and other Victorian members, should remember that the representatives of all the States have to come to Victoria. During the eighteen months we have been here, we have had ample opportunities for learning all about the resources and requirements of Victoria; but honourable members have not had equal facilities for acquiring knowledge regarding the resources and needs of Western Australia. That State lies out of the ordinary track of most honourable members, and surely those who desire to visit it during the recess, should have every facility offered to them. It must be remembered that if the Government are true to their promise, the subject of the transcontinental railway from South Australia to Western Australia must be discussed during next session. be constructed out of loan moneys, I suppose. or not that work should be constructed out of loan funds was not considered in connection with the vote recently taken. Honourable members would probably take an entirely different view if a work of a distinctly national character were proposed. Honourable members have made extensive trips into New South Wales in order to discover the most 'suitable site for the federal capita], and I believe that the money spent in defraying their expenses was well applied. In connection with the transcontinental railway also, I feel satisfied that honourable members will be assisted in arriving at a proper decision if they have an opportunity of judging for themselves as to the progress recently made in Western Australia, and the absolute necessity for uniting that State by railway with the .other States. hope honourable members will agree to the proposal of the Minister, and that all those who can visit Western Australia will do so. I am quite sure they will receive a hearty welcome from the Government and the residents of that State. The expense incurred by the Commonwealth will not be very great, but the visit of honourable members will probably result in benefit, not only to Parliament, but to the State of Western Australia and the Commonwealth generally. Mr. WILKS (Dalley) As this matter has been brought prominently forward by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, I think it is only right that it should be presented in its proper light, and that the electors should thoroughly understand what a good bargain they have made. The Minister for Home Affairs says that there still remains in hand £1,000 of 'the £10,000 voted last year to defray the travelling expenses of honourable members. That proves in the first place that there has been no abuse. In the next place I contend that the amount set down is a very small sum for the conveyance of members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate to all parts of Australia. If the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella had been adopted, the cost would have been a great deal more. Personally, I have travelled 68,000 miles on the railways during the last seventeen months, and my travelling has been less than that of a few other honourable members. Surely the honourable and learned member.for Corinella would not ask those of us who live in other States to walk to our homes, or expect The question of-whether those who represent Tasmania to swim there ? I might point out to the Minister for Home Affairs that the right honourable member for East Sydney has Lord Howe Island in his electorate, but no provision is made for paying his travelling expenses there. Surely the Lord 'Howe Islanders might expect to hear an occasional address from him. Too much is being made of expenses like this. The public do not expect their repi'esentatives to travel all over the continent at their own cost. I shall not be able to afford to travel to other parts of Australia in the recess, and I certainly shall not travel for pleasure. In a long session such as this has been, most of us have had more than enough railway travelling, and are not likely to pass our time in railway carriages for our own enterI tainment. A railway journey may be a very pleasant thing to the honourable and",65,William Lyne I N New South Such As He Refers To I Recognise That We

334,Mr Kirwan,"learned member for Corinella, whose private residence may be in Bourke-street, or somewhere near at hand, but those of us who have to make long journeys twice every week view the matter very differently. I do not agree with the Minister for Home Affairs that members' wives should be conveyed free. It is, however, well that this matter has been referred to, so that it can be put in a clear light before the public to know, in regard to the amount of £ 5 0 0 which is put down for the compilation of the Seven Colonies of Australasia, when the publication of the work is to take place ? completed. The amount set down here was not expended last year, and is being revoted. of the New South Wales Parliament I used to receive a great deal of statistical information, which is not sent to me now. Will the work, when published, be posted to honourable members 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE out on a former occasion, the Seven Colonies of A ustralasia is a work which was formerly compiled by the Government statistician of New South Wales at the expense of that State; but, as the New South Wales Government was indisposed to continue the publication, I induced my colleagues to put this sum upon the Estimates to provide for the work being done by the Commonwealth. I believe that it is nearly completed, and the moment copies are ready they will be distributed to honourable members. ' the amount set down for railway travelling is a very proper one, and I trust that the committee will support it. I do not think that it is any too large. It would be a good thing for the Commonwealth if honourable members could make themselves better acquainted with the conditions of States other than their own before legislating concerning them: mier of Queensland was ver\' anxious that members of this Parliament should visit that State before passing certain legislation which seriously affected Queensland, and it has since been urged that had they done so that legislation would not have been passed. Similarly in the future we may be called upon to pass legislation specialty affecting, say, Western Australia or South Australia. A t any rate, honourable members will continually be asked to vote upon measures affecting States other than those which they represent, and it is, therefore, desirable that thejshould visit them. I do not think, however, that many of us will make railway trips for pleasure during the coming recess. Our expenses during the session have been so heavy that, if we include our election expenditure, they will not be covered by our allowances. Most of us, therefore, will have to devote the whole of our energy during the recess to getting back our lost incomes. I shall have nothing but commendation for the man who is so patriotic as to incur further expense in visitT h e work is nearly ing other States. Even if honourable members did travel merely for pleasure, they could not help deriving instruction and information from their journeys at the same I was a member time. I did not understand the honourable and learned member for Corinella to suggest that railway passes should not be given to honourable members. Perhaps if there had been no passes some of us would have been better off, because we should not have been As I pointed expected to travel here so frequently. The honourable and learned member only pointed out that certain expenses were being incurred which he did not quite agree to, and it was quite competent for him to do that. The amount set down for railway travelling is really very small, and I shall certainly vote for the item. think that it is of the greatest importance that the Commonwealth should have a statistician of its own at the earliest moment. The compilation of statistics affecting the Commonwealth and the States should be under our own control, and the information when compiled might be made available to both Commonwealth and States authorities. been discussed by the Cabinet, but it was considered that it would be necessary to pass an Act before we could do what the The Prehonorable member suggests. the passing of an Act should be necessary, but in any case, the arrangement should be made as soon as possible.

It will mean more expense to the Commonwealth, but it will result in savings to. the States, and, I think, bring about more accurate and complete compilation. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I have great sympathy with the Minister for Home Affairs in regard to the criticism which has been levelled against tbe item providing for the travelling expenses of members. If we listen to the Age and', the Argun in these matters we shall be coming here dressed as Adam was in the garden of Eden. They growl at every expense which is incurred by this Legislature, however necessary it may be. They want Members of Parliament to be clothed almost in the primitive fashion of ""Tiger Cat,"" an Indian chief, who was captured in Arizonai n 1885, and whose first question was"" What do they think of me in New York ?"" Here every little item in connection with travelling expenses has to be accounted for. Y e t a member of the United States Congress draws £1,000 a year, and is allowed £350 for expenses. Further, there is a B ill before Congress at the present time to increase that salary to 2,000 guineas. Of course, all this money is not spent upon the gilded-spurred, high-tonedroosters. Alittleof itisreservedfor the people. Did honorable members come here to be told that the veriest details of expenditure are to be set out in these Estimates? I have thegreatest respectandsympathyforthe representatives of Victoria. The deluge of nry compassion flows out to them, because when they rise to speak I always know that they have to dance to a certain tune. Sir MALCOLMMcEAOHAKN is very insulting. MrO ' MALLEY I will withdraw the remark and put it another way. When brother Jasper in Virginia was describing the electric telegraph to the scared negroes he said"" Well, brethren, if we had a dog long enough to have his tail here and his head in San Francisco, when I pinched his tail here lie would bark in San Francisco."" That is exactly the position here. The Age and Argus pinch the tails of the Victorian representatives in Collins-street, and they bark economy in this Parliament. gratulate the Minister for Home Affairs upon his vindication of the right of honourable members to put themselves in such a position that they will be able to legislate intelligently for the whole of the Commonwealth. When the honourable and learned member for Corinella was speaking I interjected once or twice with a view of discovering exactly the form of travelling expenses to which he objects. I find that he objects particularly to an alleged pic-nic by some honourable members who may wish to visit Western Australia. I am aware that the term "" pic-nic "" is applied to all travelling undertaken by members of this Parliament by a certain section of the Victorian press. A t the same time, I very much regret that that cry has been raised in this Chamber. I can assure the honourable and learned member for Corinella that the people of Western Australia will not regard any visit to that State by .the members of the Commonwealth Parliament as partaking of the nature of a pic-nic. They will regard it as a visit which ought to be made by every member of this Parliament who has not previously been in that State. My honourable colleague has alluded to the question of the construction of the trans-continental railway. A t a very early date we are hopeful that that subject will be discussed by this House. It is one which is very dear to the hearts of all residents of Western Australia, and I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that the hope of having that railway built was one of the principal reasons which induced Western Australia to join the Federation. Under tbe circumstances, it is only fair to expect members of this Parliament to discuss that question with some knowledge of local conditions. The representatives of Western Australia are perfectly willing that it should S u r e l y that be discussed absolutely upon its merits. But, I ask, is it possible for such an important matter to be debated in an intelligent way by people who have not. visited that State? If Western Australia were merely a barren desert, containing a few gold deposits here and there, there possibly might be some justification for refusing to undertake the construction of that line. But we are perfectly willing to allow honourable members to ascertain for themselves whether the",67,William Lyne I N New South Such As He Refers To I Recognise That We
342,Mr Fowleb (Perth),"I wish to condemand for its construction is a reasonable one-whethe r it is likely to prove a financial success, or a burden upon the Commonwealth. All that we ask is that honourable members shall be enabled to bring some local knowledge to bear upon the discussion of that matter. I will go so far as to say that if .this Parliament seriously objected to any expenditure which might be incurred in respect of honourable members visiting Western Australia, the Legislature of that' State would be only too glad to bear that expenditure. Mr G. B . EDWARDS -We cpuld not allow that. will be sufficiently seized of the justice of the request to render it unnecessary for the State Legislature to bear any expenditure in this connection. think that the Minister for Home Affairs should be very grateful to the honourable and learned member for Corinella for directing the trend of the debate from the real subject at issue. Personally, I do not intend to lose sight of the main feature connected with these Estimates. I want a good deal more information than has yet been given in respect of a number of items relating to office fittings and furniture.

370,Mr Mahon,"In view of the expendiobtained from the States departments. MrM c DONALD ment was being organized there was no need to get officers at these expensive salaries, seeing that at present there is not a considerable amount of work. Sir WILLIAM LYNE gentleman's pardon : the officers have more work than they can do. MrM c DONALD further information as to the amount of work. Whenever an attempt is made to reduce estimates in the way proposed, honourable members are told that the officers have more work than they can do; but when popular feeling is expressed it is generally ascertained that not only are the men not overworked, but that a considerable number can be dispensed with. It is simply ridiculous to think that the officers in this new department are overworked, but if they are they should be paid smaller salaries and more men should be engaged. It is quite evident to me that it is the men with the small salaries, and not those at the head, who do the work. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy to go uncontradicted. I am sure that had the honourable member known what work is done in the department by the officers he has mentioned he would not have spoken of them in the way he has done. I altogether differ from the view taken by the honourable member, and hold that the best policy is to pay men reasonably and make them work well. The officers in this department do their work efficiently, and are not paid salaries that are too high. Except it may be in the small States, it is scarcely possible to find a similar department in which such low salaries are paid. of extravagance in the States. Sir WILLIAM LYNE member has said that when there is a public outcry, it is usually found that the men are not overworked, and that it is easy to reduce their number; but the little outcry I have heard through the press on one or two occasions has not affected me in bhat way On the contrary, I have found thab bhe officers in bhis deparbmenb work very hard, as is shown by bhe facb bhat during bhe lasb six or eighb monbhs bhey have worked until eight and ten o'clock night afber night. I hope honourable members will not take the view that the proper policy is to pay officers such salaries as W h e n the departcompel them bo live in a condition of genteel sbarvabion. I have always held bhab bhe best officers are obtained when in return for good work they are well paid, and I hope the item will not be I beg the honourable reduced in the way proposed. Indeed, if the amendment be adopted, I do not know how I shall be able to carry on the I should like some deparbmenb. Honourable members forgeb bhab bhe Home department is probably the largest in the Commonwealth, and has the most subjects to deal with. A.nd, further, ib musb not be forgotten that we are not dealing with one Stabe, bub wibh bhe whole of bhe Commonwealbh. Thab makes a vasb difference in bhe volume of accounbs and papers which pass bhrough bhe deparbmenbin bhe course of the bwelve months. All bhis bends to make the departmenb appear large, bub I am sure honourable members will bake my word that there is no extravagance, and that the officers do their work well and creditably for salaries, which cannob be described as boo high. When bhe officers do bheir work earnestly and efficiently, we should I cannot allow sband by bhem and see bhat bheir salaries are nob reduced below a figure on which bhey can reasonably live.

372,Mr Mcdonald,"There is a good dealthat of the chief accountant to £400, and that of the senior clerk to £350. It appears to me that when the department was established due regard was not paid to economy. The secretary should be a man qualified to supervise, but all the others I have mentioned do mere clerical work. In my opinion, the clerk who is paid £ 2 5 0 does just as important work as that done by the chief clerk with £600. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I think it is too much to ask the committee to reduce this division by £2,000, though there is some reason for the comments made by the honourable member for Kennedy. It is essential that the chief man should be paid a good salary, but I do not see the necessity for four or five clerks at the high salaries here proposed. However, it is difficult to get really good men, and the Minister must have the best, men obtainable. am anxious to be as careful as possible in regard to expenditure, but if we adopt the amendment we shall be proceeding in a haphazard fashion. We shall not know who will suffer by the reduction, and it is possible that the very men whom it is desired to serve may have to bear the brunt. We agreed to these salaries on the last Estimates, and should not attempt to deal with them in this way now. I quite recognise that if vacancies occur, the Government should be careful about making fresh appointments. The honourable member f *>r Kennedy will not pretend that he knows anything about the duties which have to be carried out by the officers of the department. He can only make haphazard suggestions. I am anxious to reduce expenditure, but we should know the consequences of the votes we give. It is unfair to attack salaries in this random way. I would not be a civil servant under present conditions for three times the salary most of them receive. Either the Minister in charge knows the requirements of his department, or he has no right to be in his present ! position. To take off £2,000 without knowing the effect of the reduction would be to -let in a way that is anything but statesmanlike new appointment. There is an anomaly in support a motion to reduce these Estimates by £2,000. The. arguments advanced in regard to some of the salaries paid should rather be directed towards the removal of the Government from office, because if we cannot trust the Minister, who is responsible, and should know how much every officer is worth, he should be shifted. That is the logical course to take, not to reduce the Estimates haphazard by a lump sum without knowing whether the officers are worth so much money or not. The only comparison we can make which will throw any light whatever upon the present position is to compare the department with any great banking institution in Australia. Do honourable members mean to say that no chief accountant or chief clerk in any banking institution in Australia receives £600 or £ 5 5 0 a year? The suggestion is absurd. The chief men who control the business of these great institutions are highly-salaried officers. Mi'. McDONALD But some of them have to control £8,000,000 or £10,000,000. whilst this department spends less than £100,000. deals not only with money, but with other very important matters also. A really good man in this department could save his own salary on a few transactions. ment ought to do that. ment is the responsible Minister, and if he cannot be trusted to see that the men who receive these salaries earn them, the proper course for Parliament to take is to shift him. It is not true economy to make reductions such as are proposed. agree with either of the last two speakers. The honourable member for Melbdurne Ports says that because we have previously discussed these salaries we should not criticise them again. If that contention be correct, it is -of no use to bring these Estimates before the committee at all. There is one new position in these Estimates, and that is that of senior clerk and secretary to the Minister. Sir WILLIAM LYNE The salary was on | the previous Estimates, but to save ex| pense the money was not paid. connection with some of the departments.

379,Mr Salmon,"I thought this was aofficers in other departments. No doubt there has been a great amount of work to do in the Home department, but surely the work done by the accountant does not exceed that done by the accountant in the Treasury who has to check the accoumts of all the other departments. countant to the Treasury is to receive but £420, whilst the accountant to the department for Home Affairs receives £550. Then, again, the Chief Clerk of the Home department receives £600 a year, whilst the Chief Clerk in the Treasury receives little more than half, namely, £335. Is the work more arduous in the Home department than the Treasury? I do not think so. . In the abserce of any specific statement from the Minister that the Home department officers have more work to do of a more intricate character, requiring greater ability, experience, and industry, my opinion is that there should not be these differences between the officers in respective departments. It is ments are not overmanned, and that the quite right that the Commonwealth should pay good salaries. The Commonwealth service should be the cream of all 'the services of Australia, and we ought to get the best men, but should exercise the greatest possible discretion in respect of the number of officers employed. That is where the great danger arises. I am sorry to see the increase of numbers in some of the departments. The Minister has said that his department will, expand more than any other. I quite believe him, but I enter my protest against the multiplication of officers. Every honourable member is desirous of exercising the strictest economy in the Commonwealth offices. We have taken a great deal of trouble in framing the Public Service Act, which will soon be in force. A . Commissioner has been appointed to administer the Act, and I compliment the Government upon having selected a very able, painstaking and trustworthy officer to fill that position. I feel sure that the Commissioner is a man who cari be trusted to discriminate between a good and a bad officer. He will have power to make reductions in the number of officers employed if he thinks it desirable In New South Wales the Public Service Commissioner had very extensive powers in regard to reductions and the re-arrangement of offices'. Here he will have power to make a searching inquiry into every department, in order to ascertain what the officers are doing, whether the proper men have been appointed, whether the salaries being paid are too high or too low, and whether the departments are overmanned. When that has been done we shall be able to review Y e t the acthe whole position. then be varied. difficult for us to express an opinion upon the merits Of the various officers. We do not come in contact with these men. We have placed all the departments under the Commissioner, with a view to put an end to political influence, and to enable the service to obtain justice. I feel that we shall have to be content with the explanation that has been given, and I am more inclined to be satisfied because of the fact that I know an officer has been appointed who will see that the departsalaries are in accordance with the work done. It is very difficult for honourable members to bring about any reduction in the salaries or the number of officers. We have to depend to a large extent upon the report of the Minister, just as we shall have to depend upon the Commissioner's report. will be responsible. sponsible to us. Sir WILLIAM LYNE He will be able to make a re-adjustment of the salaries right through the departments. derstood. One of the strong reasons put forward for passing the Public ServiceB ill was that it would remove all officers beyond the power of the Minister. I merely mention these facts in order to show that in view of the explanation which has been given, it is impossible for me to vote for the proposed reduction. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I rise simply to point out that the papers put before us are somewhat misleading. It is true that they refer us to the fact that the expenditure shown for last year was for only a portion of the year; but, in looking over the Estimates for last year, I find that we voted £3,895 for salaries of the administrative staff. Therefore, the increase shown here is only £ 1 27 in excess of the sum which we passed on the last Estimates.",72,William Lyne I N New South Such As He Refers To I Recognise That We

Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN accounts for the difference. Upon, these figures there is nothing to criticise. roughly in sympathy with every effort to keep the expenditure, not only of this, but of all Government departments, within reasonable limits, but I think it would be a great mistake, on the plea of retrenchment, to sacrifice efficiency. some regard to the efficiency of the departments. The department under review is perhaps one of the most important in the Commonwealth. nearly all internal affairs, and, through the Public Service Commissioner, has largely the control of the whole civil service of the Commonwealth. Whilst it is most undesirable that the service should be overloaded, those who are charged with responsible dutiesshould be well paid for their services. To so reduce the remuneration that the services of the best men could not be obtained, would be a penny wise and pound foolish policy. A mistake made by a leading officer in charge of a large department like this might involve the Commonwealth in a loss of thousands of pounds. I happen to know some of the gentlemen who hold positions in this department, and who previously filled important offices in the States services. I consider that in appointing them eminently-suitable selections were made. I do not see anything in the item to which I should care to take exception upon the scoie of economy, nor do I think the department is overmanned. It has to do the pioneering work of organizing the whole service, and necessarily a very considerable amount of labour now falls upon the shoulders of these officers, which will hereafter be greatly reduced. It is very desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth that this initial work should be well done. Ifi t could be shown that the department was overmanned I should be prepared to support the proposed reduction, but from my own knowledge of the work, as well as from the arguments I have heard, I am convinced that the officers who have been appointed are necessary. It would be very unwise to sacrifice efficiency to the mere plea that we should keep down expenditure. MrA . PATERSON (Capricornia) -I am just as anxious for real econonty as is any honourable member, but we must no tsacrifice efficiency to economy. The amendment to T h a t reduce this amount by £2,000, is ridiculous. I am sure that the economists of the committee will completely alienate the sympathy of those who would otherwise be inclined to support them by pressing such a proposal. I should favour a reduction of £ 4 0 0 or £500, knowing that the Minister couldeasily re-arrange the department, so as to effect that change. Anything more than that, We should have however, would involve a sacrifice of efficiency. It would be of no advantage to the Commonwealth, and would act as a discouragement to good officers.
