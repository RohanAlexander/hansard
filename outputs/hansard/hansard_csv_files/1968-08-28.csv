Mr Speaker, it is my sad duty officially to inform the House of the death in London yesterday of Her Royal Highness Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. Princess Marina, who as we all know was aunt to Her Majesty the Queen and the widow of Prince George, Duke of Kent, had a particularly warm place in our hearts. With her charm, natural beauty and quiet courage she was, 1 believe, regarded with special affection not only in Britain but throughout the ComAll England Lawn Tennis Club for 25 years. monwealth of Nations. The youngest daughter of Prince Nicolas of Greece, she endeared herself to the British people on her marriage to the Duke of Kent in 1934. She at once took an active part in public life, travelled widely and showed a special interest in hospital and nursing work. The war robbed us of the pleasure of having Princess Marina in Australia as the wife of the Governor General. The Duke of Kent had been appointed Governor General but with the outbreak of war he became involved with military duties. Her courage and composure on the tragic death of her husband in 1942 in an air crash won admiration and sympathy, and despite her grief at her husband's death she bravely took over many of his interests and many of his public duties. Princess Marina was frequently called upon to carry out duties on behalf of the Sovereign. She made a Far East Commonwealth tour with her son, the Duke of Kent, in 1952, and in 1954 she toured the United States of America with Princess Alexandra with whom she also visited Canada and Latin America. In 1957 she was the Queen's representative at the independence celebramoved. Princess Marina had been a memtions of Ghana, and in 1966 she represented the Queen at the independence celebrations of Botswana and Lesotho. We were delighted to have her here with us in Australia in 1964. She came here for the British Exhibition and while in Canberra, as many members will remember, she declared open the headquarters building, Department of Defence, at Russell Hill. We also had the honour of entertaining her at a reception in this Parliament. When we think of Princess Marina we also think of her daughter, Princess Alexandra, who, reflecting in every way her mother's grace and charm, made her own memorable visit to this country. Princess Marina had other links with us. She was honorary Commandant of the Womens Royal Australian Naval Service and, of course, ever since the war years she was Chief Commandant of the Womens Royal Naval Service in Britain. And who can forget the films and pictures of Princess Marina, the tennis enthusiast, watching Wimbledon and handing over the trophy to the champion, more often than not an Australian? She was in fact President of the I think that even from these few vignettes it is clear why Princess Marina enjoyed such high regard and such warm affection. I had the pleasure of meeting her during her Australian visit and, like all who shared that privilege, 1 still have warm memories of that occasion. Princess Marina had known for months that she was suffering from an incurable sickness yet, as might be expected, she faced death in the same way as she had faced life, with that quiet courage and dignity that endeared her to us all. Mr Speaker, I. move: That an address to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth 11 in the following terms be agreed to: To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty: Most Gracious Sovereign: We, the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, have learned with heartfelt sorrow of the death of your aunt, Her Royal Highness Princess Marina. On behalf of your people throughout the Commonwealth of Australia, we express deep sympathy to Your Majesty and members of the Royal family in the loss which you have sustained. the Opposition)I support tbe motion of condolence which the Prime Minister has ber of our Royal family for more than half her life. When she married into it before World War II she created as much interest as was created when her cousin married into it after World War II .

3,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa,"Leader ofRomanov. The British Royal family has been durable throughout the last generation because its members have been identified to an exceptional degree with the people in peace and war. Princess Marina lost her husband in World War II. He was the first English prince to die on active service since the Wars of the Roses. She devoted herself to her sons and to her daughter who, like herself, is warmly remembered within our shores. She continued the very exacting round of public duties at home and abroad which falls to members of the British Royal family. The Prime Minister has very aptly and eloquently referred to the range of those activities as to place and time. Princess Marina contributed to a very great extent in her own right. She bad in a very real sense charm, grace and style. She had charisma. At this time we remember her own children and tbe family into which she married. I believe that all who ever saw or met her will remember her. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Death Sentence-Northern Territory certain members of the Portuguese community in Melbourne praying that the House of Representatives take any action necessary to assist in obtaining a commutation of the death sentence passed on Jose Manuel Da Costa. Petition received and read. Social Services certain electors of the Commonwealth praying that the Government implement Article 25"" of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by providing increased social service and housing benefits for the aged, the invalid, the widowed and their dependants. Petition received and read. to the Minister for Trade and Industry. Is there any truth in reports that the Government intends to invest between $30m and $40m in the British shipping company, Port Line Ltd? If so, what is the basis of the Government's negotiations with the company? Is it intended to operate ships of the Australian National Line in association with Port Line Ltd? will be going to Geneva in the very near future to lead the Australian delegation to the resumed International Sugar Conference which is of so much importance to Australia. While he is away he will be making some inquiries in London relevant to possible Australian participation in shipping. It will be known to the House that the Government is interested in entering into the carriage of some Australian goods in Australian ships, as has been evidenced by the arrangements made with the K Line to have an Australian ship operating in the Japan and British trade. That is simply where the matter stands. the Minister for Social Services. Has his attention been drawn to the public appeal at present being conducted in Victoria for the Aboriginal Advancement League? If so, will the Commonwealth Government give some support to this very worthy cause? worthy cause which has been supported by the Victorian Government. Money raised is to be used for the erection of hostels for Aboriginal children, for the maintenance of those hostels both in Melbourne and elsewhere, and for the training of teenagers to enable them to obtain apprenticeships and bursaries. The Victorian Government has supported this appeal, which I understand has amongst its patrons both Archbishops of Melbourne. I understand that the Victorian Government has allocated $10,000 for this purpose. The House will recall that in the Estimates now before it an amount is set aside for such purposes. When the Estimates are passed, I propose to ask the Prime Minister to allocate a matching grant of $10,000 for the furtherance of this very worthwhile public appeal. I hope that this evidence of both State and Federal support for what is a good project will lead to even",14,Death Of The Princess Marina

It would be a breach of the secrecy that should attend Party meetings for me to give information on what happened or to indicate in what respects the articles are false, but officers of the Department may be assured that they are not true. The reports in the articles of differences between the Prime Minister and myself are equally misleading. It is part of political life that stories get Kingdom run will be put into service as circulated, either to secure political advantage or to create a sense of drama, which give a picture of differences between Ministers. Officers can be assured that the picture given by the two articles in the ""Bulletin"" is false. I make this statement to officers of the Department of External Affairs because they have a natural interest in matters that affect their work or which question the value or acceptability of what ihey are doing. What has appeared in the ""Bulletin"" should not be taken as accurate, nor other articles of the same tenor which might appear in other publications.' I would only add to my statement that, as members on both sides of the House know, party meetings are private. Information about them can come only from either a pimp or the imagination of a journalist. I do not think either the stories of a pimp or the imaginings of a journalist are dependable evidence. Minister for Shipping and Transport whether an American shipping company known as Farrell Lines recently announced that it was building five container ships for the Australia-East Coast of America trade. Have British. Swedish, German and French shipping lines combined to form a container shipping conference to carry Australian trade to and from the United Kingdom and European ports? Is the Russian national shipping line pressing these overseas owned shipping lines for a portion of this lucrative container trade between Australia and Europe? In view of these negotiations and the bargaining by foreign owned shipping lines to carve up Australian shipping trade among themselves, can the Minister say whether the Government has given any consideration to building and operating container ships to carry a reasonable part of this country's European and American trade similar to the recent decision to enter the Japan-Australia container trade? If this important matter has not been considered can the Minister say when it will be considered? honourable gentleman's question related to developments in overseas shipping generally. As all honourable members will be aware, a number of new vessels soon will be introduced into the Australian trade. Container vessels operating on the United fiom March 1969. Thereafter an additional container vessel will be put into service at intervals of approximately I month. There is a general reorganisation of world shipping. In this situation of change it is not unnatural that the Australian Government should have an interest in developments. It was because of this interest that the Australian National Line entered into an arrangement with the K Line to provide a roll-on roll-off service to Japan. Honourable members will be aware that this service was negotiated with the Japanese Government late last year by my predecessor. Looking into the future, the Australian Government will continue to take an interest in developments in international trade. The announcement by the Prime Minister of the impending visit overseas of my colleague the Minister for Trade and Industry indicates the Government's continued interest in developments which might be of advantage to Australian shippers and the carriers of goods to Australia.

There will be about half a dozen such members. The Whip has the responsibility of deciding who will speak in the debate. He has exercised that responsibility but he has said also that those who do not get an opportunity to speak in the general Budget debate will have priority in the debate on the Estimates.

Is it a fact that Osta Chemicals (New South Wales) Pty Ltd recently mistakenly supplied the Canberra Community Hospital with washing soda instead of dextrose for use in the Hospital's artificial kidney machine? Is it a fact also that the mistake could have caused loss of life if the washing soda had been used in place of dextrose either in the kidney machine or for some other purpose, such as in the preparation of mixtures for babies' bottles? Is it a fact, too, that the company was fined $40 for a breach of the Therapeutic Goods Act? Does the Minister believe that this penalty was severe enough for such a serious case of neglect which could have caused loss of life? Will he consider tightening the law to help prevent such an error occuring again? answer to the honourable gentleman's question is: Yes, I shall consider the proposal. supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Riverina relating to the survey conducted by the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities, is addressed to the Minister for Shipping and Transport.

Services: Is it a fact that he will shortly be leaving for New York to attend a conference on social security? Is it a fact also that his absence may delay the introduction of legislation to give effect to the meagre improvements in social service benefits for age and invalid pensioners which are provided for in the Budget? Will the Minister give the House an assurance that he will return in time to. avoid, firstly, delay in the commencing date of the higher rates of benefit and, secondly, restriction of debate or the legislation and therefore curtailment of criticism of the Government's policy? Furthermore, will he consider doing what should always be done in these matters and backdate the new rates to lst July? honourable member that my absence overseas will not be as prolonged or as needless as was his absence from this country at a time when he came to be known as Dilly-Dally Daly. My absence will not in any way impede or delay the payment of the increased rates of benefit which this Government has proposed in its Budget. I shall attend a meeting of Ministers responsible for welfare in many countries throughout the world which has been convened in New York and which, I believe, will terminate on 12th or 13th September. I shall return immediately after the meeting, in time for the introduction of legislation soon enough for the new rates of benefit to operate from the earliest possible scheduled date. May I say that my Department is at present engaged on the work that is necessary to permit the increased rates to be paid without delay. the Minister for External Affairs about the dispute which seems to be continuing between the Philippines and Malaysia over the territory of Sabah. Js it possible for the Australian Government to offer to act as mediator in this situation, which could represent a danger to the area if the dispute develops? to report that there has been a very considerable lessening of the tension between Malaysia and the Philippines over the Sabah dispute. The two governments concerned are talking with each other from time to lime on this matter, and I can see no useful opportunity for Australia to be a mediator in this dispute. Already we have taken action to counsel moderation by both Malaysia and the Philippines. By reason of the fact that I was visiting both countries at the time when the tension was at its height 1 had the opportunity of speaking personally to the heads of government in both countries, and also to the appropriate Ministers, expressing our concern and the hope, too, that the two countries, with both of whom we are in the closest friendship and intimate association, should not come into conflict with each other. I believe that the counsel and the words that were spoken on behalf of Australia did have some moderating influence. Mr J. R.

Primary Industry aware of the fact that cotton farmers on the Ord River are concerned that they may not share in the bounty payable on the 1968 crop because they harvest their crop some months later than growers in the eastern States, who can supply all of Australia's domestic needs? Can the Minister say whether any action will be taken on requests made to the Government on this matter? Cotton Bounty Act has provided $4m annually for the sale in Australia of Australian produced raw cotton. This Act expires on 28th February next. We have not had a problem with the distribution of the bounty while there has been a deficiency of production to meet Australia's needs, but during the within their financial limits and responsibillast year of operation of this scheme Australian production has expanded to such an extent that there will be a slight surplus. It is possible that those who harvest their crop late in the season will not be able to share in the bounty. For that reason the Government has agreed to extend the present term of the bounty for another 4 months, to enable Ord River farmers to have the chance to sell their crop on the Australian market. ter to widespread concern amongst primary producers that compensation for devaluation losses on overseas markets will be limited to the one year. I ask: Will the Prime Minister give an unqualified assurance to industries such as dairying, fruit and others that genuine losses resulting from devaluation will be compensated for by the Government and that the undertaking given by the late Prime Minister, Mr reduce the work load on the teaching staff Harold Holt, in November 1967 will be honoured? Industry will answer that question. ing the Government has said that it would compensate for those devaluation losses which were unavoidable and demonstrable. It has announced that it will compensate losses for this year. As far as future years are concerned the Government will have to look at the circumstances then applying. to the Minister for Education and Science. I ask: In order to reduce the failure rate of university students, has the Minister given serious consideration to the need for universities to use closed circuit television on a much greater scale to replace those lecturers who may be incompetent? Are the qualifications of lecturers to teach seriously checked before they are appointed to the academic staffs of universities? able member should appreciate that he is asking a question about a matter in which the universities are autonomous and a matter upon which the universities do, ities, make their own decisions. I believe that in the great majority of cases the academic staffs of universities jealously guard the standards of appointment of new staff. The honourable member may he interested to know that at Sydney University and the University of New South WalesI have not been able to ascertain the position at other universities-close d circuit television and radio have been used on quite an extensive scale. The University of New South Wales began external courses using radio 10 years ago and more recently it has been using television. I think that it is the only university in Australia with its own radio station and television stations. From the end of this year the power of these stations will be magnified many times. This university has also extensively used closed circuit television for its own internal courses. I have been told by the university authorities that this does not in essence but that it does enable high quality staff to make contact with a much greater number of students, so that time which might have been spent in repeating lectures and that sort of thing is in fact spent on tutorials",21,Czechoslovakia

Minister for Social Services follows on a previous answer that he gave today. J ask: Is the Minister aware of a very commendable appeal conducted by the Melbourne 'Herald' to provide blankets to pensioners? In view of the desperate need of these people, will the Commonwealth Government consider making a contribution to this appeal? this appeal though, on the face of it, it seems good. I shall consider the matter. However, I do not think it is appropriate for such an appeal, which aims at a pubiic response, to be made directly in this Parliament. addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry. Is there anything in the proposed Government wheat stabilisation plan which in itself would cause a reduction in the first trick. It does not make provision for payment to wheat growers this year as compared with the first payment on deliveries in the three previous years? stabilisation scheme and the proposals that have been put forward by the Government do not include any provision for a set amount for the first advance payment to wheat growers. The Government determines annually what this rate shall be. For the past 11 years it has been $1.10. Normally the Government makes an announcement in October of what the rate will be. It has yet to consider the rate for this year. However, I hope to be able to Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed from 27 August (vide That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Whitlam had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'this House is of opinion that the Budget is inadequate in that it does not make provision: (a) to lighten taxes and health costs for families and to increase benefits for them, (b) to plan defence procurement and expenditure, (c) to meet the problems of Australia's capital and provincial cities, and (d) to retain control and promote development of Australia's mineral, fuel, land and marine resources'. the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) last week.

I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Bowman (Dr Gibbs), who was speaking in this debate rather late last night, say that the Budget indicates that we are on the verge of a new era in the field of social welfare. He said that it is a very exciting development in social welfare and is an example to the rest of the world.

62,Mr James (Hunter) [3.27],"I supportThe Government has failed to meet the needs of the needy for fear of offending the greedy or high income groups from whom it derives so much electoral and financial support. 1 refer to the privileged and wealthy section of the community. People in this section of the community have the most sensitive hip pocket nerves. They have a more sensitive hip pocket nerve than pensioners, the aged, the infirm and those in the low income brackets. Yet research would probably reveal that during freedom from hunger campaigns and when other appeals are made to the community, proportionate to their income, those in the low income groups would give more than people in the rich sections of the community. It is well known, particularly in the Newcastle area in the Hunter electorate, that when these appeals are made pensioners will contribute 10c or 20c because they know what it is to have experienced hunger and deprivation. The Budget provides a miserly $1 increase for single aged and invalid pensioners and widows with children. This is insufficient even to make up for the increase in the cost of living since the last miserly increase in their pensions. The Treasurer has automatically tabbed himself as Dollar Billthe only man who can tell people how to live in Kings Cross on $10 a week. In industrial areas such as the electorate which I represent, where employment fluctuates with local and overseas orders for commodities or minerals produced and where fear of unemployment is a constant nightmare, no increase in social service or sickness benefits has been made. Such an increase has not been permitted by this Government. 1 remind the House that some years have elapsed since the Government has seriously considered raising the sickness benefit or social service benefits. An unmarried person in the 16 to 17 years age group who is unemployed receives $3.50 a week. If girls of this age are unemployed the tendency, particularly in city areas, is for them to be forced into an immoral life of prostitution with the result that parafor almost the full old age pension and together sites like the late Joe Borg can amass a fortune of about $250,000. I am damned if I know why the Taxation Branch did not catch up with him while he was alive. Unmarried persons in the 18, 19 and 20 years age group receive a miserly sum of $4.75 if they happen to be out of work. This is disgraceful. I definitely think that the Budget is correctly tabbed as a go-stop BuugvC Every member of this House should appreciate that even the most thrifty of people in the low income group who mc out of work for 2 or 3 months take at least 12 to 18 months to recover. During the period they are out of work mental anguish is imposed on them. In many instances the breadwinner develops a sense of nobodyness. This is one of the reasons for an increase in alcoholism. Many peopie turn to drink to forget their worries and problems. The wife and children of an unemployed person suffer. The wife in particular suffers as much mental anguish as her husband, or even more, because she has to face the tradesmen who come to the door for payment of food bills that accumulate. I know of many instances in which a boy's schooling has been interrupted Decause the father has not been able to afford to send him to high school as a result of temporary unemployment. The Government expects such a man to live on a miserly social service payment that it has not considered increasing in this Budget. The Government has apparently abandoned any idea of gradually abolishing the means test. I would like to quote briefly some of the gross injustices that have been imposed as a result of the means test. Le! me quote from a letter written by Mr J. P. Magnay, of Newcastle, who represents the Retired Police Association. He said: Sydney Mc Alister McLeod, now aged 78 years, retired in 1949 when the basic wage was £6.2.0. per week. He is a widower and is in receipt of superannuation payments of S24 per week. He has no other income and has to pay his own medical and hospital costs and full council rates on the cottage in which he lives and owns; full bus and rail fares, etc. He compulsorily paid 4% of his salary towards superannuation over the whole of his police service. His brother, a retired railway driver, also a widower, under the old railway superannuation scheme, could not pay more than 51c per week towards superannuation, and received about $12 per week railway pension. He is therefore eligible with his railway pension is in receipt of $23 per week. He is therefore eligible for and receives; free medical, hospital, dental and optical benefits, rebate on rates if he owns his own home, transport concessions by bus and rail and also periodic rail passes as aretiredrailway employee. Yet supporters of the Government have the temerity to rise in this place and tell us that this is a new era of social welfare. I do not know how they can say this without their consciences being pricked. It is ob""ious cial travellers and the like are able to claim that they have no conscience. I want to make some mention of retired people are in a higher income group than mine workers, many of whom are constithe unfortunate men who have had to tuents of mine. They have to pay heavy change their employment due to changes in medical costs. Although they retire at 60 the coal mining industry.

The Government gradually to abolish the means test. As I could well have increased the welfare grant said earlier, the Government has had the to the Joint Coal Board. The Government has promised tax deductions for expenses incurred in travelling to work.

TheseI have in my possession letters from the Commonwealth Officers temerity to describe this Budget as introducing a new era of social welfare. The Government has again failed to bring conscientious and honest men, but some of them are the greatest rogues that the community can produce. We want more doctors of the type of the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham). I congratulate him on his forthright and honest speech in this House last week. It was a credit to the Australian Labor Party and a credit to his high and rich principles. I was disappointed that the doctor on the Government side of the House, the honourable member for Bowman (Dr Gibbs), did not follow the example set by the honourable member for Capricornia. Recently a constituent of mine received increase the maternity allowance has been a medical account for $180 for a minor completely overlooked. Is it any wonder operation.

64,Mr James,"As the honourable member It is my belief that the main causeThe greatest contribution the Government can make is to help the States to overcome the rapid rise in motor accidents. I think you would agree with me, Mr of the book 'Living with Asia', which was Deputy Speaker, that if the figures were taken out they would show that, since the new expressway between the Hawkesbury River and Wyong has replaced the old twisting road, the number of serious and fatal accidents in this area has fallen to an extent that is amazing. The expressway was built as a result of the actions of the present answering a question, which was asked by Leader of the Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament, Mr Pat Hills, when he was Minister for Highways. If the toll of the roads is to be reduced, the Commonwealth Government must take some practical action. It must give more money to the States so that the States can build highways and improve rural roads. The Government has continually failed to meet the urgent need to give more aid to the States to improve roads in rural and urban areas. The Government, under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act, requires the States to spend not less than 40% of the money it grants on roads in rural areas other than main roads. This imposes on the States a burden that they cannot carry. I was surprised to hear the answer given yesterday by the Prime Minister( Mr ing material sent by the South Vietnamese mission, Gorton) to a question asked by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren). It is no wonder that the members of the Liberal Party are getting fed up with the Prime Minister, as the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) pointed out last night. He has deceived the nation and the Parliament. Yesterday the Prime Minister made a misleading statement to the House. He is not unknown for this. I find myself restrained here. Order! If the honourable member for Hunter does not find himself a little more restrained, he will transgress the Standing Orders. Minister yesterday is not something new. Minister: He should be reminded that a half truth is no truth at all. He should also be reminded basing itself on its own observations made in the that there was a time when the basic truths US of America and the Republic of Vietnam, the of the scripture, such as the resurrection of Commission concludes that the Republic of VietJesus Christ from the dead, were either Geneva believed or rejected and such belief or military aid from the US of America in the rejection determined whether a person was absence of any established credit in its favour. a Christian. The words used yesterday by the Prime Minister were more or less a verbatim account of a passage at page 53 written by the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns). This is a magnificent book and it is accepted by all universities as an authentic document. BeforeI read from it, I will quote from the answer given by the Prime Minister yesterday. It appears at page 542 of Hansard. He was the honourable member for Reid and which dealt with Vietnam. It related to the invitation to the United States Government to send troops to South Vietnam. The Prime Minister quoted the following extract from a report of the International Commission: In examining the complaints and the supporting material, in particular the documentary material, sent by the South Vietnamese mission, the committee has come to the further conclusion that there is evidence to show that the Vietcong has allowed tbe zone in the North to be used for inciting, encouraging and supporting hostile activities in the zone in the South aimed at the overthrow of the administration in the South. The use of the zone in the North for such activities is a viotation of various articles of the agreement. He continued to quote the report: Having examined the complaints and the supportthe committee has come to the conclusion that, in specific instances, there is evidence to show that armed and unarmed personnel, arms, munitions and other supplies have been sent from the zone in the North to the zone in the South with the object of supporting, organising and carrying on hostile activities including attacks directed against the armed forces and administration of the South. Then the Prime Minister stopped. That is practically verbatim what appears on page 53 of Dr Cairns' book. But half truth is no truth at all. The Prime Minister omitted to read this statement from the report of the committee of the International Control Commission which was responsible for keeping peace in Vietnam after 1954, and in the Cairns book it follows immediately Taking all the facts into consideration, and nam has violated Articles 16 and 17 of the Agreement in receiving the increased",26,Wheat

Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, on this evidence I am fully entitled to accuse the Prime Minister of telling the Parliament an untruth, which you somewhat resented a little while ago. honourable member for Hunter carries on in this way he will be resuming his seal. The Chair directed his attention to the Standing Orders. The honourable member will not reflect on the Chair in any way. respect your high position. I am citing the facts, but if you are ruling against me 1 will cease to tell the truth to the Parliament. The United States White Paper on this matter also omitted to point out these other sections of the report of the Committee of the International Control Commission. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, due to the attitude you have taken I will have to curtail my remarks in that regard. I also point out that right from the inception of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war, the Government frightened the Australian people by saying: ' If we do not stop them there we will have to stop them in our own backyard.' When I was speaking one night the honourable member for Moreton( Mr develop in a way that is the envy of the Killen) asked me: 'Do you believe in stopping them here at Lake Burley Griffin?' I have never heard so much piffle in all my life. I refer honourable members to a publication entitled the 'Far Eastern August 1968. It is a conservative magazine. It is printed in Hong Kong for the information of businessmen. Under the heading 'Singapore' it says: Official statistics showed that Singapore's and Malaysia's rubber exports totalled 735,847 tons during the first 6 months of 1968, 123,000 tons more than 1967's corresponding period. The biggest importers were Russia (122,930 tons), United States (112,808), China (75,451) And China is said to be the great threat to the Australian peopleBritain (58,331) and Japan (52,255) If China is such a great threat in South East Asia and to Australia, it is a pity that Malaysia, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, is allowed to export this strategic material to China. I suggest that the Government has lied to the Australian people, it has deliberately misled them and it has instilled a fear into them hy telling them that China could be regarded as the ultimate threat to Australia. There is no possible threat from China because it has a great Army but it does not have a Navy or an Air Force. As1 have said previously in this Parliament, the real basis of the Vietnam war is international money. The war has been instigated by the war mongers so that they can enrich themselves. International finance knows no principles and it has no boundaries. support the Budget and oppose the amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). No budget in itself does all that individual members 1 would like it to do. The case is always made out that there are certain people for whom more should be done, and there are people paying taxes who would like to pay less. But the proper way in which to in sider the Budget is to look at it in its entirety. Over a period of time the Government has been providing more and more in the field of social services. The important point is that by its economic policy it has created a climate which has enabled this country to expand its economy and to rest of the world. One has only to leave Australia and to return to see what is happening in this country. Anybody who has moved around Australia, particular!* in the north and in the north-west, and who Economic Review' of 15th denies that amazing and fantastic development is taking place in Australia is simply not keeping up with current facts. This is very largely-nobod y would be so biased as to say 'wholly'-du e to the wise economic policy that has been adopted and maintained by this Government.

69,Mr Armstrong (Riverina) (4.561i,"innuendo. I want to draw the attention of the House to something that the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) said last night, and in doing so I take the opportunity of congratulating the leader of the nation on an excellent speech. The Prime Minister said that the Leader of the Opposition had been incorrect regarding one matter. I suggest that that was not the only matter in the speech by the Leader of the Opposition which was incorrect. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the moneys that are directed to the States and the moneys which are raised by the States for road purposes. He said that the States allocate more than 80% of the grants received under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act and more than 80% of their general road expenditure to roads in rural areas. Of course, this applies to all States. But it is interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition was reported in the 'Courier Mail' of 29th July 1968 as saying that 90% of Commonwealth roadsfinancewas spent on roads in rural areas and 90% of the road revenue raised by the States was spent in rural areas. If he were taken to task about this statement he would say that his statement in the House was quite correct because he said that more than 80% of the money is spent in rural areas. The fact of the matter is that in New South Wales, in particular, all revenue fiom licence fees, motor vehicle registrations and road maintenance contributions -that is the ton mile tax-is derived from within the State. Of this money, 20% goes to the County of Cumberland and 80% goes to the remainder of the State, which -includes Newcastle, Wollongong and all provincial cities and towns. The money is not spent entirely on rural roads. Of the money received under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act, 40% goes to non-classified roads largely in shires, many of which, incidentally, embrace towns, and some goes to urban councils and municipalities. The remaining 60% goes to the Department of Main Roads. Of this, 12% goes to the County of Cumberland which results in a figure close to that given by the Leader of the Opposition. The other 48% goes to country towns and cities but not to rural roads. This is misleading. I will be generous not quite on the same basis as that proenough to say that the Leader of the Opposition has been misinformed. I will say that NSW does not stand for Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong. It stands for New South Wales. This needs to be looked at in a sensible, reasonable and equitable way. The Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Sinclair) answered a question of mine today about the road survey that has been recently carried out. IfI may use an ungenerous word, this survey has been slanted very much in favour of the roads in the cities. The emphasis is placed on the high standard that is set down for rural roads but this standard, termed a tolerable standard, is not reasonable and realistic. The means of contact that people in rural areas have with commerce, centres of culture, amenities and centres where they can gain medical aid should be of the highest standard that our economy and technical knowledge can provide. The decision to build high standard rural roads has been a wise one, because it has helped to develop certain areas and to expand industry. It has been a contribution by this Government to the expansion of industries which earn the greater portion of our export income. This income, in turn, enables us to import the raw materials and other things that keep industry going. That is a simple, basic economic fact. I am pleased to note that in the referred to a matter which I have brought up in this House over a period of time. I refer to drought bonds. He said that primary producers in arid areas will be given the benefit of purchasing drought bonds. One thing disturbs me. Who will determine what is an arid area? If drought bonds are to apply only in the arid areas I have referred to where 30% of our wool is grown, I am very much afraid that because of drought conditions in the last few years not too many people will have made sufficient profit to be able for several years to come, to put aside an amount for drought bonds. I would like to see drought bonds available to all primary producers, because they afford a method of saving by setting aside profits in years of higher taxable income for use in years of low income. This system has operated very successfully, particularly in New Zealand. The system in New Zealand is posed in the Budget but fundamentally it is the same.",28,Wheat
70,Budget The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) Has,"This Budget provides for an increase in the superphosphate bounty. A good deal of this increase of $2 will be lost because the sulphur used in manufacturing superphosphate has increased so much in value recently. Nevertheless the increase in the bounty is a sign of good intention on the Government's part, and will be a great contribution to the continued expansion of primary industry. As was ably pointed out by my colleagues, the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hallett) and the honourable member for Calare( Mr England), in their speeches on the Budget, the situation in regard to primary industries is one for concern, particularly the wool industry. In the light of what has happened over the last 10 or 15 years this calls for very careful reflection and very careful consideration. Whilst costs have continued to rise-ther e is no way that the primary producer can avoid fixed costs in the form of fixed tax and fixed charges-the price of the product has remained at about the same level, or at least any increase which has taken place has not been consistent with the increase in charges. The wool industry in particular has suffered. I am not one who goes around saying that the wool industry isfinished.To do this is one of the very worse things we can do for our industry. It is very far from finished, but nevertheless it does require considerable consideration. Perhaps 'assistance' would not be too strong a word to use. Thefiguresquoted by the honourable member for Canning are worth repeating. Those figures used as a base on a 5-year period ending in June 1950, that being the year when the price of wool was at the highest point ever known. Using 100 units as a base, the price received for wool has declined from 62 units to 49 units between 1965 and 1968 whereas in the same period costs have increased from 235 to 247. Very many things influence costs and sources. Our next breakthrough will probprices.

But this needs watching and does call for careful consideration. It is interesting to note that 76% of the products we bring into this country come in tariff free and that we impose tariff duties on only 24% of imported items. The general position of rural industries is not one where, as we were led to believe, everything is rosy and thriving. To some extent every industry is causing anxiety. Our wheat industry, which I hope to say more about during tbe Estimates debate, has gone through a period of prosperity, and I have reason to believe that that prosperity will be maintained. The most prosperous industry at the present time is our beef industry. The prosperity enjoyed by this industry is due in a fairly large measure to the increase in our exports to the United States of America over the last decade and particularly over the last 5 years. There has been strong pressure and strong lobbying in the United States to increase the content of soya bean meal in processed meat from 3% to 7%. Although this is not a matter for alarm, it is a matter for considerable thought, because the 4% meat content that would be displaced in American processed meats coincidentally equals approximately the quantity of meat imported from Australia. Australia has emerged from a time of drought into one of the most bountiful seasons ever known. The present good season tends to lull people into a false sense of security and to blind them to the importance of water. I still maintain that water is our most vital commodity, not only for irrigation purposes but also for domestic and industrial use. In many cases the only limiting factor on mining in northern and central Australia is the availability of water. Fortunately, a good deal of work is being done in surveying underground water reSome people are prone to say that large monuments of concrete in the form of dams are built without regard to their cost or productivity. In this regard it is interestthreat comes from subversive activity ing to note that in the 5 years ended 1965 the total annual value of production using irrigation was $150m in Victoria. SlOOrn in New South Wales and S50m in Queensland. I am not able at the moment to give the capital cost of the irrigation works whicb enabled this production to take place, but it was a little more than one-eighth of the total value of pastoral and agricultural pro duction and about one-quarter of the value of our gross agricultural production. This production came from an area of about 2.5 million acres or about 6% of our present cultivated land. It has been possible to dissect costs in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. Capital investment in the MIA amounts to $32m but the return from that area now exceeds $32m a year. So one should not condemn the cost of irrigation projects without looking at the other side of the picture. As the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) has rightly said, the future of our nation must be built on a sound economy and the development of our industrial potential. We all must have been rudely shocked by the events of recent weeks, particularly of the last week. I refer to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by troops of Russia and her Warsaw Pact satellites. The Prime Minister has said that the invasion must have been planned in advance. I would suggest that the Warsaw Pact military exercises carried out in Czechoslovakia some weeks before the invasion were nothing more than a rehearsal for what took place. It is very difficult to understand how anybody could claim that Russia was able to invade Czechoslovakia because the Americans were preoccupied in South Vietnam. It is interesting to note that the only nation to congratulate the Russians on their efforts has been North Vietnam. Of course, Ho Chi Minh is an expert in these tactics. He adopted them in invading South Vietnam. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr ment protecting the interests of the greedy James) said this afternoon that China did at the expense of the needy. This situation not pose a threat to this country because is highlighted in the field of taxation. No China does not have an Air Force or a attempt has been made by the Government Navy. Apparently the honourable member to rectify the unjust, unfair and scandalous has never read Mao Tse Tung's red book. practice of placing the emphasis on indirect Surely nobody believes that the threat from taxation instead of on direct taxation. Since China is a threat of immediate invasion. The Chinese are far too wise for that. They say that time does not mean anything. The directed at the countries in our region. I would hope that the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia will cause the British to revise their decision to withdraw from the Persian Gulf, where the Russians have been exerting a tremendous amount of influence in recent times. In conclusion I repeat that although we all would like to do more for people less fortunate than ourselves, this Budget does assist to alleviate the difficulties faced by the needy people in the community without detracting from the development and defence of the nation. I therefore support the Budget. Mr DalyI rise to order.

73,The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon). Like Other,"the Chifley Labor Government went oat of office in 1949 Liberal-Country Party Governments have adopted the practice of placing the emphasis on indirect taxation, thereby imposing a burden on the great mass of workers in this country. The need to consider the position of the people on lower incomes is clearly outlined in the preface of a book, 'Taxation in AustraliaAgenda for Reform', which was written by a group appointed by the Social Science Research Council of Australia-Professor s R. I . Downing, H. W. Arndt, A. H. Boxer and R. L. Mathews. The preface states: The report submits for consideration a number a year.

It is significant to note, however, that tbe Treasurer has learned a lesson from the mistakes of his predecessors and has chosen not to increase the rate on non-commercial vehicles, which already are subject to sales tax at the rate of 25%. We recall that an increase in the sales tax on motor vehicles generally initiated the Government's credit squeeze policy in 1961, with all its disastrous results.

SI O .K 1 iliaII refer to this article in more detail later when I come to various aspects ol social services. It is an interesting study to analyse taxation by type for ail public authorities. 1 haw taken from the publication entitled 'Australian National Accounts' for the years 1953-54 io 1966 67figuresfor direct taxation and for indirect taxation of public authorities, including Commonwealth and St.ite governments and local government authorities, showing these types of taxation a-, percentages of the gross national product. It is most noticeable that between 1953-54 and 1966-67 there were at times sharp decreases in direct taxation but indirect taxation progressively increased. In 1953-54, direct taxation totalled $1,116m, or 12.3% of the gross national product. Indirect taxation totalled S968m, or 10.7% of the gross national product. In 1958-59, direct luxation represented only 10.4% of the gross national product, whereas indirect taxation had risen to 11.5%. A similar trend was noticeable again in 1959-60. This trend clearly indicates that Liberal governments place greater emphasis on indirect taxation than on direct taxation, though indirect taxation operates to the disadvantage of those in the low and middle income groups. This attitude of Liberal governments is further highlighted by changes in the concessional tax deductions that have been allowed. The greater a person's income, the more advantage he can take of these deductions. A particular instance is the concessional deduction of $1,200 allowable in respect of life insurance premiums. How many workers-o r even people in tbe middle income group, for that matter-ca n afford to take full advantage of this deduction? It has become a major selling point with insurance agents in their efforts to sell life insurance. I am well aware of this because I have a friend who is in the insurance game. He has informed me that his company has told him and his fellow that this deduction provides a means of obtaining assistance from the Commonwealth in the payment of life insurance premiums. The Commonwealth takes over part of the responsibilities of a taxpayer who cessional deduction. Similar considerations apply over the whole range of concessional deductions. So a person who pays tax at the rate of 50c in the dollar has the advantage of having the Commonwealth pay hall the expense that he is allowed to claim as a concessional deduction, whereas the person in the low or middle income group gains much less benefit, though it is those in these income groups who most deserve assistance from the Government. Events have proved, particularly this Budget, that they have not received it. The ""Commonwealth Taxation Assessments 1965-66, Bulletin No. 5' provides information about concessional deductions as related to ranges of income. It indicates clearly the unjustness and inequity of our taxation structure. 1 regard the average wage earner in Australia as the person who is earning between $1,801 and $3,000 a year. It is interesting to compare this wage earner with the person in the classification of $4,001 upwards. It is obvious from the information contained in that booklet lhat abuses are made of taxation deductions, particularly by the wealthy supporters of the Government. There are 1,669,800 wage earners who are receiving between SI,801 and $3,000 annually and 594,300 earning $4,001 and upwards. Statistics indicate that the average wage earners receive 33% of the education deduction benefits whereas those earning more than $4,001 a year-on e third of the number of average wage earnersreceive 35.1%. This pattern extends right through the concessional allowances. It applies to claims for medical costs, for chemists' charges and particularly for life assurance payments. I cannot stress strongly enough the abuse being made of life assurance concessions by those who have the means to take advantage of the situation. Those in the average wage class get 27.7% of the life assurance concessions whereas those in the wealthier class get 41.5%. This is a clear indication of how the Government looks after its wealthy friends. The taxation structure, as administered by the present Government, is loaded in favour of the haves as against the havenots because statistics indicate that 30% of the face value of concessions goes to fewer than 13% of the taxpayers and the tax worth of the concessions would be nearly 40%. Surely this situation clearly illustrates that the time is long overdue for a reform of our tax structure. It would be more equitable and just to abolish all concessional deductions and to make a reasonable payment to wives and children, in the same way as child endowments are made, and to levy taxation at progressive rates on total income. This at least would go some way towards ensuring equality in the tax structure. I should like now to make some comments on the social service benefits as contained-o r perhaps I should say not contained-in the Budget. The Australian public was treated to a fanfare of Press statements, following the election of the Prime the appointment of the Minister Cor Social Services( Mr Wentworth). Both of these gentlemen made numerous statements that social welfare would occupy a predominant place in the immediate future, but the Budget makes it crystal clear that the Government is not taking action to rectify the glaring anomalies that successive Liberal-Country Party governments have allowed in the social services field. The Government said that it would look after the less privileged and less fortunate people in the community who have to rely on age pensions and unemployment and sickness benefits. The first thing I want to do is to comment on the great hand-out to pensioners. It is most interesting to refer to newspaper articles and to headlines concerning pension payments. In one newspaper, under the headline 'Pensioners Happy', and bearing the date line Canberra, 14th June, the following article appears: Representatives of the Australian Pensioners Federation today met the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) for 2t hours. 'We had a good hearing,' the Federation's national president Mrs Irene Ellis, of Melbourne, said. 'We are happy now.' Mr Wentworth commented: 'It was a most useful meeting. I now know the pensioners' priorities items of the platform of the Liberal Party and they outlined what they wanted most clearly.' 19511/68-R-[23 } The day following the introduction of the Budget a newspaper published an article headed 'Pensioners Are Unhappy'. It stated: Pensioners were in a fighting mood last night after learning of the $1 pension rise in the Federal Budget. The secretary of the 80,000-member Commonwealth Pensioners Association, Mrs Irene Ellis, of Victoria, had this to say in Canberra: 'We aro disgusted. It is a mere pittance, and pensioners will still have to live at a subsistence level. We will fight it. We will call on the Australian people at the next Federal election to show their objection through the ballot box.' During the last financial year there has been an increase of $1.15 a week in the cost of living, and in the last Budget no provision was made for pension increases. So it is obvious that the increases proposed in this Budget are measly. When the Minister for Social Services was a back-bench member he took a considerable interest in social service matters and I should have thought that he would have done more for pensioners. Consideration should bave been given to the allowance paid to the wife of Minister( Mr Gorton) and a pensioner. She should receive at least the age pension even if she were under 60 years of age. A number of such women are living at a mere subsistence level and cannot obtain the age pension. It has been suggested that if these women went to see a doctor they would probably be able to get medical certificates that would enable them to qualify for an invalid pension, but this should not be necessary. When a man reaches 65 years of age and qualifies for the age pension he still has the same responsibility to maintain his wife. It has bcon argued by some honourable members opposite that if we granted wives an age pension before they reached 60 years of age. and when their husbands reached 65 years of age, this would encourage a lot of young women to marry old men. I have never heard a more stupid argument. The Minister for Social Services was a great champion of pensioners before be was appointed to his portfolio. great advocate for the abolition of the means test. So he should have been. The abolition of the means test was one of the main of Australia in 1949 when it defeated the",31,Wheat
74,Mr Daly,He was a rebel then.,34,Wheat
75,Mr Nicholls,"That is so, but he was aChifley Labor Government. It was an election promise that the Liberal Party put forward to get the support of the public. But at no time since has the Government attempted to bring legislation of that nature before this Parliament. The Government has been in office 19 years. During that period it has introduced at least eighteen Budgets. It has liberalised the means test but it has not attempted to introduce the legislation that it promised in 1949 for the abolition of tbe means test. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr fare involved after they had commenced James) this afternoon put forward a detailed case for the abolition of the means test. He suggested that abolition of the means test should begin with all persons over 75 years of age. I suppose that I am a little more radical than the honourable member, but I would prefer to see this Government or some other government in the future make a more positive approach towards abolishing the means test. At least a decision doing so during the Estimates debate. Every should be made to abolish the means test over a period of two parliaments. In other words we should go one sixth of the way each year for a period of six years. The thoughts expressed by the honourable member for Hunter are most valid. This Government has a poor record as far as unemployment and sickness benefits are concerned. An examination of the rates will show that they are the same now as they were in 1962. Six years ago the rate for an adult was $8.25 a week, with $6 for a dependent wife. The same rates are still in force. I am indebted to the Minister for Social Services, who is sitting at the table, for this information. The last time that there was an increase in unemployment and sickness benefits was 1962, yet the cost of living has increased by $1.15 in the last 12 months. I understand that a similar increase occurred in the previous 12 months. Why should those who have to accept unemployment and sickness benefits be asked to live on the same amount today as in 1962? During the last period of this Parliament I asked the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury) whether consideration would be given to providing travel vouchers to those seeking jobs. I said I had been approached by a constituent who had been directed by the Department of Labor and National Service at Elizabeth, which is my electorate, to go to Adelaide, a distance of approximately 19 or 20 miles, to get a job. A return ticket by train costs 64c. The man has not been successful in getting a job although he made four other attempts. I received a nice reply from the Minister to the effect that he had made some inquiries and that in the future people might be assisted with travel warrants for a return journey to an agreed destination, but that recipients of this assistance would have to undertake to repay the cost of the employment and were receiving wages. A mere pittance is involved and yet this compassionate Government, which has supposedly gone out of its way lo make things easier for recipients of social services, expects to be reimbursed. Time does not allow me to discuss fully maternity allowances and child endowment rates, but I will take the opportunity of person has a moral right to share in the wealth of the Australian community, and this applies to pensioners as well. Australia's growing productivity and expansion are making us a richer nation. Yet the Commonwealth Government refuses even to maintain social service benefits at the levels of from 5 to 20 years ago, let alone do anything to ensure their continual advancement in value. The manner in which the Commonwealth Government is acting is entirely contemptuous of those who are the most needy and who should be given extensive consideration. The Government should increase all social service payments at least to their former levels and should take early action to make them commensurate with current living standards. This year is Human Rights year-so determined by the United Nations. There can be no greater human right than the health and welfare of the nation's citizens. This is a year when we have all been asked to recognise the suffering, misery and needs of those requiring assistance and least able to fend for themselves. As a matter of conscience, the Government should read and heed the 1963 report of the International Labour Organisation, which showed that in regard to the amount of money spent per head of population on social security, Australia had slipped from its 1949 position of third to sixteenth out of twenty-six countries. The position is even worse today. Minister for Social Services) [4.471I think that this is the nineteenth Budget to which 1 have spoken. It is the first to which I have spoken as a Minister. I wonder what subject. I would have chosen if I had been speaking from the backbenches. PerhapsI would have spoken on foreign affairs, which commands much of our attention today. PerhapsI would have spoken on the economic climate or overseas trade. 1 may even have spoken on the revolution which is taking place in grain production throughout the world with the introduction of the new strains of wheat and rice that will transform the grain economy of the world and will have tremendous significance to Australia because they will mean that for only 3 or 4 years at the most will it be possible for Australia to find a market for large wheat crops. This revolution may require some adjustment of our rural economy in the interests of the wheat growers, whom I hope will not be let down by their friends. It will mean that for the future Australia must look to minerals and meat rather than to wool and wheat as the mainstays of our export income. I do not for one moment mean that there will not be any wheat exports or that wool exports will not be the biggest item in the receipts from our exports. But those two commodities will lose their predominant importance. Therefore, some kind of adjustment will be necessary. Those are the subjects that I would have preferred perhaps to speak about from the backbenches. However, I think that the House would prefer me to say something about social services this afternoon. 1 feel that I should do so because the Government really has a story to tell in the Budget. It has a plan to put forward. It has already achieved a great deal. When the present Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) took office he set up the Welfare Committee of Cabinet to consider the whole question of social services and what is incorporated in this Budget is the first instalment only of the plan which the Prime Minister set out. Honourable members will know very well that there is naturally some tendency for social services to grow in a haphazard way under the influences of political and other pressures. This is helped in our system by (Mackellartwo factors, the first of which is that these services are divided between the Federal and the State Governments. I think it is proper that each of these Governments have their sphere and in the passage of, for example, tbe deserted wives legislation only a few months ago this House very properly recognised that. There is the other factor, however, which does lead to this kind of haphazard growth, namely, that of necessity the real field of social services impinges upon more than one Commonwealth department. The greater expenditure, of course, lies in my Department, but this cannot be entirely divorced from the operations of the Department of Health or the Department of Housing, or indeed from other aspects of the Government's administration. This is of the nature of things. Until the present Prime Minister took the matter in hand there was a tendency for each of these Departments to develop its plan without proper reference one to another, so there was some kind of overlapping and wasteful duplication which was not to the benefit of people who needed help from the Government. Until this present review started there was not a proper co-ordination between the services provided by the Commonwealth and those provided by the various States. Now, for the first time, we are setting out on a purposeful and coherent plan. But this is not yet fully developed. As I have said, this Budget is the first instalment. The Prime Minister has laid down twin objectives: First, that our resources should be directed primarily to the areas of real need so that they should do the most good. We do not have unlimited resources, but we do have increasing resources and, as honourable members who listened to the Prime Minister last night will know, it is the Government's intention to allocate increasing resources for this general purpose. The second objective is that in so doing we do not want to neglect entirely the thrift which is the basis of our economy and which provides the sinews without which the maintenance of our structure of social services would be entirely impossible. Let us look in general at the plan that is envisaged in this present Budget which we are now debating. Firstly, there is the raising of the standard rate of pension throughout by Si. I think the House should note",34,Wheat
76,Mr Wentworth,"that in the cases of greatest need the supplementary assistance is also payable. The pension is therefore $16 plus the fringe benefits. has been less than the increase in the single The House might appreciate that this, in terms of real purchasing power, is the highest level to which the Commonwealth pension at standard rates has ever come. This is the high water mark. I do not say that it will not go further forward, although it may well be that in its development of its objectives the present Government may be more selective rather than increasing very much the overall rate above any changes in the cost of living. I think the House will remember that when the pension is looked at in terms of present day purchasing powerI have adjusted this to the changes in the cost of living throughout so that I am using a set offigureswhich can be compared, one with another-fro m the inception of Commonwealth pensions they did not go above the $6, $7 or $8 level until towards the end of the Second World War. It may be, and I think it was, that in those days families had more regard for their responsibilities as a family. There may have been other factors at work, but up to a time towards the end of the Second World War, $8 was the ceiling in terms of present day purchasing power. From then there was a rise under the Chifley Government to a ceiling of about $10 in terms of present day purchasing power. At the time of the change of government in December 1949 the pension rate in terms of present purchasing power was about $9.35. This was an improvement on the level of the past, but it was vastly less tban the level of today. I remind the House again that in those days the main fringe benefits in tbe shape of medical services were not available to pensioners to the degree that they are today. So honourable members can see that in portance, but it will be of advantage the lifetime of this series of governments wherever it operates-in the method of calsince our side came to power in 1949 we have just about doubled the rate of pension culating the allowance for the first child. in terms of real purchasing power, and the We have also made provision for an inrate proposed in this Budget is the highest creased wife's allowance. For a full year it has ever achieved. Perhaps honourable these benefits will cost $70m. They will members would say that it is still not benefit over 1,000.000 people consisting of enough. In point of fact all of us would like 800,000 pensioners, 80,000 widows, 105,000 to pay more to everybody. This is a general children and 20,000 wives. I have rounded view. However, I have a feeling that if we thesefiguresa little and because of this they are to increase these rates it may be better are not entirely accurate to the last decimal for the future to have selective increases place. But I am giving the House a correct devoted to the areas of greatest need. In this Budget, as in some previous budgets, the increase in the married rate rate, but there is a good reason for this. This is an example of the principle of directing funds towards the areas of greatest need, using available resources where they will do the most good. I know, and everybody knows, that there is the odd exception to any rule. But the married couple would be better off than the single person if they received exactly twice the amount, because some of the expenditures, not all, are shared. For example, rent and items of that character are shared. Professor Downing, who conducted the needs survey in Melbourne, but forward the general principle that the single rate pension should be 60% of the married pension rate. Under the Government's present proposals, I think the figure is about 56%. The difference between the pension of a married and a single person is not as great as it is in most other countries and is not as great as the university people would like it to be. But I believe that in this case the Government has a sound point in mind. The Budget is directed specifically to the needs of widows and of widows with children. The child's allowance has been raised from $1.50 to $2.50. This is a great, significant and good rise. It is something from which widows with children particularly will benefit. Provision has been made for the surviving partner of a married pensioner couple. We propose to pay the double pension for 12 weeks after one of the partners dies. In the case of a migrant widow we will no longer insist on residential qualifications. Provision has been made for a special rehabilitation course to help widows to train for profitable industry. We have made a small change-it is not of tremendous impicture of the situation. The Government has also looked at the subject of health, which really is of concern to the pensioner. In the past the pensioner has not enjoyed proper provision for his hospitalisation. There will now be no limit to the time insured people may spend in hospital. Most important of all perhaps, we have raised from $2 to $5 a day the subsidy for heavy nursing cases. These matters concern the Department of Health rather than the Department of Social Services. But primarily they affect the pensioner. This is an example of the way in which the Welfare Committee of the Cabinet has been able to co-ordinate a policy which is directed towards the real needs of pensioners irrespective of whether the action should lie with the Department of Social Services or the Department of Health. We intend to put more emphasis on voluntary effort. Provision is made for an extra subsidy for home nursing in this Budget. We are developing a new system of domiciliary care whereby support will be given to all those excellent and wonderful organisations, such as Meals on Wheels, which are of benefit to pensioners. Senior citizen centres will be subsidised in accordance with a plan that will be worked out with the States. The Welfare Committee has only just really started its work which will be carried on into the future. Finally, I do not wish to take up the time of the House too long, but I would like to discuss briefly the question of accommodation for the aged, sick and needy. Perhaps the most important aspect of all is that if a person can obtain proper accommodation, other problems become The Government will further develop its system of providing aged persons homes. This matter is at present under consideration by the Welfare Committee of the Cabinet and I am hopeful that before Christmas 1 shall be able to introduce a Bill to improve yet further what has turned out to be an excellent scheme. I would like to mention to the House one important by-product of the Government's decision to raise the heavy nursing subsidy from $2 to $5 a day. As honourable members will know, under the existing provisions it is possible for an aged persons home to have, as an adjunct, a nursing home that may consist of up to half the number of beds in the institution itself. Full advantage has not been taken of this because many of these organisations have felt that they would not have the financial resources to run the nursing homes. It is inevitable, though perhaps regrettable, that as people advance in age more of them become heavy nursing cases. We can well understand the reluctance of some aged persons homes to undertake commitments which they felt they did not have the financial capacity to maintain. This impediment will no longer exist because, under the scheme announced in the Budget, even though there will be a high proportion of heavy nursing cases in the home, it will still be possible for the organisation concerned to obtain finance to maintain the attached nursing home on an even keel. Under existing arrangements we have a leeway of about 10,000 nursing beds for our aged persons homes. This is the number of beds which are available under the Government's existing legislation but which have not yet been taken up by these organisations. All these beds will not be taken up, of course, in a single year. But I am certain they will be taken up at an increasing rate as these organisations realise that under the proposed scheme as announced in this Budget, it will be possible for them not only to obtain a $2 for $1 subsidy for their nursing homes but also to obtain an additional $2 a day for light nursing cases and an additional $5 a day for heavy nursing cases. Under these arrangements the maintenance of their homes will be financially possible. I should like to bave said many other things if I had the time to do so. I should manageable. like to have said something about the Government's desire to develop its rehabilitation services. Time will not permit me to do so. May I finally and just in passing say, not in regard to social services but in regard to my other responsibility, Aboriginals, that here again this Budget breaks new and, 1 am sure, fruitful ground. I have made a statement to the House and I hope it will be debated as soon as time can be made available for it. Therefore, I will not pursue this matter. I hope it will be possible to have the House discuss it later. CouldI just say by way of summary that the Government is providing in this Budget an extra $!0m for Aboriginal welfare. This is in addition to the $7m or so it provides for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory and the estimated $13m a year that is being spent on social services for Aboriginals within the scope of my other responsibilities. Therefore, this amount of $30m a yearthe special amount of $iOm, the $7m to the Northern Territory and the $13m in social services-is a substantia] Commonwealth contribution to the welfare of Aboriginals for whom we have now this new responsibility, which the Commonwealth Government will do everything it can to discharge. In both areas, social services and Aboriginals, although we are providing the financial sinews, we will not be as successful as we should unless we can mobilise, as I believe we can and will mobilise, the goodwill that is inherent throughout our community for both sections-for the pensioners, for the aged, for the needy and for the Aboriginals who also in a sense fall within this same category. to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). The tragic events of the last week have overshadowed the Budget. The Parliament quite properly interrupted this debate to express the dismay and the resentment of all sections of the Australian people at the illegal and unjustifiable invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army. I should like to place on record my support for the sentiments that were expressed during the debate that took place last Thursday. Having said that, I would like to deal with some aspects of the Budget presented to the Parliament by the ago. The Minister for Social Services( Mr wage was frozen in 1953 and had not Wentworth), in the speech that he has just concluded outlined quite a number of propositions. He made one point that I found rather fascinating. He said that the fringe benefits now available to pensioners were not available prior to 1949. In at least one respect, and I think a major respect, the benefits available under the pensioner medical scheme were not required before 1949 because people in all sections of the community were able to obtain public hospital treatment without cost. bed. Minister for Heahh (Dr Forbes) that if they can get a bed now they are very lucky. If they live in a country area, where there is bush nursing or only private hospitals, beds are just not available. should confine his remarks to Victoria. an electorate that is in Victoria and the people who are in Victoria are the people on whose behalf I speak in this place. In his speech, the Treasurer constantly referred to the Budget as a social welfare Budget. This, 1 would suggest, was a deliberately misleading term. It has already been shown that the words were little more than an empty catch cry. It may be as the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) has suggested, that the Government has social welfare in mind, but it has very little social welfare in this Budget. Pensions have been treated in exactly the same way as they have been treated by this Government over a considerable period of years. In 1946 the combined pension for an aged couple represented 73% of the basic wage. The basic wage has since been abolished, but at the time it was abolished-the actual value of the pension has not materially altered since then-it still represented 73% of the basic wage. That basic wage was not related to the C series index as the basic wage in the past has been. The basic advanced with the cost of living. The rate of child endowment for the first child has not altered since it was introduced in 1950. The rate for the second child has never been altered at all by this Government. It remains at the level at which it was fixed in 1947. Since then money values have altered substantially and the cost of maintaining a family, in relevant terms, has not changed for the better. Indeed, I suggest that the cost of maintaining a family is now higher in relevant terms than it was in 1947. Applied to young families and those dependent on social services, this Budget could not possibly be described as a social welfare Budget.

But not all of them employment opportunities took place in relate to social services. Because of land speculation, shortages and high interest rates, the cost to a family of finding suitable accommodation is extremely high. In many low income families it would represent one-third of their total income. This cost cannot be afforded unless a person is able to purchase his own home. In many cases it is necessary to do this in order to obtain accommodation. But rates are continually rising, interest rates are increasing and recently the rates charged by the Commonwealth Bank to housing societies were raised by one-half of 1%, which added approximately $2.50 a month to repayments by members of co-operative housing societies. These increases which are constant are making home ownership a burden for persons whose incomes would not be classified as being in the middle income range.

Substantial rises also occurred among the professional, managerial, proprietor and official sections of the work force. It is true to say that, in future, proby the local community as a non-profit venspects for employment will diminish with age Already those in the 40-plus age bracket are finding it difficult to obtain constant their income in order to make up their total employment. This situation applies particularly to unskilled and semi-skilled persons who are aged over 40 years and who, in the main, were denied educational opportunities for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the advent of the depression in the 1930s and the World War in the 1940s. This was the period when these people, if they had had the opportunity, would have completed their secondary and tertiary education. Apart from the extremely successful rehabilitation scheme following the last World War. little or nothing has been attempted which would bring about the necessary upgrading of the all too large section of the community which must at present depend on continued labor shortages in order to retain their employment. The policy of the Government and of industry today appears to be: 'If you are over 40 years we would be obliged if you would stop making a nuisance of yourself.' Even Government departments have policies which deny employment to persons over 40 years. The tragedy of people in the over 40-age group is more than matched by people who are physically handicapped, mentally retarded or have some other disability which prevents them from obtaining regular employment. 11 is unlikely that any member of this House can say that he is not aware of cases of persons who have not been able to get a job because of some disability which constitutes a bar to normal employment. These people represent one of the great tragedies of today. Unless they are helped they must surely sink deeper into the morass of hopelessness which is already so evident in so many cases.

Also, invalid pensioners who are and technological obsolescence. employed in the workshops should be allowed to retain their pension as part of earnings to at least 85% of the award rate for the job which they are doing. That would encourage them to obtain work in industry so that they could earn the full award rates. It would also enable them to recover their self-confidence, which is an important matter in a number of cases. In the Geelong area alone I would suggest there are at least 500 persons who receive sickness benefits, unemployment benefits or the invalid pension and who could perform useful work but at present they are not able to compete for jobs on the open market. adult apprenticeship scheme? I was not here. The field of education is one in which much remains to be achieved, and every day that action is delayed means that some child has had his future jeopardised. The under-educated of today are finding employment difficult to obtain. Tomorrow they will find it impossible to obtain employment. A child should be able to obtain an adequate education, irrespective of thefinancialposition of his parents. Unfortunately, this is not the case at the present time. Children who are fortunate enough to have well endowed parents can expect to obtain the maximum possible level of education which they are able or willing to accept. For the less fortunate children cost is often the only relevant factor.

90,Mr Scholesi Do Not Know Because,"Even in the field of Government grants there is evidence that low income areas are not as well served as are the more affluent districts. In my area, for instance, the only co-educational high school without a science block is at Norlane, which serves Geelong's biggest Housing Commission estate. This, I admit, is a matter of State priorities. But the fact remains that these children are less well endowed than those in more affluent areas where parents are able to afford the greater part of the cost of their children's education. Every child, boy or girl, who is forced out of school because of the economic circumstances of its parents, or who is subjected to less than adequate educational facilities, as often happens in schools which are established in temporary accommodation that is not suitable for the level and type of education being attempted, is disadvantaged for the rest of its life. It costs a parent up to $150 per year to keep a child in a State high or technical school. Where there is more than one child of secondary school age the situation constitutes a severe economic strain. It is impossible if for various reasons the breadwinner is unable to earn a reasonable level of income constantly. Migrants are adding to the strain on the education system and have had a severe effect on both independent and State schools. To date the Commonwealth has not appeared to concern itself with assisting to meet the financial problems faced by schools, and the educational problems faced by children who lack a sufficient command of the language or teachers with classes so large that they cannot give the attention that is needed. Education is vital to every child. It is time the Government stopped skirmishing with the needs of the entire education system and came to grips with problems which are placing too many children's future in jeopardy. The other area of welfare which has money was allocated only for rural areas. been neglected in this Budget is health. The facts are that it was allocated for part Under our present so called health plan of the urban area of Geelong. There seems no person can afford to be sick. The cost to be no reasonable ground why a person of adequate insurance cover is beyond the who lives in a brick house on one side of financial capacity of most low income Boundary Road, which is about 50 yards families.

The longer the Government delays of stock going up and the re-stocking that effective action to solve the glaring weaktook place following the drought, should nesses in the present system, the harder.it not receive some form of relief. It seems will become to bring about effective reforms. The present system has already created within itself vested interests that are prepared to do everything possible to maintain the status quo. It should be the right of any person who needs medical attention to have treatment irrespective of his ability to meet the cost. To describe as a welfare budget a document which so neglects the whole welfare structure is plainly dishonest. I would now like to deal with one or two specific matters which are related to my own electorate. A week ago during an adjournment debate I spoke about discrimination by the Commonwealth against persons who live in the cities of Geelong, Newtown and Geelong West in the allocation of funds for drought relief. A serious disability has been placed on the residents of one-third of the urban area of Geelong. In an answer I received from the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) within the last 2 days he said that the object of funds for the relief of drought caused employment was to maintain employment in rural areas. I dispute that this in fact was the manner in which these funds were distributed. The city of Ballarat received some $60,000 for relief of drought caused unemployment, the city of Bendigo received $59,000, and the Shire of Corio, which is part of my electorate, received about $40,000. The Shire of Corio has 36,000 people living in the urban area of Geelong. The Shire of South Barwon, which adjoins my electorate and is represented by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Street), and the Shire of Dellarine, which is on another side of the three cities which make up central Geelong. were all able to use funds for the relief of unemployment caused by the drought. Only the cities of Geelong, Geelong West and Newtown in the areas outside the Melbourne area in Victoria were excluded, ft is not true to say that (his unreasonable to say that a person who lives on the east side of Boundary Road is drought affected and the person who lives on the west side is not, merely because the name of the municipal area in which he lives is different. That is the only difference between the two areas. There are 70,000 people in the urban area of Geelong who are or were eligible for employment on drought relief projects and 46,000 persons who were not so eligible. I also draw attention to the continued running down of the Government Aircraft Factories, particularly that section which is at Avalon in my electorate. In answer to a question on 13 th August the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall) indicated that rationalisation of the aircraft industry would most likely mean that it would not be possible to maintain three aircraft establishServices( Mr Wentworth) mentioned and ments in Australia. He also indicated that the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, which is privately owned, had no real problem in maintaining staff and that the Government aircraft factory was more likely to be affected. The employment figures for Avalon which were supplied to me indicate that at 1st July 1966 and lst July 1967 405 persons were employed at that plant. At lst July this year 328 were working there, a drop of seventy-seven during a period of 12 months. Another thirty-nine have received notice of retrenchment and it is expected that others will receive notice before Christmas. This is an establishment to which a large number of persons have devoted a lot of time. Most of those who are being dismissed are classified as tradesmen but have been up-graded to that position and have little or no hope of obtaining employment as tradesmen outside the industry. They are skilled in aircraft production. They are being thrown on to the employment scrapheap. The employment position in the area in which they live in Geelong is such that at present about 900 persons are in receipt of unemployment benefits. A lot of these are over 40 years of age and will not be eligible for employment in major industries, which have a policy of not employing persons over 40. They are being seriously jeopardised. I suggest that the Government has treated very lightly what I regard as being a very vital defence establishment. The skills which have been attained in this industry through the construction of the Sabre, the Canberra bomber and the Mirage fighter would be vital to this country if ever we were involved in a defence emergency. It is not reasonable to expect that we would be able to send our aircraft to some overseas establishment for maintenance during a defence emergency. If provision had been made for the F ill aircraft to be serviced in Australia-thi s should have been possible-the people employed in these establishments would have been able to attain the skills necessary to maintain the aircraft if they were required in the active defence of this country. I hope they will never be required for this purpose. I would like now to draw attention to something which the Minister for Social which is in my opinion an even more serious problem than the Minister suggested. I refer to the lack of Commonwealth activity in the field of geriatric care. The Minister mentioned the Aged Persons Homes Act. I would like to make a suggestion which I hope the Minister will consider. In the Geelong area Grace McKellar House caters for most of the geriatric patients in need of intensive care. Grace McKellar House has 185 beds but there are 171 persons on the urgent waiting list for admission to Grace McKellar House. Most of these people will die before they can be admitted. At the present rate at which finance is being provided by the Victorian Government, which has refused to accelerate its provision of finance, 12 years will elapse before Grace McKellar House will have sufficient beds to accommodate all the urgent cases awaiting admission. In addition to the urgent cases there are 700 other people on the list awaiting admission. In all probability these people would benefit greatly from the expert care which the home could provide but they have no chance of being admitted unless they are virtually on their death bed. A number of organisations have provided housing under the homes for the aged programme. T suggest that where an eligible organisation does not wish to accept the Government's offer of grants towards the provision of intensive care units it should be affiliated with a central regional unit approved by the Government. Grace McKellar House would be such a unit. Under such an arrangement the Returned Services League, which provides housing for elderly citizens but is unlikely to enter the field of intensive care, could affiliate with Grace McKellar House. The Government could then make a grant to Grace McKellar House for the provision of intensive care units, which could be better provided by Grace McKellar House as it is an institution already providing this type of care. This would enable facilities at Grace McKellar House to be enlarged, thus providing accommodation for a greater number of: persons. I hope that the Minister will consider my suggestion when drafting amendments to the Aged Persons Homes Act because this is a matter of serious concern to many people in my electorate. I have had brought to my attention most pitiful cases of people needing intensive care. AllT can do is recommend to them a private nursing home, which in many cases will not have the required facilities or skilled staff. In many cases also such a home is beyond the means of the people needing attention. regret that lack of time will not permit me to reply to some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Scholes), in particular the matter of re-training for industry. On page 92 of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1968-69 is an entry of $945,000. This is not a large sum as national account entries go, but it refers to a body exercising tremendous influence on the whole structure of the Australian economy. I refer to the Australian Tariff Board. Probably no economic domestic issue of recent years has such interest and discussion as has the tariff question. This is not surprising and it brings me to the first point that I would like to emphasise, namely the very widespread effect of tariff policy. Tariff policy vitally affects our export industries, particularly our primary industries, and their ability to maintain a competitive position in world markets, l t affects our secondary industries-no t only those which enjoy a high rate of protection for their products but also those which have to pay a high rate of duty on imported raw materials required in their business. We must not forget that secondary industries will have to make a constantly increasing contribution to export earnings and that unwise tariff protection would jeopardise their future prospects. Finally, tariff policy affects the Australian consuming public since it has a most important bearing on our wage and cost structure. It is important to understand just what tariffs are. 1 thought that the honourable member for Moore( Mr Maisey) gave a good definition of tariffs yesterday. He pointed out that tariffs are a tax on imports. They make an imported article dearer and hence permit local producers of the same article to charge a higher price than they could otherwise charge. The honourable member gave me a list of typical items enjoying tariff protection-severa l enjoying protection of more than 100% and one enjoying protection at the almost unbelievable rate of 150%. Any increase in prices gives rise to repercussions throughout the economy and reduces the income of wage earners by reducing purchasing power. In other words, tariff policy affects every man, woman and child in the country and ideally should be considered on a non-party basis. Only under such conditions, free from the emotion and prejudice which seem to be inseparable from party politics, can we expect to reach a true and balanced conclusion on this matter. Probably at no time since the introduction of our tariff policy have conditions been more favourable for such a dispassionate debate than they are now. because early in this Parliament we had a clear indication that the Australian Labor Party has drastically modified its former policy of protection at all costs. On several occasions the honourable member for created Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) has spoken to this effect. The Australian Country Party, representing as it does many primary producers, is vitally interested in tariffs, as are members of the Liberal Party from both country and metropolitan electorates. So we have a climate in which it should be possible to make a dispassionate examination of tariff policy. In the old days it used to be a question of free trade versus protection but, of course, this no longer applies. ] do not know of any thinking person who would advocate a policy of free trade today, and I certainly do not, but between a policy of free trade on the one hand and over-protection on",41,Wheat
91,Mr Street (Corangamite) [5.4311,"the other there must be an optimum level of tariff for every industry, taking into account not only the industry concerned but the Australian economy as a whole. I personally feel that recently our tariff policy tralia than in the United States of America. has been directed too much towards asking, 'How much does this product or industry need protection?' rather than asking, 'How much does the Australian economy need this product or industry?' I also appreciate that one has to be realistic about this subject. It is clearly impossible to dismantle overnight a tariff structure built up over the years but it is possible to stop its undesirable extension in uneconomic areas and to encourage its expansion into those industries which contribute to the national income and in which we have proved our ability to compete successfully on world markets. Everyone agrees that Australian industry needs protection. Indeed, the original terms of reference of the Tariff Board are as sound now as they were when first introduced. Our tariff policy has been a vital factor in building up Australia's industrial capacity and wisely applied I am sure that it can continue to aid Australia's industrial development in the future, but over the years it seems that we have lost sight of the original guide lines laid down for the Tariff Board. The situation today gives considerable cause for concern. At this stage it may fairly be asked. Concern to whom? Certainly not just to me. It caused concern to the Committee of Economic Inquiry, known as the 'Vernon Committee'. It is causing concern to the former chairman of the Tariff Board. Sir Leslie Melville; to the present Chairman of the Board, Mr tries best able to contribute to our Rattigan; to a Board member, Mr Tucker; to many economists such as Dr Corden and Dr Coombs; to many honourable members of this House; and to many members of the Australian public. Indeed, Sir, those who are in full agreement with our present tariff structure may soon, perhaps, be compared with the proud mother watching a battalion march past who proclaims: 'Look, everyone is out of step except our Johnnie'. There are too many highly competent men of great experience in this field who are expressing serious doubts about our present tariff policy for their doubts to be dismissed Board to maintain its independence. Any or disregarded. I should now like to examine a few of the comments made by some of these men. Sir Leslie Melville, I believe, was the first to direct attention to the fact that a higher proportion of the work force was engaged in secondary industry in AusHe made this vital point: Whatever economic or social benefits are to be gained by a general growth and diversification of secondary industry and employment, we must by now have gained them. Again, he said: Our standards of living would be on a firmer basis if we ourselves provided the domestic savings to develop the new mineral and pastoral industries. Here we come to a sentence that should be marked by every member of this House. Sir Leslie said: However, our tariff policy is diverting our scarce resources of capital into high cost industries, some of which make little contribution to the national income. My final quotation from Sir Leslie Melville is this: Some of our tariffs against Asian imports have now become so high that it is possible to say that they are reducing rather than increasing our standard of living. With a policy of full employment, they are not needed, either to provide or lo maintain employment. Mr Rattigan, the present Chairman of the Tariff Board, makes the very important point lhat when the lines on which the Board works were first established the main problem was to find uses for resources not fully employed. Now. the uses for our resources are in greater supply than the resources themselves. He considers that the Board's recommendations should lead to the growth of indusnational objectives. I ask. Sir: 'Can this be said of the results of all recent tariff decisions?' Mr Tucker, a member of the Board, considers that it is highly desirable that any future inquiries into tariff policies or administration should have terms of reference permitting inquiry and report on the relations between the Board and the Government, the nature and extent of the independence that the Board should enjoy in the community interest, and the conditions which should be observed by the Government and the inquiry, he considers, should be nondepartmental in character and should take account of the returns which are obtainable from the use of resources in sections of industry not dependent on the tariff -that is, should take into account the opportunity costs of tariff protection. Dr Cordon made this comment: One is struck above all by the very high rates of protection afforded in almost all cases. This is so even though 1 have not been able to calculate the implications, in ad valorem terms, of support prices for chemicals. I may say, Sir, that this is an extraordinary statement for a highly skilled professional economist to make. It illustrates the complexity and the hidden costs of the tariff. Dr Corden stated also: The chemical industry report tells us a lot about the industry and its point of view. But it is quite devoid of information enabling the reader to assess the impact of its recommendations, nor does it contain a critical examination of the issues involved in protection by support prices. Dr Corden then made two suggestions. One is that the Tariff Board be attached to the Prime Minister's Department. The second is that the tariff on products which are important inputs into export industries should in general be somewhat lower than they otherwise would be. Next, 1 should like to quote a short comment by Dr Coombs who, until recently, was Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. He said: I think the time has come when we could, with advantage, review the generality of the protection and begin to use it with more discrimination. It must be remembered that when we are fully employed, a subsidy or tariff in one area of industry reduces spending power or raises costs in another. Finally, I should like to quote Mr L. C. Bridgland, who might be considered to favour fairly high rates of protection. He stated: There is a necessity for a most discriminatory approach to the fostering of industry if costs and prices are to remain reasonably stable. I could go on and give innumerable examples like these, Mr Deputy Speaker, but surely those that I have given are enough to prove my point. league from Perth. These are the views of men of substance and learning. Whenever a major review of tariff policy is suggested, the claim is always made that a general lowering of tariffs would inevitably lead to a reduction of employment and a slowing down of Australia's industrial development. The observations that I have just quoted show that this is a fallacy based on outdated economic thinking. It is clear that we now have the ability, by the skilful use of fiscal policies, to maintain employment without recourse to excessiveI stress the word 'excessive'-tarif f protection. For my part, I believe that the time has come for a careful examination of the rates of tariff protection applying in this country and, perhaps even more important, full consideration of the question of whether the methods currently employed to determine the rates of protection are based on sound economic principles. The Tariff Board itself obviously is concerned about this question. I completely support it in its proposal to classify industries into those receiving high, medium and low rates of protection. Duties payable on more than half the 3,500 items studied by tbe Vernon Committee have not been reviewed since the end of World War II , and probably not since a time long before that. Although, like the character in Gilbert and Sullivan, we have them on the list, I strongly suspect that further investigations would show that, to quote well known words: 'They never would be missed; they never would be missed'. Unless we are prepared to make a thorough objective assessment of our current tariff policies and where they are leading us, the economy of this country, and especially the export industries, I believe, are in for serious trouble, because present tariff policies are a major factor in increasing the costs of export industries, especially primary industries. We have heard the Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr McEwen) say that Australia needs to earn about $5,000m annually in export income by the mid 1970s. We have also been told that for as far ahead as we can see primary industry will have to earn the major part of our export income. But primary producers are finding it increasingly difficult to earn this income, for they are at the end of the line in terms of their capacity to absorb further cost increases. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that while all other sections of the community have recourse to some means by which they can maintain the purchasing power of their incomes, no such means are available to the unprotected",44,Wheat

93,Mr Streeti Quite Agree With My Col,"primary industries that contribute to our export trade. Manufacturers can appeal to the Tariff Board. Wage and salary earners can appeal to the arbitration tribunals. Industries selling a substantial proportion of tunity to do so. their products on the home market can appeal to the Government. But the unprotected exporting industries have no-one to appeal to and are at the mercy of rising costs at home and falling prices abroad. As I said a little earlier, I congratulate the Tariff Board on its last report. I believe interest amongst them in resettlement here. that if its recommendations are accepted we shall be on the point of a real breakthrough on the tariff problem and on the verge of a more enlightened era of tariff policy. The Minister for Trade and Industry has said that the question of the classioffer all possible help to Czechoslovakians fication of industries into those receiving high, medium and low rates of protection should be approached with great caution. 1 agree that it should be approached with caution, but for heaven's sake let us make sure that we not only approach it but also tackle it. We must not be like a frightened horse. It, too, approaches an obstacle with great caution, but shies away at the last moment. It is vital that this classification be made. Here, I am reminded of the old navigation axiom: 'If you do not know where you are, bow on earth do you know where you are going?' I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Ministerial Statement Immigration)-by leave-Last week this House unanimously approved a motion expressing its distress at events in Czechoslovakia and stating its sympathy for the people of that country in their ordeal. Yesterday, you, Mr Drury, asked me whether I could assure the House that the Australian Government will provide maximum facilities to enable refugees from Czechoslovakia to come to this country. In reply I said that, in the event of a refugee situation arising from the circumstances that have been precipitated upon Czechoslovakia, the Australian Government would respond as it has responded in similar situations in the past. I am sure that the question reflected the concern of other honourable members, and of the community generally, that Czechoslovakians wishing to begin a new life in Australia should have the opporAt this stage there is no suggestion that a major refugee situation has arisen. However, I have just received reports from overseas posts that there is a large number of Czechoslovakians temporarily in countries outside their homeland and that there is We have for many years been granting assisted passages to refugees from countries of eastern Europe, including Czechoslovakia. In line with this, I have instructed immigration posts overseas that they are to wishing to come to Australia for resettlement. leave to make a short statement. There being no objection, leave is granted. port the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Snedden). I assure him that the Opposition supports and appreciates any moves he may make to assist Czechoslovakian refugees. We believe that Czechoslovakians have been very good citizens in Australia. If we can facilitate the passage to Australia-possibl y under the assisted passage scheme-of Czechoslovakians who are not living in Czechoslovakia but in other parts of Europe we hope that the Minister takes the necessary measures. We fully support his attitude and the action that is proposed. Sitting suspended from 6.2 to 8 p.m. Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed. Deputy Speaker, before the suspension of the sitting [Quorum formed.] Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the vital necessity to support the proposal of the Tariff Board to classify industries into those receiving high, medium and low rates of protection.

98,Mr Street (Corangamite) [8.0],"M rfor this I used tbe old navigational axiom: 'If you do not know where you are, how on earth do you know where you are going?' I sincerely trust that reference to the Tariff Board of sections of chapter 84 of the tariff covering agricultural machinery is the first sign of the new era of tariff protection that I mentioned before the suspension of the sitting. Another most welcome sign is the reference under section 15(H) of the tariff in March 1968 involving case board and panelling. This reference, which was initiated by the Department of Trade and Industry, is to determine whether a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him. Section 15 (H) has not been used previously so this is one of the most important precedents in Australia's tariff history. I trust that it will be followed by many more such references that will enable the Tariff Board to fulfil its true function of contributing to the development and strength of the Australian economy. Obviously, it can do this only if it investigates possible cases of over-protection as well as cases for initial or increased protection. I believe that these decisions are welcome straws in the wind. I. hope that they are indicators of an awareness that economic conditions change, that the relative prosperity of sections of the community changes and that the order of national priorities changes over the years. What was a correct decision 30 or 40 years ago may not be correct today. The Tariff Board has recognised the necessity for a modern assessment of rates of protection. Of course, the decisions themselves have to be made by '.he Parliament. I hope that Parliament will be instrumental in formulating a programme to establish a tariff policy in Australia that is based on sound economic principles, with an appreciation of the problems caused by current demands on the rapidly expanding full employment economy and with a much greater appreciation of the wider issues involved than has been evident in recent years. debate one can cast one's net over a wide field. That being so, I take the first opportunity I have had since the sad events in Czechoslovakia one week ago to pay my tribute to the gallant Czech people and their Government. I trust that their undoubted courage and determination will prevail in these very difficult days through wbich they are going. Ever since I have been a member of this HouseI have believed that members of Parliament should endeavour to maintain good relations with, and develop understanding with, all the nations with which Australia has diplomatic relations. Accordingly, I am one of those who believe that there has been a positive trend in Soviet foreign policy over a period of time. I hope that the happenings of the past week are an aberration and an exception rather than the rule. I support: the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) in his speech on the Budget. It states: That all words after 'That', be omitted with a view lo inserting the following words in place thereof: this House is of opinion that the Budget is inadequate in that it does not make provision(a) to lighten taxes and health costs for families and to increase benefits for them, (b) In plan defence procurement and expenditure, (c) to meet the problems of Austialia's capital and provincial cities, and (d) to retain control and promote development of Australia's mineral, fuel, land and marine resources. I would like to discuss the amendment against the background of the claims made honourable members opposite. An attempt has been made to make some political capital out of that portion of the amendment that seeks provision to meet the problems of Australia's capital and provincial cities. I notice that members of the Australian Country Party have tried to draw the conclusion that in this section of the amendment the Australian Labor Party is turning its back on the people in rural areas. At this stage of the game I would like to give the lie to any such suggestion. The ALP believes in the well being of all sections of the Australian community. It recognises that there are substantial needs in road construction and in other fields in the capital cities, in the provincial cities and, indeed, in all the small towns in rural areas throughout Australia. I propose to discuss",47,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69
99,Mr Cross (Brisbane) [8.5],In a Budget,48,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69
100,By The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) And Other,"the Budget against the background of the Treasurer's claim that it is a social welfare Budget. The Treasurer said: IndeedI believe it will be clearly seen that the Government has placed the objective of helping the aged, the sick, and the needy in the forefront of its domestic programme. 1 do not think that the Government's claims are borne out by the figures contained in the Budget papers. Page3 of Statement No. 1 indicates that in the year ahead it is estimated that expenditure will increase as follows: Defence Services by 9%; payments to or for the States and State works and housing programmes by 7%; social services and repatriation benefits by 8%; Commonwealth payments to industry, principally primary industry, by 21%; departmental running costs by 7%; and external economic aid, including Papua and New Guinea by 14%. The estimated increase of 8% in benefits is just marginally ahead of the increase in the running cost of the Government. At page 5 of the document entitled 'National Income and Expenditure 1967-68' the increase in the gross national product for 1967-68 is shown as 4%, compared with a 6% increase in the previous year. Wages, salaries and supplements are also shown in that document as increasing by 8.3% in 1967-68 compared with 8.7% in 1966-67. We all know that the slight decrease has been caused by the effects of the drought experienced in that year. Therefore, an 8% increase in social welfare expenditure will not keep pace with the increased earnings in all other sections of the community. 1 suggest to the House that when one claims to have made great advances in fields like social welfare it is not merely necessary to do an exercise infigures;it is necessary to show also that the increase being given will keep pace with the increased wages and salaries, the increased prosperity and the increased welfare of all other sections of the community. If1 might make some comparisons, the income of trading companies increased by 11% in 1966-67 compared with 8% in the previous year, whereas on the other side of the picture we see that company taxes increased by 2.5c in the Si. In other words, company income increased from S2.2U0m to $2,437m for the year just gone, an increase of S237m, but the revenue from them will increase by S60m in a full year and will be substantially less in the currentfinancialyear. I believe that this is a Budget which has as its only purpose the keeping open of options for a possible early election but not otherwise to rock the boat by risking inflation or disturbing the supporters of laissez-faire economic policies and. therefore, supporters of the Government. I propose to speak principally on the social welfare aspects of the Budget, but before doing so 1 wish to say that I consider that the Government should give earnest consideration to developing ways and means of determining the areas of greatest need, rather than leaving pensioners and others at the mercy of political considerations. I believe that if we took account of the increase made in the pension and olher social service payments over the entire period that this Government has been in office we would find that there has been a curious coincidence between the increases and election years or near election years. : Indeed, if one were of a mind to believe these things, as I believe them, one would say that any increases in social welfare made by the Government had been motivated by the ballot box rather than the well-being of the people concerned. For example, in my speech on the Budget last year 1 drew attention to the rates of sickness and unemployment benefits. At lhat time the amount was $8.25, and it is still unchanged. In answer to a question this week I was told that the number of people registered for employment was shown as 61,000. In the Budget the anticipated expenditure on sickness and unemployment benefits will fall from $18,832,000 to $18,400,000, a drop of $432,000. We would all be happy to know that there will be a lesser number of people in Australia unemployed in the year ahead and we hope that the Government's predictions in this matter are correct. However, I believe that the reasons why other forms of social service payments and pensions were increased and why the unemployment and sickness benefit was not increased was the small numbers involved and the limited effect on the ballot box. it is a shocking thing to ask people to live on $8.25 a week. The last increase which was made was, if 1 recall correctly, given in February 1962 at a time when the rate of unemployment in this country had very recently shown a substantial effect on the ballot box. I refer to the 1961 election when the Government very nearly went out of office. Not only is the amount of S8.2S for an adult too small but there are great anomalies in amounts payable to persons aged 16 years or over. They receive S3.50 a week. Persons between the age of 18 and 21 years receive $4.75 a week. I believe that this very modest payment takes into account the belief that young people of this age will be living at home with their parents who will be substantially able to support them. It does not take into account the fact that they may have left home or may be orphans or may be young people whose fathers have passed away. The mother may be an invalid pensioner, in which case these young people are in very dire straits. I believe that My belief is that the Government should because of the small numbers involved and their limited effect on the ballot box no attention has been given to the unemployment and sickness benefit in this Budget. I would like to see the Commonwealth establish an institute for research into social welfare at one of the universities. It could be similar to the Institute of Applied Economic Research at the University of Melbourne or other similar organisations throughout Australia. I believe that the Commonwealth should finance a programme of research into social services, health, housing, education and, indeed, any mutter which is involved in the quality of question of health, but before doing so I Australian life. There are precedents for should like to say that although I have this. A programme of this kind should be pointed out some deficiencies in the system financed by Commonwealth money. We all in making social service payment increases, know that the Commonwealth provides a we on this side of the House welcome the great deal of assistance for research in some increases which have been made. It is a olher Melds, including this one, throughout great pity that Ihe Government does not the Australian community and the universiprogramme for increases of this kind perties. I believe that such an institute should haps year by year so that the pension and use the resources of the universities and other payments can be built up to a more voluntary organisations to find out where acceptable rate than they are at present. the greatest areas of need are. A problem which has existed for some given in the Budget to widows for the period time, which exists now, and which will of 12 weeks immediately after the death always remain is where to spend the $1 of their husband in order that they may in the area of greatest need. We all know enjoy the benefit of the married rate penthat the Department of Social Services and sion. I appreciate also the removal of the olher government departments accumulate qualification period of 1 year from widows records over a period of time, but the who have come to Australia and have knowledge that tbey obtain is not publicly shown that they intend permanently to available. No reports are published which give this information to members of Parliament and the public, and the people who may be needing assistance are left again to the political hazards of this Parliament. IfI may cite some examples, 1 recall that previous Ministers for Social Services have said in the Parliament that they did not think this was an avenue for the Government and welcomed some of the surveys made by private organisations. A number of surveys have been made in Australia. 1 mentioned one made by the Institute of Applied Economic Research into poverty in Melbourne, but there have also been specialised surveys in other areas, such as those conducted by Robb and Rivett in Marrickville, the Red Cross in Sydney, Jean Aitken-Swan on widows with dependent children in New South Wales, and Appleyard on housing needs of migrant families. finance at one of the Australian universities an institute of research into social welfare in order that proper programmes of research may be undertaken, the knowledge made public and this Parliament given an independent yardstick, apart from the information available on the Government side of the House through its departments. This would enable us to determine whether the people in the community who are in needy circumstances are being properly catered for. I now wish to refer fairly briefly to the On the matter of health I would I'ike to express my appreciation for the concessions reside in Australia. These are useful steps forward. However, there are a number of other fields of health to which I should like to see some attention given. I. think we all welcome the increase to $3 programme of research paid for by the a day for intensive care patients in nursing Commonwealth should be undertaken by homes, but the anomaly still exists that the subsidy of $2 a day for all other patients the universities. Independent research has remained unaltered for many years. would, I believe, show the areas of need According to my information the subsidy much better than we know them today. was last altered in December 1962, but 1 have a feeling that the rate of $2 may go the field of education. This year the Budget back earlier than that. I am one of those provides for an expenditure of $27m over a people who always welcome assistance to 3-year period-presumabl y $9m per annum local nursing homes and particularly the -to provide libraries for secondary schools. small suburban convalescent homes. I The section of the Treasurer's speech which believe that it is very important for old refers to the provision of libraries for people who believe that they are becoming secondary schools also mentions the successtoo much of a burden for their family or ful programme for providing science need nursing rather than merely care at laboratories. Every member of the House, home to be able to go into some local home certainly every member of the Opposition, rather than into some much larger instituwelcomes the increased Commonwealth intion which might be a considerable distance volvement in education. Indeed, it is part from where their families and friends reside. of the policy of the Australian Labor Party, At present, assistance is given through the if elected to office, to hold a full and comAged Persons Homes Act.

But surely any goreduced to the married rate and, unless their vernment that was sincere about wanting families are able to support them or unless to improve education would see that cothe convalescent home can make concesordination took place.

This is are a disgrace. The present arrangements a field of activity that should be looked at are not resulting in the money being put but not through the eyes of a government where the need is greatest. Once again the department. I am not attacking the governCommonwealth has failed to respond ta ment departments; but the information supplied by departments is available to Ministers and the Government but is not available to the public or members of the Opposition. In fields such as health a proper I welcome the increased involvement in I have been to some very fine science one trained science teacher. It is not of much use providingfinebuildings and equipment if these schools do not have properly pressures from this side of the House, churches and other sections of the community, and I expect from back bench members on the other side of the House. The Commonwealth has felt that it had to make a further gesture to increase Commonwealth involvement in education. But I will be surprised if any person well informed in the field of education regards this as being the best way in which the Commonwealth could become further involved. As one member on this side of the House who has taken some interest in Aboriginal affairs, I welcome the fact that for the first time we have SlOm allocated for the well being of Aboriginals throughout Australia. We do not have much information on the way this money is to be spent. A lot will depend on this. When we consider the large number of Aboriginals there are in Australia, we realise that this field has been neglected for many years. It has been completely neglected by the Commonwealth because until recently it has not sought to amend the Constitution since the days of the Chifley Government. Expenditure on Aboriginals has been limited also by the financial resources of the States. I hope that the Minister in Charge of Aboriginal Affairs( Mr Wentworth) will keep the Parliament apprised of how the money allocated in the Budget will be spent. It seems to me that this amount is small. I suppose one should be thankful for small mercies. But at least it is a step in the right direction. I hope that as far as possible this money will be disbursed through Commonwealth departments rather than through State Aboriginal welfare departments and the like. If we are going to give Aboriginals the opportunity to be assimilated in our community or to be integrated within their own communities, which I believe should be the case, we should not encourage them to be dependent on the State Aboriginal welfare departments. I am not saying this to reflect on these departments, which in some ways do good work but which in other ways adopt a paternalistic and possessive attitude thinking they own the Aboriginals rather than that the Aboriginals own them. I do not propose to keep the House any later in this session. Therefore, this section longer except to say that I have listened of the amendment is an obvious piece of to a number of budgets in this Parliament. band-wagoning. Speaking to paragraph (c) None of them has been very spectacular. Most of them have just jogged along. None has explored new avenues of welfare and none has distributed among the whole Australian community the prosperity that exists among smaller sections of the community. This is the Budget of a government that has been in office for too long; which has run out of steam; which has sought not to rock the boat but to take a minimum return in increased company taxation to make small concessions to pensioners and others. It is keeping the options open for a possible election this year and a certain election next year. The Budget has provided for some welcome steps forward but by and large it will be very disappointing to the Australian community. The House should carry the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition and condemn this most unsatisfactory document. I notice that the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Cross) mentioned relations with Czechoslovakia. BeforeI commence my speech on the BudgetI would like to say just briefly that I flew with some very gallant Czechs and as a result of having fought with them in other skies I cannot do other than grieve deeply at their plight and pray, as I know they do, for those who still live in their homeland. I must say that generally the Budget has been received favourably throughout the country. Of course, there are some who are not satisfied. There are some who never will be satisfied and some who cannot afford to be. Naturally I speak of the Opposition. But I think the man in the street expected an increase in direct taxation lo pay for the increases in social service payments and benefits. The man in the street was agreeably surprised when this did art occur. The Leader of the Opposition { Mr Whitlam), in his amendment, which I reject wholeheartedly, said that the Budget failed to plan defence procurement and expenditure. The Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) has stated in this chamber repeatedly that a defence review is currently taking place and that he will make a statement about it",48,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69
101,Mr Calder (Northern Territory) [8.27],"of his amendment, the Leader of the Opposition made much of the lack of roads, railways and sewerage. He specifically mentioned sewerage and spent some time on this subject. Let me read from the 'Civil Works Programme 1968-69'. It gives details of the following works: Darwin-connectio n of sewerage to hospital; exassociated services; amount authorised, $120,856; penditure to 30th June 1968, $54,330. Darwin-Rapid Creek sub-division-Construc tion of sewerage, roads and drainage and provision of water supply; expenditure lo 30th June 1968, $715,886.

Darwin-Casuarin a sub-division-Constructio n of roads, drainage and sewerage and provision of water supply; expenditure to 30th June 1968, $961,265. Yet the Leader of the Opposition said that nothing was being spent on sewerage. The list continues: Darwin-Escarpmen t tion of roads, drainage, sewerage and provision of water supply; expenditure to 30th June 1968, $287,792; to be spent after 30th June 1968, $52,313. He said nothing was being spent on sewerage in the towns and cities. Did he not look at this document? It continues: Darwin-Alaw a sub-division (stage 2)-Con struction of roads, drainage, sewerage and provision of water supply; amount authorised, $1,044,059; expenditure to 30th June 1968, $811,504; to be spent after 30th June 1968, $232,555.

Darwin-Ludmill a Creek sub-division-Con struction of roads, drainage and sewerage and provision of water supply and associated services; to be spent after 30th June 1968, $429,984. There are plenty of items here and I will continue witb them because I think they should be on record. The Leader of the Opposition said that nothing was being done, but this list goes on: Alice Springs-Constructio n of sewerage scheme (stages 4 and 5); expenditure to 30th June 1968. $153,521; to be spent after 30th June 1968, $37,864.

Alice Springs-Constructio n of sewage treatment ponds (stage 2), $115,000. The Leader of the Opposition took nearly as long as 1 have just taken saying that nothing was being done. The statements of the Leader of the Opposition can be refuted by facts such as I have given. As usual, his statements are not backed by the facts and 1 suggest his other arguments are similarly lacking in truthful backing. The Prime Minister made this point when speaking in the House last night. sub-division-ConstrucI come back to the Budget. Provision is made for an increase of 13.8% in Government expenditure in the Northern Territory. This expenditure is now in the vicinity of S40m in addition to the cost of beef roads, which amounts to $8,585,000. Under this Government the Territory is having one of its most exciting and progressive times. This is shown by the figures. The value of buildings in the Northern Territory in the first half of this year amounted to $20.4m, which is more than the total for the whole of last year. Savings bank deposits this year were nearly double what they were 5 years ago. Motor vehicle registrations rose steadily to 17,865 in December 1967. They rose by 2,100 in 12 months. The port of Darwin saw its exports doubled since 1966. The figure for 1967-68 was 282,000 tons valued at $15.6m. The drought bond scheme, which is mentioned in the Budget, is very welcome indeed. It should spell new hope for families that have been battling in the outback for years. I hope that under this scheme pastoralists will be able to insure against crippling droughts and devastating bush fires. They should be able to release their losses by purchasing stock. After the last drought these men had to breed up their herds laboriously again. This scheme will encourage self help and self reliance, as the Governor General said in his address and in his Budget speech. Most of the north is enjoying an excellent season, so the more quickly use can be made of this scheme the better it will be for the economy. It should be a self-servicing drought relief scheme. 1 ask that, when these drought bonds are recognises the urgent need to carry out implemented, too strict a limitation will not work on this road. SoI hope something will be placed on the amount at any one time. be done. For instance, an owner who started the dry time with the equivalent of $150,000 in the bank, an unencumbered property and a herd, finished the period with about the same upgraded at a cost of about $2m.

103,Mates. But May I Say Briefly That The Beef Member For Grey ( Mr Jessop),"to heedproblems. Last week the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Sinclair) in answer to a question asked in this House stated: In the long term perspective it is necessary, with increased volumes of goods being shipped out of and into Darwin, for the standard of port facilities to be continually improved. It is into this phase that an inquiry is being made amongst the relevant departments within the Commonwealth Government, each of which has some responsibility for the upgrading of the port. The Minister went on to say that there was another problem confronting the port. Then he said: It is one which the people of the Northern Territory themselves can help to alleviate by directing the attention of those who are unnecessarily causing industrial unrest on the waterfront to the cost impost that they are producing for all the other people in the Darwin community. So, to sum up the problems on the Darwin wharves, we must have new wharf facilities and we Territorians must remove the Communist domination on the Darwin waterfront. The superphosphate bounty will be increased from $6 to $8 per ton of standard superphosphate. The weight of approved compounds of trace elements incorporated in superphosphate will receive bounty at the same rate as the superphosphate. This has been done to encourage greater use of superphosphate as a means of increasing production for export. Sales of superphosphate expanded rapidly from 2.8 million tons in 1962-63 to 4.2 million tons in 1965-66. This bounty should provide the incentive to bring the superphosphate industry to Darwin. I turn now to pensions. Pensions are fixed incomes. The Budget has provided for increases in both age and Service pensions. Hospital benefits have been increased and additional assistance has been provided for home nursing services. I repeat that pensions are fixed incomes. When you move 1,000 to 2,000 miles from here things cost more and money does not go so far. Tbis is elementary. Supplies are liable to run short. The benefit of an increase in pensions is whittled away, but there is no taxation zone allowance for people trying to live on the pension. There is a strong case for the provision of a northern differential to equalise this fixed income with those in the south. This comment also applies to war service home loans and to homes savings grants. It must be remembered that one-third of the cost of a home in the north goes in freight. So my previous argument applies to these questions as well. I commend the Government on the proposal to establish an Aboriginal trust fund. Admittedly the Government is spending $7m on Aboriginal affairs in the Northern1 Territory, but of the $10m which is to be spent as a result of this Budget, $5m will be in the form of non-repayable grants. I gather from the breakdown of this figure that the Northern Territory can expect to receive $lm for special projects, some in respect of individuals and some in respect of community efforts. So we should now see Tim Jabangardi and his miners at Yuendumu, who have been amassing a supply of copper over the years, get their copper show going. They are in need of this sort of assistance. There are many other such ventures. There is a tourist venture at Jay Creek and there are various cattle ventures at Hermannsburg. This assistance will be of great benefit to Aboriginals. For those who doubt what I have been saying I say to them: Come to the Territory. In the last minute or so before I close I would like to read an article from the 'Northern Territory News' of 25th June 1968. I think most honourable members would know that this newspaper does not always support this Government. The article states: A dangerous new game seems to have been developed in which the Northern Territory's 'Aboriginal problem' is the football. Not New South Wales' or West Australia's, or Queensland's Aboriginal problem . . . just the Northern Territory's. The players are an assorted bag of characters including some quite notable identities, egged on from the sidelines by political agitators, professional do-gooders and a gaggle of ill informed if well-intentioned folk who appear to have become suddenly conscious-stricken at a most inappropriate time. The game could be called 'Stirremup'. Further on it states: It's difficult to know whether these gentlemen and many others like them are just bandwagoning at a time when the national conscience has been aroused, and Government agencies are well advanced with education programmes and legislation aimed at bringing some measure of equal rights to the Aboriginal peoples of this part of Australia, or whether they sincerely believe they are giving impetus to the cause. Further on it stales: They ignore the costly and progressive education programmes that Welfare Branch in the Territory has built up over a number of years until there are now over 5,000 Aboriginal children at schools. They ignore the legislation already introduced aimed at wiping out all discriminatory laws. cons all of us into believing that pensioners They ignore the fact that in matters affecting Aboriginal rights and welfare, Ihe Northern Territory is a long way ahead of any of the States. It concludes as follows: The players of this game will better serve the people they claim to wish to help, by putting away only hope that the kissing episode, in which their bats and scoresheets. They should learn a little more about what has been, and is being attempted by the people in a position to really do ticipate between himself and some women something, and then come up with some really practical ideas, on employment for instance, if they have any. That article was written by the editor of the newspaper. He has lived in the Territory for years. I say again to those who have any doubt about what T have been saying: Come to the Territory, as the Minister for the Interior( Mr Nixon) has done on four occasions since taking the portfolio and as the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) will shortly be doing for the second time since June this year. The future of Australia is in the north. night the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) has listed a long programme of sewerage and other works which are to be carried out by the Government in his electorate. I would have thought that the honourable member might have refrained from exposing the Government for its lack of interest in the Territory over a period of 19 years. It has 'taken the Government 19 years to recognise the need for the work to be done. I believe that this is an indictment of the Government's maladministration over a long period. progress. it is very late. Despite the plaudits the extent of the Treasurer's popularity and from bis own colleagues and the acclaim of fied with the Government's handling of the the Press barons for the 1968-69 Budget, national economy, especially in the light of which has generally been praised as being increased taxation at a time when the a welfare Budget, I find myself in complete nation's resources are bursting at their seams disagreement with the sentiments expressed. and are crying out to be used. In every I support the amendment moved by my Budget that the Government has been Leader, which I think highlights the Budget's responsible for, Treasurer after Treasurer deficiencies to the letter. I believe that has stressed and has continually instilled students of finance and all fair-minded into the minds of the people the fear that people will condemn the Budget for what it isa crafty, cruel and harsh document, void of compassion, conceived and designed to deceive in particular those people who have to rely on it to eke out an existence. It are living to a standard much higher than they really are. The truth of the matter is that everybody in the lower income bracket, including the pensioner, is having his standard of living systematically reduced. I the Treasurer appeared to be keep to parpensioners on the morning of Tuesday, 13th August, will not be taken as a licence by him further to reduce the pensioners' base standard of living as he bas done in I his Budget. It is morally wrong for the Government to give with one hand and to take back with the other, as the Treasurer has done in this Budget, in the form of sales tax increases on the consumer goods which are used by every man, woman and child in Australia. After the presentation of the Budget it was most noticeable that the Treasurer was being snubbed by even those who earlier had been keen to kiss him. It has been said in the lobbies that the Budget is an election Budget and that an election will be held before the end of the year. AllI can say is that if an election is held this year it will have been put on before the people who live on fixed incomes feel the adverse effect of increased living costs which must surely follow increases in sales tax and rising costs of living as a result of further wage increases the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is obliged to grant to workers in industry.

107,Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) Has Received Seeing Whether The People Are Really Satis,"inflation is lurking around some corner or other. This Budget is no exception because it contains a veiled threat or two as to what could occur should the economy become unbalanced. I am sure that this wishful thinking is only being indulged in to keep a Labor Government out of office, just as for years the Prime Minister of the day and members of the Government canvassed the Communist bogy at election after election. In my view much of the material contained in the Treasurer's Budget Speech could have been eliminated for it does not make sense to thousands and thousands of people who listened to it. In fact, over tbe past few years the Budget has been presented to the Parliament in a different form each year. It is becoming much more complicated for members to understand in tbe time available to them between its presentation and the ensuing debate. The movement of funds through accounting procedures somewhat intrigues me. For instance, in statement No. 2 attached to the Budget, dealing with the estimates of expenditures Commonwealth expenditures are estimated to increase by $478,930,000, or 7.8 per cent, to $6,590,887,000 in 1968-69. The estimates for 1968-69 arc compared in summary form with actual expenditures in 1966-67 and 1967-68 in the following table.

S9O.553.OO0: 1967-68 actual, $132,138,000: 1968-69 estimate, SI 22.352.000. Tables setting out the composition of the various items of expenditure and notes on the main variations follow. for 1968-69, one sees the letter (a) beside several of the items. Those items relate to the movement of thousands of millions of dollars; so I do not suppose they are very important after all. However, underneath the figures this explanation appears: (a) Some of the figures for 1966-67 and '1967-68 have been adjusted for accounting changes to place them on a basis comparable with the eslimates for 1968-69. That is all we are told. The amount of money involved is not revealed. But if one looks at the 1967-68 Budget, particularly tables 1 and 2 which contain a summary of Commonwealth receipts and expenditures for the years 1953-54 to 1966-67, an explanatory note of the movement of ihe funds I have been referring to will be found. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate the two tables in Hansard so that my speech will become a little more intelligent to those who study the figures and so that the business of financing the Government may remain continually within the public gaze.

Honourable members should social services and repatriation benefits, etc., not have to browse through the papers in the Press barons and members of the order to inform themselves on this subject. Government cry: 'From where will the finance come to implement these promises?' A week or two ago the Treasurer was credited with saying in a television interview that the Government was considering 1953-54 the defence do a reduction in pay as you earn taxation for people in the $1,000 to $10,000 income group. Tbat, of course, was just another of nation has not been at war. In the same the Treasurer's gimmicks. But should income period the vote for national welfare paytax be reduced, I ask whether the Treasurer 'Thisments has increased to a similar extent. intends to use increased bank loans to finance the proposition or to increase $1,217,160,000, which is an increase ovor indirect taxation, as he is doing in this last year of $111,726,000. The vote for the Budget, to offset the increased benefits he National Welfare Fund is $1,160,512,000, has given to pensioners. Already in the Auswhich tralian Capital Territory pensioners' rents are being increased by 41c for married tenants and 20c for single pensioners. One thing is certain: It is that the Government sociul welfare services and comes entirely will not be able to repeat next year the out type of Budget the Treasurer has brought whereas the defence vote is heavily \i:bdown this year and get away with it.

Actions speak louder than words, in my i would like to know whether the Australian people are receiving value for the vast amount of money being spent on defence. I not think they are. Since vote has increased almost fourfold, although officially the year the vote for defence purposes is is an increase over last year of $85,463,000. Of course, the great different is that the national welfare vote is divided among twenty-two different categories of of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, sidised from the Loan Fund, the amount charged to the Loan Fund in 1967-68 being In view of the efforts of the Prime opinion the Government's claim amounts to nothing more than another gimmick, as a perusal of taxation statistics will show. The Because the bottom had fallen out of the Government bleeds taxes from everybody, down to and including the kids earning a paltry $416 a year. I remind the House that under a Labor Government married taxpayers earning the basic wage were not required to pay income tax. Taxation statistics show that today about two million taxpayers are earning less than $36 a week. After the Government takes its chop out of such earnings in the form of pay-as-youearn income tax and increased sales tax on such items as ice cream, confectionery, school requisites, detergents, soaps, stationery and sports goods it will be seen that the Treasurer's concern for the underdog emerges in the form of concern for profit. Is it any wonder that his dear old pensioner friends did not offer to kiss him after he had delivered his Budget Speech? Is it not a fact that pensioners have to shop in the same shops as millionaires frequent? Will somebody tell me why Loan Fund finance cannot be provided to finance substantial increases in all classes of social welfare payments, including unemployment and sickness benefits? Will somebody tell me why earlier this year farmers in Queensland were allowed to bury their banana and pineapple crops while large numbers of people were too poor to purchase fruit? Are we to believe that it is proper to spend hundreds of millions of dollars of Loan Fund finance in the purchase of Mirage or F ill aircraft, motor vehicles and ships nothing has been done to eliminate the many for defence and write off the loss by the cancellation of Treasury bills when they crash, while at the same time allowing production to rot on the farms for lack of finance? This is what we seem to be doing. If the small people of this country allow their Government to continue with its present system of financing they will deserve that unemployment and sickness benefits all that is handed out to them by way of depleted pensions, the value of which will be reduced considerably in the next few months by the increased cost of the commodities to wbich I have referred, which will be brought about by the increase of 2±% in sales tax. Every householder has to buy ice cream, confectionery, soaps, detergents, soft drinks and stationery, all of which will increase in price because of increased sales tax. Recently the honourable member for Gellibrand and I saw beautiful pineapples growing on farms in Queensland. pineapple market the fruit was rotting on the ground while shopkeepers in New South Wales and elsewhere were charging more than 20c each for pineapples. At some farms pineapples were offered for sale at as low as $1 a case, with no buyers. Does anybody mean to tell me that some Loan Fund Finance could not have been made available to enable marketing authorities to send that fruit to the cities and towns where it could have been distributed amongst sick pensioners and other needy members of the community, if not sold in the markets? Pensioners may rest assured that there is every possibility of costs further increasing in the next few months due to increases in wages as other cost factors are passed on. Notwithstanding the Prime Minister's announcement earlier this year that a committee of Cabinet would be appointed to make a comprehensive examination of existing health and social welfare schemes, the provision in this Budget for social services leaves much to be desired. It is clear beyond doubt that the Government is intent on playing pensioner against pensioner in its quest for the political support of pensioners, because we see an ever-widening gap in the types of social service benefits payable, whether they be rates of pension, health benefits or funeral benefits. In my view anomalies which exist in the Social Services Act and the Repatriation Act. The Government steadfastly refuses to give full effect to its legislation. There is more resentment in the community now over entitlement to pensions and other benefits than at any other time. A perusal of the Budget papers will show have not been increased for more than 6 years. Can any honourable member imagine the humiliation suffered by a married man with a wife and children who is foroed to live on about $17 a week? A single person in receipt of unemployment or sickness benefit receives only $8.25 a week, whilst a single minor receives between $3.50 and $4.75 a week, according to age. I know of case after case of unemployed persons having their unemployment benefit cancelled simply because they had not been able to comply with the regulations laid down by the Department of Labour and National Service and had not been able to submit work returns-or to satisfy the Department that they have been genuinely seeking work. How can a married person be expected to search for work in cities and at places of industry while living 6 to 20 miles or more from potential places of employment and receiving an income of only $8.25 a week? The fare aspect alone rules out any hope of such people obtaining employment. Once again, I say to the Government that fares or travel warrants will have to be provided for all unemployed persons to enable them properly to search for work. The official figures give the number of unemployed at lst August as 61,000, but there are hundreds of others who are not registered for work, simply because departmental officers refuse to believe that they want work. In my view, every person who is unemployed or ill should be in receipt of some benefit, regardless of the circumstances responsible for his situation. The Government's claim that this is a welfare Budget is hooey. Even Government supporters accept the fact that only 54% of the people who are qualified by age receive an age pension. No-one as yet has been able to determine the number or percentage of men and women who, because of ill health or for some other reason, are virtually unemployable and are not receiving any government social service benefit. People who fall into this category are widows under 50 without children, widows who are under 45 when the youngest child turns 16, and persons who are classified as being approximately 50% to 84% incapacitated, as well as de facto and former de facto wives. The treatment handed out to these people is indeed shocking, for it virtually compells them to perform acts of dishonesty and depravity foreign to Christian ideals. I. ask: Is there one member of this House who would himself employ any man or woman from whom he could expect lo receive only a 20% or 50% working effort? It is people such as these who are virtually starving in our community today and who are without medical services simply because they have not the money to pay for the service they need. If the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) is honest in his prediction that Australia will become a welfare state, why does he not immediately take the first step towards that end by making section 124 of the Social Services Act really work? This Government's continued widening of the gap between the standard rate pension for single persons and the rate for married couples is somewhat alarming because, in the final analysis, by adopting this approach, the Government is impoverishing the married base rate pensioner, as can be seen in whatever comparisons one chooses to make. The single rate pension, inclusive of the supplementary allowance, will shortly be SI6 a week, and the rate for married couples will give them a total of S25 a week. Already the Government has announced rent increases for pensioners occupying government homes. I hate to think how much rent married pensioners renting privately owned homes are being asked to pay today. Married pensioners occupying their own homes are even worse off. In addition to having to meet maintenance and insurance costs, tbey are required to pay land and water rates, which alone come to a minimum of more than $2 a week. Added to these expenses is the cost of light and fuel. All these costs must be met out of an income of $25 a week. To illustrate the extent to which some base rate pensioner couples become impoverished, let me mention a case that came to my notice recently. The couple concerned were aged 48 and 49 years respectively, and they occupied a Housing Commission home. When the husband died a few weeks ago, it was found that he and his wife had at least six cash loans outstanding to five different finance companies. At the date of his death, the balance owing on the loans was $768. The fortnightly payments came to $41 leaving the couple S6 a fortnight on which to live and pay their rent. Details of the loans were: Amount of loan Repayments outstanding per fortnight $ $ Workers Cash Order and Finance Co. Ltd 68 6 Australian Cash Orders Ud 225 10 Wattons Ltd 247 9.50 Kayles Pty Ltd 84 3.50 Dickens and Carey Pty Ud 120 10 Dickens and Carey Ply Ltd 24 2 I am aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that some honourable members will say: ""What of it? These people are masters of their own affairs and are responsible for what they do.' But I wonder whether such people really understand the consequences of their own actions. I believe that in their hunger and ignorance they become caught up with unscrupulous high pressure canvassers for finance companies v/ho pitch all sorts of yarns to snare the ignorant into a trap from which there is no escape. I consider that this Parliament should, by legislation, protect such people against companies of the kind that T have just named. Among the 46% of the people who are of pensionable age but are not pensioners are thousands of retired public servants and their wives who receive a gross income from superannuation of between $50 and $60 a week. These people are paying dearly today for the thrift and enterprise that they displayed during their working lives. Many of these couples are now much worse off than is the maximum rate pensioner couple who receive a supplementary income of $34 a fortnight in addition to the pension and who, after the proposed increase in benefits takes effect, will receive Department of Health by at least examining a maximum income of $84 a fortnight. If a superannuitant couple's income is reduced by the income tax paid, together with payments in respect of which pensioners receive concessions, and like amounts are added to the maximum income of the pensioner couple, a fairly accurate comparison can be made. For this purpose, let me illustrate the cases of a pensioner and a public servant each having expenses similar to those that 1 have to meet. The gross income of an age pensioner couple, after the proposed increase of $3 a fortnight becomes effective, will be $84 a fortnight, or $2,184 per annum. Add to this figure the $258 that he would be paid in tax on that income by someone not a pensioner, $46 for land rates, $78 for medical and hospital benefit fund contributions, at least $104 that the pensioner couple are saved by the pensioner medical service and free pharmaceutical service, $35 for the concession on television and radio licences, and, at a conservative estimate, $20 for fare concessions. This gives a total of $2,725 per annum. Now we turn to a superannuitant couple with thirty-four units of superannuation, giving a gross income of $3,094 a year. After allowing for concessional deductions, income tax would be equivalent to ninetwentieths of $282, making the tax $127. If we deduct also $46 for land rates, $68 for medical and pharmaceutical expenses, $78 for contributions to hospital and medical benefit funds, $35 for television and radio licences, this being the amount of the concession to pensioners, and $20 for fares, this being the equivalent of the fare concessions to pensioners, the total deductions come to $374. Deducted from the gross income of $3,094, this leaves the superannuitant couple with $2,720. So they are worse off than the maximum rate age psnsioner couple. Indeed, my comparison is somewhat marginal, as numerous superannuitants would incur medical and pharmaceutical costs much heavier than those which I have taken into account. These people are living at standards foreign to them and much lower than they deserve. TonightI appeal to the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) to introduce a little realism into the administration of the the difficulties under which superannuitants in all classifications live with respect to payment for health services. I refer particularly to retired mine workers, whose health in the main is much worse than that of the average retired worker. Mine workers are compulsorily retired at 60 and are not entitled to an age pension until they are 65, unless they are ex-servicemen, when they may obtain it at 60. Why the Government refuses to extend entitlement to medical and hospital benefits free of charge to retired mine worker superannuitants is impossible to comprehend. I again ask the Government to review this aspect of its policy and to grant pensioner medical cards at least to all pensioners whose net income is equivalent to or below the total of the maximum age pension and associated benefits. There are some very commendable new social welfare benefits in this Budget. The Minister for Social Services is to be given all possihle credit for their introduction, and it will be interesting to see how they work. Order!

On the other hand France has weakened NATO by the withdrawal of its armed forces from the integrated command and its stated doubt as to its remaining in NATO after 1969.

J would like to refer for a while to the tragic invasion of Czechoslovakia by the troops under the direction and control of the Soviet Union. I am sure that all Australians will feel sympathy for the people of Czechoslovakia, but they should not be surprised at this latest example of Russian savagery, for the Communist forces were only being consistent with the philosophy they have espoused for the past half century. Their philosophy is one of repression of the right of thetr own people, and of the people of other countries, to have some say in the type of government they desire and the type of life they wish to follow. The Czechoslovakians had committed a cardinal sin against the basic tenets of Communism. this organisation, should Their Government bad decided to give them the right of free speech-withi n limits of course. It had decided to allow freedom of the Press-wit h inbuilt self-censorship I think we may be wrong in assuming Were those in the Kremlin afraid the buffers between Russia and West Germany would be weakened? Were they afraid of their own vocal minority who were clamouring, in a rather muted way, for greater freedom of expression? Or were they afraid of the great inarticulate masses in the Soviet Union who despise their Communist dictators and yearn for the life that is taken for granted in the West? Whatever are many other possibilities-neithe r any ground one, nor a combination of them, can justify the West can win out against these insidious tactics the actions taken by the Soviet leaders is to be constantly on guard and to realise that against this fellow Communist colony. I even though the tactics used may vary, the aim must confess that to me the invasion was only not a great surprise, but a logical move in the Russian pattern for world conquest.

Only movement that was so brutally crushed by the methods used to attain this aim vary in their the Russians. They had a sense of distechniques. The aim of eventual world conquest is illusionment, extreme bitterness and coman avowed one-it is a deadly serious one, and it is immutable and never changing. It was plete hopelessness in the face of Russia's enunciated by Mara, confirmed by Lenin, and has cynical, barbaric and sadistic brutality.

111,"Mr Arthuri Hope That The Honourguard Against The Insidious, Subtle And Often","this infamous act. But, more than this, 1 feel we should have refused to trade with these countries while this crisis exists. It is means test for other pensions. A man is useless Australians professing to be supporting the Czechoslovakians in this crisis without being willing to make some sacrifice to give effect to our impassioned, sincere protests. I think I know the Australian people well enough to say that they are willing to give help in some practical way to the Czechoslovakian people, even if it means some personal sacrifice on their part. I emphatically reject the cunning suggestion put forward by the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) that by our protests we are expressing support for the Communist Government of Czechoslovakia. What we are doing, and what the Australian Government and people have always done, is to express horror at the fact that a large and powerful nation can, by force of arms, the use of murder and the slaughter of innocent people, take over, in an act of open and brutal aggression, a smaller country, whatever its political system. This certainly does not imply that we are giving our approval to the government of the conquered country; it is a simple statement of an ideal which I trust the Australian Government and people will always espouse. We have done it in relation to Vietnam, and we have done it in relation to this further act of aggression by the Communists in Czechoslovakia. Any inconsistency certainly does not exist on our side of the House. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to comment on other aspects of the Budget-thos e nearer home. I commend the Government on its decision to raise the limit of war service homes loans from $7,000 to $8,000. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that the Government will, in the future, see its way clear to correct an anomoiy in the War Service Homes Act by making loans available to single ex-servicemen and exservicewomen. There are many former nurses, to take one example, who, perhaps because of the period spent in war service, have never, and will never, marry. I feel it is wrong to debar them from war service loans, just as it is wrong to debar any single the Opposition regarding the pension, I canex-servicemen in a similar situation. While on the subject of ex-servicemen vernment has ever reduced the age pension, and ex-servicewomen, I would like to see and that was a Labor government. I feel several changes in the Repatriation Act. I that the way to tackle this problem is to feel it is wrong to include war pensions as income for the purpose of calculating the given a war pension because he has suffered some disability as a result of his war service. It is really a compensation, not a pension, in the general use of the word. I think it logically follows that this compensation should be above and outside any other pension to which he may be entitled, and I would like to see this come about. I believe also that the funeral benefit should be increased. It is an unreal figure and has no relation to present day costs. I believe that it would be a compassionate move to give full repatriation medical treatment to all ex1 servicemen over the age of 70 years. The number is, unfortunately, not large, but the human advantage to these people of being able to be treated amongst their fellow ex-servicemen is a great one. In the field of health, I commend the Government on the compassionate measures it has introduced, especially the increased subsidy for home nursing. This will fill a long felt need. I commend also the raising of the subsidy to approved nursing homes for patients suffering from chronic, preexisting or long term illnesses and the introduction of a supplementary benefit of from $2 to $5 a day for those patients in intensivecare nursing homes. I share the hope expressed by many of my constituents that the hospitals will not use this as an opportunity to raise their fees by the same amount and so give no real benefit to the patients. I feel sure that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton), both of them kindly people-lik e some of our friends opposite-agre e with me that it would be a good thing if age, invalid arid widow's pensions could be taken away from the political field and made the responsibility of a non-political, impartial body which could work towards the abolition of the means test and the payment of a pension that would allow aged people not just to live a life of bare existence but to spend their last years in the dignity and comfort which they have surely earned. When I hear the protestations from not help but remember that only one gohave a detailed survey to find out the problems and needs of the aged, invalid and widows, and then to recast our social service programme to fit these needs. For example, we have a rental subsidy for those who pay high rents. But there are many pensioners who are paying off their home -and paying high costs for repairs and maintenance of old homes-whos e needs are not catered for. There are also many people on fixed incomes that are just beyond the pension limit who have precisely the same medical, pharmaceutical and hospital costs and yet they get no assistance. This whole field, in'niy opinion, needs a disregard for the needs of the peoplea thorough examination and I hope the Minispattern which seems to typify Labor governter for Social Services will direct some of ments; indeed all Socialist governmentshis undoubted great talents to this end. And Mr Askin had to undo many of the stagnatwhen we replenish those small leaflets which ing policies which had typified the Labor are ostensibly a guide for pensioners, for mis-rule, and the people of New South goodness sake let us express them in simple Wales showed at the recent election that language and in large print so that agoj they heartily approve of Mr Askin's people, whose eyesight is generally not Government.

116,Mr Birrelli Suggest That The Hon,"amendment so eloquently moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). I. believe that the Budget is a regressive document and, like all previous budgets of the past few years, has been carefully and deliberately designed to act narshly against the vast majority of Australian people, including pensioners, widows, those covered by repatriation benefits and the work force. When I refer to the work force I mean all those people who are working for wages and salaries in industry and commerce, regardless of whether they wear blue collars or white collars. If one cares to peruse the Budgets of the last 2 years in which the Treasurer terms as 'the best performance of recent years' and 'the present bouyant economic conditions' one will see that in 1966-67 the gross national product rose by between 5% and 6% and average weekly earnings rose by close to 7%, whereas the comparativefiguresfor both these indicators in 1967-68 was 6% in each case. Thus we find that out of the huge increases in income received by the Treasury by way of income tax and sales tax due to the increased average weekly earnings and the rise in the work force of over 200,000 during this period, and in spite of price rises approximating 7% in the 2 years in question, the aged, the sick, those in receipt of repatriation benefits and other sections in need of help did not receive lc from this so-called increased performance. In the Treasurer's own words, at page 6 of his circulated Budget speech: Payments from the National Welfare Fund relating mainly to age, invalid and widows' pensions, child endowment, medical and hospital benefits, pharmaceutical benefits and other health services are expected to increase by $8Sm. . . This will make a total expenditure from the National Welfare Fund of $1,161m. He continued: Expenditure on repatriation pensions and beneso ago. The husband on reaching the age fits is expected to total $286m, this year, a rise of 65 years was retrenched. He applied of S25m. The total of the increase in these two aged 58 iyears, who has had 10 children, fields of expenditure will be SI 10m. Howbas not worked for wages for almost 40 ever, in the next breath the Treasurer years, has no skills other than those of a announced that company tax would bring housewife and mother, is now expected an increase of S56.5m this year, sales tax to seek employment in order to ensure S34m, broadcasting and television licence that during the next 18 months she and fees S5m and Post Office tariffs S5m. her husband will be able to exist. This These amounts, plus light dues, air navigation charges and passenger service charges will at least equal the sum allocated for the miserable increases in social service, health and repatriation benefits. The whole of this amount will, either directly or indirectly, in the final analysis be borne by the wage and salary earner. By this I mean that those extra charges made against companies will be passed on-plus-in the form of increased prices. In the field of social services I desire once again to raise what I firmly believe to be the worse feature of an overall very inferior social service structure, that is, the continual refusal to grant to the wife of an aged pensioner a similar benefit regardless of her age. Week after week most honourable members receive inquiries on this malter from couples in the terrible position where, because the wife is under 60 years of age, she is not eligible for a pension. The Treasurer and the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) know only too well that most people caught in this tragic and frightening situation are forced by financial necessity to use whatever influence possible, lawful or otherwise, in an effort to obtain either an invalid pension or a wife's allowance in order to exist. The only alternative to that is that one of the couple must endeavour to obtain some type of employment, which everyone knows is virtually impossible for people in their age bracket. To illustrate the position more clearly and at the same time to prove the lack of sincerity of the Treasurer, especially having regard to his opening remarks when delivering his Budget speech when he said: My Government will review the field of social welfare with the object of assisting those in most need I desire very briefly to refer to a case which came to my notice some weeks or for and received an age pension. The wife,",68,Table I Summary Of Commonwealth Receipts And Expenditures 1953 54 To 1966 67 And 1967 68 Estimated
117,( Mr Mcmahon) Has Triumphantly Used Such,"woman who mothered 10 children, instead of being completely disregarded by the Government and left to fend for herself in jungle should, in my humble opinion, be immediately granted some government assistance. In fact, any government with any sense of pride or decency would honour rather than humiliate her. I am aware that this type of situation has been raised many times in this Parliament. It seems to me that the one reason why no corrective action has been taken is the fear that a small percentage of single pensioners may marry younger women in order to obtain the married couples' rate of pension in lieu of the single rate. This type of reasoning-is completely unacceptable to me. However, in an effort to offer some kind of compromise solution, it is with deep respect and sincerity that I suggest to the Minister and the Government that the Act be amended to make the wife of an age pensioner eligible for a similar pension, together with the fringe benefits, provided the couple have been married for at least 5 years prior to the date that the husband becomes eligible for the pension. I say this although in my heart I believe that this amendment should not be necessary, because the wife should receive the pension when her husband becomes eligible. If the Government will not go the whole hog it might consider the proposition I have just made. I desire at this stage to refer to the dras'ic changes made over recent years by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-and at the same time to reflect upon the disastrous effects these changes have made to our economy and industrial relations. A short history reveals that prior to 1953 the nation's wage structure was set in the concept of a basic wage based on what was then known as the C series index, with automatic quarterly adjustments to take care of price rises or falls, plus a margin entitlement for skill and responsibility. In 1953 automatic quarterly adjustments of the basic wage were discontinued. However, that part of the national wage was kept at approximately its correct level by way of annual reviews until 1960. As a consequence the worker had some assurance that this section of his wage still took care, to a reasonable extent, of price rises or falls in the preceding 12 months. In 1960 the C series index w<i? the unskilled-employment seeking replaced by a new index known as the consumer price index which was introduced with the blessing of this Government and accepted with some misgivings by the trade union movement on the assumption that the new index, if accurately and properly applied, would reflect some reasonable stability in living standards for the Australian work force. While on the subject of the consumer price index, let me quote some comments from the Commission when it used this new system in the 1961 basic wage case. The Commission said: We acknowledge the fact that the new basic wage under the consumer price index is in fact lower in money terms than would have been the case under the old C series index. However, in our view the material available demonstrates the superiority of the consumer price index over the old C series retail price index. The Commission concluded by saying: Having considered the standards of the seven basic wages of the last decade we regard the consumer price index as most appropriate for present adoption and future maintenance. The important section of the Commission's observations is in the concluding paragraph where it used the words 'and future maintenance'. Following that, a campaign commenced in 1965, just 4 years after the introduction of the 'most appropriate' consumer price index. The employers of this country with the active support of this Government literally forced the Commission to abandon the two unit wage, which over the years had held some restraint on price movements, and replaced it with a single unit wage which gave to management an open cheque to increase prices at will with little or no danger of such increases being reflected in future wage decisions. Having succeeded in the sabotage of the two unit wage, some responsible Ministers of this Government have made violent attacks on the Commission each time wages have been increased by using the unrealistic argument that such decisions would cause inflation. But anyone with the slightest knowledge of the history of wage fixation in this country knows perfectly well that it is only with a two unit wage, with automatic quarterly adjustments based on price fluctuations, that price stability will prevail and inflation be curbed. Not only is such a system designed to curb inflation; it would also substantially industry has a comparatively high cost strucdecrease the wave of industrial disputes we have witnessed over the past few years. This most important aspect of industrial relations would be further improved if the Treasurer and the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury) would refrain from making public statements which gave the impression that they, on behalf of the Government, were trying to intimidate the Commission. The Treasurer in his Budget Speech made a brief reference to the rising sales of motor that the Japanese Government is at present vehicles during the past 12 months, and he seemed to accept the fact that such a situation would continue indefinitely. I cannot agree with this reasoning. A number of forecasts of future demand have recently been made by economists after studies of the industry and their findings suggest a marked decrease in demand of up to 30% in the Australian market by 1972. These studies have revealed, after having regard to an increase in population due to migration and natural causes, that the saturation level may be reached by the early 1970s. Some studies have suggested that a substantial drop in demand could be evident before then. Whilstf agree with the Treasurer that the industry at the moment is in rather good shape, in view of the results of the economic studies I have just referred to I strongly suggest that plans must now be prepared to ensure the security and stability of the Australian motor vehicle industry if local production and imports outstrip demand in the near or distant future. It is my belief that the Government's vehicle production plans, which provide, firstly for manufacturers who produce vehicles with 95% Australian content and. secondly, for small volume assembly firms which provide for limited production levels of vehicles with various lower levels of Australian content, have not achieved their objective. Car imports are still able to compete on favourable terms with the products of the local plan A manufacturers, who produce vehicles with 95% Australian content. The reason for this is elementary. It is well known and universally accepted that the low unit cost depends in the main on high volume output and because Australia has four A class manufacturers, which is a large number having regard to our relatively small domestic market. Our vehicle ture, although its facilities are modern and up to date by world standards and its work force is highly skilled. Until some months ago this . situation allowed high volume, low cost, Japanese imports to penetrate the Australian market regardless of the tariff barrier and freight charges. Recently these imports have all sustained price increases and as a result their level of penetration has temporarily declined. However, in view of the fact negotiating plans to allow high volume produced American vehicles to be assembled in Japan, thus reducing the market for Japanese produced vehicles in that country, it appears certain that Japanese interests will leave no stone unturned in an endeavour to increase their share of the Australian market to offset this loss. The Australian vehicle manufacturers-by that I mean those who produce cars of 95% Australian content-clai m that their' investment in foundries, machine. . shops, tool rooms, and press. . . lines . will be seriously jeopardised .by further, development of small volume assembly operations. I entirely agree with this point of view. For instance, it is generally recognised within the industry that for every 1,000 small volume assembled cars produced in Australia in substitution for 1,000 95% Australian content vehicles over 180 Australian workers lose their jobs. This, to my mind, is of vital importance. Another factor of considerable importance in this context is that the manufacturers of cars with an Australian content of 95%, with their modern machinery and technical know-how and with their highly skilled work force, are a great asset to Australia and are capable of converting to defence production in case of need. To realise their worth, we have only to recall their outstanding contribution during World War II , when the industry was in its infancy in Australia. Having briefly and, I trust, fairly covered the position of the Australian vehicle industry today, I appeal to the Government to ensure that the future of the manufacturers of cars with an Australian content of 95% is not placed in jeopardy. If the occasion does arise in the near or distant future, I hope that quick and positive action will be taken to maintain these people in the rightful place in Australia's industrial comtaneously the Soviet Union sent its repreplex. I suggest, therefore, that, if the ecosentative to the heads of governments nomic studies I have already mentioned prove to be correct in any way, as a first step the sales tax laws be amended to provide that the higher the Australian content the lower the sales tax, and vice versa, in lieu of the present situation in which the sales tax is based on the price of the vehicle. My contribution also to the debate on the Budget will refer to the unprovoked and indeed unpremeditated aggression of the Soviet Union on one of its neighbours, the country we know as Czechoslovakia. During the 8 or 9 years that I have been in this Parliament I have seen and read of aggression by various countries on their neighbours. Usually this takes the form ot a country crossing the border of a neighbouring country and trying to impose its will on that country or on its leaders. Alternatively we have seen the establishment of so-called national liberation fronts where a small band of people enter a country from a neighbouring country, usually a Communist country, and try to upset the balance in the country they have entered. We have seen this sort of activity in the various states of South Africa. It is a shame that the South African states, many of whicb are trying to build up a national spirit, have to put up with this of anguish the news that the Soviet Union form of interference and aggression. We had invaded Czechoslovakia. Of course, it have seen it also in the various states of abruptly ended the dreams of the people of South America. We know that the ComCzechoslovakia who were looking for a munist rulers in the Kremlin, in Moscow, liberalisation of tbe controls that had been have endeavoured, unsuccessfully I hope, imposed on them for many, many years. to impose their will on the various South These people love freedom and have done American states through Fidel Castro in so for generations.

Of course for all time. It is customary when a skirmish the classic example is the intrusion by takes place, such as this might have been, North Vietnam into the affairs of South for some provocation to cause it. In other Vietnam. But the cold-blooded effrontery words, there has been shooting by one side of the Soviet Union when it invaded or the other. We have seen this in the Middle Czechoslovakia and tried to impose its East. We saw what happened 12 months will on the people of that country last ago when the United Arab Republic tried week surpasses the actions of other to provoke Israel and we saw the results countries throughout the world. It sent a representative to the Australian Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) and told him, told this Parliament and told the people of Australia that the Soviet Union had been invited into the country known as Czechoslovakia. This calls for the strongest protest on my part and I hope on the part of the Party to which I belong. I believe that the censure of this Parliament should be sent to Moscow, to Peking and to the capitals of other countries that think they can interfere with the regimes of smaller nations. ber for Grayndler asked about South Vietnam. Today he heard the Prime Minister give a short discourse on the reasons we are trying to uphold the established Government in South Vietnam. We know that the North Vietnamese, Ho Chi Minh and his assistants, have tried to impose their will on the Government and the people of South Vietnam. This has been set out in many documents, including documents from the International Control Commission. I believe what the Commission has said; apparently the honourable member for Grayndler does not. I heard over the radio, with a good deal of the provocation.

122,Mr Whittorn,"The honourable memregard for world opinion, has had nothing to match it for at least 12 years. This was a dastardly act by the Soviet Union. We in Australia, and no doubt peoples throughout the world, realise that the Government of Czechoslovakia was negotiating with the rulers in the Kremlin early this month and during July. We saw the pictures that were taken when the leaders of the Soviet Union kissed the cheeks of Mr of relations with these people when they Dubcek. I saw these pictures on 9th August, so no doubt the kissing took place on 8th August. But obviously at the same time the Soviet Union had set up its forces to ensure that its will would be imposed on the Czechoslovak people, even though the Soviet leaders had kissed the cheeks of Mr Dubcek, the recognised leader of Czechoslovakia. What did the forces of the Soviet Union do? In the dead of night they roared in with their tanks, their armoured vehicles and their men armed with tommy guns and they took over this small and wonderful country, these people who realise that freedom must be earned and that there are responsibilities associated with it. The Czechoslovak people met these forces in their pyjamas and dressing gowns. This demonstrates how unprepared these culture-loving people were when the hordes of the Soviet Union invaded their country. To cap it all, the representatives of the were looking for individuality of thought Soviet Union were instructed by their and freedom to express their views. The leaders to come to the Prime Minister of Czechoslovak people had an aspiration to this country and say that the Communist live their lives in a better way and to have troops had entered Czechoslovakia at the a better way for their children to live in request of the people of Czechoslovakia. future years. We expect this sort of idea to The position is set out in the 'Soviet News inspire tbe Czechoslovak people because, Bulletin' of 23rd August. I have no doubt as I have said, for generations they have that all honourable members received a copy inspired people. of it. It states: It is generally known thai Ihe Party leaders and statesmen of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic have asked the Soviet Union and other Allied ing to give these freedoms to the people states lo render the fraternal Czechoslovak people of his country. He knew his people, he urgent assistance, including assistance with armed knew what they expected and he knew that forces. Unfortunately, the Soviet representatives cause their individuality and their need for do not tell us which were the armed forces. self expression have been a part of their They just say that they were invited into nature for generations. The Czechoslovak Czechoslovakia by the leaders of that people are leaders in art, in work-a-day life country. 1 find it difficult to understand why and in politics. Whilst Mr Dubcek and his people in Australia can believe that Comassistants were carrying out this experiment, munist regimes have any right to impose we in this country looked on with a great their will on any other country. We saw deal of interest and a great deal of this type of activity in 1956, but the people encouragement at what we thought would of Australia-and obviously the people take place. Then we saw Mr Dubcek and throughout the world-forgo t the desecration of Budapest in 1956 when the Soviet Union slaughtered Hungarians and caused a blood-bath which horrified the whole world and shocked and sickened the people of Australia. Now, 12 years later it is the Czechoslovak people's turn. How can we form a detente with the people of tbe Soviet Union? How can we have an easing shake the hand of their so-called friends, on the one hand, and stab them in the back, on the other hand? At the same time as they are doing the stabbing they tell the leaders in this country that somebody told them to do the stabbing. I find it impossible to express myself because this is not world relations as I know them. Last year I was fortunate to represent the Government side of this Parliament at the United Nations. There1 saw in action the representatives of the Soviet Union, Mr Gromyko and Mr Federenko. There at all tunes it was obvious in a brutal way they endeavoured to impose their will and their strength on the smaller nations in the United Nations. Whenever their will was thwarted by a majority vote they used the veto. This is the form of a Communist regime. In the case of Czechoslovakia they have overrun a people who been a freedom loving and culturally 1 believe that Mr Dubcek was endeavourthey wanted liberty from oppression behis assistants meet the Kremlin leaders head on and we wondered what would be the result. The grim masters of the Kremlin had no illusions about the result because they knew and were prepared for Mr in 1956, and it will take generations Dubcek and his assistants. The masters of the Kremlin knew that freedom and Communism just do not jell. They know that they do not mix. For 50 years they had seen that the democratic way of life was not important, so far as they were concerned. This morning during question time 1 heard an honourable member opposite ask the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) who was the Leader of the Opposition in South Vietnam when Diem was leader of that country. I then felt impelled to ask: Who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? Who is the Leader of the Opposition in East Germany? Who is the Leader of the Opposition in Hungary and in the other satellite countries of the Soviet Union? These Russian people realise that civilisatreachery and aggression. The peoples of the tion and Communism are incompatible. They do not jell . I believe that they only 1 know of barbarism which was born out of Marx's hate filled mind. Marx wrote the books that these people follow, and they will follow them until the people in these other countries rise against this hate this aggression by a very large country of filled philosophy. The Kremlin masters are committed to the eventual barbarisation of the whole world, unless the peoples of the world stand up against them. They are committed to the mutilation of the human spirit. That is what they are doing to the Czechoslovak people, and that is what they have been doing to tbe Hungarian people since 1956. They are committed to evil methods and to diabolical naked aggression. Their instruments have always been, firstly, subversion, secondly threats and thirdly the use of force if their will cannot be imposed on the leaders of their satellites. Once they take over a country we know that freedom is extinguished, fear rules the people of the country that is taken over and persecution reigns. Mr possibilities. The phrase which is often used Dubcek knew this when he met the leaders from the Soviet Union. He knew it when the Soviet Union decided to invade his country. That is why he asked his people not to resist the Soviet forces. He knew what would happen to his people because he saw and read what had happened to the people of Hungary in 1956. The Soviet leaders crushed Hungary before the people of Hungary regain the feeling of liberalisation that they felt prior to 1956. The Soviet leaders established a puppet government in Hungary, as they tried to do in Czechoslovakia without success. They tried to name the puppets who had called them into Czechoslovakia, again without success. The Soviet representative at the United Nations was asked who was the leader of the new Czechoslovak regime, but he failed to answer the question. So this spontaneous request to enter Czechoslovakia obviously was made by the faceless men, but we do not know where these faceless men were. The world wants relief from this sort of world, in all parts of the world, want more freedom, not less. People-whethe r they be black, brown or white-in all parts of the world want more independence of thought and more freedom, not less. But now all of us have on our consciences this invasion, 240 million people against the Czechoslovak people who number 14 million. This was a distressing and unforgivable act of aggression. We should not become emotionally involved with CommunismI find it difficult not to do so-bu t we must be aware of the results wben Communists impose their wills on the other peoples of the world. I am speaking in this way tonight so that those people who happen to read what I have said will be alerted against the type of aggression that the Communists use when they want to impose their philosophies on other people. The people in my electorate of Balaclava should be alert to the Communist philosophies. 1 never forget that Communism and socialism are so close together that one can be a travesty of the other unless people are alert and vigilant to the in Australia, 'it could not happen here' should be buried by all Australians. Australian people must be alerted to the dangers of Communism and to the brutality of dictators, whatever form they might take. People must be alerted to the dangers of Fascism, Communism, dictatorship and totalitarianism. They are all sickening to people who believe in a democratic way of life. We may read what the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), a former Leader of the Opposition, said and we could have heard it had we listened to radio station 3KZ on 18th August. He said: Russian influence today is built on peaceful co-operation between all nations and it is becoming increasingly successful. On 21st August, less than 24 hours after one finds that the average amount each the Soviets had invaded Czechoslovakia, the man, woman and child is paying is $132 per same man said that be stood by every word year. he had uttered 3 days before. Is it any wonder that the young people of Australia protest against the leaders of parties, the correctly pointed out, the worse feature of leaders in politics, when they hear words sales tax and other indirect taxation is that such as those uttered by the former leader a single man pays less than does a man of the Labor Party on 18th August and with a wife and three children to keep. 3 days later, even after this sad aggression That married man pays five times as much cf the USSR against the people of a small as a single man pays. This is so whether country like Czechoslovakia, hear him say the family man is poor and the bachelor that he stands by every' word he spoke? is rich or whatever else their position is. The young people of Australia will protest Surety no-one can say that it is a fair unless older people like myself and the method of levying taxation. The burden people in this Parliament say what they of taxation placed upon the family man, mean at all times, whether it affects their especially the young family man who is 1 political future or their party. I will always trying to rear children and educate them, encourage university students and other has now reached the point where it is really people who feel they must protest against beginning to hurt. It is more than he can 1 the inexactitude of sayings by people in high really bear, and he cannot bear it much places. I will join with them on all occasions. longer. I often wish that every member of Sir, I commend the Treasurer for his the Parliament could find time to do what Budget. [10.22]-Lik e the Chairman of Committees, of Parliament ought to go and visit the the Australian Country Party member for poorer areas, because until we visit and Lyne( Mr Lucock), I am bitterly disapenter the homes of these people we have pointed witb the Budget because once again no idea how poor people are in Australia it imposes heavy indirect taxation upon today. We have no idea of the extent of the community in tbe form of sales tax. poverty in this rich country of ours. It is Speaking in this debate on 20th August, a disgrace to the Government that this the honourable member for Lyne said: 1 wish to make two comments about the poor, the privileged and the underprivileged, Budget. Speaking personally, I would have prethe weak and the strong, should be allowed ferred to see an increase' in income tax rather to continue. than in sales tax. There are two factors relating to an increase in income.tax. Firstly, the increase is more evenly shared throughout the community. Secondly, people have a greater realisation of it. what they are paying. In many instances sales tax is literally a hidden tax. Some people may not realise how much they are paying in sales tax. says, the Government encourages it. Each That is a very true and correct statement Budget that increases the burden of indirect of the position. This Budget proposes to taxation makes the position of the poor increase sales tax from the present scale of worse than it was before. It is of no use 12i% to 15%. There are two other categories of sales tax, one of 2i% and another of 25%. These amount to a total of $400m per year. In other words, when it is divided between the community, every man, woman and child in Australia today is paying $33 per year in sales tax alone. But if one adds to the sales tax the other forms of indirect taxation imposed by this Commonwealth, including excise on beer and tobacco and many other forms of taxation such as revenue tariffs, not protective tariffs alone, As the honourable member for Lyne so I regularly do, that is, to visit the poorer homes in their electorates and see how great disparity between the rich and the",72,Table I Summary Of Commonwealth Receipts And Expenditures 1953 54 To 1966 67 And 1967 68 Estimated

125,Mr Clyde Cameron,"As my friendanyone pretending there is not any real poverty in Australia. This Government has deliberately carried on a form of taxation which imposes on the poorer sections of the community a bigger burden than they can really afford to bear and which only imposes an increase upon the very rich when the Government thinks it has reached the point where it cannot get any more from the very poor. If we examine the form of taxation deductions we get an idea of how the system works. A rich man may claim a deduction of $312 for his wife. If the rate of taxation is 50c in the $1 he is able to claim 312 times 50c; so the benefit of a wife to a rich man on a high income is infinitely greater than it is to a poor man. Yet, a rich man finds it easier to maintain his wife and has much more money left over after he has maintained his wife than the poor man has. I would like to see the nation evolve some system of deduction for dependants under which a stipulated cash deduction would be applicable to all taxpayers, irrespective of the rate of tax. If the amount to be allowed for a dependent wife were to be $50 a year, S50 a year should be deducted from the amount of tax payable by every person regardless of whether he pays 10c in the $1 or 50c in the $1. No taxpayer should be allowed to get a greater cash benefit in the form of a cash rebate for a dependent wife than another. As the position now is, a rich man gets a far greater cash benefit for a wife and the first and subsequent children than does a poor person. This surely cannot be justified on moral or other grounds. the honourable member for Scullin: It is outrageous. The tax deduction scale should be recast to meet the spiralling inflationary trends that have plagued the Australian economy for the past 19 years. But whilst the Government is very niggardly with the amount of deductions it will allow to those in the lower income group it is quite generous towards company directors and other people on high incomes. A company director may claim as a tax deduction travelling expenses and entertainment expenses. Company directors and other people on very high incomes may claim as deductions large sums paid in entertainment expenses but a worker cannot make any claim for the cost of travelling to and from his place of work, and some workers live so far from their place of employment that it costs them as much as S3 and $4 a week to get to and from work. Let us talk now about advertising expenses. For a long time. I have believed that the .Government should do more to try to reduce the amount of smoking in Australia. Everybody in the world now admits that smoking is a definite threat to a person's health and even to his life. Smoking is now known to be the cause of heart deterioration and lung cancer. The world's leading medical authorities are convinced that smoking presents one of the most deadly risks to health. The Government says that it cannot do anything to stop people advertising cigarettes. I do not believe this. I believe that the Government could do two things. It could tell the television stations that it will not renew their licences if they continue to advertise cigarettes or continue to promote the smoking of cigarettes. Secondly, although the Government has no power to enter the field of newspaper advertising, it could make it clear that money spent by tobacco companies on cigarette advertising will not be allowed as a deduction for company tax purposes. The Government should tell those .people who want to advertise cigarettes in newspapers and magazines and on television that the expenses involved will not be allowed as a tax deduction. It cannot be denied that anybody who smokes to excess is literally destroying himself. A person who smokes at all runs the risk of reducing' his capacity to resist disease generally. Yet we not only allow manufacturers to encourage people to do things injurious to-.their health but we also permit them to claim as a tax deduction every penny spent on advertising. There is very little difference between cigarettes and narcotic drugs. Tobacco is a form of narcotic. What would, the Government say if somebody advertised heroin or opium and then sought to claim his advertising expenses as a tax deduction? There would be a hue and cry, but the only difference between the effect on one's health ot nicotine and the effect of other drugs upon which we frown is one of degree.",75,Table I Summary Of Commonwealth Receipts And Expenditures 1953 54 To 1966 67 And 1967 68 Estimated

128,Mr Duthie,"What about the breweries?relevant interjection from my friend the us. honourable member for Wilmot. I do not believe in stopping people from drinking. If people are foolish enough to spend their stupid to the honourable gentleman but he money on drink, that is their bad luck. I should remember that he sits on the front spend a little of other people's money on bench because people for whom I am pleaddrink, but not very much of my own. I ing voted for him. If he had to rely on the submit that the breweries, the wine makers, votes of people of the class I am now the brandy makers and the whisky makers attacking he would lose his deposit at the should not be allowed to claim as a tax elections. That is the point I am trying to deduction money which they spend in trying make. Since everybody in this Parliament is to make people disregard the advice given here as a result of the votes of wage and every Sunday afternoon by the honourable salary earners we should behave as if we are member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie). ] want to say something about other forms of tax deductions. Up to $1,200 a year may be claimed, as a deduction in respect of premiums paid to life assurance companies. This represents approximately $24 a week. How many workers would qualify for the full benefit of a deduction in that category? This provision is all very well for the very rich who have more money than they know what to do with. They have the extra $24 a week, which they cannot spend on anything else. They can afford to pay this much for life assurance and claim it as a tax deduction. But this should be a Budget to help the very poor. No government, Liberal or Labor, could occupy the treasury bench on the votes of the rich alone-o n the votes of people who have $24 a week to spare for life assurance premiums. If honourable members had to rely on the votes of people with $24 a week to spare for life assurance they all would lose their deposits at the general elections. All of us are in this place because people in the low and middle income groups have voted for us. Since we are here as a result of their votes we should Minister, who has a financial background, to be doing more for them than we are now. The present situation in respect of tax my speech and that he is impressed witb its deductions is a disgrace. Take the case of a logic. I should like the Treasurer to look person who owns a factory. Every penny into the matter and see whether the situaspent on the maintenance of his factorytion that I have mentioned can be rectified. on repairs for example-is treated as a tax deduction. But a worker who must maintain a home from which to go to work want to discuss. It is impossible for a worker in the factory is not allowed to claim to evade tax, because the tax that he is any deductions in respect of repairs to his required to pay is taken out of his pay home. WhatI am suggesting may sound envelope every week. revolutionary but it is not; I am merely stating elementary principles of social and taxation justice. the representatives of those people. NowI wish to advance another proposition. We have heard a great deal from time to time about the wonderful generosity of the Government in providing the age allowance for taxation purposes. I have a great respect for the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury), who is at the table. I seem to have put him to sleep. Now that he is awake I should like to know how he can justify the application of an age allowance foT income tax purposes to a person not eligible for the age pension, yet refuse to apply a similar allowance to an invalid who. because he has an independent income equivalent to the pension, is not entilled to receive the invalid pension. I have knowledge of a retired police officer in Adelaide who was crippled as a result of his work. He has been bedridden for 15 years. His superannuation amounts to a little more than the age allowance but because his superannuation is too high to enable him to qualify for the invalid pension he is not allowed to claim any of the allowance which people similarly ineligible for the age pension are allowed to claim. T would like the talk about this matter with the Treasurer. Let him tell the Treasurer that he has heard Tax evasion is the next subject that I annuitant also to evade tax.",76,Table I Summary Of Commonwealth Receipts And Expenditures 1953 54 To 1966 67 And 1967 68 Estimated

132,Mr Duthie,"It is impossible for a supersible for him also. He plays a big part in the scheme of things these days, too. But large companies such as those controlled by Reg Ansett are able to avoid a good deal of tax by what is regarded as legal means when they buy other companies that have been making losses and average those losses over 5 years in order to reduce their tax. Mr Ansett does not hesitate to buy a company that has made losses for 5 years in succession, so that he can add it to his already long string of companies and average its losses and deduct them from the earnings of his other companies. He never hesitates to become the proud owner of a company that has made losses for 5 years. Indeed, it pays him to buy such a company and use its losses to offset the tax that he is required to pay on the earnings of companies that have made profits. is bushranging. This sort of thing does not stop there, however. Ansett, as everybody knows, decided to buy a television station. He has lost money on it ever since he acquired it, but that does not worry him, because he is able to use the losses to offset the earnings of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, a holding company. By spreading the losses of the company operating the television station over the profits of other companies that he controls he gains a benefit. ber think that any Government supporters have shares in Ansett companies? have, because I have taken the trouble to look at the share registers of Ansett Transport Industries and other companies associated with it. I have discovered that a considerable number of members of this Parliament have a few shares in Ansett companies tucked away somewhere in their portfolios. Those honourable members are not all on the side of the chamber directly opposite me, of course, because some of them sit in the corner occupied by the Australian Country Party. I now turn to the subject of television licences, about which T have heard very little said in this debate. The raising of charges for television licences is resorted to by governments of the political comple.von of the present one as a handy method of slugging the poor. This Government chooses to impose excessive charges for television licences because, the more it can make the little people pay for these licences, the more are its rich friends relieved of the obligation to pay by means of a graduated income tax. If] had my way. 1 would have all these revenues paid in the form of graduated taxes instead of in licence fees. 1 would hit the rich until it hurt, just as this Government is now hurting the poor. The present Government Parties could have all the votes of the rich people who would be affected, but the candidates of those Parties would still lose their deposits in many instances, because the very rich are few and the poor are many. We ought to see to it that those in the community who could so easily pay more are made to do so. I now turn my attention to the reckless manner in which this Government spends public money. I am directly opposed to its reckless spending of public funds, and I do not hesitate to make my position clear in this Parliament. 1 condemn the wasteful expenditure of $350,000 on air conditioning for the main dining room in this building. It is a wicked waste of the taxpayers' money to undertake that expenditure on a building that the Government proposes soon to replace with another which, we are led to believe, will be built, on Capital Hill. Nobody can justify expenditure of that order on this building at tbe present time. This scandalous waste of the people's money ought not to be tolerated. There is also other wasteful expenditure of public money to which I wish to direct attention. I am not satisfied that all the tendering that characterises the activities of every government is above board. I realise that I am making a pretty serious charge, and I make it with full cognisance of what I am doing. prove anything that is wrong? prove something. do it, then.",77,Table I Summary Of Commonwealth Receipts And Expenditures 1953 54 To 1966 67 And 1967 68 Estimated

140,Mr Hulme,"Let the honourable membersomething. The Minister for Defence( Mr successful tenderer. Unless this information Fairhall) knows of a case which 1 discovered in Adelaide and in which tenders for the supply of meat were called. Because one particular tenderer happened to submit a tender that was too high, fresh tenders were called so that he could tender below the figure submitted by another tenderer. The Minister for Defence knows all about this because, when he was -Minister for Supply, he investigated the case and found that what L had said about it was true. It concerned tbe Metropolitan Wholesale Meat Co. Ltd, of Adelaide. action was taken to protect the public funds. Minister what protection was extended to public funds. I ask him to try to understand what I am saying. When the original tenders closed, it was found that the person ciated with public property are being made' who eventually was successful had put in the highest tender. So fresh tenders were called and he then tendered at a lower figure people. Ihe calling of tenders is a mockery. than his competitors. He brought his price down. ablemember said at the beginning. say now. How can the Minister justify this kind of skulduggery? When we know that this Government has been caught out once in this sort of thing are we not entitled to assume that it can happen again? When I was listening to the debate in another place today I found that the Government has refused point blank to tell members of this Parliament, who are the elected custodians of the people's money, what were the figures of the tenders submitted by various successful tenderers. A question was asked about how many companies bad tendered for the right to service car parking areas at airports. The Avis company now has the sole right to service airports with drive yourself vehicles and lo service parking meters and the like at airports. The answer given was that more than one company had tendered for these rights. However, the Government refuses to tell members of the Parliament the amount of the successful tender. This is a scandal. If the letting of tenders has been fair and above board, the Government ought to be able to tell us the figure submitted by the is revealed, how do unsuccessful tenderers know whether their prices were above or below that of the successful tenderer? Only by revealing these particulars can the Government remove the suspicion of skulduggery and crookedness in the letting of tenders. Unless the Government is prepared to change its policy, I for one shall always be suspicious. The Government has no right to treat a public tender as private property. ber think that the conditions should be made known? be made known to the public. The people own all these public properties. Public funds have'been used to acquire them. The people have the right to know that those who are given exclusive rights to enterprises assoto pay the maximum charge for those rights. If this information is not given lo the Details should be thrown open to the public and to anyone interested, and in particular to unsuccessful tenderers. The figure submitted by the successful tenderer should be made known to all who are interested: Tendering is no different from an auction sale. tenders come into consideration. But the conditions apply equally to everybody. ought to. different bases. The honourable member does not know what is going on. the new ruse adopted to circumvent proper. tendering practices. Whatever the conditions and tender prices are, they ought to be made public.

153,Mr Clyde Cameron,"This must beis happening in respect of motels at airports. things smell to high heaven. There is 1 have discovered that a motel is to be established at Adelaide Airport, and ) believe there is to be one at Brisbane Airport. Indeed, I understand that a motel is to be established at every principal airport and that the right to operate these motels has already been given to certain motel interests. It is said that this has been done by tender. But apparently we will never be told what was the price submitted by the successful tenderer. The unsuccessful tenderers will never know whether they were robbed because of some skulduggery and the Government, for the sake of its own decency, ought to throw this open for the world to see. Why should it not? The Government is the custodian of the public purse. It has no right to withhold information from the people who own the buildings and establishments. The Government does not own the airport restaurants and refreshment rooms, nor does it own the Lobby restaurant in Canberra. The people of Australia paid $105,000 for the building of the Lobby restaurant and we ought to know how much was paid for the lease of that restaurant and what are the conditions of the lease. We should know where we stand in respect of tenders. 1 am not making this a purely party political matter. I dare say that the same sort of thing could have happened in other days with other governments, but 1 have no evidence of it. Let us consider for a moment the refreshment rooms and liquor bars at airports. I should like to know the tender submitted by the Federal Hotel of Melbourne for the exclusive monopoly of these facilities at the Melbourne airport. I should like to know what were the tenders submitted by other interested bodies. What are the conditions applying to the use of those facilities? We are entitled to know these things. Let us look, too, at the Hotel Canberra. I. am told that the rental which is paid by those who have the licence of the Hotel Canberra, which is owned by the people of Australia, is not enough to pay the cost of the gardeners who look after the gardens of the hotel. Although it seems hard to believe, I have it on reliable inforin tbe Budget, and deservedly so. It is mation that part of the conditions attaching to the lease of the Hotel Canberra is that the Government is responsible for keeping the gardens in order. All these something very suspicious and very smelly about the tendering situation. SinceI am here as the elected representative of the people to look after their interests I demand that the Government explains the position. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) who has just resumed his seatI wish that he had done so long agotalked a lot about the poor people. He has not a monopoly of sympathy for poor people. If the Australian Labor Party had control of the treasury bench 1 suggest that there would be a lot more poor people becauseunder the present Government unemployment has not increased and people have had the opportunity to secure good jobs. Australia's good economic position is founded on the stability of the Government. It is obvious from the speeches of honourable members opposite during this debate that a Labor government would not be able to maintain a sound economy and consequently the people who would suffer most would be the working people. The Budget presented to the Parliament this year highlights tbe soundness of the Australian economy. It is estimated that without any change in rates of taxation or charges, revenue will increase by about 9% while Commonwealth expenditure will be limited to an increase of 7.8%. This will result in a decrease of $97m in the deficit as compared with 1967-68: At the same time Australia will be able to cope witb increasing expenditure on defence, social welfare, education and in other fields without resort to any serious increases in taxation. This demonstrates, in no uncertain fashion, the real strength of the Australian economy resulting from sound government policy. Much has been said about defence, and I intend to touch on it for a few minutes. Defence represents one of the largest items essential that we have the strongest possible system of defence in' relation to our resources and the demands of development.

Jt is also essential that we provide our servicemen with the most modern arms and equipment, and this can be very costly; but it is unthinkable that we should do otherwise. I freely accept the necessity to increase our defence spending by SlOlm to a total of SI,217m. The provision of aid to developing countries is tied up with the overall defence of Australia. This is one way in which we can help countries to rehabilitate their economies and to maintain stable government. I believe that prevention is better than cure. Rebellion is liable to occur when a country's economy becomes unsound and the people suffer. Any aid that we provide to developing countries is money well spent. The total official economic aid which Australia provides to developing countries each year has increased by more than $110m $41,897,000 in 1958-59 to an estimated $155,029,000 this year. Expenditure on external economic aid has increased at a much faster rate than both national income and total government spending since 1958-59. All told, Australia has provided, as outright gifts, more than $1,130m in official economic aid to developing countries since the end of World War II , and a further $155m is expected to be provided in 1968-69. That is a proud record, and Australia ranks second only to France in terms of the net transfer of official resources to developing countries expressed as a percentage of national income.

This is an important point, and while I believe that greater assistance was deserved I. commend the Government on having improved the lot of pensioners. It is particularly pleasing to see that repatriation services, including pensions, are to receive a worthwhile increase. One of the highly creditable achievements ot this Government has been to maintain economic stability in conjunction with the record growth and development of the nation. I know that this hurts the Opposition, which would like to be able to do as well. This situation has been brought about because the Government's policy has encouraged investment of capital in Australia by investors at home and overseas. The end result is that this country is enjoying an era of prosperity which is the envy over the past decade, from of countries throughout the world. The work forceI hope that members of the Opposition are listening to this-ha s benefited tremendously because wage fixing tribunals have considered that the economy can stand an unprecedented strain and have increased wages beyond the limit that would have been thought possible only a few years ago. In fact, this has been the best workers' government that Australians have ever experienced. The other side of the picture is that costs will rise to an extent that will have a serious effect on those primary industries which are largely dependent on world markets for the sale of their products. There is a bad. Devaluation of sterling has also disadvantaged primary industry.

157,Mr Corbett,"Wait a minute. Howindustries for reduced returns in AustralianThese changed circumstances more than justify the benefits to primary industry that are contained in the Budget, especially when viewed against the great contribution that primary industry has made to the development of Australia as a result of the export income it has earned and is still earning. In 1966-67 rural industry still condevelopment. Too many city dwellers and tributed no less than 66.6% of Australia's export income. Since export income is vital to the Australian economy, the total payment to rural industries of $179m in this Budget is a sound national investment, (t is the minimum sum required to keep these important industries operating. Other sections of the community share in the prosperity enjoyed by Australians generally and arc able to pass on the increased costs, but the primary producer has to absorb the increased costs as best he can. The drought bonds that have been announced in this Budget have been constantly advocated by the Australian Country Party as they can serve to equalise the income of primary producers and at 'he same time provide a reserve of funds for the preservation of livestock. This is certainly in the national interest. Wheat stabiments are not subjected to this vigorous test, only lisation has long been recognised as a worthwhile economy. When stabilisation was first introduced the wheat grower was subsidising home consumption. The wheel has turned a full turn. But even if it seems unlikeiy in the near future, who can say, with rising standards of living and increasing population throughout the world, that wheat stabilisation will not once again be able to stand on its own feet. In the meantime, it needs and deserves at least the assistance i l is attracting. Water conservation must be continued. I commend the Government for providing the States with finance for those water conservation thoroughly investigated and have been shown by stringent cost-benefit analysis to be sound economic propositions. While some crops which could be successfully grown under irrigation are at present in over-supply, there are alternative crops or improved pastures which can utilise the water available. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and 1 would be interested to hear of any area in the Commonwealth now enjoying the benefit of a properly investigated irrigation scheme which now says it would have been better off without irrigation. Far loo often in this House, and indeed outside of it, we hear detractors of water conservation as an instrument of national representatives of city dwellers follow ibis line without, I am sure, having given the matter the consideration it deserves. These people would no doubt label my opinion as biased. Therefore, I will quote a statement made by a city dweller who is an eminent authority of this subject. I refer to no less an authority than Professor Munro, who is Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of New South Wales. Addressing a meeting at Stanthorpe recently he said, inter alia: The procedure is that we have to compute the annual benefits and the annual cost of the water conservation project and if the annual benefits are not greater than the annual cost; in other words the ratio of benefits lo cost is not greater than one, then the project must not proceed, but worse than that, in order to get a project supported by the economist you have got to have a benefits-cost ratio of something like two to one. This is as far as water resources are concerned. Other investwater, and in doing this we are only allowed to feature of our national count the tangible benefits; i.e. what you can measure in terms of money. We are only allowed to count the direct benefits, the primary industries. We are not allowed to count secondary benefits or indirect benefits . . . It amazes me to contemplate a state of affairs where economists and governments insist on rigorous benefit-cost analysis to justify the building of irrigation dams, insisting that only tangible and direct benefits can be counted on the credit side, and yet similar analysis is not insisted on when a capital city asks for more dams to keep the rose gardens blooming and the suburban lawns green. In addition to that extract, I would like to quote the words of Dr Alan Patterson who said, in his 1966 Curtin Memorial Lecture: The principal reason for the negative approach schemes which have been to development in Western Australia and Queensland is the increasing stranglehold of the SydneyMelbourne axis on Federal funds to finance their urgently needed requirements resulting from the almost uncontrolled octopus-like growth of their cities. The self-generating expansion of this densely populated infra-structure results in huge demands being made on the resources of the nation, particularly if the standards of living in the cities are to be maintained. Yet the fact is rarely grasped that much of this development in these populous areas involving heavy capital outlay in such projects as parking lots, multi-storey buildings, railway electrification, urban roads and bridges, seaside resorts, opera houses, artificial lakes and bridges to cross them, super highways to coastal resorts, etc., may be relatively unproductive investment so far as increases in the real income of the nation are concerned. If investments in such major undertakings were subjected to the same exhaustive and rigorous benefit-cost analysis, tralian Labor Party, it must be accepted as are insisted upon by the Commonwealth with respect to all northern development projects, the resultant answer would come as a shock. We would find that in cases the investment, from the national viewpoint (the criterion insisted on by the Commonwealth Treasury when passing judgment on northern projects) is so uneconomic that it could not be justified. There was a lot more along those lines said by those two eminent men but as my time is limited I must pass to another matter. 1 want to refer now to local government. Local government, particularly shire councils, has been called upon in recent years to carry greater responsibilities. Local government has had to provide more amenities such as modern swimming pools, caravan parks, libraries, well appointed recreation areas etc. and is now maintaining aerodromes under the local ownership plan. Local councils can raise money only by a rate on property. Because of this, many people are not called upon to equitably share the added financial burden of the payment of these, heavy charges. I refer to the payment which arises over and above whatever subsidy may be applicable to any of these expenditures and, indeed, that can be very heavy. The time has come, in my opinion, to at least review, with the object, of increasing, the amount of money made available to local governments by the Commonwealth through the State governments. The whole system could be profitably examined but in the meantime let us at least increase the amount that local government now has to accept. Referring to roads, as the present Commonwealth legislation for aid to roads expires in June 1969, a full scale review of the arrangements for road grants will have to be conducted during the current financial year. I believe that this review will require vigilance on the part of local authorities, particularly shire councils, to see that the conditions of the legislation remain at least as equitable as they are at the present time. In my opinion, demands will be made by the front page news that Catholic schools the capital cities for a lessening of the in Sydney are likely to discontinue fifth share which is now applicable to rural and sixth year classes, which would comroads. Because of this, I view with great prise about 5,200 pupils. It states that the concern the attitude of the Leader of the elimination of the fifth and sixth forms Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) in his speech in the debate on the Budget, lt is obvious that bis concern is for the city dweller and, since he speaks as the Leader of the Austhat this also is the policy of that Party. Time does not permit me to elaborate more on this subject but I would like to do so. Australians generally will appreciate the added assistance to education which was revealed in the Budget and details of which have been given by the Minister for Education and Science( Mr Malcolm Fraser). The need for better standards of education, in all fields, is growing more and more apparent. The decision of the Commonwealth Government to lift its estimated expenditure on education by $34m over the allocation for last year to a total of over $210m clearly indicates that it is accepting its share of responsibility in this direction. This is further emphasised when it is realised that Commonwealth expenditure on education 5 years ago was less than one-third of this amount. There is, however, one field of education which is very deserving of assistance and which has not been mentioned. I refer to independent primary schools in the various States. The saving to the Government and tbe community at large over the years bas been a very large amount of money and this saving is still being enjoyed. The Government has recognised the value of independent primary schools in the Northern Territory by increasing the pupil allowance from $12 to $20 per pupil a year. It is high time that assistance was given to these schools throughout Australia as many of them will not be able to continue on the same scale without it if, indeed, they can carry on at all. If the contribution made by these schools were withdrawn, the Government would be faced with finding a lot more teachers, a lot more finance and a lot more accommodation for children. It would obviously be very good business from the Government's point of view to give some assistance before it was too late, and it is very late even now. This afternoon's Sydney Press features on would place an almost intolerable strain on State schools, which would have to accommodate the overflow. To get back to my own opinion, I suggest that the Government must give serious consideration to this position. ] am concerned with the welfare of the children involved. They are the nation's most precious asset and their future education is of the utmost importance to Australia. This has been highlighted in the Sydney Press, as I have pointed out. 1 hope that the Government will-take serious note of the position which has arisen and will look after the future of these children. It should at least consider what can be done and what is likely to happen in the future, and should deal witb this very serious situation in phases. In the few minutes that remain j would like to talk about some of the problems of the inland areas of Australia. One of the most earnestly sought amenities in inland Queensland, and no doubt in other States, is television. Whilst it is true that well over 90% of the people are receiving the benefits of television, the people who are not receiving them are those most in need because of the lack of alternative entertainment and because the educational value would help to counter the lack of educational facilities. The financial' success of commercial television as shown in recent company reports suggests that commercial television might be prepared to move farther afield if given reasonable encouragement. I urge the Government to investigate fully all practicable possibilities in this direction. A continuous telephone service in this day and age is a necessity but it can be provided in many rural areas only by the use of automatic exchanges. The introduction of subscriber trunk dialling and other scientific advances shows up in bold relief the disabilities of subscribers who still have restricted hours of service. For balanced progress to be made in telephone communication it is necessary that a greater proportion of Postal Department expenditure be applied to the provision of more automatic exchanges. A great deal more should be said to agreement would pay $6,000. An Auspromote the welfare of people in my area, tralian taxpayer pays $9,486 on the same but I have not time to say it because I taxable income. I asked the Treasurer intend to keep to the limit that has been whether the taxation concessions to Japan imposed. I merely say in conclusion that I would exceed by an immense amount any believe this Budget will continue to promote reciprocal taxation advantages to Australia. the prosperity of Australia and will continue to promote the welfare of Australia and her people. I have very much pleasure in supporting the Budget and in opposing the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Debate (on motion by Dr Patterson) adjourned. Taxation-Trad e with Communist Countries Motion (by Mr Bowen) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. August 1968 1 asked (be Treasurer ( Mr McMahon): Will the double taxation agreement now being compiled with Japan reduce by at least 50% the amount of taxation payable in Australia by Japanese on dividends from their investments in this country? The Treasurer said: The answer to the question is no. In Hansard on 16th May 1967 the Treasurer is reported as having told me that where a shareholder in a company operating in Australia is a resident of a country with which Australia has a double taxation agreement, such taxpayer is called upon to pay half the amount payable by a taxpayer resident of a country with which Australia has no agreement. The Treasurer set out in his answer details of amounts of taxation payable by shareholders resident in countries with which Australia has double taxation agreements, by those in countries with which Australia has no agreement, and by Australians. A shareholder in a country with which Australia has a double taxation agreement receiving from Australia taxable dividends of $20,000 would pay Australian taxation of $3,000.

158,Mr Peters (Scullin) [11.13],"On 27thThe Treasurer said: The answer is no. The investment of Australian money in Japan equals a small fraction of Japanese investment in Australia. I asked: Will the agreement boost Japanese exports to Australia and Japanese takeovers of Australian industries and resources? The Treasurer replied: The answer to the third question is that I see nothing in the agreement that could lead to the conclusion to which the honourable gentleman has come. . . . The Prime Minister of Japan has made it clear that Japan wants a double taxation agreement to reduce its unfavourable trade balance with Australia. The Melbourne 'Herald' of 28th August 1968 contains this statement: The agreement could result in the establishment ment before an agreement, which has here of big Japanese manufacturing firms. It may also increase direct Japanese investment. l t is of the greatest urgency that the abilities and resources of this country be marshalled to prevent Japanese businessmen, armed with cheque books and assisted by our Government, from taking over the natural resources and the industries of this country. A control that the Japanese could not secure with their embattled might in time of war they are seeking to secure in time of peace per medium of investments in this country. I have said before, and I repeat now, that it is not anti-Japanese but pro-Australian to oppose the Government of Australia giving to Japan taxation concessions that will help Japanese investors to deprive Australians of their financial interests in Australia. AllI suggest is that our Government take action to retain the control and the government of Australia for Australians by Australians just as the Japanese bave taken and continue to take action to keep control of Japan by the Japanese. f ask the Treasurer which of his answers was correct-that of 16th May 1967 or that of 27th August 1968. 1 challenge him. Does he still contend that the Japanese will not get advantages from a double taxation agreement out of all proportion to those gained by Australians? I emphatically state that the Japanese want taxation concessions to boost Japanese exports to Australia and to promote takeovers by the Japanese of Australian industries and resources. Those who sell their country in time of war are called quislings. Apparently those who assist lo sell their country to other nations in time of peace can claim to be liberal statesmen. I had informed the Treasurer that I intended to dispute his replies to my questions, that 1 intended to bring this malter up. He has not seen fit to be present this evening. Apparently the object of not only the Treasurer of this country but also the Press of this country, which relies upon the advertisements of overseas interests, is to conceal from the notice of the people of this country the intention of the Japanese to secure concessions that will enable them to take over Australia's resources and industries. This is a most important and urgent issue and one that should be discussed fully by the Parliaalready been concluded with the Japanese, is presented. This action should be taken so that we as a government or as a people should be able to make our statements and give our opinions in connection with the agreement, before the agreement is ratified by the leaders of this country and of Japan.

I think the honourable member was trying to make a little more of this than he needed in the circumstances. His attitude to any sort of foreign investment in Australia is well known and I think that colours his whole attitude to this subject. the week I have listened to some rather startling speeches.

161,Mr Dal Y (Grayndler) [11.22],"Duringwere these speeches that I was prompted to speak to show up the differences of opinion in the approach of Government supporters to international matters. It is on record that the honourable member for Balaclava has stated that there is little difference between Communism and Socialism. I wonder why he continues to enjoy the fruits of Socialism when he travels by Trans-Australia Airlines? I wonder whether he banks at the Commonwealth Bank because by his definition this is something very close to Communism. I wonder whether he supports the wheat stabilisation scheme? Does he believe in the stabilisation of markets? I wonder whether he believes in government railways and whether he delivers his letters by hand or sends them through the socialised Post Office. The honourable member made a hypocritical approach when he spoke about the great fear of Communism and the danger to this country and others of Russia, China and other Iron Curtain countries. ' the immense trade with those countries even when our servicemen are fighting and dying in Vietnam under the conscription laws of this Government, lt is to the credit of the United States of America, which is fighting in Vietnam, that it says it is opposed to the Chinese Republic and will not trade with it. But the Australian Government has two standards. The members of the Australian Country Party, who nominate and choose the Prime Minister and keep the Government in office, say we must trade with and sell wheat, wool and other primary products to Communist eountries irrespective of who our enemies might be and no matter how many Australian servicemen are dying in Vietnam today. The Australian Labor Party does not object to trade with any country at all. But if we thought, as the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) and others say, that Red China is the real threat to our security and we had to conscript men to fight in that part of the world, has signed trade agreements there. TheI do not believe the Labor Party would trade with that country. In addition, if the monstrous things being said by the Government are true in relation to the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia, why did the two honourable members opposite who spoke earlier and nearly make us tremble with fear on the dangers of Communism, give silent assent to the immense trade being done with Russia? Today national servicemen are dying in Vietnam. Probably the soldiers who are killing them are eating food made from wheat that has been sold to Red China with the support of honourable members opposite, because if their stories are correct, the Chinese are a threat to us and are engaged in this conflict against us. If the Government's story is true, Czechoslovakians are suffering today at the hands of Russian soldiers whose uniforms are of Australian wool that has been sold to Russia by an Australian Liberal-Country Party Government. Where do members of the Government parties stand on this issue? Do they stand with the United States? Have they the courage of their convictions? Or do they want it both ways? They frighten the daylights out of the people in regard to Communism and clothe and feed the very people who they say are engaged in the destruction of all the things that we stand for. I thought I should remind the House of Let us look at the present situation. Mainland China is Australia's fifth biggest customer. An answer given to the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) quite recently shows that only Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand have more trade with us. Do the two honourable members concerned support that policy? Do they support the sale of wool to Russia? Do they say that all the things that they have said tonight are true and that these people are endangering the security of the world and our security? If tbey do, let them stand up in this Parliament and tell us how they split their ethics, if I may use that term, and, in a most hypocritical way, quite wrongly condemn the Labor Party for being affiliated with the Communist Party, and trade with and condemn these people as enemies at the same time. The Minister been to Iron Curtain countries recently and Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony) went to Moscow recently. I thought he had gone Communist because when he returned he sang the praises of what he had seen in Russia in regard to farms and other things. The praises of the Russians and others were sung to the highest by this disciple of Country Party policy on",85,Adjournment

They do not like the politics of these people, but they love the jingle of Communist gold. So do members of the other Government party. The Minister for Trade and Industry is smiling handsomely and is of happier countenance than ever these days. He is shaking hands and signing trade agreements witb the representatives of Iron Curtain countries. But we do not see him behind the closed doors when the negotiations are taking place with the Communist leaders whom he condemns as a menace to world peace. According to the 'Australian' of 19th August, at this very moment we are trying to sell more wheat to China. An article headed 'We try to sell more wheat to China' states: A three-man team from the Australian Wheat people, irrespective of the consequences to Board has been in Shanghai for a week trying the people of Australia. Let me make the to sell more wheat to China. According to the Australian Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong, Mr R. Holberton, the delegation is headed by the Board chairman, Mr Callaghan, with the general manager, Mr L. Borman, and a board member, Mr P. Shannon, assisting him. Shortly we will see the Minister for Trade and Industry shaking bands with representatives of Red China as they sign an agreement. Then we will see him standing up in this Parliament a few days later and, supported by other members of the Government parties, condemning the menace of Red China as a threat to the security of the people of this country. It is scandalous to think that the Government conscripts boys to fight for freedom and liberty, as it says, in Vietnam where, it says, the future of this country is at stake because if Vietnam falls so will Australia. Yet the boys who are fighting there are being opposed by men who may be equipped with and fed on products sent to them by the very men who are using this monstrous law in order to conscript Australian servicemen to fight there. Honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. Why are not they Uke the Americans? Why do not they say: 'These people are the enemy and we will not trade with them'? Do they prefer to sell the lives of Australian servicemen for trade? That is precisely what the position appears to me to be. It was not until the Labor Party raised the matter that it became known that the Government was selling tallow and steel to North Vietnam and that some of the tallow may welt have been used in explosives that blew some of our soldiers to eternityin Vietnam. These matters are worth elaborating. I am sick and tired of being almost frightened, when an election is pending, by members of the Liberal Party thundering about the dangers of Communism. The very people whom they are condemning the most are the ones with whom they have the greatest trade. They are misleading the Australian public in the most hypocritical way because they know that what they are saying in many respects is not true. They know that their policy on Vietnam has been condemned not only in this country but in various other countries. Yet members of the Liberal Party are prepared to give in to the Country Party and to sell to these 1 Labor Party's attitude quite clear. countries. I am pleased that the Minister is here. He is one of the Ministers who have said that our security is in danger in Vietnam and that Red China is the threat to this country. If he believes that, why is he putting wheat into the bellies of the soldiers who are shooting down Australian boys in Vietnam. Let him answer that question. Honourable members on the other side speak of the rape of Czechoslovakia. What is their attitude to Russia? Do they still believe that Russia is a great menace? I admit it was a remarkable change to hear the Liberal Party in this Parliament defending a Communist regime. If honourable members opposite believe that these matters are deserving of condemnation, they should stand up and say why they are trading with the Communists. I repeat that they are condemning the Communist countries as a menace to Australia and they are the ones who are supplying those countries with the sinews of war, with wheat, wool and steel. Why do they do this if their case is true? The real reason is that their approach is hypocritical.
