I was held up at a committee hearing. of us. Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 March, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1997. This bill amends the access regime for the so-called essential facilities. The amendments will seek to streamline the process for access undertaken by service providers, and are specifically directed towards the electricity industry. That is a point that was entirely missed by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) when he spoke yesterday. This bill will promote competition in infrastructure sectors by providing very substantial benefits to consumers, businesses and the overall economy. This bill is about responsible micro-economic reform. It is about making the Australian economy more efficient and more effective, so that it delivers even greater benefits to the Australian community. This bill improves on the access provisions contained in the Competition Policy Reform Act of 1995, and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the national competition policy and our ongoing commitment, without apology, to micro-economic reform. The bill underlines our determination to continue to cut unnecessary red tape and administrative duplication through simplifying and streamlining the procedures for improving access arrangements to essential infrastructure services in network industries. Honourable members will be well aware of the election commitment given by this government to cut red tape with respect to small business. This is another indicatiol1 of how we are continuing to remove unnecessary red tape, unnecessary duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy from part of the Australian community. This bill will help establish a national, competitive electricity market. That is very important. The Industry Commission has estimated that the annual benefits through this establishment will be in the vicinity of some $S billion. That is $S,OOO million dollars, or approximately 2S per cent of the total benefits expected from the national competition policy reforms. The honourable member for Werriwa referred to some last gasp amendments moved by the Labor Party in the Senate. The simple fact of the matter is that those amendments were to require petrol companies to allow access to terminals, but it is fairly clear that the amendments",113,Adjournment

This bill, as I said a moment ago, is specifically directed towards the electricity industry. This government has a determination to improve competition in the petrol industry, and I will point out what the government proposes in relation to the petrol industry. Perhaps the honourable member for Werriwa and his colleagues missed the joint media release issued by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism( Mr Moore) on 11 December last year when the new approach by this government to the petrol industry was outlined. The amendments which the Labor Party will seek to move to this bill, the amendments which they sought to move in the other place, are amendments which are nothing to do with this particular bill. It is simply using this forum, using the parliament, as an opportunity for point scoring. It is a cynical attempt to criticise this government's approach to petroleum industry reforms. After 13 years of Labor government, the Labor Party has nothing much to be proud of in this area. The Labor Party did nothing much in relation to the petroleum industry or, for that matter, the electricity industry. So it really was a case of crying crocodile tears for the honourable member for Werriwa to come into the Main Committee yesterday and tell us that he is going to move amendments to this bill-amendments which are nothing to do with this bill at all. It is obvious that the 13 years of Labor neglect with respect to the petroleum industry have adversely impacted on the situation in rural and regional Australia. As a very effective regional and rural member yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware of the need for the government's policies and changes with respect to the petroleum industry to be implemented as soon as possible. But we find that it is very much as though the Labor Party these days has had a latter-day conversion on the road to Damascus, and that its members have gone from being tariff slashers in the former government to now being, in this parliament, proponents of tariff maintenance. The Labor Party has no policy consistency, I suppose one could say. Ms Worth-It is 'New Labor'. the next election they will be rejected once again by the Australian people. The Australian people actually respect consistency. They actually respect honesty. They actually respect the fact that people are prepared to say what they believe in and to proceed down that line. Every time we open the newspapers at the moment, we find that there has been an about-face. Mr Kelvin Thomson-You know nothing about consistency.

I have been making. The only reason I was referring to the petroleum industry was that just about the whole of the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa referred to proposed amendments which he will be moving to the bill, in effect to extend the terms of the bill beyond the electricity industry and, indeed, to the petroleum industry. SoI am sure that in those circumstances I am in order in referring to the speech by the honourable member for Werriwa, because he is saying that he is going to be moving petroleum industry amendments to the bill currently before the committee. committee that we have not yet seen those amendments. But certainly in this place, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are entirely right. They have not yet been moved, but the honourable member for Werriwa has foreshadowed his intention to do so. In doing so, though, he is suggesting that the Howard government is not interested in petroleum industry reform. He is suggesting that the Howard government is somehow welshing on its responsibility to bring about equity in the petroleum industry. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. I mentioned a few minutes ago the joint media release issued by the Treasurer and by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism on 11 December 1996, when it was pointed out that the government would: ... implement new measures in 1997 to promote increased competition and benefits to consumers in the petrol industry. The joint statement went on: In responding to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Petroleum Products Declaration report, the Government announced that petroleum products would be removed from prices surveillance in 1997, once the Treasurer is satisfied of pro-competitive developments in the market. One of the measures required to put this in place will be commitments from the oil majors to allow open terminal access and price transparency for the purchase of petrol by distributors and retailers. The amendments which are going to be moved by the honourable member for Werriwa in fact refer to access to petroleum terminals. SoI suggest that the honourable member for Werriwa should go off and have a cold shower. He should realise that the government has reform of the petrol industry firmly in its sights. We have a statement made by two of our most senior ministers confirming that we are committed to delivering major reforms in the petroleum sector, consistent with our election commitment. The ministers have also pointed out that progress has been made towards this end, and that the government moves to implement deregulation 'will promote greater competition which will lower prices over time.' So, after 13 years of inactivity, we find that, belatedly, the Labor Party has moved amendments in the --nate and will, in this place, move amendments to this bill, amendments which are entirely Irrelevant, amendments which miss the point. This bill is about improving access to essential facilities such as electricity grids. It is a -affirmation of our determination to have responsible micro-economic reform in Australia. Yhe bill will promote competition and we make no apology for that. It is interesting that the La1:tor Party is not actually opposing this bill but what it intends to do is to seek to expand the ambit of the bill beyond the electricity industry, to which it is specifically addressed, so that the petroleum industry can be included.",116,Representatives Main Committee

188,Mr Slipper,"They were, I understand, moved as last-gasp amendments in the Senate.2650 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 It would be more orderly for the Labor Party to wait for the reforms of the government to be implemented. The government's proposed reforms to the petroleum industry have received widespread support in the Australian community and I think it will be much better for the Labor Party to defer its comments on the petroleum industry until such time as the government continues to proceed with its reforms concerning that industry. I commend the bill to the committee. Access Codes) Bill 1997 is designed to streamline the formal procedures for granting access to third parties to infrastructure facilities and networks of national significance by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The bill proposes to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to incorporate a general industry access code approval process as a basis for access undertakings in network industries. Under the current legislation, the ACCC has to conduct both a public consultation process for the industry code and separate public consultation for each access undertaking made by a service provider. It is considered that that is an unnecessary duplication of effort for the ACCC and for relevant stakeholders and could lead to difficulties for the ACCC in assessing whether separate access undertakings will achieve single coherent industry wide access arrangements. This legislation incorporates legislation which was considered by Labor in government and I think accepted by Labor in government but was not announced. The proposals improve the efficiency of the access regime approval process, we believe, without diminishing consumer or service provider protection. On that basis, it is supported by the opposition. It ought to be able to simplify and streamline the procedures for approving access arrangements to infrastructure services in network industries and build on the access regime established by the former government. Under these arrangements, third parties can seek access to services provided by essential infrastructure facilities of national significance. In network industries, such as electricity, the emerging pattern is for an industry code to be developed governing access arrangements which form the basis of undertakings to the ACCC by individual service providers. This morning, I want to call for this industry access code to go further and cover the petroleum industry. The reason I do so is that the petroleum and electricity industries in Australia have been remarkably similar in their structure and performance-that is, an homogenous product within a vertically integrated industry with natural oligopoly features at the point of production. Their only substantial difference has been that we had public ownership of electricity and private ownership of petroleum products. At a time when, under the banner of Hilmer and competition policy, state governments are vertically separating their electricity operations-generation, distribution and retail-why should petrol be any different? At a time when houses with solar energy units can join the national electricity grid, why should service stations not be able to buy their product from the most competitive source? Why should the Hilmer principles governing vertical industry separation and open access regimes not be applied to Australia's petroleum industry? My colleague the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) has set out how this could happen. He said that a starting point would be to declare petrol refineries and terminals as an essential facility under the access regime. The terms and conditions of access would then be administered by the ACCC. The parliament has delegated authority for these declarations to",117,Representatives Main Committee
189,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10:16 A.m.),"The Trade Practices Amendment (IndustryThursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2651 the relevant minister, now the Treasurer ( Mr Costello), following a process of third party applications and National Competition Council assessment. In the case of petrol, it would not be inappropriate for the parliament to make its own declaration, just as in the 1995 Competition Policy Reform Act it determined to exempt coal rail transport for a period of five years. Declaration under the access regime would represent the first and most significant step towards the vertical separation of Australia's petroleum industry. It should ensure open access to terminals on reasonable terms and conditions. Other aspects of vertical separation should logically follow, based on the competition principle that an access regime should involve more than a company simply providing downstream access to one of its own subsidiaries. Importantly, I would argue that petrol meets the three criteria set out for declaration in the ACCC's access regime guidelines in November 1995. They are: 1. natural monopoly, duopoly or oligopoly characteristics such that, due to economies of scale, it would be uneconomic to develop another facility. 2. access to the facility services is a prerequisite for businesses to be able to compete effectively in markets upstream or downstream of the facility. 3. a facility of national significance, with regard to its importance to international and interstate trade. The member for Werriwa has pointed out that an access regime for petrol will become increasingly important as the industry continues to seek greater economies of scale. Each of the oil majors argues that the petrol industry in Australia is overcapitalised at both the wholesale and retail level. In its submission to the ACCC, for instance, Ampol argued that the industry should down-scale. It talked about 30 per cent fewer service stations, no more than 300 depots nationally, no more than three or four refineries, greater use of pipelines to distribute petrol between capital cities and major centres, and one shared seaboard terminal in each out port. If you look at that situation, it would seem to me that this strengthens the case for it being covered by the kind of industry access code to which we are referring this morning. I want to point out to the parliament that the Shell National Action Group has expressed concern about the direction in which petroleum retailing is going. It has written to Professor Fels as Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and referred to a transcript of a radio interview between Professor Fels and Neil Robins on 24 February when Professor Fels was asked whether he thought that elimination of what are referred to as the 'Sites Act' and the 'Franchise Act' would strengthen the oil companies' position to control retail and wholesale prices. In the transcript, Professor Fels said: We have doubts whether the two bits of legislation you're talking about-the sites act and the franchise act-are really doing that much good at the moment. We think this is a bit of reguiation that hasn't really served a useful purpose. That doesn't mean we aren't concerned about Shell's move to have multi-site franchising, but I do think it's unlikely that oil companies would try to take over and run every service station in town if the sites act left. The Shell National Action Group indicated to Professor Fels that they differed with him on most of the points he had raised and expressed concern that, after the abundant industry information that they have tabled before the ACCC, he should take such a position. They go on to say: The PRMF and the PRMS Actsthe sites act and the franchise act2652 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 have most definitely served a useful purpose over the last 17 years. They have afforded an umbrella of protection for oil company franchisees who were previously, and quite often, at the mercy of the oil companies regarding tenure. Prior to these Acts, many franchisees were, at the whim of an oil company junior employee, given one months notice to quit their businessesof the member for Wills. But, as I did with the previous speaker, from the government side, I must remind you that there are no amendments dealing with petrol before the House of Representatives, the main chamber, or this committee, and that the bill we are debating refers to electricity. I do hope that the member will be able to direct his remarks to the content of the bill as it is, not to amendments which mayor may not appear. about what should be in this bill and what ought to be covered by the industry access codes, the subject of the bill. I do want to put a submission that the parliament ought to be looking at including petroleum as well as electricity and other things in relation to the industry access codes. It is my understanding that because amendments were moved in the Senate and because the member for Werriwa has foreshadowed his intention to move amendments relating to the petroleum industry, and because the member for Fisher( Mr Slipper) has also spoken about these issues, it is reasonable for me and other speakers to take a position where we seek to expand the ambit of the bill and it is reasonable to debate these issues in that context. That is why I have chosen to make remarks about this issue. it is reasonable and proper for the occupant of this chair to remind all members of the need to observe standing orders. Please proceed. Group has indicated to Professor Fels that they feel: · . . the remedy is not to repeal this act, but to strengthen and re-mould it to incorporate modern terminology to prevent oil companies circumventing the original intention of this act. .. that is, to prevent oil companies from controlling more than a small percentage of their total sites, and thus controlling the retail price, as they currently have the ability to do with multi site franchising to the detriment of competition. As franchisees, they have expressed concern about: · .. the lack of protection afforded to us through the Trade Practices Act due to numerous constraints such as the cost of funding actions, the complexity of federal actions, the lengthy duration of any challenge and time consciousness of the system. The oil companies are well aware of this and it is only of recent times of agitation within this industry that a number of different branded franchisees have joined together to collectively take actions against their franchisors. They go on to say: The franchisees and the motoring public need these Acts in place. Without them the oil companies will control every franchised retail petrol outlet in Australia, as Shell have publicly stated, as their determined goal. The oil companies are desperately attempting to have these Acts repealed ... and that repeal of the acts · .. gives them more control and unshackles them from the very constraints which are currently protecting both franchisees and the public.",118,Representatives Main Committee

193,Mr Kelvin Thomson,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Shell National ActionThursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2653 That is why I would express the view that there is a need for the industry access codes to be widened in the way proposed by the member for Werriwa. The letter then goes on to say: The true fix for this industry is not in repealing those Acts but in allowing all franchisees to play on a level playing field. If we could all have the ability to purchase fuel under the same conditions as Woolworths, that is up to 9 cents per litre cheaper than they are forced to purchase from our franchisors locked high prices ... Indeed, it is my concern that if the view taken by Professor Fels were to be followed then in many towns and cities there would be a Coles at one end, a Woolworths at the other and nothing in between-no news agent, no service stations, no local baker, no pharmacist, no banks, no post office, and no motor mechanic. There would be just a Coles at one end and a Woolworths at the other. We have a situation where downstream access is essential to fair competition in this area. We have Woolworths presently establishing itself as another vertically integrated major with access to cheap wholesale petrol and it is establishing horizontal alliances with other majors. Unless branded and franchised stations can also access cheaper petrol then they face closure at the hands of Woolworths. By making competitive petrol access a legal right, small petrol retailers would not need the resources enjoyed by Woolworths, rather, existing service stations in country towns, for example, would have the same terminal access rights as any new competitor. This is not just an issue for consumers, the other part of this issue is the treatment of franchisees. I have had quite a lot of correspondence about Shell's treatment of franchisees. For example, one letter I had referred to Shell's 'corporate thuggery towards its single site franchisees'. Another letter pointed out that under the multi-site franchise system, any individual dealer who wanted to become part of this system with, for example, 'between 15 and 35 sites would need capital of between $450,000 to $1,050,000 just to pay for each site's franchise fee'. If you look at store stock levels-a realistic average of, say, $35,000 per site-then they would need another half a million dollars for 15 sites and a further million dollars for 35 sites. Fuel stock would be another $900,000 to $2 million. So for a 15-site franchise, a person in that situation would need to raise over $1.8 million, and for 35 sites the figure explodes to over $4 million. So, in those circumstances, it seems impossible to imagine that a multi-site operator could function without Shell's active participation through a bank guarantee, and the only conclusion that the authors of this letter draw is that there is a strong relationship between the multi-site franchisees and Shell and that, furthermore, 80 per cent of Shell's revenue and sales is controlled by a small number of dealers. I have had information supplied to me by Charles Power of Holding Redlich concerning the operation of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act which does provide certain basic protection of tenure for lessee service station operators and requires disclosure of relevant information by oil companies to prospective franchisees. But it does not apply to commission agents or distributors, nor to resellers who occupy their own premises, and oil companies typically require service station dealers to operate as commission agents in respect of sale of fuel and, thereby, put such franchisees outside the protections of the Petroleum Retail 2654 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 Marketing Franchise Act. So, the end result of this is that franchisees are greatly disadvantaged. For example, here is a case that was brought to my attention. Back in 1980, Mario and Robyn Suprano accepted Shell's offer to operate Shell Wallsend in the Newcastle area as a self-serve commission agency in return for which Shell would upgrade the site. In mid-1989, the Supranos who were dissatisfied with waiting for Shell to upgrade the site, said that unless Shell gave assurances that Shell Wallsend would be refurbished in the near future, they would pull out of the site. In October 1989, Shell showed them plans to refurbish the site. They were to become Shell° Force franchisees and were promised lO-year tenure in two five-year terms. So, they stayed there. But Shell departed from its representations regarding 1 years tenure some three years into its term of franchise. In September of 1990, four weeks before the re-opening of the refurbished Shell Wallsend, the Supranos were told by Shell that they would be commission agents, not dealer franchisees, putting them outside the protection of the franchisees act. They still signed an agreement which gave them 10 years tenure in three terms of three, three and four years. Shell said that they would only refuse to renew the agreement if the Supranos were consistently in breach of it, which they had never been. In July 1993, Mr Suprano sought to renew the agreement for the second term, more than two months before his first term was up. But Shell did not respond until nearly 18 months later when they informed the Supranos that they were not prepared to renew because they had not provided written notice of their desire for a further term. Absolutely extraordinary! The Supranos ended up being forced to sign, agreeing to a 12-month extension of the agreement and only in line with Shell's current policy. That is to say, there was no guaranteed tenure because their livelihood depended entirely on their being allowed to continue to trade at Wallsend. Furthermore, in March of 1993, Shell reduced the commission paid for sales downwards. These commission and royalty payment arrangements are extraordinary. An increase in litres sold, as a result of franchisees' efforts can, in fact, put franchisees in a worse financial position than those achieving lesser sales. Other franchisees have also experienced similar treatment. Charlie Qasabian and Simon Totonjian have a Shell service station at Doyalson and the Greta Roadhouse on the New England Highway. After getting a letter confirming 10 years at the Greta site, they entered into a $90,000 loan to purchase the business from Shell. They spent $250,000 endeavouring to turn the site into a profitable business, but Shell refused to renew the lease after its expiry on 30 June 1996 and offered them far less than appropriate compensation. So what we have are situations highlighting the inequality of bargaining power between service station operators and petrol companies. If there is any dispute the petrol companies simply cut off supply. As a result, there is a need for better legislation to protect both consumers and franchisees. That is why I support the remarks made by the member for Werriwa concerning the need to expand this area of the Trade Practices Act and the operation of industry access codes. Latham), who I see in the Main Committee room, will generally agree with the thrust of my remarks. I am delighted to see such a large gallery. Mr Ted Grace-They knew you were speaking!",120,Representatives Main Committee
194,Mr Mcarthur (Corangamite) (10.36 A.m.),"I am sure the member for Werriwa( MrThursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2655 This trade practices legislation is fundamentally about competition, which the member for Werriwa would be very keen about. The Productivity Commission's stocktake of microeconomic reform had this to say about competition: Getting more competition across the economy is now seen as a key to better performance. It provides a powerful stimulus for private and public firms to operate efficiently and respond to what consumers want. It encourages firms to search continuously for improvements in the way they operate, and is therefore vital to the process of productivity improvement through time. Competition is also central to ensuring productivity gains are shared with the wider community through lower prices. I entirely endorse those sentiments of the Productivity Commission. Regulation and monopoly and protection all encourage inefficiency and a misallocation of resources. Competition promotes efficiency and continuous improvement leading to consumer choice, better quality and lower prices. Most Australians are familiar with the benefits of competition in the sporting field. As Australia is a great sporting nation, it is appropriate that the Australian economy should be based on the principle that all sectors are exposed to the rigours of competing with each other and with the world's best. The sporting analogy helps us to understand the nature of competition-the way the competition encourages improvement, the way fair competition helps us to understand and respect the verdict of the umpire, and the way competition encourages cooperation between team members. The two concepts are not in conflict, as some people would claim. Nothing could be more removed from the Australian psyche than a desire to escape or avoid healthy competition. The most significant reform for the Australian economy over the past 15 years has beer, those reforms which injected greater competition. Two fundamental reforms stand out: the lowering of protection which exposed Australian firms to greater international competition-I note that the member for Werriwa has been supportive of the general move by the former Labor government to a lower protection regime-and the injection of competition into a number of the sectors of the domestic economy. Examples of this include the ending of the two-airline policy-all members would be aware of the improvement under the newer regime-the entrance of competition in the international, SID and mobile phone markets through Optus and Vodafone, the reduction in Australia Post's monopoly position, and state government moves to open up the electricity market to greater competition. I have had personal exposure to Australia Post's operation, and I say that they have become very competitive, both on an Australian market position and in comparison with other nations. I think that is because they have been open to genuine competition in some sectors of their markets whilst they do maintain a monopoly of the standard letter rate. This bill is part of a next step to a policy reform process. The Hilmer competition reforms are also known as the national competition policy and it dates back to the special Premiers conference in 1991. Until then the focus of micro-economic reform was on individual industries, for instance, the aviation industry, the automobile industry-which is now a focus",122,Representatives Main Committee
195,Mr Mcarthur,"That is right, they knew I was speaking, as the member for Fowler says.2656 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 in the current debate-the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, postal services, which have been the subject of a number of government inquiries, Telecom and higher education. The national competition policy, flowing from the Hilmer report, is by contrast a national cross-industry initiative. Broadly, the policy requires governments to undertake the following initiatives: structural reform of their public monopolies; ensuring competitive neutrality-a level playing field is a term that a lot of people like to use-between the public and private sectors where they compete; conducting a review of all legislation which may limit competition; and ensuring access to essential infrastructure services for third parties. It is this final element which is dealt with by this bill. Under the Hilmer reforms, governments are required to look at the public businesses which have been traditionally regarded as natural monopolies. These industries, such as rail, electricity, postal and telephone services, have been traditionally regarded as services which only the government can provide. There can only be one rail network, one set of electricity wires and one set of telegraph poles. However, in the last few years we have come to question whether all these services really need to be monopolies and whether government really needs to be the provider. Under the competition policy, governments are asked to look at the possibility of separating aspects of these businesses which are natural monopolies and those which are potentially competitive. For example, railways have traditionally been regarded as being the domain of governments because of their natural monopoly characteristics. In other words, it is uneconomic to duplicate rail networks, and thus competition between rail tracks would be wasteful and costly. However, rolling stock, passenger and freight services are potentially competitive. Just as private cars, trucks and buses drive on public roads, there is no reason why private operators cannot use public rail tracks and compete vigorously with one another. By doing this, the natural monopolies-the roads, rail tracks, telephone wires or electricity poles-stay in government hands, but the private sector is allowed to offer services in the area where competition is possible. The greater the competition, the greater the incentive to raise quality, lower prices and give consumers choice. Competition between the SID telephone companies Telstra and Optus has had this result. Optus makes use of the Telstra network, just as different truck operators make use of the Hume Highway. This is the nature of what is called third-party access under the national competition policy. The bill before the House helps to streamline the mechanisms by which access can be negotiated and the terms and conditions of access to essential infrastructure like telephone networks, rail tracks and gas pipelines might be determined. It is pleasing to bring to the committee's attention that the electorate of Corangamite has been among the pioneers of private sector access to public rail facilities. In my electorate, West Coast Rail is among the first ever private passenger rail operator in Australia's recent history. The company negotiated access to the track between Melbourne and Warrnambool and runs a private service which was once run by the government owned V -Line. West Coast Rail now provides the only service from Warrnambool to Geelong, with three trains per day each way, and competes directly with V-Line on the Geelong to Melbourne route. We have a situation where this privati sed service has integrated into the V-Line network throughout Victoria. So on the one hand we see the public monopoly position operating, but with the new West Coast Rail service providing a service efficiently and effectively, and saving the government some $5 million. Thursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 2657 The Victorian government was actually going to close that line. Now West Coast Rail has provided the service to the electorates of Corangamite and Warrnambool and provided a new concept of the way in which a private operator, owning its own rolling stock, might operate on the publicly owned track. We also see that TNT and the Specialised Container Transport Company are competing with National Rail on the standard gauge between Melbourne, Adeiaide and Perth, which incidentally runs through the electorate of Corangamite. Yesterday's Financial Review foreshadowed the possibility of the stevedoring firm Patrick's also becoming involved in rail freight operations on this route, which I commend as a desirable possibility. The Commonwealth's share of National Rail is set to be privati sed, along with the passenger service of Australian National and its freight arms in Tasmania and South Australia. But the standard gauge rail itself will stay in government hands and will be run by Track Australia, a specialist track management agency. This is a clear example of the separation of the functions which is possible, even under the traditional natural monopolies, under the Hilmer competition reforms. This bill deals with the rules about determining the terms and conditions of access to essential services, such as, the rail networks, electricity grids and gas pipelines where access is now being seen as an important prerequisite for real competition and, ultimately, lower prices. Under Part 3A of the Trade Practices Act, the relevant minister may declare certain essential infrastructure. This would require the infrastructure to be offered to those third-party users, potential competitors, under certain terms and conditions. Alternatively, the owners of this infrastructure, usually the government agencies, may offer access undertaking which would set out the terms and conditions under which it would offer infrastructure access to new players. The undertaking would set out all the terms and conditions that any new player would need to meet to be granted access. This undertaking would be submitted to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The ACCC would advertise the offer, take submissions from interested parties, and undertake public consultations on the process. Of course, there would be industries where the access undertakings would be best done on a national scale. Instead of negotiating a series of different, independent access undertakings each with its own period of public consultations and submissions, it would be possible to have a national overall industry access code. This bill will facilitate that administrative change. The ACCC will be able to conduct public inquiries and take submissions on a national industry access code without going through the wasteful process of conducting a number of individual inquiries, consultations, and submissions from the public. The glaring example of where this approach is required is in the electricity market. Part of the national policy agreed to by the Commonwealth and the states requires the creation of a national market in electricity. The national market will soon commence involving New South Wales, the ACT and Victoria. Werriwa says, participation of Queensland remains in doubt at this stage, so I accept the interjection of the honourable member. If there is to be a national electricity market then access to electricity grids in each state should be determined by a national industry access code, not a series of individual access agreements as submitted to the ACCC. The latter would be an excessively cumbersome approach. Thus, this bill will be of vital importance in setting the arrangements for the national",123,Representatives Main Committee

197,Mr Mcarthur,"South Australia will follow suit at a later stage and, as the Member for2658 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 electricity market. The national market will provide consumers in different states with unprecedented choice in where they source their power. Once again, Victoria has led the way in this reform by splitting up the old SEC into an electricity grid which remains in public hands. There are six electricity distributors, all now operating as private companies, such as Powercor, United Energy, Solaris, and Citipower. There are also a number of separate and largely privately owned electricity generators, such as Yallourn, Loy YangA and Loy Yang B, all of which can compete to supply electricity along the government-owned grid. Of course, if the private sector operators are to compete with the public sector on publicowned infrastructure, then we need a competitive neutrality. Competitive neutrality really means a level playing field between the public and private sectors. Often, government business enterprises enjoy some unnatural advantages over their private sector competitors. Many have traditionally been exempt from sales tax and other government charges. Others have had the benefit of government guarantees over their borrowings. State and federal governments are now being asked to neutralise these advantages so that public and private sectors can compete on an equal footing. The Victorian government has moved to impose debt guarantee charges on major government enterprises to remove any advantage they may have from the government guarantee over their debts. Another aspect of the competition policy is the requirement of conducting a legislative review. State and federal governments are supposed to look at any rules and regulations on the statute books which restrict competition. The governments must identify anti-competitive laws and determine whether those laws can be justified in the public interest. The public interest should include a broad range of factors, such as, the social welfare, ecologically sustainable development, regional development and occupational health and safety. Thus, even the Hilmer reforms recognise that unfettered competition may not always maximise the broad community welfare in all cases, although there is concern that governments are exempting certain industries from the Hilmer reforms even before they conduct the relevant reviews of the legislation. The National Competition Council, set up to advise the government on the progress of the competition policy, has already expressed doubts about decisions made by some governments. It has questioned the New South Wales government's decision to retain the existing arrangements for rice marketing. The honourable member for Werriwa and I would have some concerns about the monopoly position of that particular organisation; I have challenged it in the past. It has also questioned the ACT's shopping hour restrictions. These restrictions are the complete opposite of the Victorian government's decision to allow 24-hour trading, thus liberalising the market and removing several anomalies under prior restrictions. At the Commonwealth level, there are a number of industries which have also been exempted. The Wheat Board's single desk export monopoly is something that there is a considerable amount of debate on, on our side of politics, but in the broad thrust of discussions I think that, over the next 20 years, that monopoly position will certainly be questioned. The regional monopoly of local newsagents and the restrictions of home delivery of newspapers may be exempted from the scrutiny of the Trade Practices Act. Again, that is another quite interesting argument as to the monopoly of the news agents that has been maintained after a considerable amount of debate on both sides of the parliament. Thursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2659 So the government needs to be vigilant about encouraging competition in all aspects. I notice that the honourable member for Werriwa is very keen on encouraging genuine competition between the oil companies and making sure that there is a fair and level playing field between the big majors and another couple of new entrants. I share some of those sentiments with him. I conclude by referring again to West Coast Rail. That concept of running a privatised rail in Victoria is leading the way and other state governments might follow the example and integrate, in a sensible and practical way, the operation of a private company using rail trackeither government owned rolling stock or their own rolling stock-and develop an integrated service within the total passenger service of the states or the Commonwealth. Then, over time, we can move away from this so-called natural monopoly of railways which has been the mindset of governments and, I think, of the Australian people since Federation. SoI commend West Coast Rail on its very good performance over the last three years in providing a service and, more importantly, providing an idea and a concept that the Commonwealth can follow. I recognise the one-track initiative of the previous Labor government in standardising the gauge throughout Australia and putting forward the concept that access to the standard gauge would then be available to private sector operators. It was a step in the right direction. I am very confident that the new Howard government will follow on and make more accessible the whole idea of using the national standard gauge, like the national highway system, for access by private operators. In that way, the rail systems in Australia will become more competitive, more efficient and provide better transport for very heavy agricultural goods to the seaports. to respond on behalf of the government. As I represent the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) in this portfolio today, I would like firstly to thank all those who have contributed to the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1997.

202,Colleague The Member For Corangamite ( Mr Mcarthur) Would Agree That That Is Going A Bit,"2660 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 The Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 reflects the second tranche of the complete rewrite of the income tax legislation embarked upon by Labor through the tax law improvement project in 1994. On Monday, I am pleased to note, the Senate passed the first package of three bills that commence the rewrite. Labor supports this legislation as it is essential that the large and complex income tax legislation laws must be simplified, hopefully to reduce compliance costs for both taxpayers and the tax office, and to take the opportunity to improve certainty in cases where there is currently a great deal of tax law uncertainty. This whole process is necessary because the old legislation, the 1936 parent act, has been amended and expanded so often that it has lost an overall coherent structure. Because of the sheer enormity of the task, the rewrite has to occur in tranches. This ongoing rewrite process, piece by piece, provides its own challenges as it is not possible to repeal the entirety of the 1936 act and replace it in total. Labor does not criticise this process. Naturally enough, we understand it is the only realistic option. However, this process has produced some disquiet in some sections of the industry. There is a variety of opinions. Some believe that there should be absolutely no policy changes at all in the rewrite. For example, Price Waterhouse, as reported in the Financial Review in October last year, argues that the resources of the tax law improvement program should be redirected towards a tax reform task force-that is, change policy first and then rewrite the legislation. Clearly, Labor favours the current process which we instigated when in government. The Assistant Treasurer has the authority to make some small limited changes, especially to clarify the tax laws. However, this process should not be used to significantly alter policy more or less through the backdoor. Labor initially understood that the government agreed with this policy neutral project. However, this legislation, as introduced to the parliament, goes beyond a simple and neutral rewrite role. This particular tranche is being rewritten to address matters concerning assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. The more specialised areas include entertainment expenses and primary production. As with earlier bills, this bill was sent to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for consideration. The committee's report on the legislation, No. 348, was tabled in the House on 6 March. I am pleased to see in the chamber the chair of that committee, Mr Somlyay. I pay tribute to the work of his committee in the rewrite project because, in the parliamentary scrutiny, the rewrite brings forth a whole range of very complex and detailed matters in our taxation laws. To have a joint committee that so capably gets across all the detail and complexity, and provides due parliamentary scrutiny to the project, is absolutely critical. From time to time, there is too little public appreciation of the active role of committees such as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in that parliamentary scrutiny. It is a very good thing that we have a committee that is well-led, well-resourced, and very active in making sure that the work of the tax officials in the rewrite project, and the involvement of the private sector, receives due parliamentary scrutiny. I pay tribute to the work and the report of the joint committee in that regard. I also endorse the way in which the committee appreciates that the best type of rewrite is a policy neutral rewrite. I note its concerns about the significant policy changes proposed within the bill. In particular, a concern arises about the proposed alteration of the depreciation provisions concerning hire purchase transactions, and the proposed alterations to the trading Thursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2661 stock provisions where assets change their character from normal business assets into trading stock, and vice versa. There is also a large number of minor technical amendments to ensure that the bill accurately reflects the existing law. Accordingly, the government has circulated numerous amendments; 83 in total. The opposition will not oppose any of these amendments. However, while being supportive of the project, we are concerned about the volume of amendments being presented to the parliament, and I am sure that that concern is supported by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and its chairperson. Perhaps part of the problem relates to the resourcing of the tax law improvement program. A vacancy has existed in one of the two private sector positions within the program since December 1995, 18 months ago-a vacancy for private sector resources to the program-and I note that the joint parliamentary committee has expressed concern about this delay. The joint committee has also suggested that additional resources be made available for the hiring, on a short-term basis, of private sector experts in particular areas to supplement the general program team. Labor supports this recommendation wholeheartedly. I note with concern, however, the cost to the public interest of the inadequate resourcing of a core government function-that of the major revenue authority, the Tax Office-and of private sector resources being harnessed for this particular program. I urge the government to take corrective action as soon as possible. It is an important point that too often in the public commentary, and too often under this government's budget management, it is assumed that every single budget cut and every single reduction in public resourcing is a good thing. But, clearly, the private sector can suffer much greater costs than the small public costs that are being saved. The cost to the private sector-to the accountancy and tax law industries and the small business sector, in particular--of delaying this tax improvement project is immense. For the government not to have filled a vacancy for some 18 months in the private sector resources that can be harnessed for the project really is an opportunity cost of folly. It is far better to resource this program fully, get the rewrite happening as fast as possible, have it approved by the parliament under the scrutiny of the joint committee, and allow certainty and simplicity to take hold in the tax law industry around Australia and in the understanding of those laws by private citizens and the private sector, particularly small businesses. The government needs to act on the recommendations of the joint committee to give this rewrite process full and adequate public sector resourcing. Other than making those comments, I will say that Labor will be supporting this bill and the circulated amendments, and we look forward to the further success of the rewrite program. reading the second reading speech by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister( Mr Miles), in which he said that the 1936 act was 'on the verge of collapsing under the weight of 60 years of constant and largely piecemeal amendment.' I have spoken to accountants about the income tax act, and they all say the same thing: it has become so heavy to lift that some of the staff are looking at putting in claims for back problems. It is about time it was reviewed and rewritten to make the act shorter, easier to understand, and with as few loopholes as possible.

I am advised that both New",127,Representatives Main Committee

That is a great tribute to Mr Somlyay and his committee, who have reviewed the bill. The rewritten areas that, in particular, I want to talk about are the areas that cover expenses, primary production deductions, the recoupment of deductible expenses and the sale of leased cars. I am advised by the accountants that I have spoken to about these issues that these are the issues that are most open to debate. As a result of that, of course, it costs the taxpayer money to have the matters resolved and costs the taxation department time, effort and money in trying to determine who is right and who is not right and in trying to interpret the intention of the act. I want to mention five points in particular. They are minor policy changes and I note that these changes have the support of the opposition. The five specific points that will make it easier, simpler and less burdensome for the taxpayer are: replacing the rules with which one facilitates taxpayer compliance; simplifying the rules which are unnecessarily complex; deleting unnecessary rules; removing anomalies; and clarifying ambiguities. Anyone who has anything to do with the income tax act will be very pleased that these changes will occur. The only other thing I would like to mention is that this will have no impact on revenue. It is basically a broadly neutral impact on revenue. It is about time that this has been tackled and, as I said, I want to pay tribute to Mr Somlyay and his committee for reviewing the changes and for making this possible. It will, in time, save us all a lot of time, money and effort and the taxpayers of Australia will be very pleased with these changes, not to mention the accountants, and those who go to them to seek advice and to understand the interpretations of the act, which have become very complex. I know in one particular case-my own case-I have sought a clarification from the Australian Taxation Office on matters that my accountant and I would like to dispute, and we have asked them for an interpretation of the act. We chose not to put in my tax return and to say that we have taken the deductions. If the ATO disagrees, they should advise us accordingly. We have decided that the best thing we can do is to ask for a clarification of the matters and then we will put in an amended return. It has now been close enough to six months and we still have not had a response from the Australian Taxation Office. I can understand the difficulty of the complexity in which they find themselves, trying to interpret something that should have been cleared up a long time ago. I fully support the bill. overhaul of our surfeit of tax legislation. What is different is that this message is now being driven, not only by industry and employer groups which have long championed tax reform, but also by social welfare groups, including the Australian Council of Social Service. The government finds itself in a position a little like Aladdin, inasmuch as the tax reform genie has been released from the bottle and simply will not go away. While the government has chosen to continue to grant two wishes, that is the rewriting and renumbering of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the clarification of ambiguities, it has, as its predecessor in government did, baulked at the third and unarguably most critical wish, and that is an overhaul of our byzantine tax policy. We are left, Mr Deputy Speaker, to tiptoe through the TLIPs, without even a suggestion of falsetto help from Tiny Tim. This bill is the second instalment of legislation to result from the tax law improvement project, which was established by the former Labor government on 1 July 1994.

My support for the efforts being made by the tax law improvement project team is qualified. However, I reaffirm my belief that it is absolutely essential that the terms of reference for this project should be extended by the government to include and allow for a review of some policy matters. The progress to date by the project team is not really significant. It is a start, but nothing more. There should be absolutely no easing of pressure on this parliament to implement substantive changes to tax legislation. It is very clear that this country needs a bipartisan commitment to total tax reform if it is to remain competitive in an increasingly globalised economy. Moreover, the commitment must be to rapid but thoughtful change. If the current rate of progress by the tax law improvement project is anything to go by, it will be something like 25 to 30 years before the rewrite is complete, given that there is no major rewrite or change to policy in the meantime. That is plainly unacceptable. One of the criticisms being levelled against the current rewrite of corporations legislation is the length of time involved. Mr Richard Humphry, Managing Director of the Stock Exchange, recently commented that the simplification of the existing laws was not solving the problem because the corporations legislation needed to be rewritten from scratch. He suggested that 'Corporations Law would not stand up to any form of competitive analysis against international law.' Mr Humphry concluded by saying that the corporate law simplification project was progressing at the speed of an old-fashioned steamer while the global marketplace operates at an electronic level of speed. His comments might apply to the TLIP project. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its recent report into the tax law improvement project, revealed an opposing anxiety. It stated that it was concerned that 'TLIP's process may be suffering in the rush to have legislation introduced into the parliament.' The committee chairman, the honourable member for Fairfax( Mr Somlyay), went on to say: The committee has not had time to review the bill as comprehensively as it would have liked. The committee acknowledged that while the mass of the second instalment of TLIP had been embraced in general terms, there were two divisions that had earned strong criticism by tax experts. It indicated that the government would have to 'schedule sufficient time for parliamentary debate and review of the next tranche of legislation,' to ensure meaningful consultation and scrutiny in the tax law improvement project in future. The government would do well to heed the advice of the JCPA, given that the government went to the last election on a platform of improved levels of consultation and accountability. It is of real concern that the JCPA is unhappy with the amount of time it has had to liaise with tax professionals on this instalment of TLIP. It seems to me that an imbalance now exists between allowing for adequate consultation and the timely delivery of TLIP. If the government cannot strike a balance for the simple renumbering and rewriting of 16 divisions in the tax act, how does it expect to assure the community that real tax reform will be dealt with in a decisive manner? The Financial Review reported on 28 May 1996 that Australia's international competitiveness had deteriorated over the previous year, and cited our weak performance in the category of 2664 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 internationalisation as particularly alarming. Six months later another report found that Australia was losing ground because of relatively high taxes. An improved structure, simpler language and a better numbering system are certainly a step in the right direction in terms of tax reform. But this is at best a partial solution. It is merely another example of treating the symptoms rather than effecting a cure. So while the member for Braddon( Mr Miles), in his speech during the second reading debate, talked about the benefits of reduced compliance and administration costs that business can expect to enjoy because of the tax law improvement project charter, I seek to remind him and others that tax experts are far less effusive when it comes to the project. As Mr Geoffrey Lehmann, a partner of Price Waterhouse, was reported in the Australian of 5 July last year to have said, the tax law improvement project: ... is an attempt to simplify the language and arrangement of tax legislation, while doing nothing to change the underlying complexity of tax laws that cause the real problems for taxpayers. In a nutshell, plain English and improved drafting are not in themselves a substitute for simpler tax law with lower compliance costs. True simplification of the tax system is linked inextricably to a review of tax policy. The JCPA made explicit its view on this matter. Its second recommendation stated that the TLIP should have its terms of reference expanded by the government to allow it to consider a wider range of tax policy simplification issues. Section 3.6 of the JCPA report reads: The committee had received considerable evidence that unclear or unworkable sections of the 1936 act are being perpetuated in the bill because changing them is beyond TLlP's very limited mandate to make policy changes. By ruling out any review of tax policy, at least in its first term, the current government, like its predecessor, has made it clear that it will not make the wide ranging changes to the tax system that are needed to make it as simple, fair and economically efficient as possible. The Taxation Institute of Australia presented a paper at the 1996 tax summit titled 'The quintessential tax system, reform: the impossible dream'. In it the TIA argued that, for a tax system to achieve the three essential goals of simplicity, equity and efficiency: A tax system in its design, legislation and administration, ought to be able to be complied with by ordinary taxpayers, having regard to the complexity of his/her affairs, without resort to professional assistance. It is an indictment of our income tax system that approximately 70 per cent of individual taxpayers now turn to tax professionals each year to prepare their income tax returns. The Industry Commission's Office of Regulatory Review noted, in a report released in July 1996: It would not be surprising if broad surveys of compliance costs or attitudes to the tax system fail to show major falls in tax compliance costs after the tax law improvement project is complete. This was a government instrumentality predicting that the four years, millions of dollars and countless man-hours pumped into the hallowed tax law improvement project could be for naught. At the same time, the JCPA concluded that TLIP's rewrite will go only halfway to meeting the goal of the simplification of the 1936 act because of its narrow mandate. It said that the cost of compliance, and the burden of administration of the tax law, will not be reduced until Thursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2665 the Commonwealth and state governments commit themselves to a 'comprehensive review of tax policy'. Is it any wonder that two presenters at the 1996 tax summit referred to Australia's tax reform process as being almost entirely captured by the bureaucracy. Messrs Phillip Anderson and Richard Vann assert that Australia is desperate for an independent inquiry into the entire tax system. They argue convincingly that, until this occurs, the past practice of legislating ad hoc changes to a system that is ill-equipped to sustain them will continue. As far as they are concerned, the tax law improvement project 'demonstrates over and over again, we will not get the fundamental review of the income tax act that is absolutely necessary ... while the tax policy process remains the preserve of a bureaucracy' obsessed with tax avoidance. Soon after the election of the coalition government, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs( Mr Prosser) went on record as saying that those on the right side of the House recognised that small business was the engine room of the Australian economy. He said that the coalition would make things 'a darn sight better' for small business than did his Labor Party predecessor. The centrepiece of this commitment was the establishment of the small business deregulation task force. In December last, the task force released 62 recommendations on how the government should reduce the compliance burden on the small business sector. Many of these proposals were reliant on an overhaul of the fringe benefits and wholesale sales tax systems. Likewise, in a joint submission to the government on the tax law improvement project, the TIA, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Society of Certified Practising Accountants have made it clear that plans to cut business compliance costs could not be addressed without substantial reform to the capital gains tax. As for the coalition commitment to reducing the paperwork burden on small businesses by half, in February last year the Business Review Weekly had this to say: The unanimous view is that a 50% reduction can be achieved only if the legislation that caused the paperwork-primarily tax legislation-is overhauled. Tinkering at the edges, getting rid of one form here and another form there, will not even come close to achieving the coalition's promised revenueneutral 50% reduction. The small business deregulation task force makes no reference in its report to the positive impact that the tax law improvement project will have on small business, because it sees it for what it is: yet another fits and starts attempt at questionable reform. At a tax summit, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the ACCI, warned the then Labor government about the danger to small business of tokenism in the tax reform process. It said: Piecemeal action should be avoided at all costs. This is the fundamental flaw we have faced since the wheels fell off the tax reform cart 10 years ago. The lack of true tax reform, the representative of ACCI went on to say: ... is why small businesses in particular are feeling alienated and under siege from compliance imposts which have been calculated as worse than virtually any other country in the world. It would seem that neither the former Labor government nor the current coalition government have heeded that warning. While the minister for small business may bleat about promises kept, including changes to capital gains tax rollover relief, it is worthwhile remembering that this came at the price of what one tax professional described as 25 pages of 'brain numbing legislative amendments'. 2666 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 In the words of Mr Graeme Samuel, the President of the ACCI, 'Why does the tax office invest millions of dollars in a tax law improvement project if it cannot staunch the flow of legislative gobbledegook' in one particular amendment. The ACCI made it clear that consecutive government reviews have accentuated the anticompetitive ramifications of the current tax system on Australia's small businesses. It stated that one of the key strategies to shoring up business confidence was for the three levels of government to reach agreement on a process to overhaul revenue raising systems. It would seem that business is going to have to continue to wait for the government to bite the bullet. The question is: how long can business afford to wait, given that the economy continues to remain somewhat flat and bankruptcies in the small business sector are at an all-time high? Not much longer, I would suggest. It is worth noting that the TLIP senior management team includes two positions for private sector practitioners. One of these positions has been vacant for approximately 15 months. The whole point of having these two positions is to ensure that TLIP considers as wide a range of perspectives as possible when considering the simplification of our tax legislation. The positions exist to ensure that the business community has an opportunity to contribute to this essential process. The JCPA report recommended that the government fill this position 'as a matter of urgency.' I also understand that the TLIP team has written to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) requesting that this second private sector position be filled immediately. To date the government seems to have ignored that request. So much fur the coalition's commitment to the private sector; so much for the government's promise to consult widely in an effort to stay in touch with industry's needs. While some groups, including the AICD Taxation and Economics Committee, have called for 'sweeping reform' to the Australian tax system, others have supported a more cautious approach. For example, Mr Robert Fitzgerald, the President of ACOSS, has said that Australia is in need of 'genuine and progressive tax reform.' Tax experts have variously dubbed the income tax act as a super nova-a star bloated and about to implode--or as a gothic mansion to which new additions are constantly made without consideration as to whether the foundations can support them. Whatever the language used, the message is plain and simple: this parliament cannot back away from its responsibility to implement an efficient, simpland equitable tax system. I conclude by quoting an editorial from the Australian of 4 September 1996 which sums up very succinctly the road ahead for tax reform in this country. It states: ... it is also inescapably true that the contorted and unresponsive nature of the current system is the product of a half century of tinkering ... A suitably independent inquiry, with broad, sensible terms of reference and adequate time to consult and consider ... might well be the best remaining opportunity for an Australian government to achieve an honestly negotiated, worthwhile and electorally acceptable tax reform package. Improvement Project Bill, I say that there is a fairly hackneyed phrase that there is nothing more certain in life than death and taxes. What should be tacked onto that phrase is that nothing has been more certain in recent years than continuous additions to the Income Tax Assessment Act. The phrases that have been used expansively and colourfully over a number of years are certainly very appropriate.

But always lurking in any initiative of that kind are the opportunistic in the community, particularly on the other side of politics, but it is not necessarily confined to the other side either if a situation arises. However, in recent times the opportunistic approach has been confined exclusively to the other side. The Leader of the Opposition exemplified that during the Western Australian election campaign when he suggested, in a somewhat contorted fashion, that the Western Australian government was trying to implement some sort of GST. Yet again, the initiatives that need to be taken are constantly being mired by opportunistic politicians, particularly in the opposition. The comments by the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Rocher) about treating the symptoms rather than effecting a cure are very appropriate. The failure of fundamental reform has spawned the burgeoning act. The burgeoning act did not come about because of technical problems; it came about because of the underlying problems. In fact, the feet on the act have never really been properly addressed. It is the top-heavy nature of the act that is constantly being played with: it is rickety, it is rumbling and it is falling. Consequently, although this piece of legislation does go some way in the right direction to try and redress some of the problems, the underlying problems are the ones that ultimately must be addressed because they form the base upon which the act is erected. The comments by the honourable member for Curtin are relevant to consider in relation to the need for professional assistance and I will do that shortly. Not only is there the need for professional accountancy assistance to about 70 per cent of the population but frequently taxpayers have to seek counsel's advice, in addition to their accountant's advice, because the accountants cannot provide the sort of advice necessary in some areas because of the complexity of the act. So that tacks on an additional cost. The act, as has been said in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech, is on the verge of collapsing under the weight of constant piecemeal amendment. It is true that the rewrite will make the act more user-friendly, more understandable, hopefully shorter, clearer and less burdensome. The amendments include the rewrite of assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. Other rules included in the bill are entertainment expenses, primary production deductions, the recoupment of deductible expenses and the sale of leased cars. There are about 30 minor policy changes. I need not go through those in whole other than to mention references made to replacing impractical rules with ones which facilitate taxpayer compliance, the simplification of rules, deleting of unnecessary rules, the removal of anomalies and clarifying of ambiguities. The valuation methods for livestock will bring them in line with those for other kinds of trading stock. The change will have a revenue cost of up to $10 million in most years, and over $25 million in the occasional year where there is a large fall in stock prices. The proposed change in the use of trading stock taken for personal use will result in a gain to the revenue of about $30 million in 1998-99 and $25 million in each subsequent year. When I was studying taxation law in 1980 I can remember carrying around a CCH version of the act but I needed a reasonably strong wrist to do so, and the paper was not much thicker than rice paper at that time. Having observed a very strong table on which my accountant's Income Tax Assessment Act sits, and being reminded that he needs to take weight lifting 2668 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 lessons to carry it around, one can see and feel the enormity of the problem. I would hate to be a law student trying to wield that act between lecture theatres. I am told by a law student thdt in 1994 at the QUT the sections of the act that the students used-it was just too heavy to carry around-were about the same size of the act that I was using. That was not the complete act-the relevant sections that they were focusing on in their studies were a microcosm of the act itself. If only those sections were relevant to a law course, it makes me ask the question as to what use the other sections were to the public, but that is probably another manifestation of the great debate about the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is interesting that the complexity of the act is causing more and more members of the public with taxation problems which, on the face of it, are relatively easy, to resort to the assistance of an accountant. Yet again you can see an anachronism in that sort of approach. People have to go to their accountant, they are in effect taxed again-they have to pay a fee to do that, so that is a form of tax out of their money-and then they get a deduction for doing so. So the revenue is depleted by that very complexity. Then you see the seeds of the problem. Why are we not looking at a situation where the tax rate is dropped and there are no deductions? Would that not make it easier for everybody? We would probably drop half the act in the process and we would drop the necessity for all of this resort to advice and professional assistance. Maybe it is too simple, but it seems an obvious way of addressing the problem: take out the deductions and drop the tax. In the process, we would eliminate much heartache and anguish, the problems that go with that, the resentment that is felt by the community and the resorting to tax avoidance. Sure, we are always going to have people who will try to avoid tax. But when you are looking at compliance costs, when you are looking at the keeping of records and so forth, you realise that all of that impacts on the Australian community. All of that hurts small business. All of that, in my view, is grinding our economy in a negative direction when we should be looking at turning it in a positive direction. We need to do that by the simplification of our tax laws. I say again that this is a step in the right direction but we certainly need to go much further. I can recall the Tax Pack in the 1970s being a couple of pages. Look at it now. The Tax Pack is now an enormously complex document in itself, for some people. Admittedly It is a question of time for many people, but I would not fancy having to go through the Tax Pack to see precisely where I, as a taxpayer, am at with it. When one looks at the reasons for the complexity, one could spend a long time in this debate. Let us, however, look at the methodology in calculating depreciation, as just one example. We are, in effect, so concerned with deductions that we are losing sight of what the act should be doing. It is there to make a simple, just, fair and equitable collection for income tax, and to provide a system that will assist the community in developing an economy that is generating income, employment, adventurism in decision making and an entrepreneurial spirit, not stifling it-not providing the plethora of rules and regulations and exceptions that stifle the movement in the economy that is needed to get the country going. While again I emphasise my support for the proposal in principle, as one that will get us one step along the way, I shiver at the thought that it is one step in a 25-year process, as the member for Curtin mentioned. I do think that, with the enormous support in the community, right through from practising accountants to ACOSS itself, the messages are there. They can no longer be ignored; we can no longer fudge the issue. We have to tackle tax reform. We Thursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2669 have to have bipartisan support. That is why the initiatives of the member for O'Connor are to be commended. In essence, I support these measures. I hope that contributions that have been made to this debate will be looked at by those who should finally convince themselves that the messages are loud and clear and it is time to start a full and thorough reform of the system. is one of the bread-and-butter, non-controversial, machinery of government type bills, which this parliament is properly occupied with. I note that the first instalment, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, was passed through the Senate earlier in the week without opposition. I rise to support the bill. It is a common sense reform. It reflects government's continuing obligation to make its legislation easier to understand, and easier to enforce and comply with. It is the result, in part, of a response from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts led by my colleague, the member for Fairfax( Mr Somlyay). He has got that particular cast of mind which is rich in common sense and practical insight. Pretty much whatever goes through his jurisdiction or purview, such as the recent amendments to the Auditor-General Bill, reflects his capacity to recognise the anomaly and introduce common sense where previously it had not existed. The practical amendments to this bill, we should acknowledge, did not originate on this side of the House but originated under the previous government in its tax law improvement project in July 1994, with the goals of restructuring, re-numbering and rewriting in plain language the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. As previous speakers have mentioned, it is a herculean task. Before we came to government, that particular act expanded in size in those 13 years from 1,328 pages, which we thought was already a pretty enormous act, to 3,792 pages. The word around town is that tax accountants now measure the act not by the page numbers but by the kilogram. All of us today have got up and basically applauded the work of the bill in relation to assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. It is a helpful change. It communicates to small business and others that the government is working to reduce the compliance burden which they face. The member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) raised the question of the number of amendments being proposed. The advice to me from the minister is that the large number of amendments proposed reflects the procedural requirement for each textual change to be dealt with separately. For example, the minister says that 23 amendments are needed to implement the single JCPA recommendation to omit the provisions allowing hire purchasers to depreciate plant. The fact that 23 amendments are required to introduce one change reflects the deeper underlying issue that we have touched on this morning. The member for Curtin( Mr Rocher) appealed for the terms of reference for this exercise to be extended into the realms of substantive policy. We accept that, to date, it has been essentially policy neutral and essentially revenue neutral. The member called upon the parliament and the government to expand the terms of reference and get into the real areas of difficulty in the tax act, which I think most of us would accept. The great difficulty we have here is trying to make simple what is an inherently complex set of concepts. It is not surprising that the complexity of the underlying concepts revolves",134,Representatives Main Commitiee
206,Mr Ross Cameron (Parramatta) (11.40 A.m.),"The Tax Law Improvement Bill 19962670 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 around the fact that our system of taxation is weighted so heavily in favour of the taxation of income. And income is a complex beast which is difficult to wrestle to the ground. If we look, for example, at the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force-they made 60 recommendations which are currently before the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) and we expect a response from his office perhaps next week-the first 11 of those 60 were all tax related, in terms of how the government can reduce the impact of compliance on small business. That reflects the sense of urgency which the small business community, in particular, feels about these issues. All the studies which have come back from small business say essentially the same thing: they do not resent having to pay tax but they resent the volume of regulation and legislation governing tax. They resent the complexity of the rule structure of tax and the frequency of changes to that rule structure. Those three messages consistently come back from the small business community. It is true that the complexity of the current regime impacts in a kind of discriminating way against small business, because these are the businesses which have not reached that critical mass where they can appoint someone as a full-time compliance accountant. Larger businesses have that luxury. All the time spent in complying with the government's tax requirements is time that cannot be spent in marketing, selling product, building relationships, networking, R&D and all of those other productive areas of the economy. We then get back to this question: should we then be making a much bolder, broader sweeping response to the problem? Let me put it on the record that I, like every other member who has stood, support this bill as far as it goes. I believe that it is an appropriate reference that has been undertaken by the tax law improvement project, but the bill inevitably raises this broader question of whether we ought to be approaching this in a more robust way. There are moments in history when we sense that there was a critical decision that had to be taken by a nation and a community, and the decision taken will have a very long-standing impact on the quality of life of a very large number of citizens. As I look back over this century, the Treaty of Versailles at the conclusion of the First World War is one about which I feel a great sense of sadness. I think that there was a situation where we had started the century off on a bad foot, if you like. We had had a civil war in Europe with millions killed, and then the statesmen, the elders of the nations, came together to hammer out the peace. It was one of the few occasions in his life when I would agree with John Maynard Keynes. He was arguing for a much more gracious peace, if you like, and for a rebuilding of the German economy. But the leaders of the victorious states did not have that broad-mindedness, that grace, that sense of statesmanship and they imposed a peace which most of us in retrospect would say was unjust. Their lack of leadership at that moment, in my view, was one of the principal causes of the subsequent conflict in the Second World War. It sowed the seeds of resentment and the rest of this century, in effect, has been very much a result of that. Like the pebble in the pond, the waves have continued to flow out, largely due to the failure of leadership at that moment. When I look at our own country's history over the past 50 years or so, I feel a sense of sorrow at the McEwanist high tariff policies in the 1950s and 1960s; at our failure to really latch onto and develop the technology when the CSIRO developed the first computer, and the sense that we drifted along as a primary producer without really value adding or really getting onto the front end of the technology wave. But I also feel a great sense of sadness for that Thursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2671 moment in history when we had a key decision to make and we failed. I feel a sense of sadness about the 1993 election when John Hewson went to the Australian people with this incredibly ambitious but completely transparent package for national reform. It was a critical issue which everyone in the room would accept had to be one of our top national priorities. If you pick the top three priorities, you would probably say something like: employment, health finance and tax reform. There may be a different order around the room, but tax reform has to be in the top two or three challenges we face as a nation. And there we had this moment in timeA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.50 a.m. to 12.03 p.m. at which we define ourselves. To me, the 1993 election was one of those moments. So often people are cynical about politicians and believe that we are motivated by base motives, that we are unwilling to take the long-term view, that we are not concerned about matters of principle. Here we had an Australian politician who said, 'I am not cynical about the electorate. I am going to put a very high level of trust and faith in the electorate. I am going to go to the Australian people with this comprehensive package of reform. I am going to give them that package a year out from the election and I am going to let them go over it with a fine toothcomb. I am going to totally expose myself to public scrutiny. I am not going to pull something out of the bag when we get into government; I am going to have faith and confidence in the good judgment and good sense of the Australian people.' I get a little bit irritated when I hear all the murmurings and rumblings about introducing a GST and how we have no stomach for it. When we went to the Australian people and offered them that deal, they did not have the stomach for it. I have a certain impatience with all of those accountants and experts and people who are now coming out and calling for this reform. They watched us get mowed down when we came out of the trenches carrying the GST, and they sat silently back in their comfortable bunkers and said, 'We will derive the benefits of this reform once it goes through, but we will not share any of the risks.' Even in the business community they were coming out and saying, 'No, we do not want it. It is too hard and too complex. We do not want to have to collect it.' And then you had Keating-the absolute duplicity of the man-who, having fought tooth and nail in cabinet for this fundamental change and having lost, in a completely cynical electoral exercise turned that election into a referendum on the GST, knowing that in all of Australia's history since Federation we had never passed a referendum except with bipartisan support. Clearly, we are in the same position today. So there was that moment in time when we had this great opportunity as a culture for decision, and we failed. Now we are locked in; we are all standing up and giving obeisance to this good piece of essentially technical housekeeping legislation when, in our heart of hearts, we all know there is a job to be done but we do not have the national will to do it. SoI challenge groups like the Taxpayers Association of Australia, the accountants and the whole industry out there who are calling for reform. I say, 'Why don't you go out and recruit the Australian people to that concept and get their commitment and come back to the parliament?' N ationalleadership in a parliament such as this is not just about initiating things and leading the people; it is also about responding to them and reflecting their views. When we have gone to the Australian people, only four years ago, with this exact proposal and been very clearly",137,Representatives Main Committee
207,Mr Ross Cameron,"Before the division, I was talking about those moments in history2672 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 rejected, some could equally argue it would be presumptuous of any prime minister to relaunch that phoenix out of the ashes. I want to see the signing on the dotted line of those companies, corporations and small businesses who are all wandering around murmuring and saying, 'Why don't we do something about it?' We went to the Australian people and they knocked us back because they did not have the stomach for it. It is like the second airport: everyone is in favour of the second airport until they actually see that the flight path goes over their house; then, of course, they are implacably opposed to it. We have these moments of decision when reform is painful. I am not necessarily saying a consumption tax is the panacea. But we have to move away from this incredible reliance on income as the basis of Commonwealth revenue. A GST is not the be-all and end-all. But it is a movement away from this preoccupation with income that actually stimulates savings and investment, encourages compliance because it is simple, is equitable because everybody pays it, and does not encourage a whole industry of tax evasion. That is what we need as a nation. It has got to be one of our top priorities. I am appealing to the business community and the Australian people to, if they want it, let us see the colour of the money; let us see them come out en masse. Ross Perot, before he ran for the presidency of the United States, said to his constituency, 'I'm not going to run until you can get 500,000 signatures saying you want me to run.' In a sense, it was smart politics-half the battle was won before he began. SoI am saying to the Australian people: if you want a consumption tax, if you want fundamental reform of tax, I urge you to lobby the Australian Labor Party to a point where we know we can move forward with a bipartisan commitment, in the same way that we have had for this bill, for which I applaud the opposition. It was originally their bill. If we are talking about real national leadership in tQis place, nothing would restore the integrity and stature of this parliament in the eyes of the Australian people more than a bipartisan commitment to fundamental tax reform. SoI call on the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) and the Australian people to rally together and demand it of us. Thank you. on the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996, but it is important to make a few comments. I certainly concur with a lot of what the previous speaker, the member for Parramatta ( Mr Ross Cameron), has said. This bill had its genesis way back in 1992-93 when the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the 36th Parliament and, subsequently, the 37th Parliament put together a report on the inquiry that it held. It was report No. 326, called An assessment of tax. A lot of people will recall some of the public hearings and the evidence that was received by the JCPA in putting that report together. I was fortunate enough to have been on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts at the tail end of that inquiry, in the 37th Parliament, and I also participated in the drafting of the recommendations. Among the recommendations with regard to the legislative framework that came out of that report No. 326, recommendation 22 said: The committee recommends the government establish a broadly based task force to redraft the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Recommendation 23 was: That the committee recommends that the government commits sufficient resources to the task force as will allow it to complete a priority simplification redraft within two years and the full simplification of 'the act within five years.",139,Representatives Main Committee
208,Mr Vaile (Lyne) (12.08 P.m.),"I will not take up a lot of the time of the Main CommitteeThursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2673 It should be noted that there was also a minority report, as part of report 326, and what I feel was a fairly important recommendation came out of the minority report with regard to rulings. That minority report, in recommendation 3, said: That the relevant Commonwealth Tax Acts be amended to provide that generalthat is public rulingsbe issued as regulations under the taxation laws and subject to tabling and disallowance in the parliament. As everybody would know, that recommendation in the minority report was not picked up, but it certainly is an area that way back then was of concern and, from my understanding of the private sector, at this stage is still of major concern. The existence of the ruling system and how it is applied and enforced is one of the areas of concern to the private sector and private practitioners. Obviously, the other area relates to the perception, following report 326, that the rewrite of the tax act would be addressing policy issues as well as the simplification of what is a very, very complicated bill. To a large extent that has not happened. The TLIP process started under the former government in the 37th Parliament and it has continued under the current government in the 38th Parliament. It was interesting to note the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister( Mr Miles), in which he said: The first instalment of the new law, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, was passed by the House with bipartisan support and is presently waiting consideration by the Senate. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts reviewed that bill in detail, concluding that the bill was a significant improvement over the current law being widely regarded as far easier to read and understand. That is quite correct, but it certainly did not address any issues of policy. I know that this is one issue that has been raised in the debate so far on this bill. In the second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary went on to say: The rewritten rules include 30 minor policy changes which will make the law simpler, clearer and less burdensome for taxpayers. They will do this by: · replacing impractical rules with ones which facilitate taxpayer compliance: · simplifying rules which are unnecessarily complex; · deleting unnecessary rules; · removing anomalies; and · clarifying ambiguities. I believe the crux of what the previous speaker was talking about was addressing policy issues in taxation, trying to drag the Income Tax Assessment Act at least into the 1990s and push it forward so that it is a forward looking piece of legislation to take into the next century. Unfortunately, at this stage in this process, that is not entirely happening. In fact, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its report 348 on this bill, stated in recommendation 2: Government should expand the mandate of the Tax Law Improvement Project to allow it to consider a wider range of tax policy simplification issues than the mandate currently allows. Such a mandate should be applied to TLIP for all future tranches of rewritten legislation. And that is the most recent report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the whole TLIP process that has been taking place over the last couple of years. I support the process. I support the bill that is before the House. I believe that we should be going a little further, flexing the margins out a little further and having a look at addressing some of those policy areas. 2674 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 As an aside to that, quite apart from this process I note that the Australian Tax Office is having a look at some policy changes and flexing the margins in another area, which is also partly covered by this bill. In division 70, I think it is, the bill deals with trading stock and there are a few references in the EM and descriptions of natural increase of livestock as trading stock and how the Australian Tax Office will deal with those. Just recently I had the opportunity of spending the day with a number of oyster farmers on the Hawkesbury River, and some of them were from Wallis Lake. The Wallis Lake farmers currently have an additional disadvantage which can be added to those that they are already burdened with emanating from the state government of New South Wales. Anyhow, I spent the day on the Hawkesbury River with a group of oyster farmers from there and from Wallis Lake and also with two officers from the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Taxation Office at the moment has a discussion paper out on how it can draw into the tax system a declaration of trading stock by oyster farmers. That is going to be an extremely difficult thing. I am just using this is an example. I am not criticising the ATO, but I am saying that the ATO is able to push things out at the margins in this regard yet the mandate given in the rewriting and the simplification of the tax act in the TLIP process has been fairly clearly defined. Going back to the discussion paper and the assessment of how the ATO wants to deal with oyster farmers, it is a very difficult industry to operate in. It is very sensitive to climate changes-more so than a lot of other primary production-and it is going to be very difficult for the ATO to identify a point at which oysters actually become trading stock. The oysters are caught in the wild. It is the same as asking a deep-sea professional fisherman, 'How are you going to assess your trading stock?' I spent the day with the oyster farmers. We looked at the different processes of oyster farming from actually catching spats that are free and wild in the rivers, to putting them onto sticks, to growing them out, and how they take them from there to fattening paddocks. The most salient point that was made by the oyster farmers-and I take this opportunity to put it on the record-was that only last year they lost millions of dollars worth of stock in a matter of one hour in one day. They had a lot of their oysters on beds in what they call fattening paddocks. It was extremely hot weather in the middle of summer. There was a low tide at the wrong time of the day and those oysters were exposed to extreme heat for an hour too long. As a result, the industry lost millions of dollars worth of oysters. They are exposed to those sorts of things and now they are being faced with the dilemma of how they are going to deal with what may be imposed as far as the Australian Taxation Office is concerned in a declaration of open trading stock. At what point in the process of catching a wild animal on stakes-and the vagaries of that-going through to the process to fattening and marketing an oyster should they be declaring the level and value of their trading stock? The point is that in this bill it is fairly clear and it makes it easy to enunciate the natural increase of livestock as trading stock, their value and how to go about it. It is all prescribed in here, but it is going to be a far more difficult exercise with the different operators in the oyster industry in Australia. I just flag to the officers from the ATO who are here today that it is an issue that those of us who represent areas with a major oyster farming industry are going to take a great deal of interest in. It is of concern to us. Thursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2675 To their credit, the oyster farmers accepted the offer from the ATO to look at how they operate their businesses and to discuss some of the issues that revolve around the businesses. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know about that because you also have an oyster industry of sorts in Tasmania. It is not Sydney rock oysters but it is an oyster industry of sorts. It is .an important element and it has wider ramifications in so far as how people who are heading off into different ventures in agriculture are treated in the system. Every reasonable, thinking person in Australia expects that if you make a profit, you pay tax. That is our contribution to running this country. It is another question as to whether you agree how different governments from time to time spend that money, but any reasonable person will expect to pay tax. I concur with the previous speaker with regard to the development of a tax minimisation industry in Australia. However, the reason it exists is because the tax law is so complicated. The average layman just cannot understand the majority of the tax act. That is why the industry has grown to the extent that it has. There should be no reason why it should not be a very simple process. I also believe that, as we move towards the tum of the century, there is going to be an increasing demand from different sections of the community-not just from industry, the taxation industry, big business and small business, but from individuals, the PA YE taxpayers-for an overhaul of the tax system in this country. Sadly, it is going to get to the stage where that becomes a very loud cry before it is addressed. I say that because, sadly, on a couple of occasions-{)ne very public and one probably internal in government in this country-there was an opportunity presented in 1993 and previous to that in the mid-1980s, to have a full and reasonable review of the tax system but on both occasions that was rejected because of a perception of it being too difficult. At some stage in the future, the general taxpaying public will demand that that take place. As I say, sadly we will have to wait till then before there will be a response. I support the bill. I would like to see greater focus given to the possibility of policy changes. In a legislative manner, we seem to be bonnd to just rewriting and simplifying the tax act through what we are doing in TLIP. But the ATO still has the capability to look at those other areas of tax collection, as I highlighted with regard to the oyster industry. It is a dynamic system that we run. Let us be open-minded and look at the possibilities of looking at that issue in future projects. As has been set out in a recommendation in report 348 from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, let us have a look at addressing some policy issues in the future. of the minister, I say thank you to all the speakers who participated in this debate. It is always interesting to hear people representing their electorates very well. Indeed, as my colleague spoke about the oyster industry, he highlighted some of the difficulties of having a very fair tax system in this nation. I could not help but remember that I like oysters; let us not kill off an oyster industry in Australia. SoI thank those from both sides of the House who have contributed to this debate. The government believes that the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 will be of significant benefit to the entire Australian community. The bill is the second instalment of legislation to replace progressively the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936.

It is a major step forward in the progress of giving the taxation laws of this country back to the community in understandable language. I would particularly like to acknowledge the extremely valuable work of the JCPA in its watching brief on the project, and especially of its chairman, the member for Fairfax, Mr Somlyay. The 1936 act was in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. It is long and almost impossible to understand for anyone but tax specialists-sometimes I doubt if they were really clear on what it might have meant. Even then, it takes years of specialisation before a professional can offer confident advice. This bill will be of major benefit to the community and, together with the earlier bill, it makes an enormous improvement on existing law. The tax law improvement project has restructured, renumbered and rewritten the law so that it is easily understandable and can be followed completely. Because the law can be more easily understood, compliance with it will improve and, very importantly, business costs of complying with it will also reduce. People will be able, for the first time in decades, to have a sense of confidence that they understand their rights and obligations and what actions they are required to take. There have been suggestions about the lack of readiness among the professions and the community for the 1 July 1997 start-up date for the bill. The government believes that the community and the professions are now, or are at least becoming, well prepared for the start-up date of 1 July this year. I am aware that the commercial publishers are ready to go with material, including detailed commentaries on electronic databases, which will support the tax profession and the community. I am also aware that the rewritten law in this, and the earlier bills, is already being taught in many of the tax courses in our universities and other tertiary institutions. So the process is certainly well on the way: that extension of knowledge and understanding of this bill. Text books have been, or are being, written or updated to take account of those changes. The Australian Taxation Office is developing training material to support the implementation of the law. This material will be made publicly available in good time. The extensive public consultation has meant that this bill has been exhaustively examined in order to identify any possible detriment to taxpayers. It has stood up to this extensive scrutiny very well. This is testimony to the high professional standards maintained by the tax law improvement personnel. I commend the bill to the House.

The amendments that have been circulated on behalf of the government fall into three categories. The first block of amendments removes from the bill rules which for the first time would have provided an express treatment for the transfer of assets into, or from, trading stock. The government has decided to postpone this change because there is no consensus on the technical expression needed to implement the proposal. The government will continue to consult towards an agreed formulation with a view to early restoration of provisions to deal with the issue. The second group of amendments adopts a recommendation of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, in its advisory report No. 348, by removing references to hire purchasers of plant as being entitled to deduct depreciation. The third group will make miscellaneous amendments of a minor technical kind. The government is accepting all of the changes to the bill proposed by the joint committee except, for the time being, the recommendations about assets converted to or from trading stock. The government has also made changes to the explanatory memorandum along the lines recommended by the joint committee. The government is fully aware of concerns about private sector involvement and we will be taking action on this issue very shortly. The government is giving sympathetic consideration to other recommendations in report No. 348 that go to wider policy matters, and responses on these matters will be provided later. Amendments 23, 39, 53, 55, 57 to 59,61 and 63 to 69 relate to the changes in use of trading stock. The amendments will remove the proposed rules about converting trading stock into private or capital assets and converting private or capital assets into trading stock. The bill Thursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2681 had sought to include express rules to deal with these events; however, there has been ongoing debate about the drafting of these rules. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts made recommendations on those issues, but some business groups still have concerns. Accordingly, the government has decided not to proceed at this time with these measures in the bill but rather to further pursue broad agreement with professional bodies. Amendments 18 to 20, 33, 35, 36,40 to 45, 47 to 50, 70 and 76 to 82 relate to depreciation by hire purchasers. These amendments will remove references to hire purchase in the depreciation provisions. The bill had sought to provide legislative backing for the long standing practice of allowing persons who hold property under a hire purchase agreement to depreciate it. However, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts thought it inappropriate for the bill to deal with hire purchase in isolation from other kinds of broadly similar finance arrangements. The government accepts that recommendation. Hirers under hire purchase agreements will continue to attract depreciation deductions under the long-established administrative arrangements. Amendments 1 to 17, 21, 22, 24 to 32, 34, 37, 38,46,51,52,54,56,60,62, 71 to 75 and 83 relate to miscellaneous changes. This third group of amendments will make a number of minor technical changes to the bill. These changes do not reflect any change in policy and are mainly to make drafting improvements and correct omissions, to better ensure that the new law accurately reflects the existing law. Each of the amendments is explained in more detail in the supplementary explanatory memorandum which I now present. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill-by leave-reported to the House with amendments. Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 March, on motion by Mr Prosser: That the bill be now read a second time. amends the Excise Tariff Act to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content. It is a bill which the opposition supports. It closes a loophole that was created by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruling that, for example, Carlton United's Sub Zero alcoholic soda, which has an alcohol content of about 5Y2 per cent, could not be described as 'spirituous' and therefore was not excisable as a spirituous beverage. This is bad news for drinkers of Sub Zero,. but the closure is about protecting the revenue base and applying some consistency to the description of alcoholic beverages. It also applies to a range of other packaged mixed drinks, so it is not just the trendies with the Sub Zero who will be affected, but people who are into mixed spirit drinks, such as the United Distiller brands of rum and cola, gin and tonics and all those sorts of things. I think all of those people who have tried these recognise they contain spirits, especially if they have a lot of them. If sold separately, those spirits would be excisable, but the AAT ruled that the mix, to use their terminology, contained less alcohol than the community definition of spirit.",144,Representatives Main Committee
214,Mr Crean (Hotham) 02.34 P.m.),"The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.1) 19972682 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 At least 37 per cent alcohol by volume is the community definition. It was therefore not subject to excise. The mechanism which has been used to close the loophole is to redefine the rate of duty in the schedule of the act from an amount per litre of alcohol to an amount per litre of distilled alcohol. There are further applications for similar rulings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the Commonwealth has lodged an appeal in the Federal Court against the CUB Sub Zero ruling. None of these is yet concluded. The legislation acts retrospectively from 3 February to effectively quash all claims currently before either the AAT or the Federal Court. All disputed excise has been paid into a deposit account of the Commonwealth so there is no repayment or back payment of disputed excise duty to the Commonwealth. The financial impact of this bill is that it reduces revenue by $290,000 for an, at this stage, still unexplained change to the excise on brandy based beverages, presumably to bring them into line with other spirituous beverages. Further clarification is being sought from the minister but a response has not been received. I would simply ask in this debate that we get that clarification. It is an important one, because it involves reduction in revenue. But other than that, the bill avoids a contingent liability of $12.6 million from the AAT and the Federal Court actions. The opposition supports the bill. Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 and I note that the shadow minister, the member for Hotham( Mr Crean) has indicated that the opposition will be supporting the amendments to the bill. The purpose of the bill is to amend the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcoholic content. The important thing here is that this is a bit of housekeeping legislation and the intention is quite simply to close off a loophole. The financial impact of this bill is virtually zero; there is no financial impact. The amendments proposed in the act only clarify the law as outlined and involve no change to the excise treatment of beverages containing distilled alcohol. As I said earlier, it will have no financial impact. However, conversely it could mean that, unless there is retrospective amendment to the act, the government will have a contingent liability of some $12.6 million. When I first saw the bill, there was a degree of retrospectivity about it. As someone who strongly voices concerns when the word 'retrospectivity' comes into play, I must say that was a warning signal for me to have a look in more detail as to what it really means with respect to retrospectivity. I believe in this instance that the amendments are justifiable on the grounds that they are backdated to 3 February 1996 because this will remove the technical loophole in the tariff act which was uncovered by the decision of the court to make the request by the company seeking the removal of the tariff acceptable. There is no reason to doubt that the court has acted in the best interests of the parliament in bringing down the decision that it has. This will not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages as the excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers under deposit. This will protect the government under any claims for recovery of this duty. As I said earlier on, the bill is more in the nature of a housekeeping bill, and I strongly support the amendments.",149,Representatives Main Committee
215,Mr Zammit (Lowe) (12.37 P.m.),"I am pleased to join this debate on the Excise TariffThursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2683 I thank the members who have spoken to this bill. As my colleague the honourable member for Lowe( Mr Zammit) mentioned, the amendments that we are proposing here have been made necessary because of a challenge brought on by Carlton and United Breweries with regard to the product known as Sub Zero. But I would like to reiterate for the record-I did note that my colleague, the honourable member for Lowe, mentioned this-that the purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1921 to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content. It was the alcohol content that was the problem with regard to the Sub Zero case. This is really to make what we are aiming to do in legislation crystal clear. Under item 2 of the schedule of the Tariff Act, spirituous beverages are subject to duties of excise which are calculated at a dollar amount per litre of alcohol in each of the beverages. In November 1994, Carlton and United Breweries, CUB, commenced the manufacture of a product known as Sub Zero alcoholic soda which had an alcoholic content of approximately 5.5 per cent. The Australian Customs Service considered SubZ ero an excisable product. Carlton and United Breweries appealed against the decision of the Australian Customs Service to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the AAT determined that the product Sub Zero, with such a low alcoholic content by volume, could not be described as spirituous and was therefore not excisable. The Australian Customs Service is appealing against that decision in the Federal Court. Since the AAT decision, Carlton and United Breweries has ceased the manufacture of Sub Zero using alcohol derived by distillation. However, there are several other manufacturers of beverages of low alcohol content, and the Customs Service has continued to impose excise duty on these beverages. In order to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, I have brought this bill forward to amend the act. The combination of these amendments will remove any connotation as to the strength that an alcoholic beverage must be before it is excisable. It is proposed that the amendments will take effect on and from 3 February 1996. The effect of the retrospective commencement date of the amendments will be to extinguish all rights of appeal to the AAT in relation to the excisability of low alcohol beverages and all rights to refunds of excise duty in respect of such beverages. The commencement date of the amendments on 3 February 1996 would not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages. The excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers under deposit, and the 3 February 1996 commencement date will protect the government against all claims for recovery of this duty. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 November 1996, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time.",150,Representatives Main Committee
216,Mr Prosser (Forrest,"Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (12.42 p.m.)2684 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 March 1997 The International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996 provides mechanisms through which Australians imprisoned abroad may be returned to Australia to serve out their sentences. The bill also provides for foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia to be returned to their home countries, also to complete their sentences. The bill makes this provision both in relation to prisoners convicted of war crimes and also prisoners convicted of general offences. In the case of prisoners convicted of war crimes, the bill complements Australia's commitment to prosecuting international war criminals. Australia has vigorously assisted the international efforts in this regard through our participation pursuant to the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1995 in the tribunals established to deal with war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda. That legislation was moved by the former Labor government and received bipartisan support. Some concerns were expressed at the hearings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into this bill. The concerns were that the bill might undermine the effort to fight serious crime, particularly drug related crime. These arguments seem to rest on the erroneous assumptions that the transfer of these prisoners will result in prisoners receiving less severe sentences. This is clearly not the effect of the bill. Whilst it is true that in being closer to home, family and friends prisoners are more likely to be held in more culturally sensitive conditions, these conditions are hardly likely to promote criminal activity. It would be a rather strange individual who decided that they were prepared to commit a serious criminal offence where previously they were not, simply because they knew that pursuant to this bill they might ultimately be returned home. Rather, this bill recognises that despite the serious wrongdoing these prisoners have committed, wrongdoings that are deserving of the gravest censure and punishment, those prisoners have rights to humanitarian treatment. It also recognises that the best way to rehabilitate these prisoners is to return them to culturally appropriate and supportive environments, and as far as the general community is concerned surely this is one of the prime considerations we should be concerned about to minimise the prospect that criminals will offend again and that other innocent people will suffer from their actions. Punishment is an important part of the criminal process; however, punishment that increases the prospect of recidivism is not in the interests of society nor the prisoner concerned. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs provided an advisory report to the parliament on this bill and I think it is worthwhile reading onto the record page 5 of that report. I think that summarises the consideration in favour of international transfer of prisoners and really encapsulates my view of the situation. It says at paragraph 1.15: The principal argument in favour of the international transfer of prisoners is humanitarian. The deprivation of liberty can be more harsh for prisoners imprisoned in foreign countries because of absence of contact with, and support from, relatives and friends, language barriers, differences in diet and health care, alienation from local culture, intolerance of religious practices, ineffective vocational training and general prejudice against foreigners. A prisoner can be adversely affecterl both psychologically and physically, and his or her rehabilitation might be impaired. The international transfer of prisoners is said to enhance the prospects of rehabilitation of prisoners and their re-integration into the community, as rehabilitation is thought to depend on the prisoner having the benefit of family or community support. This support is more likely where prisoners are in the same country as their families.",151,Representatives Main Committee
217,Mr Melham (Banks) (12.46 P.m.),"I propose to speak only briefly in relation to this bill.Thursday, 20 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2685 Those paragraphs out of the report encapsulate my view of the matter perfectly, and that is one of the reasons why we on this side of the House support this bill. The bill also facilitates greater cooperation between Australia and foreign law enforcement and custodial agencies. This increased confidence and support of international law enforcement and custodial agencies will ultimately increase our combined ability to tackle the ever growing rate of international crime. This will help ensure that more criminals are brought to justice and help make the world, including Australia, a safer place. The aspects of this bill relating to the transfer of prisoners convicted of non-war crimes related offences will ultimately rely for their success on the cooperation of the states and territories. The state and territory attorneys-general have given in principle agreement to the operation of the legislation. I urge all attorneys concerned to conclude the final agreements with the necessary legislative support as soon as possible. Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I note that the government's proposed amendment to the bill clarifies the wording of clause 24 in accordance with recommendation seven of the unanimous advisory report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Australian Labor Party welcomes this amendment, just as we welcome this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Bailey) adjourned.
