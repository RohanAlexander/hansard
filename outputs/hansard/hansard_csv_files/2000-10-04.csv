The Treasurer should have moved on that there is very little monetary impact in this, but he was not willing to do so. regard to this and that people will not have The specific effect in regard to this is that much problem in terms of complying with it, of controlling interest. This bill clarifies what most people, apart from the aggressive tax ‘an eligible employee’ is. The key thing is minimisers and the schemes that they operthat previously a person who had a controlated, actually got the message previously that ling interest in a company could actually you should not really be in the game of ripclaim their superannuation contributions as ping off $1.5 billion or more out of the Ausdeductions and avoid fringe benefits tax on tralian revenue.

So a minimal financial impact and a minimal person who had a controlling interest in that revenue impact when we know that those company and who was a single individual in kinds of moneys have been extracted; or, that company could then effectively contract rather, there is an argument within the reguthemself to that company in order to do the lation-the ATO has said that in the media work.

Indeed, when the ATO The three superannuation problems adreappeared before the House of Representadressed are as follows. First, the bill adtives inquiry on 11 May, it seemed taken by dresses a key tax avoidance arrangement: the surprise that such schemes were still being so-called controlling interest superannuation marketed. In answer to a question about such arrangements where the employee benefiting marketing, the ATO officials responded: from the super and the employer getting a In terms of ‘aggressively marketed’ we do not deduction for making the contribution on seem to see the mass marketing of these arrangebehalf of the employee are, in reality, one ments, but I would be cautious in saying that and the same person; that is, the employee some categories or variants might not still be in has the controlling interest in the employing the marketplace. company.

The third problem addressed by schemes being marketed this year but there are this bill is the question of superannuation not other types of schemes. being excluded from fringe benefits tax unFollowing the receipt of that evidence I was less the superannuation contribution is made able to produce a copy of a scheme which for an employee. was still being aggressively marketed and, Apart from the severe limitation of adfollowing a question from me about the dressing only one area-namely, the superrevenue at risk and whether or not it could annuation area of the tax avoidance probescalate as a result of this and other schemes lem-this legislation is limited in the sense still being promoted, the ATO agreed that that it is only prospective; that it only catches the exchange between us had been ‘good those offending superannuation schemes enfeedback’. Clearly this evidence prompted tered into after the date of the Treasurer’s the government to respond, and it was announcement on 30 June this year, so it shortly after this hearing-indeed, late on 30 catches schemes from then on.

So finally the government billion being invested in shonky, sham tax has been shamed into some sort of action, avoidance arrangements. I intend now to but I think scepticism is justified when we spend some time on this point, because I assess just how far the Assistant Treasurer’s think it is important that this-the potential announcement and this bill will get us in adfor the prospect of a recovery of revenue dressing the huge tax avoidance problem lost-is clearly understood. uncovered during the inquiry. In my view, the answer is not very far at all. The government’s answer is that we do not have to worry-that the revenue lost will The first problem is that this bill only adbe recovered through litigation, and the dresses problems in the superannuation areas Treasurer put that view to this House on 6 and leaves entirely untouched the question of September in answer to a series of questions tax avoidance issues emerging in the emabout sham employee benefit schemes.

In relation to controlling with in this legislation, there is no pretence shareholder superannuation rorts, this bill is in the explanatory memorandum that this premised on the assumption that the current legislation is not really changing the current law is satisfactory and that this bill is no law-that is, there is no pretence that the more than a clarification.

For each the courts and they have the benefit of priof the three arrangements dealt with in this vate binding rulings, the taxpayer who is bill the financial impact is estimated to be party to that litigation will be able to rely on negligible.

After touch on rorts that form part of more than all, a private binding ruling is supposed to be $1.5 billion being hidden from taxation, why a determination for a named taxpayer about is it that correcting these rorts can only have his or her position by the ATO. Then there is a negligible financial impact? One is left to the position of those who entered into speculate that the government does not really schemes on the advice of advisers who had have any reliable accounting of the revenue received favourable private rulings in respect that has been lost to date and therefore is so of identical schemes or like schemes. Indeed, unable to estimate the revenue stream this it seems common practice in the aggressive bill should generate in plugging three looptax planning industry to obtain private bindholes that it has gone for the easy option of ing rulings on behalf of a limited number of saying ‘negligible financial impact’. test taxpayers and, if those rulings are faTurning now to litigation in relation to vourable, to then market identical or like matters not dealt with by this bill, that is, schemes to many other taxpayers.

Those three proving that the dominant purpose of these arguments-and I think it is important that schemes was to avoid tax rather than for anthey are understood-are, notwithstanding other purpose such as saving for retirement. the representation by Michael Carmody that the ATO is not bound by an unlawful private binding ruling, that a taxpayer who does incentives to retain key executives in the have a favourable private binding ruling in share scheme area or rather than incentives these areas-employee trust arrangements to retain key staff in the employee trust area. and employee share plans-will present to So all of those hurdles are well and truly in court and one would say very highly arguathe face of the Commonwealth in relation to bly suggest that they are entitled to rely on litigation, not only, as I have said, about that private binding ruling because they have controlling interest superannuation rorts but been given it by the ATO in respect of their also in relation to employee share scheme own tax position.

It being 8.00Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20805 Wednesday, 4 October 2000 ----Roads: Burdekin Bypass Project shadow transport minister to bring to the attention of the parliament and the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services local community views on the issue of the Burdekin bypass project. A local group was formed around this issue, the organisers of which contacted my office after they had become exasperated at a perceived reluctance on the part of their local member to raise this issue in the parliament. Representatives of the group rang the Table Office to establish the true options of bringing their views before the House. They even had to contact the National Party Whip to clarify the reasons or excuses given by their local member, the member for Dawson, as to why she could not present their views to the House. After a significant local organising effort, these citizens wanted the federal parliament and the transport minister-who will make the decision on the project-to know the nature and depth of their views. I suggest to the House that it is a sad indictment on the member for Dawson and the National Party that their constituents had to personally take the dive into the maze of bureaucratic procedure, standing orders and National Party power structures to find out their options. I can testify to you today that the cane farming families and others in the group did a good job. They made a good fist of finding their way around the bureaucracy. The result is that they have found a way to be represented-against the resistance and blocking by their local member and the National Party-to have the issues aired this morning. They got that satisfaction by coming to the Labor Party. The letter I am about to read is one of 1,425 identical letters signed by the people of the Burdekin region. It says: I wish to strongly object to the Burdekin Bypass Project and call for its complete abandonment. I am also calling for the elimination of all lines on Main Roads Maps with any prioritised numbering over these lines and land titles abolished. As the Burdekin is situated on a flood plain, the building of an elevated road through our community will cause extra flooding for our district. Any extra flood water caused by a road is unacceptable. As there is a limited amount of fertile agricultural land in the Burdekin, it is unacceptable to destroy this Australian Asset for the placement of a bypass road. The quality of land is irreplaceable. It is unacceptable to make farms unviable by carving them in two for the placement of a bypass road. We are constantly being told ‘get bigger or get out,’ being forced to become smaller will inevitably send many farmers to the wall. It is unacceptable to take the only available water source on a farm for the placement of a bypass road. As on some farms, there is only one point of access to quality and quantity of water. In the south-east corner of the state it is often seen that traffic merges from four lanes to three lanes to two lanes, in sensitive areas. The volume of traffic is far heavier in the south-east corner than the Burdekin district will ever experience. Therefore I request a second bridge crossing, and the upgrading of the existing highway, including Bower Street Bypass. I request that this matter be resolved, so that a sense of stability can return to our community. (Time expired)",126,Committees Be Instrumental In Delivering A Positive Out

Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Monaro region’s lavender growers on coming together to form Australia’s first lavender cooperative. Monaro Country Lavender Cooperative Ltd encompasses 30 lavender producers from a vast area, from outside of Queanbeyan down through Jerangle, to Wyndham and across to Jindabyne and Delegate. Karen Cash of Bombala Lavender worked hard to form this cooperative, and should especially be commended for bringing this project to fruition. The federal government was instrumental in helping this project to find its feet. Last year under the Regional Assistance Program $17,000 was provided to increase the viability of the lavender industry of south-east New South Wales. The project was endorsed by the New South Wales South East Area Consultative Committee as one which would generate employment opportunities for the local community. Through this funding injection and the dedication of the lavender growers, we should now see Bombala and the Monaro grow to become the lavender capital of Australia. With increased tourism in the area, this project will bring about sustainable employment growth for the whole community. Lavender is known for its soothing properties; maybe we should have a bit more of it about here in some of the more heated debates. www.garynairn.com.au provides an index of my latest media releases and parliamentary speeches, provides information about Eden-Monaro and has a range of links to federal, state and local government services. I hope that over time the links section will build up so that the site is thought of as a starting point for accessing all ranges of information about services in the region. I am pleased to be able to provide this extra resource for the people of Eden Monaro. I will update the site on an almost daily basis and I will especially value any feedback that constituents provide. I hope that my webpage will become a regularly visited site as a provider of information for school students looking for help with their schoolwork, constituents who would like to know about my work in the electorate and for those outside of Eden-Monaro who would like information about this special part of the world. (Time expired) Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices the broken promises of the Prime Minister. They well remember his most outrageous promise-that he would never, ever introduce a GST-and now they are reflecting upon another broken promise: that petrol prices would not rise because of the introduction of his GST. Yesterday, the opposition announced that it proposes to conduct an inquiry into the very important and significant issues as to why petrol prices are set at the level that they are, why the Prime Minister has broken his promise and what levels of revenue are carried by the federal government. That inquiry will be self-developed by the Labor Party, because we tried to get a bipartisan committee of inquiry through the parliament to look into this very important area and it was firmly rejected by the Liberal Party and the Democrats. I find that quite unacceptable in this day and age when people are prepared in the other house to run off and establish inquiries into all sorts of things. But when things affect our ordinary, everyday lives in areas like Wollongong-and, indeed, right around Australia-then people simply are not prepared to put up significant inquiries. The Labor Party, on the other hand, has done so. I will be saying to my constituents in Wollongong that they can see, at the different service stations-whether they be in Helensburgh, Corrimal, Unanderra or central Wollongong-that the price of fuel in fact is much higher now.

In fact, as the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, we want to see the government remove the GST spike from the calculation of the inflation rate. The effect of that would be to reduce the price of petrol by at least 2c a litre. On behalf of my constituents in Wollongong, I implore the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to let us, now the Olympics are over, concentrate on one of the important and significant issues in the lives of everyone in this nation. It goes to the cost of fuel and it goes to the ability, based on the cost of fuel, for people to get around this great nation of ours. I think people do deserve that break. They recognise that this government has once again misled them; they understand that the Prime Minister’s promise has been broken on this matter. I am suggesting also to my constituents to make their voices heard. I am quite prepared, through my office, to receive any submissions that people would like to make about this important issue, whether they come from the trucking industry or from just ordinary motorists-ordinary people-living in my electorate. I am quite prepared to make sure that those submissions are forwarded to the Labor Party’s committee but, importantly, also to the Prime Minister. (Time expired) HMAS Bundaberg Council’s request to have a navy ship named after the city of Bundaberg. The council recently wrote to the Naval Association of Australia and received support from the association’s federal president, Admiral Mike Hudson. A Navy warship last bore the name of Bundaberg during World War II. The HMAS Bundaberg was one of 60 Australian minesweepers, more commonly known as corvettes, built in Australian shipyards as part of the Commonwealth government’s wartime shipbuilding program. Fifty-six of these corvettes were named after Australian cities and towns, and the remaining four went to the Indian Navy. The HMAS Bundaberg was launched at Evans-Deakin Shipyards in Brisbane in 1941 and, following trials the next year, was assigned to operational duty as a convoy escort along the east coast of Australia. Bundaberg also performed a range of duties between 1942 and 1946, including escorting convoys to Papua New Guinea, bombarding Japanese positions on Alim Island and assisting in the recovery of allied prisoners of war from Borneo. In October 1945 she visited her namesake town of Bundaberg for an official reception, and was decommissioned in 1946 after sailing 113,193 nautical miles and being under way for 11,792 hours at an average speed of 9.6 knots. Bundaberg is possibly unique to the Naval Association of Australia inasmuch as it has two subsections represented: one long standing in Bundaberg and the other recently chartered Coral Coast section of Bargara. The vessel has a proud record and the city was proud of its namesake and her crew. It would be a thrill for local residents to have this honour bestowed on the city again, and I support the mayor, Councillor Kay McDuff; the Naval Association Coral Coast Sub-branch President, Mr John Simpson; the ex-Naval Association of Bundaberg President, Mr Jack Strong; the National President, Admiral Mike Hudson; and one of those most dedicated ex-Navy stalwarts, my good friend, Ted Garth, who brought this matter to my attention.

I got a response of 3,000, which was excellent in an electorate that has not in the past been asked its opinions politically on many issues for the federal parliament. I would like to share some of those results with the chamber. One of the questions was: ‘Do you think genetically modified crops should be grown in Tasmania?’ to which 75.9 per cent of respondents said no. In terms of the Tasmanian government’s one-year ban on genetically modified crops, 79.7 per cent supported it. Asked whether there should be a total ban on growing GMOs in Tasmania, 71.9 per cent also supported that; 95.5 per cent were in support of compulsory labelling of genetically modified food products. To test the validity of this, we asked, ‘Would you buy genetically modified food if it was cheaper?’ and 75.1 per cent said no. Asked, ‘Do you think you have enough information?’-and this is the point I want to make on genetically modified organisms-83.7 per cent said no. Asked whether there had been enough debate in Tasmania on genetically modified crops-and I suspect that this is the case elsewhere-82.4 per cent of people said no. So it seemed to me that one of the most important things in terms of this whole issue, both in Tasmania and throughout the rest of the nation-and this is certainly taken up in Work in Progress, Proceed with Caution, the report of the primary industries committee of which I am a member-is that we have proper, constructive, rational debate. It was with interest that I picked up the spring edition of the Agricultural, Fisheries and Forestry Australia newsletter. It had the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry telling us that ‘the myths surrounding gene technology are being dispelled in regional Australia.’ I suspect, given my survey, that that is not the case. It listed all the areas where these particular forums have been conducted by Biotechnology Australia and I noticed that Tasmania was not listed. I did hear that one member of Biotechnology Australia has said in the past that they thought the issue was a bit hot in Tasmania to go down there and hold regional forums. It is interesting, and a happy coincidence, that after I put out a press release yesterday calling for these forums I believe they are going to happen in the new year. I think we need better, more informed, constructive debate. (Time expired) Ballarat Electorate: Olympians Melbourne Aquarium today about some Ballarat Olympians who competed in the Sydney Olympics. As honourable members would be aware, there have been many Ballarat Olympians. We do not use the term ‘past Olympian’ in Ballarat. There is no such thing as a past Olympian-they are all Olympians-but I will talk about the Olympians who competed at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. I will mention them in no particular order. We had Peter Blackburn and Kellie Lucas in badminton. I know that Peter and Kellie were disappointed with the outcome of their competition but we are still very proud of their endeavours. Russell Mark is a Ballarat boy. Russell won the silver medal in the men’s double trap. Rachael Taylor won a silver medal in the women’s coxless pairs. Anthony Edwards and Rob Richards won silver medals in the men’s lightweight coxless four. We had Emily Martin, Bronwyn Thompson and Katie Faulkes in the women’s eight. Katie was the cox and Emily and Bronwyn were rowers. They were fourth in the final and very nearly got there. Tamsin Barnett competed in volleyball. The team competed with great honour-they defeated Kenya and China, and lost to the USA, Croatia and Brazil. In athletics, we had Lee Troop. Lee made a fantastic effort, in my view. It was a really gutsy performance from a gutsy bloke. Our other athletics competitor is Steve Moneghetti. Everyone knows ‘Mona’. I think we have all known him as ‘Mona’ for a long time.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 September, on motion by Dr Wooldridge: That the bill be now read a second time. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.58 a.m.)-Despite its brevity, the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 actually contains some important changes to the Health Insurance Act to enable the minister to proceed with his design for bonded scholarships for medical practitioners in rural and remote areas. Members may recall that bonded scholarships were actually proposed by Labor at the 1998 election and opposed by the Minister for Health and Aged Care. Labor strongly supports the need to get more doctors into rural Australia and believes that there needs to be comprehensive reform of the current training arrangements to provide shortand long-term solutions to this very serious problem. The May 2000 budget provided for $32.4 million over four years to create 100 scholarships of $20,000 per annum. These scholarships will be offered each year to new medical students entering university, in return for a commitment to practise in rural areas for a period of six years at the completion of their medical training. What we all need to be aware of is that it takes 11 years to complete a university degree, undertake the internship and then complete paid vocational training as a GP or a specialist. In other words, the first fully registered doctors from this scheme will not be taking up rural positions until 2012. So it is certainly not a quick solution. The bonding arrangements for these scholarships require the person to spend an equal amount of time continuously in a rural area. This means that in the simplest situation a student will receive financial support for six years, then work and do further training for at least another five years before spending another six years paying back the obligation to practise in the country. Essentially this bill provides the legislative mechanism for the Commonwealth to enforce the bond. The new section 19ABA provides that, if the medical practitioner breaches the commitment to work in a rural or remote area, the Commonwealth will be able to restrict payment of Medicare benefits in respect of that practitioner’s services. Bonded practitioners in breach of a contract can have their Medicare benefit payments restricted for up to twice the period they agreed to work in a rural or remote area. This means a person who is unable to commit to working for six years in the country after completing their degree will be banned from claiming on Medicare for up to 12 years. I note that this is a maximum and that the bill permits a lesser period to be agreed.",130,Representatives Main Committee
247,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with standing order 275A,20810 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 As I indicated at the start, the Labor Party’s rural health policy at the 1998 election included a bonded scholarship scheme of $20,000 a year for up to 100 medical studentssounds familiar. Labor’s policy required medical graduates to work in a rural area of need for the same number of years for which they received the scholarships. In 1998, the minister dismissed the Labor proposal as being fundamentally flawed and claimed in a press release dated 10 September 1998Mr Sidebottom interjectingThe Rural Doctor Placement Scholarships are probably unconstitutional due to the limitation in section 51 preventing civil conscription of doctors. Obviously now the minister has been forced to eat his words completely and accept Labor’s proposal. At the time that Labor proposed it, the AMA also embraced bonded scholarships as a means to provide an incentive for young doctors to plan a career in the country without needing to resort to geographical restrictions on Medicare provider numbers, as some rural groups have argued. The reason for this about-face by the minister is that he has been forced into adopting this scheme against his will. Country people, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, are desperate about the shortage of doctors and the absence of bulk-billing in many places. Unfortunately, the minister has designed a less effective and less fair scheme than Labor’s proposal and, along the way, lost the support and goodwill of the AMA. There can be no doubt that the shortage of doctors in rural areas is a major problem in the Australian health care system and it has been there for some time as a result of the combined effect of social and economic factors. This was recognised by the previous Labor government which put in place a number of measures to reverse the leakage from rural areas and these have made some progress. I just want to quote from the findings of the national rural practice study, as reported in an article by Professor Roger Strasser and others in the August 2000 Australian Journal of Rural Health. Professor Strasser reviewed the various actions taken by state and federal governments and he observed: The most significant was the creation of the General Practice Rural Incentives program in 1992 which included a package of initiatives addressing undergraduate medical education, relocation and retraining of urban doctors, specific rural CME programs and locum support. This program was followed up with rural work force planning initiatives. The article demonstrates that the long-term decline in rural doctor numbers was reversed by these programs. I just want to take a few minutes to look at the minister’s achievements on this subject and his various comments. In May 1998, in the Norman Cowper oration, the minister said: We are making important gains. In 1997 the number of doctors in rural areas went up by 4%. We are hoping that the figures for 1998 will show a similar or greater increase. But that was not the case. In fact, the increase in effective full-time doctors for the last two years to 1998 was only 0.4 per cent. Over the last four years, more than a dozen new programs have been announced without making any noticeable inroads. A number of these programs have been outright flops, while some certainly have provided a degree of relief. In 1997, we saw from this minister a program called the Clinical Assistantship Program. It was intended to provide additional training places for rural based doctors to do supervised training in rural areas. There was not a single applicant to participate in this program, despite significant funds being spent in developing and advertising. Similarly, the register of medical availability was intended to provide a list of qualified doctors willing to undertake locum work in rural areas. We had eight people put",131,Representatives Main Committee
248,Ms Macklin,"The member behind me gets it absolutely right. The minister said:Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20811 their names on that list, and it is understood that none was qualified to practise medicine in Australia and that most were not Australian residents. That scheme was also quietly axed. Some $2½ million has been spent on projects run by rural undergraduate steering committees at Australia’s 10 medical schools to promote interest in rural medical services. These projects have still to be evaluated, and we still do not have any information about how the money was spent. The John Flynn scholarship scheme is a holiday program to encourage 150 medical students to take two-week placements in rural areas to experience the realities of rural service. Problems have been experienced getting students to places in areas of need, with too many applicants going to some attractive destinations where local doctors have a limited capacity to supervise students during these times. The scheme has yet to be evaluated to determine whether the availability of these placements has any long-term impact on the likelihood of graduates moving to rural Australia. I note that the recent Rural Stocktake comments on the John Flynn scholarships at page 100. It states: ... as with many of the rural health incentives there has been delayed consideration of the management of the program ... The challenge will be to integrate the scheme as one of the complaints voiced during the Stocktake was that it was not known what some of the scholars were doing with their time and there was a lack of coordination with other student placements. The list of failed or partially executed programs goes on and on, and unfortunately we have very little information about them. The government repeatedly claims that it has solved the problem of doctor shortage in rural Australia. Unfortunately, the official statistics prove otherwise. In January 1999, the member for Farrer, while Acting Prime Minister, claimed that the rural doctor numbers had jumped by 7.2 per cent in two years. The health minister repeated this claim in the parliament. Questioning in the Senate estimates committee exposed the truth. The Acting Prime Minister and the minister had got the figures wrong by including any doctor who had made a Medicare claim in a rural area. In fact, there had been only a meagre 0.4 per cent increase in the actual number of equivalent full-time doctors in the country. The 3,550 full-time equivalent doctors in rural and remote areas had increased by just 13 in the previous two years. Mr Snowdon interjectingwhy-more up-to-date figures on an equivalent full-time basis. It appears that maybe a little progress is being made, but the government needs to release the full figures so that we can actually get down and see what the true picture is and the dimension of the problems that need to be addressed. Over the next five years, a study that I referred to earlier by Dr Strasser and others estimated that every 100 medical practitioners leaving rural and remote areas would be replaced by 102 new doctors. Any improvement in the total number of doctors in rural areas has to be also seen in the context of the large increase in the number of temporary resident doctors coming to Australia for longor short-term work. The latest figures from the Institute of Health and Welfare indicate that up to 1998 there was a net inflow of permanent migration of medical practitioners of 176 people a year. Since then, a large number of additional people have been approved under the scheme requiring five years service in a rural and remote area. The exact number approved under these schemes since early 1999 has also not been disclosed, but it is understood to amount to several hundred over the last year across all states. It would be interesting to know what those numbers are, in fact. If the numbers are to that degree, we can only draw the conclusion that we are in fact going backwards in relation to getting Australian-trained doctors into rural areas. The small net",132,Representatives Main Committee
249,Ms Macklin,"That is right. The department has since refused to release-I wonder20812 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 increase in the number of doctors in rural and remote Australia reflects a sizeable increase in the number of overseas-trained doctors filling the gaps left by retiring Australian doctors or other doctors moving out of country areas. Increasingly, seeing a doctor outside the cities means that you are either going to be seeing a trainee or an overseas-trained doctor. In relation to the bonded scholarships, it is interesting to see that the minister has completely failed to win the support of the profession or young doctors for this version of the bonded scholarship scheme. The AMA has been scathing in its criticism of this scheme we are debating today. The federal president, Dr Kerryn Phelps, said that she had been pleased when the Commonwealth picked up the concept of bonded scholarships, but she went on to say that the draconian penalties had rendered the scheme useless. Tellingly, her statement was headed ‘How to turn a good idea into a dog’s breakfast-give it to the Government’. The key features the AMA is concerned about are that the length of time people are committed to work in rural areas will be too long and that there is no provision for review of hardship cases. I am disappointed that the minister has not been able to sit down with the AMA and resolve these problems, as the scheme would be much more effective if it were seen, particularly by the students, to be fair and reasonable. The Medical Students Association has also expressed grave reservations about the scheme. Its view is that ‘such scholarships will do nothing to aid rural health’. Indeed, the association’s council has unanimously passed a motion which I want to put on the record for all members. It says: The Australian Medical Students Association believes that the proposed bonded scholarships: Force new medical students to be certain of their career when they are as young as 16; Carry with them the punitive measure of denying students a provider number for 12 years from the commencement of the bond should that student fail to meet the scholarship requirements in any way; Will probably be awarded to those students who would practise in rural areas anyway, regardless of the $20,000 per annum incentive; Imply that lucrative pecuniary incentives are required to attract medical students and junior doctors to rural areas and thus fail to capitalise on the many positive aspects of rural and remote Australia; And are potentially deleterious to the students continuing education after post graduate training given that the bulk of this occurs in urban areas. It is important to note that the association is not opposed to bonded scholarships. In fact, I met with members of the association again this morning and they made that point very plain. It is simply that they think the scheme that the government has put forward is unfair and inflexible, and they want to see some changes in that regard. I want to explain how the opposition want to proceed in this regard. Of course, we certainly support bonded scholarships-it was our idea-so we will be supporting the essence of the bill. But I want to foreshadow that we will be moving amendments in the Senate to address some of the concerns that have been raised. I hope the minister will listen to some of the reasonable suggestions that are being made and revise the scheme. This bill is a very general, empowering piece of legislation that permits contractual undertakings to be made by young doctors, and for these contracts to be enforced through the non-payment of Medicare benefits in the future. The bill itself does not go into any of the details of the scheme that the minister proposes. It was only this morning that I saw for the first time the proposed draft contract that the government will be asking students to signand, from my meeting with the students this morning, I gather that they had not seen the contract either. Unfortunately, the contract raises as many new questions as it answers. I have no doubt that the students and the AMA will be negotiating with the government over the contract, but there are a couple of basic parameters that we in the opposition want to ensure Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20813 there are a couple of basic parameters that we in the opposition want to ensure will be fair and consistent. One of the weak points in the bill is that it lacks any clear safeguards or procedures for setting out how the contracts between the young doctors and the government will be managed. A lot of public comment has focused on the implication that young doctors who default will be banned from Medicare for 12 years. The legislation actually provides that if a person defaults they will be prohibited from receiving Medicare benefits for the period agreed in the contract if a breach occurs and that the maximum shall be twice the period that the practitioner agreed to work in a rural or remote area. That is a very important part of the bill. This certainly is a significant obligation. Some of the students might coin a phrase about these contracts: they might in the future refer to signing a ‘Wooldridge contract’. I would say that many of them should take great care to make sure that there are adequate clauses to protect their interests and to make sure that if a person is unable, maybe for serious health reasons, to fulfil their original intention of working in a remote or rural area for the contracted time, there is a way of dealing with that. Mr Ian Macfarlane-You should be supporting this bill. Mr Ian Macfarlane-It will help us in rural areas. member for Braddon, the member for the Northern Territory, the member for Groom. rural areas. We do need to make sure that bonded scholarships are supported. It was a Labor idea. We are pleased to see that your minister has had a complete backflip and has adopted the Labor plan, but it has to be fair, as the member for the Northern Territory says. We need to have a mechanism for dealing with hardship cases to enable the contract to be varied in circumstances where a person is unable to continue with their plans for reasons beyond their control, such as very poor health. The contract suggests-and I am sure the member for the Northern Territory would be impressed with this-it will be done as a personal discretion of the minister, which I doubt is the best way to handle such complex matters. I also note that the guidelines require the sixyear service in rural areas to be ‘continuous’, which might also be hard for many students. Most doctors would be at least 27 years old by the time they get vocational registration and 33 by the time they complete their six years of service. The minister may not have thought of this issue but many women around this age are thinking of having children, hence their work as a doctorwork as a doctor inevitably will be interrupted, even if they are to be continuously a rural resident and give a commitment to continuing to be a rural doctor when they resume work. So what I would say to the government is that it would be sensible for the contracts to be amended to allow students to serve out their six years including approved periods of suspension of service when this becomes necessary for personal reasons such as having children.

Their20814 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 time where a person was unable to fulfil their contract as they had intended. We just need to learn from those experiences and make sure that the new scheme is fair and just to everybody concerned. I reiterate: this was a Labor idea; Labor supports bonded scholarships. In fact, it was the minister for health who said it was unworkable and he is the one that has done the huge backflip and is implementing Labor’s scheme. But, of course, what we want is a fair and just scheme. There is also going to be a lot of confusion about how these scholarships are going to sit side by side with other schemes, most notably the RMS scholarships, which give $10,000 a year without a bond to students from rural areas, and the HECS remission arrangements, which provide for forgiveness of HECS debt for university graduates doing training in rural areas. We do not have any information about how these schemes are going to relate to each other and we need that spelt out. There are three other anomalies in the scheme. I ask the minister to explain how he intends to resolve them. I note that the scheme, as it is outlined in the explanatory memorandum, appears to have no penalty for a person who fails to get vocational registration. Under this legislation, a person could receive the bonded scholarship for six years and continue to work as a career medical officer or go overseas for the rest of their life. It does seem odd that one could simply evade the obligation to practise in rural Australia or repay the substantial funding provided by practising within the public hospital system or by going overseas. It would be particularly troublesome if it turned out that one could earn more in that way than by practising in a rural or remote area. It seems to be a rather large loophole and I would appreciate it if the minister could explain how he intends to make sure that the people who benefit from training in this way do not have an easy option if they change their minds. The bill makes no reference to the terms under which a debt to the scheme is to be treated. The contract refers to the government bond rate being charged, but it is unclear about the amount that will be required to be repaid in the event that a default occurs or a person discontinues their involvement in the scheme. In what circumstances will the debt be wiped? Will the same rules apply as apply to HECS debts? What will the rules be if the scholarship holder fails their course, fails to gain acceptance to vocational training, fails to qualify for vocational registration? All of these questions need answers-and, understandably, particularly for the students concerned. There is a series of anomalies about exactly how the giving of these scholarships and the associated additional places in medical schools will sit with the allocation of normal places. I understand that a person eligible for admission to a university medical school will be able to apply for these scholarships but has to take one of the additional medical school places. They cannot take one of the usual medical school places. I am advised that the intention is that the scholarships will normally go to those who have not qualified before the extra 100 places are allocated. I find that very surprising because I cannot see any reason why we would not want those who qualify first to be going to rural areas. I say, there is still an enormous amount that we need to know about how this will actually apply. We still have a number of concerns about the terms of the arrangements which should be set out in the individual contracts. The approach seems to be very similar to other approaches by the government. It is like their ‘anything goes’ approach to industrial relations. Basically, all of these junior doctors, all of these 16and 17-year-olds, just have to go out and bargain for their best. I am strongly in support of getting a real increase in the number of rural doctors. Bonded scholarships certainly are part of Labor’s plan.",135,Representatives Main Committee

These barriers apply not only to doctors but also to nurses, pharmacists, dentists and every other health worker. Logic would suggest that the graduates will continue to look for opportunities to practise in those fields that they find challenging and financially rewarding. If the rewards and challenges remain concentrated in the cities, the outcome is likely to be little different from what occurred in the past. Unfortunately, the minister is also at war with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners over his plans for a new training framework and is in conflict with both the opposition and the Democrats over his plan to remove the sunset clause affecting the current arrangements for graduate training. So we have a number of serious problems in this whole area of doctor training that must be resolved quickly. As I have said, the opposition will of course support the bill-which was our idea. However, we believe there is a need to establish some minimum requirements regarding the contracts that will underpin the scholarship scheme. I have indicated to the government that we are seeking to move two amendments to date. They require clarification of the terms of the contracts and ensure-this is a very important issue-that junior doctors, 16and 17-yearolds, receive independent advice about the nature of those contracts before they sign. These amendments will require contracts to contain provisions dealing with the basic details of the obligations to be imposed on a young person who receives a scholarship. The amendments will require a mechanism for independent consideration of applications to enable someone to suspend the period of service or to obtain hardship relief. They are the areas where we will seek to amend the legislation in the Senate. Allowing a period of suspension will be particularly important for women wanting to take some time off while they have children and a system of hardship relief will enable those who, for reasons beyond their control, need to leave rural practice. The hardship relief process must be separate from the minister and we must ensure that it is fair. We must also have a provision that stipulates the amount to be repaid and the interest rate that will apply in the event that the recipient fails to graduate or achieve vocational registration. We must listen to concerns that have been expressed about the pressure that will be placed on young people as they enter university. We must remember that such people are only 16 or 17 years old and $20,000 is a heck of a lot of money at that age. I want to make sure that those students are fully aware of the significant commitment that they will be making to rural medical services and the length of time involved in meeting that commitment. In those circumstances, it is appropriate that the person entering into a contract receives the advice that I have mentioned and that we find some appropriate and fair mechanism of delivering it. I certainly hope that these bonded scholarships will work because we need to attract more doctors to rural Australia-there is no question about that. Labor members in the chamber today who represent rural and remote areas of Australia certainly know that. They want to attract more doctors to their areas, such as northern Tasmania and the Northern Territory. To do that, we must have a scheme that works and that will encourage students to sign on and make this hefty commitment. A range of complementary measures must go with it, but I hope that the government will consider my suggestions and ensure that this scheme is fair and delivers the results for rural and remote Australia that were intended by Labor’s commitment in 1998.",136,Representatives Main Committee

261,Ms Macklin,"This is only part of what needs to be an overall policy. There are other20816 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000. This is just part of a massive effort by this federal government to improve the health services available to people living in rural and regional Australia. For some time it has been difficult to attract doctors-in fact, not just doctors but health professionals in a range of specialties-to rural areas and to retain them. Between 1984-85 and 1998-99 there was a 60 per cent increase in the number of full-time medical practitioners in metropolitan areas compared with only 39 per cent in rural and regional areas. In 1998-99 there were 115 general practitioners per 100,000 people in metropolitan areas-that is one practitioner for 870 people-compared with 87 in rural and regional areas, which is one practitioner for every 1,150 people. Therein lies the problem. When we look at the demographics of some rural and regional areas, we can see that the ratio should be much better-particularly when there is a large number of aged residents. The turnover of GPs in rural areas is also much higher than in the city. Perhaps this is in part because of the higher number of hours that they are on call and also the fact that traditionally fewer services have been available in smaller communities. I can certainly vouch for that. I often stay with a friend who is a general practitioner down on the coast and I know that the GPs there rotate the time that they are on call around the less than half-a-dozen GPs in that area. It is a very onerous task being a GP in a country area, being called out quite regularly at night and on weekends. In Eden-Monaro, for example, we had trouble attracting a permanent doctor to Tuross Head. The township was serviced by a visiting doctor from Batemans Bay only once a week. Tuross Head is no small area, as many people in this region who travel down there for holidays and weekends would probably know. It also has a very high proportion of retired people, but they only have a visiting doctor coming from Batemans Bay once a week. Tuross Head has to be one of the most picturesque spots in the world, so I still have great difficulty understanding why it was so difficult to attract a doctor. Perhaps we should have sent some brochures to city doctors and promoted a sea change for them. We finally found a doctor who was willing to move to the area-Dr Ruth Przychodzka, who was furthering her studies in Melbourne. Dr Przychodzka recently commenced as the permanent doctor in Tuross, and we are incredibly grateful to her. This year’s federal budget contains a country health package which is aimed at addressing the country-city divide. This package, by the way, is the largest ever country health package detailed by a federal government-$562.1 million over four years. It includes a series of measures to address the shortage of medical practitioners and a longer term strategy, of which the Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme is part, to encourage younger people to take up the practice of medicine in country Australia. This health insurance amendment bill addresses the Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme. Under this scheme, the government has committed $32.4 million over four years to provide 100 extra medical students with a scholarship of $20,000 per annum to study medicine on the condition they agree to work in a rural community for six years once they have completed their basic medical training and GP or specialist fellowship. These 100 places are in addition to the places that already exist in Australian medical schools. This means that 100 Australians are going to study medicine who would not otherwise have the opportunity to do so. A particular benefit to the residents of Eden-Monaro is that 25 of these medical school places have been allocated to the University of Sydney’s clinical school operating at Canberra Hospital. It is reasonable that, in return for the investment the Australian taxpayer is making in these students’ education, they then give something back to the Australian community by agreeing to work in a rural area for six years.

It is only fair that there is some obligation to the community at the end of this. This amendment particularly deals with those bonded scholars who break their agreement. When a student enters into this agreement, he or she will know their full responsibilities and what penalties apply if the agreement is broken. On the concerns about information that were raised by the spokesperson from the other side, the department is presently finalising a comprehensive information pack which includes an overview of the scheme, the key features of the scheme and answers to frequently asked questions. The information packs will be distributed in October in plenty of time for interested applicants to consider the implications of their obligations. The department is also requiring that, prior to the signing of any contracts, individuals will seek independent legal advice. The shadow spokesperson talked about 16and 17-year-old doctors. In fact, these students are not immature: the average age of an undergraduate first-year medical student in 1999 was 21½ and of a graduate first-year medical student in 1999 it was 32½. There are very few applicants who are younger, but they will not be required to enter into a contract until they are of legal age-that is, 18. That answers those comments that were given before. Bonded scholars are obliged to commence work as a medical practitioner in a rural area within 12 months of obtaining fellowship of a recognised medical college in Australia or within 17 years of commencing the medical course. They are expected to work in a rural area for six continuous years and may fulfil this obligation by working in more than one rural area. Should a bonded scholar breach this agreement they will be required to repay the amount of the scholarship they have received, with interest, and there will be up to a 12-year ban on their access to Medicare benefits. By no means does this ban signal the end of a career-students can still work in the public system, where their services are greatly needed and would be appreciated, and they could work in medical research for government authorities or large corporations which require medical expertise. In special circumstances, students will be able to apply for deferral of their obligation to work in a rural area or for approval to take a break in the period of service in a rural area. In exceptional circumstances, the minister will have the discretion to waive repayment of a scholarship or to waive the ban on Medicare access. A clause will be written into the contracts covering ministerial discretion, which will give those unable to fulfil the bond due to exceptional circumstances-illness, disability, a variety of things-the opportunity to apply to the minister to defer or reduce part or all of their service or repayment obligations. The minister will be able to approve suspensions of service. The scheme is open to any student, although consideration will be given to students interested in rural health who are motivated to work in rural areas. Without this legislation there would be no incentive for bonded scholars to honour their commitment to rural Australians. They would simply be able to pay back their scholarship once they have qualified instead of doing rural service-in effect, a very generous loan scheme. Since the announcement of this scheme in this year’s federal budget I have spent some time promoting its benefits throughout my electorate of Eden-Monaro. I have had a number of calls to the electorate office both from prospective medical students requesting application details and from constituents grateful for the federal government’s efforts to address the disparity between city and rural health services. Some residents suggested that the six years of medical service should start earlier. However, it would be remiss of the government to allow doctors to practise before they have obtained fellowship. This way we ensure that all Australians living in country and city areas have access to fully trained and qualified doctors and the best health facilities. Some residents suggested that we are imposing draconian penalties-a 12-year ban regardless of circumstance. This is completely untrue, as the federal 20818 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 health minister of the day, as I explained, irrespective of who that might be, will always be able to waive or defer the period of work. This is a long-term strategy under the budget’s package of measures to deliver more doctors to rural communities. Once the first cohort of doctors complete their fellowship training, there will be an extra 100 doctors annually working in rural communities for a sixyear period. As I mentioned earlier, the government recognises the need to attract to and maintain in rural areas not just doctors but also nurses, psychologists, podiatrists and other health professionals. Just to remind people, the budget announced a $210 million increase to support the number of doctors, nurses, psychologists and other health professionals; another $162 million to provide further medical training for doctors and graduates; $185 million for extending regional health services in aged care, child health, community care, substance abuse and mental health; an extra 50 general practitioner training positions specifically for rural areas, which means that young doctors have opportunities to train specifically for practice in rural Australia; $49.5 million to increase the range of services that support the retention of country doctors, including providing more nurses for general practitioners, more psychologists and more podiatrists; and $49 million to establish the infrastructure funding necessary to take specialists out to country areas to provide services. The government also announced provisions for the establishment of nine new clinical schools and three new university departments of rural health. This news was greeted very warmly in my electorate. When the federal Minister for Health and Aged Care, Michael Wooldridge, announced that 25 of the medical school places were to be allocated at the University of Sydney’s Clinical School operating at Canberra University, he also announced that the federal government, jointly with the ACT government, is reviewing the current Clinical School at the Canberra Hospital, with a view to establishing the ACT’s own medical school and extending medical education and training to the far south-east coast of New South Wales, and we were very encouraged by that. A new Canberra medical school would positively affect health service delivery and the economy of the region. It would be an important investment in rural health and would provide an opportunity for medical students to undertake their entire degree in the ACT and its surrounding districts. I think it is important that we provide medical students with rural experience; this is a vital component of any health professional’s training and career. A medical school would facilitate links with existing educational and health resources in the ACT and its surrounding districts. It would be of great benefit to both health facilities in Eden-Monaro and potential medical students. This government is working hard to address the gap in services between the city and the country. This is what this scheme is all about, and it is giving 100 medical students a go-a real chance. This amendment asks these new students to do the right thing and give those in rural Australia something back in return for the faith placed in them. I urge all members to support the bill. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (10.41 a.m.)-I rise to speak in support of the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 and the amendments foreshadowed by the shadow minister. This bill comes out of the announcement by the Minister for Health and Aged Care that the government will offer bonded scholarships to medical students in return for service in rural areas. In the last budget, the government announced the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme, which will allow 100 new medical students to apply for a scholarship of $20,000 per year to study medicine. In return for that fairly generous scholarship, the students will enter into a contract agreeing to work in a rural community for six years. The six years of their contracted service begin after they Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20819 complete their university course and meet the requirements of either a GP or a specialist fellowship. This bill that we are debating today effectively provides for the enforcement of those scholarship contracts by allowing for the suspension of Medicare benefits payable for the services provided by a doctor in breach of their bonded contract. The exclusion from receiving Medicare payments can go for up to 12 years. The health minister knows that he has the support of the Labor Party for the concept of bonded scholarships to attract medical graduates to rural areas. The idea of bonded scholarships has been around for some time; it has been suggested and supported by the Australian Medical Association for some years now. That was part of the reason that the Labor Party announced it as part of its policy before the last election in 1998. The health minister scoffed at the idea back then, but has now acknowledged that his government has failed to address the shortage of medical professionals outside the capital cities, and has embraced Labor’s policy. From the Labor Party’s point of view, we have not changed our position. We thought bonded scholarships were a good idea in 1998, and we still think that it is a step in the right direction towards boosting doctor numbers in rural Australia. It is not surprising that the health minister has taken a while to catch up with us, because he was obviously in a state of denial for a long time when it came to the shortage of doctors in the bush. Earlier this year, the minister was caught out fudging figures on rural doctor numbers. The minister claimed an increase of 301 doctors in rural areas. That represented a jump of seven per cent in two years. In fact, the minister’s figures came from including locums working for short periods in those country areas. The real increase in terms of full time doctor numbers was just 13 for the whole of Australia. After that, the minister’s game was up, and he had to come up with some effective policy to address the growing crisis in doctor numbers and health care in rural Australia. While we in the Labor Party are quite happy for him to resort to our policy on bonded scholarships to help out with that process, after four years of budget cuts to health services I hope that it is not too little too late. The problems caused by the shortage of doctors and specialists are quite acute in my electorate of Capricornia. They are the problems that are mentioned most frequently-those and petrol prices-when I am out and about as the local member. I believe that many of the problems in obtaining health care in Central Queensland relate to the shortage of doctors in our area and the difficulty in attracting doctors and specialists. I find that the doctors who are working in Central Queensland are very overworked and it really creates a vicious cycle. To ease the workload of the current doctors and specialists we need to attract new doctors and specialists to the area but, of course, they are discouraged by the enormous workload that our current medical professionals are labouring under at the moment. The problem really just feeds on itself and it leaves patients in Central Queensland on quite large waiting lists. One example that comes to mind is from the area of specialty-ear, nose and throat-that causes a lot of problems in Central Queensland. One letter to my office came from the mother of a young girl of about 10 who needs to see an ear, nose and throat specialist for an ear complaint. She has been advised that it will take something like two years even to see that specialist, and that is not even looking at when she is going to get an operation or any other treatment that she may require. It is a two-year wait just to get an appointment because there are just not enough ear, nose and throat specialists in our community. Another problem area is the orthopaedic specialty, which is struggling under a huge load at the moment. Earlier this year there was an example of a young girl having to go to Brisbane to get a broken arm attended to. It was quite a simple matter, but there just were not orthopaedic surgeons available to assist this young girl. So, for a very simple procedure, her family had the expense of getting from Rockhampton to Brisbane and also anxiety on top of 20820 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 that. Quite a simple medical procedure put this family through a lot of anxiety and hardship. They are just two examples off the top of my head. Anecdotally, there is also the problem where our GPs in Rockhampton are struggling under a huge workload. Many of the GPs have closed their patient lists. They are just so snowed under that they are not able to take on more patients. That is just a day-to-day fact of life in Central Queensland. The reality is that the fewer doctors and specialists you have in a place, the harder it is to hang on to them and the harder it is to get new people to fill the positions. This is one of the reasons that I am so sceptical about the government’s obsession with private health insurance. I just do not see that it is the answer to our problems in Central Queensland, because, at the end of the day, you are dealing with the same limited pool of doctors and specialists-whether you are booked in at the Mater Hospital at one end of town or the Base Hospital at the other. The problem of getting to see a doctor or a specialist really stems from the numbers that we have got to go around. Of course, this is even worse in the western parts of Capricornia. In towns like Longreach, Barcaldine and Aramac, there is only one hospital and one set of medical staff, so I fail to see how private health insurance is the answer to health care needs out in those parts of the electorate. Given the size of the problem in stemming the flow of medical practitioners from our region and in attracting new ones, I am pleased that the government is making a serious effort now with the bonded scholarships. It appears that it is not all smooth sailing with these scholarships. There has been criticism of the scheme from a number of sources-including the Australian Medical Association-regarding the inflexibility and the enormous obligations that the scholarship contracts impose on the scholarship holders. These problems have been outlined in detail by the shadow minister and I will not go into them here, except to say that I support the amendment that Jenny Macklin has foreshadowed to introduce greater flexibility and fairness into the scheme. The member for Eden-Monaro, who spoke just before me, pointed out that the health minister will have some discretion to waive the period of exclusion from Medicare benefits. To me, that just underlines the problems that exist in the scheme at the moment in that obviously the health minister foresees that there will be circumstances where it would be fair to waive the exclusion period. Why not introduce fundamental procedural fairness into the scheme from the outset instead of just leaving it to the health minister? Ultimately, the success of the scheme will depend on its acceptance by medical students, so we really have to take their opinions and views on board to make it work. There is another, broader problem that I have noticed in the details that have been released from the minister’s office about the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme that I will just mention briefly. When the scheme was announced in the budget earlier this year, it was described in terms of applying to ‘regional and rural areas’. I will quote from Regional Australia: Making a difference-the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Hon. Ian Macdonald, Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government following the budget. It says: The Government will provide $32.4 million over four years to create ... scholarships ... which will be offered to new medical students each year in return for their commitment to practice in regional and rural areas for at least six years after graduating. So there it is ‘regional and rural areas’; now, in the guidelines from the minister’s office and even in the name of this bill, the reference to ‘regional areas’ has disappeared. In the guidelines from the minister’s office we see: Definition of rural area ‘Rural area’ is defined as an area within Australia which is classified as rural or remote according to the index used by the Commonwealth at the time your period of service commences. Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20821 So, again, it is all about rural and remote areas. That might seem a bit pedantic but, coming from Queensland-particularly when I represent a seat that includes a major regional centre, Rockhampton, as well as many smaller rural and perhaps what you would call remote communities-the distinction between ‘rural’ and ‘regional’ is quite significant. I would be very disappointed if Rockhampton, a regional centre with a grave shortage of medical practitioners and with an important role in providing a range of health services to the whole region, did not qualify under this scheme. Perhaps in other states you can talk about city versus rural and cover the whole gamut, but Queensland is a very decentralised state and there is an extra layer of regional centres that need to be considered. For example, in Rockhampton, we have a population of 60,000, but we still lack the services of a major city. I would like some reassurance from the minister that our needs in regional Queensland will be considered, as was clearly anticipated in the budget statement put out by the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson. While I am referring to the budget measures, I would like to refer to the announcement of the additional clinical schools, because this is another element of attracting health professionals to regional and rural areas. The idea of providing training in those areas to medical students is a very important one in terms of attracting medical professionals to, or keeping them in, regional areas. Certainly the medical practitioners in my area do put a lot of emphasis on this aspect when they talk about attracting doctors to our area. There is a lot of support for a clinical training school in Central Queensland. I believe the logical location would be Rockhampton because of the facilities and medical practitioners already there. The establishment of a clinical training school in Central Queensland will give medical students a great experience of life and practice in a non-metropolitan area and, hopefully, will encourage them to consider practice either in Central Queensland or in other non-metropolitan areas. The establishment of a clinical training school will also add to the professional development available to the medical practitioners already working in Central Queensland. It will be an incentive for experienced practitioners to stay in Central Queensland or even move there to take part in the clinical training school. The budget announcement was for $117.6 million to establish nine new clinical schools in regional and rural areas. I have already written to the health minister to let him know the support that exists in the medical community in Rockhampton for the establishment of a clinical school and how important it is for us in boosting doctor numbers in both the short and long term in our region. Yungalla Rural Health Training Unit already provides an important training service for medical students from the University of Queensland. It provides eight-week units of training for students from the University of Queensland and, through the unit in Rockhampton, those students are sent out for experience right across Central Queensland in smaller communities, as well as Rockhampton. I believe that the University of Queensland has put in a submission to the health minister seeking funding and acceptance under that clinical training school scheme announced in the budget. I would like to commend that submission and commend the idea of the establishment of a clinical training school in Central Queensland. If the health minister is serious about addressing the shortage of medical professionals in Central and Western Queensland he will use this opportunity to establish a clinical training school in Central Queensland to build on the excellent work already being done by the rural health training unit in Rockhampton. Even if the bonded scholarship scheme is a big success, we will not see any medical practitioners come out of it for some years. In the meantime, the provision of medical services to rural Australia has to remain a priority. One of the organisations that is providing a great service to small communities in Queensland is the Queensland Bush Nursing Association. The Bush Nursing Association has five centres in Queensland: Bollon in south-west 20822 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 Queensland; Cecil Plains on the Darling Downs; Mckinlay in north-west Queensland; Mount Surprise in the lower Gulf of Carpentaria; and Jericho in central-west Queensland, which is in my electorate of Capricornia. Each centre consists of a clinic and living quarters with a registered nurse in charge. Visiting local doctors hold outpatients clinics at the centres on a weekly basis. From dropping into the centre at Jericho, I know that that is a very popular service. The centres are managed by a voluntary local committee which collects yearly subscriptions from local residents and carries out fundraising to maintain the facilities and purchase new equipment. The bush nursing centres do receive money through the HACC program, but that is only for the wages of the nurses. Funding for the rest of the operation comes from fundraising which, as you can imagine, is very difficult in these small rural towns with declining populations which are going through the general difficulties that small towns are suffering. The Bush Nurses Association in Queensland have told me that they are very disappointed that the funding announced in the budget-and I am referring to the announcement on the first-class regional hospitals-is for a very specific type of organisation. Specifically, it says that the funding of $30.3 million over four years will be spent on revitalising bush nursing, community and other small, regional non-government hospitals. The bush nurses of Queensland have been told that they are not eligible for funding under that program. It is, I believe, for small private hospitals which are quite common in rural Victoria. I believe that the argument that the bush nurses have put to me-and I understand they have put it to the health department-makes a lot of sense. If you are providing funding for rural health services in small communities, those communities should have some say in determining how they deliver those health services. Just because Victoria, for example, has a system of small, private bush hospitals-as opposed to these community based centres in Queensland-why are those people more deserving of assistance when it comes to the provision of health services? Mr Ian Macfarlane interjectinggovernment telling communities what a bush nurse is rather than the communities where they work? I think that the funding announced is very welcome but the minister is being short sighted about the eligibility for funding. The money the bush nurses in Queensland are talking about is not very much at all but that support from the federal government would make a big difference in those communities where the bush nurses provide an excellent and vital service. In conclusion, the bonded scholarship scheme is definitely a necessary part of addressing the shortage of doctors in regional and rural areas. By definition, a bonded scholarship does require some enforcement mechanism and, to that extent, I support this bill to amend the Health Insurance Act. I also support the amendments foreshadowed by the shadow minister because I believe that her recommendations are designed to make it a better and more attractive scheme. What we are all about is making this scheme work and improving the numbers of doctors, specialists and other health professionals in rural and regional Australia. her positive comments about the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000. This bill relates to the government’s rural bonded scholarship scheme. This scholarship scheme is part of the federal government’s commitment to improve health care in regional Australia. I do not think there is any argument in this or any other chamber that we need to do what we can to improve the standard of health and the availability of health in regional areas. It is part of the federal government’s commitment of $562 million for regional health incentives in this year in the 2000-01 budget.",138,Representatives Main Committee

264,Mr Ian Macfarlane (Groom) (10.59 A.m.),"I thank the member for Capricornia forWednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20823 I note with interest the concern of the shadow health minister over the issue of bonded scholarships, but I must admit I have very little support for what she is saying. The only criticism of this bill has come from the AMA and the medical students, two groups of people who have pretty strong vested interests. I have not seen a great deal from the AMA in terms of what their alternative suggestions are, other than to pay these students $120,000 and then let them off their obligation to work in regional areas. From where I come, a man’s word is his bond. I would never believe that any of these medical students would deliberately walk away from their personal commitment to rural areas. However, in this day and age we do see a proliferation of people who use all sorts of excuses not to fulfil their commitments. The government makes no apology for putting in place a set of guidelines and requirements that will see these students actually deliver to rural areas the medical services that they have accepted money to provide, and that we as a government have paid the money to provide. I do not accept for a moment that there is not room in the legislation for flexibility or compassion. Should a situation arise where a medical practitioner finds, for whatever reason, that on genuine grounds they are not able to fulfil their contract, then the provision is there for the minister to make a dispensation. I hear from the other side that the system needs to have a tribunal, or a far more complex mechanism. The reality is that all that does is set up a bureaucracy that slows the process. I have to say that I have no concerns with the current minister providing a fair and compassionate view of the situation. We are not expecting to be flooded with people applying for dispensations. AndI have enough faith in the government of this nation that were the Labor Party ever to attain the Treasury bench, and may it not be soon, that their health minister would also be able to behave in a fair and equitable manner and provide dispensations when they are needed. I also hear the argument that this sort of bonding for a six-year period does not provide for women, in particular, who may wish to start a family. However, within the guidelines of the act there is a provision that the medical practitioner has to practise for nine months of a 12month period. Most women I talk to these days-although it certainly was not the case when my wife had children-seem to be able to fit within those sorts of provisions. In fact, since the term of this government started we have seen one member of the opposition take maternity leave and return. There is the ability to juggle that leave in such a way that six months leave could be taken. Of course, if there were any complications with the pregnancy or with whatever family reason required the person to take leave, again I have no doubt that the compassion within the minister’s office would take over and that there would not be a problem. The bottom line with any sort of bonded scholarship is that there is a bond. There is no point in having a scholarship that people can walk away from. What we need to do, particularly in terms of providing rural and regional health services, is ensure that we deliver. I accept the member for Capricornia’s point that even with these provisions it will be six years before we actually deliver on the ground, or perhaps even more, but the reality is that, at least then, we will be delivering with certainty. We want to deliver 100 people a year into rural Australia to ensure that people who live in rural Australia, who live there for their profession, who retire there, or who may consider retiring there, are secure in the knowledge that we are going to see a gradual increase, a positive trend instead of a negative trend, in the number of doctors who practise there. I do not accept for a moment that we should be looking at easing the guidelines, to making them more lax. I accept that we need to have rural services improved in terms of medicine and I think this is a fantastic scheme to do it. If the people who are considering taking these scholarships are not prepared to take the conditions, the answer is simple: don’t sign them. This is not a compulsory scheme; this is a voluntary scheme. It is a scheme which offers another alternative. We have heard from 20824 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 previous speakers about the provisions that this federal government has put in place to give medical students the opportunity to get some assistance in terms of their training. This scheme is a particularly generous one. Twenty thousand dollars a year over six years is a lot of money. It is a lot of money where I come from. For a struggling university student-and I have been one-the thought of having $20,000 a year to assist them during their studies is certainly appealing. But there is no compulsion. Some university students work part time. I have a nephew who works part time to assist his studies and to provide for himself. That is easily an option for medical students; other students have other means of support. In the end, if people do not like the rules, they need not sign. My understanding of the support that is out there-and I agree with the member for Eden Monaro-is that this scheme is eagerly awaited. In fact, if I have heard one criticism of this scheme-apart from that of the students and the AMA, both of whom I dismiss-it is that it is too good. There are concerns on the part of the state government in Queensland-and there may well be some concerns within the state government, for a whole range of reasons that I will not go into right now-that our scholarship scheme for doctors is so good that they will not be able to recruit people to state government facilities. That, to me, says that our scheme is seen by the people who are going to use it and by the people who are going to benefit from it as a scheme that they want to get involved in. It is a scheme which I believe will deliver an increase in numbers. There was one comment by the member for Capricornia that caused me some concern, when she said that we should be pulling back on our commitment to private health insurance; that private health insurance will not deliver the sorts of things that we are trying to achieve in order to provide better health services in rural and regional Australia. I cannot understand the basis for that argument. WhatI see in rural and regional Australia, particularly in my neck of the woods, is a growing reliance on private medical treatment-on non state government medical treatment. In my electorate of Groom, which has only one public hospital, there has been an absolutely shameful cut in the level of services provided by that base hospital in Toowoomba. The government of the day, under Premier Peter Beattie, obviously does not favour Toowoomba. He does not favour our beautiful city at all. The cuts that are taking place are causing concern right through the medical fraternity and the community. People are losing faith in the state government health system. Whilst that needs to be addressed, it is also causing people to move towards securing their own position in terms of medical treatment. We are blessed with two major private hospitals and three smaller ones, which are either in my electorate or on the edge of my electorate. They are certainly taking up the slack and providing a wonderful service. The only way in which people will be able to afford that service is through private health insurance. This government has taken major steps to assist people to secure private health insurance and to secure their own destiny. In terms of regional, rural and remote Australia, the issues are no different. What we have seen right across Australia is a substantial increase in the number of people who are privately insured. In my electorate, the figure is approaching 60 per cent-a substantial increase and one which I am certainly very supportive of and very proud to see. I wish to address the issue of rural versus regional. In my electorate of Groom, we struggle from time to time to get doctors into the smaller centres. Recently, there was a situation in Clifton which received national publicity. We struggled to get a doctor to work there. We have succeeded in doing that. Unfortunately, the doctor has chosen to live in Toowoomba, but you can’t get everything in the first grab. Clifton is a beautiful little town. It has got great amenities, a great school and great community spirit. They are looking to the government to ensure that we provide a doctor for their town in years to come. They have overcome their immediate problem, and I congratulate the doctor for the work that he is doing there. Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20825 The reality is that it is the small country centres, the small rural centres, that are struggling to get general practitioners. Toowoomba has an adequate supply of medical practitioners. I, like the member for Capricornia, would be the first to argue for government assistance to improve the medical services in Toowoomba as she would for Rockhampton. But the reality is that the chronic need is in the small rural townships like Clifton, Pittsworth, Oakey, Dirranbandi, Cunnamulla and Goondiwindi where we need to be able to get doctors out to actually reside in and join in the community. Under this scheme, we will achieve that. We will achieve what we from rural Australia know already, and that is that once we get these people out there they will become part of the community, they will realise that regional and rural Australia is a great place to live, a great place to bring up your children, even a great place to retire to. Having done that, it will also demonstrate to them that being a medical practitioner in rural Australia has some added advantages. This legislation will, as I say, deliver more doctors to rural Australia, it will deliver the sorts of health services that we want to see in rural Australia and I think it is a great credit to the government. I welcome the support from the member for Capricornia. I join with her in lobbying for a clinical training school which, I understand, under the University of Queensland proposal, will be split equally between Rockhampton and Toowoomba. Those sorts of clinical schools offer a great opportunity to produce medical practitioners ready and able to fit into regional and rural environments. It is the sort of move into regional health-not just medicine but regional health with the associated allied health areas-that really will produce results. We in Toowoomba are already looking at a proposal which will see the expansion of the clinical training school to encompass some of the ancillary medical practices and provide allied health services as well as nursing. This can only improve the standard of health care in regional Australia because, like practising medicine, nursing in those rural and remote areas offers some particular challenges, as does being a physiotherapist or a speech therapist or an occupational therapist or any of the other allied health professions. Madam Deputy Speaker Gash, this is excellent legislation. It will deliver more doctors to regional and rural areas, particularly rural areas. I do not think you or I would have to travel very far into any part of rural Australia to find someone who is keen to see that happen. It is great legislation. It is part of the government’s overall commitment to improving rural health, part of that $210 million increase that we have seen in the latest budget. I commend the legislation to the House. debate in relation to the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000. I say at the outset that I support the essence of the bill and what it is attempting to do and I support the amendments foreshadowed by the shadow minister for health, the member for Jagajaga. Fundamentally, I support the legislation because what it is about is smashing the monopoly and hold which the people from the leafy, inner eastern suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney have had on the medical profession for decades. This has been half the problem we have had for a good many years in getting doctors into rural and remote areas: the fact that so many of the people who make up those students who are in medical courses at universities come from the elite private schools and those professional backgrounds and are people who have only lived in and around Melbourne and Sydney. These people with their circle of friends often very restricted to the more affluent suburbs in Melbourne and in Sydney just do not want to go and live in rural and regional Australia. They do not have an interest in rural and regional Australia. They have never really had any experience in rural and regional Australia. They have come from a very limited background and their exposure to what is on offer, if you like, in rural and regional Australia is very limited.",144,Representatives Main Committee
265,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (11.13 A.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the20826 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 I think that this type of legislation, this type of action, which will see an influx of people from universities into rural and regional Australia because they have signed up to this agreement, can only be a good thing. It should not be seen as a panacea, it should not be seen as just one action which is going to cure all the difficulties we have in getting doctors into rural and regional Australia, but I think it is an important component in an overall strategy to try to achieve that end. This idea was mooted by the shadow minister for health some two years ago. At the time, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Michael Wooldridge, did say that it was probably unconstitutional and probably would never be allowed to happen. We have seen a substantial backflip, a substantial change in position, from the governmentA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.16 a.m. to 11.25 a.m. interrupted as a result of a division in the House of Representatives. I am starting to think that there might be a conspiracy involved, but I will put that conspiracy to one side just for a moment. As I was saying, when it comes to dealing with methods to actually get more doctors into rural and regional Australia, we have to have at the front of our minds the fact that it takes a concerted strategy on behalf of government. Fundamentally we need to look at changing the whole basis of the medical profession, dominated as it is with people who come from the leafy inner city suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney. To the extent to which the provisions of the bill do that, I support those efforts. CanI just put on the record as well my belief that, if we are to get more doctors in rural and regional Australia, we need to streamline the existing systems that are in place which deal with getting doctors from overseas to go and work in rural and regional areas. I, like other members of this place, have acted on behalf of constituents who have tried to negotiate their way through the battery of different organisations that deal with getting doctor registration in rural and regional areas. Some of these organisations include the Rural Workforce Agency in Victoria, the Medical Practitioners Board, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Centre for Rural Health. I am sure that there are several others that I just cannot think of off the top of my head right now. So there is this battery of different organisations all providing a myriad of services without too much coordination, as far as I can see. For my own part, I think it is a great thing that we have doctors from overseas who come and work in rural and regional areas. They provide an important service and we are better for having them there. They contribute substantially by providing ethnic diversity to our communities and, in my experience, are always fantastic contributors in terms of being active at the schools and kindergartens where they send their children and also in local community and service organisations. So all up they make a wonderful contribution. However, I think we do them a disservice through the overbureaucratised system that we have in place to try to deal with their applications to come to Australia and register as doctors to work in rural and regional areas. So we really do need to do something about that if we are, in fact, to break the back of the problem that we have in terms of attracting doctors to rural and regional Australia. I have to say up front that there will not be much benefit at all to my constituency for some five or six years from this program because, with regard to the bonded scholarship program, obviously it will take at least five or six years, possibly seven years, before we actually have graduates emerging from this program. SoI think that something needs to be done in the interim to try to boost the number of doctors we have in constituencies like mine.",147,Representatives Main Committee
266,Mr Zahra,"I point out to the chamber that this is the second time that I have beenWednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20827 There has been a lot of talk about the rural doctor retention scheme and what a great thing it is for providing an incentive to doctors to practise in rural and regional areas. I have mentioned previously the problems that I have with the rural doctor retention scheme, in particular as it relates to my constituency. I remember well the discussions I had with the Central West Gippsland Division of General Practice, which wrote to me over concerns they had about the criteria which the Department of Health and Aged Care used to determine which areas would get access to the rural doctor retention scheme. It is worth mentioning again, in the context of this debate, the basis on which the Department of Health and Aged Care decided that almost no areas in my constituency would get access to the rural doctor retention scheme. It decided that on the basis that Moe had a large public hospital, that it assumed that there was a 40-bed hospital in a population centre called Thomson and that Traralgon had two public hospitals-one for acute illness and one for mental illness. I point out for the information of the chamber that Traralgon had its public hospital closed by the Kennett government, that Traralgon had its psychiatric public hospital closed by the Kennett government, that Moe had its public hospital closed by the Kennett government and that, to the best of my knowledge, there has never been a population centre named Thomson in my constituency. Certainly there has never been a 40-bed public hospital in this imaginary place called Thomson in my constituency. I can only assume they are talking about the Thomson Dam works area and, to the best of my knowledge, there has never been a 40-bed public hospital there. This was the basis on which the Department of Health and Aged Care decided that only some tiny areas of my very large constituency would be able to access the rural doctor retention scheme. So, whilst we have heard government members get up and talk about how this is part of a package and that bonded scholarships are just part of a series of different things the government are doing to try to get more doctors into rural and regional areas, can I point out that we in my constituency get almost no benefit from at least one of those areas that members have pointed to-the rural doctor retention scheme-because of the obviously flawed basis of flawed decision making by the Department of Health and Aged Care. I mentioned before that this debate needs to be viewed from a larger perspective. Those of us who represent rural areas know that we do not just have trouble getting doctors; we have trouble getting other health professionals, such as nurses and pharmacists, and people in other professions as well, such as teachers and people in senior positions within organisations. So to the extent that the government has now accepted that it is constitutional to offer this type of scholarship and that that is now an okay thing and the member for Jagajaga was right when she proposed that some years ago, I encourage the government to examine the application of rural bonded scholarships to other areas where similar shortages exist in rural and regional areas. For my part, the only way this can be a success is for governments to devolve part of their decision making to organisations such as the Central West Gippsland Division of General Practice-and other local organisations in electorates like mine-which are able to provide accurate advice about the needs of the local community, as opposed to the obviously flawed advice which the Department of Health and Aged Care, with its centralised bureaucracies in capital cities across Australia, is providing to the minister and which he is obviously using as a basis for his decision making. As I have pointed out, you can get no better example of that than the flawed basis on which the Department of Health and Aged Care decided to grant hardly any areas in my constituency access to the rural doctor retention scheme. The only way to make that work in a real way is to devolve decision making to bodies closer to the people who live in those communities so that we can identify our needs for doctors, pharmacists and other health professionals and we can look at ways to respond accordingly, using a range of 20828 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 different programs put in place by the federal government such as the rural doctor retention scheme and bonded scholarships, to try to meet the needs of our district. That is something we would very much welcome in my constituency. One of the things I like most about this bit of legislation is that it is all about getting students to understand up-front, early on, that we as taxpayers are providing them with a pretty wonderful start in life. They are getting off to a pretty good start by being enrolled in a course in medicine at some of the best universities not just in Australia but probably internationally. So, by putting this scholarship up-front, people understand that they too have obligations-that, in terms of the amount of taxpayers’ money that goes into the provision of courses they undertake, they need to put something back into the community they belong to. Doctors, radiologists, other people in the medical profession and all the other professional people have obligations to the community as well. They benefit from all the money we put into universities to provide them with world-class facilities. They have to understand that they need to put something back into the community-not just at Toorak or Armadale where they live, or Glen Eira or any of those places, but into areas such as those that I represent, like the Latrobe Valley, which is doing it tough right now, West Gippsland and the smaller rural towns that make up my constituency-not to mention places in the western suburbs which are suffering from dislocation and which have difficulty in getting medical professionals as well. These people need to understand what we are putting into their education and that we expect something back. I think that for the first time it is actually explicit in this legislation that these people are getting $100,000 or thereabouts from us on the explicit understanding that we have an expectation about what they are going to do in return-that is, that they will go and work in a rural area for a period of five or six years. That is a good thing; I think that is something which we need to see more of. All of those people in the medical profession who are resisting this, who think this is a bad thing, will be all the better for having had the experience of working in a rural and regional area. I think it will be a good thing for them. In fact, I am sure that it will be a life-changing experience for them. I am continually amazed when I speak to people from Sydney and Melbourne. I try to explain to them where I live. I say, ‘I live in Traralgon in the Latrobe Valley,’ and they ask, ‘Where’s that?’ I say, ‘It’s about two hours east of Melbourne,’ and I can see their eyes glaze over. Whenever you describe a location outside of Melbourne it is too hard for them to understand-either you live in the city or you do not. And, when it comes to Australia, the only cities in which so many people from the inner city areas are interested in, it seems, are Melbourne and Sydney. I think we have to change that. If we are going to prosper as a nation, we have to make sure that people understand all the various parts of Australia which make up the great place that Australia is. Australia is not made up of Melbourne and Sydney; it is made up of places like the areas that I represent and the rural and regional areas that so many other people in this House look after. To the small extent that this program of bonded scholarships will provide opportunities for people to go out into rural and regional Australia and see the rest of Australia-parts of Australia that they would never experience growing up in the inner city-is a wonderful thing, and it is something which we need to see more of. I welcome also the provisions in this bill that provide for the Commonwealth to enforce the bond-that is, to take action against those people who seek to get out of their obligations. The Commonwealth needs to have a firm hand in dealing with this, and I do not think it is a place for too kind a heart. People getting support from the Commonwealth have to understand that they need to put something back in. Over the past six or 12 months we have had a discussion about mutual obligations, and it seems to me that bonded scholarships are a practical demonstration of that concept. Mutual Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20829 obligations should apply not just to single mothers on low incomes who are doing it tough in regional areas such as my electorate but to people who are beginning their careers in medical schools in Melbourne or Sydney. They will understand that they are receiving support from the Commonwealth and must give something back in the same way that those who are out of work or who receive some type of welfare payment understand that they must avail themselves of training and educational opportunities so that they can contribute even more to our community. It cuts both ways. I appeal to the government to consider implementing a scheme for other health professionals that is at least reasonably similar to the scheme in this legislation. We hear much talk about the importance of attracting doctors to rural and regional Australia. There are many reasons for that. As I said before, we need not only doctors but pharmacists, podiatrists and medical specialists. In the non-health related professions we need more specialist teachers and those who constitute the skilled engineering and technical base in heavy industry. It seems to me that the health profession attracts the most attention because it is well organised. Let’s face it: the AMA is one of the most powerful unions in Australia and the Royal Australasian College of General Practice comprises people with very high levels of education, which has been paid for by the Commonwealth. I do not want to be classist-you know me, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, I would never do that-but these are the professional classes and they are extremely well organised and well educated. That is why they are having quite a bit of success pointing out the difficulties they face in attracting doctors to rural and regional areas. The other professions that I have mentioned should not be excluded from our consideration. In talking about this legislationwhich I think heads in the right direction in terms of introducing bonded scholarships and enforcing them-we must be open-minded and consider the inclusion, perhaps at a later date, of more general services in rural and regional areas. I make this point because doctors living in rural and regional Australia have particular concerns about the educational opportunities for their children. We cannot provide good levels of educational opportunity without good teachers. Specialist teachers must live in those areas. Doctors require additional incentives to live in rural and regional Australia and we should offer similar incentives to specialist teachers and those who work in other health related professions. I support the essence of the bill and the amendments foreshadowed by the honourable member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister for health. (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 and to speak briefly about its implications for regional electorates such as mine. As honourable members will be aware from the contributions of previous speakers, the point of the bill is to provide 100 new medical students with $20,000 a year to study medicine on the condition that they agree to work in a rural community for six years upon completion of their medical training. The scheme will deliver 100 doctors annually to work in rural communities and will make a tangible difference once the first 100 students complete their studies. It is easy to say that government should encourage a knowledge nation and, in the process, make motherhood statements that have no substance. It is much harder to tell regional and rural Australia that the government does not have-and cannot hope to have-all the answers but that we are prepared to try to make a difference. Making a difference is what the federal government’s budget is all about. Committing half a billion dollars to fostering regional and rural health is an achievement. It is a comprehensive plan that focuses on attracting to rural and remote Australia not only doctors but a range of allied professionals and services. The general problem that rural and regional Australia experiences can in part be attributed to long-term economic trends that would have occurred and will occur beyond the control of",148,Representatives Main Committee
267,Mr Prosser (Forrest) (11.43 A.m.),"I rise to support the Health Insurance Amendment20830 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 government. These trends, including mechanisation, have meant that Australia’s population has shifted. Whereas at the turn of the century two-thirds of Australia’s population lived in rural areas, now just over one-third live in regional areas. Of that one-third, only 15 per cent work off the land. The life expectancy of men and women in rural areas is four years shorter than that of their city counterparts, they have a 15 per cent higher risk of coronary heart disease and their death rates from injury are up 22 per cent. The starkest statistic is that for every 1,000 people in the city there is one doctor whereas in the regional areas just outside the metropolitan areas there are 1,500 people to one doctor. Of course, some communities do not have a doctor at all. And that is what this bill is all about. The $562 million dedicated to health in rural and regional Australia is the largest ever effort to correct the imbalance between city and rural areas. To increase the range of allied health professionals, the government is committing $49.5 million in order to increase the range of allied services such as nurses, psychologists and podiatrists. Geographic distances have always exacerbated health problems. It can take weeks to gain an appointment with a GP-it could be several hundred kilometres per round trip-and understandably people put off going to see their GP about minor problems. Often these minor problems become major. Over four years $48.4 million will be committed to providing rural specialists through an outreach program and $10.2 million will be committed to providing support to rural doctors in their regions, particularly those who are newly arrived. The key to making a difference is to ensure that these reforms and funding measures make a difference not just now but in the long term. That is why the government is committing $162 million in this package to further the training and educational needs of doctors and medical graduates. Nine new clinical schools will be established and $68.9 million will top up the successful regional health services program and enable 85 extra communities to access health services in this way. There will be $30.8 million provided for aged care facilities, $30.3 million for revitalising bush nursing and $41.6 million for assistance to pharmacies to start up and stay in business in areas of special need. The bill examines the area of doctors and health but it is not the only issue to be grappled with. The state government is attempting to arrest the drift of dentists from regional Australia to metropolitan areas and a private school in my electorate is having difficulty attracting a teacher because of perceived uncertainties in that town. I think the key-whether we are addressing health issues or just the population decline in general-is education. According to the Department of Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, students in remote and regional areas-comprising one-third of all school studentsconstitute only 17 per cent of tertiary students in Australia. Despite the number moving from 40,000 students in 1990 to 119,000 today, it is still not enough. I think we can begin to solve these entrenched problems when kids from these towns can make it to university, complete their studies, and then go back to practise in the communities in which they grew up. I very deliberately separate being accepted and completing university studies because often kids from regional and rural Australia are equally as bright and committed as their metropolitan counterparts but do not make it to their third year of study. I want to bring to the Main Committee’s attention the situation of the Margaret River Senior High School. Margaret River has a retention rate of kids completing year 12, which in WA is the final year of schooling, in the range upwards of 92 per cent and an acceptance rate at university of 89.4 per cent. This would be an excellent result for metropolitan schools. For a regional school it is nothing short of remarkable. I was asked to open some new facilities at Margaret River Senior High School recently and at a meeting afterwards I asked them how they had achieved such excellent results. The answer was not surprising-innovation and community support. The school has on its board Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20831 the parents, teachers and administrators. The level of dialogue and the trust between the school and the teachers are something to marvel at. Parents are involved in all levels of decision making and its devolution to a point that is an advance of the state government’s legislation. I have to say it gets results. The broader school community is also closely involved and interested and has invested in the school and, as such, the students feel support no matter what they choose, whether it is university or TAFE. The school is currently working with Curtin, Edith Cowan University and the South Metropolitan College of TAFE to set up a Centre of Wine Excellence where students from schools and others can gain recognised training in what is clearly a relevant industry area. The problem that students have is that when they go on to university, they find it financially difficult. They become homesick and losing the close support from the community means that they struggle and, ultimately, it contributes to a higher drop-out rate. I find it somewhat concerning-indeed I have raised the matter and some possible solutions with the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I raise this example here in this debate because, if these kids from Margaret River were graduating as the engineers, architects and doctors that they start out wanting to be and can be, then I am certain that many would return to the areas where they have spent their formative years and ultimately rejuvenate rural and regional areas. Finally, I want to touch on the AMA President Kerryn Phelps’s comments that the sanctions in this bill are too tough. The sanctions are that where a medical practitioner breaches the contract, Medicare benefits will not be payable in respect of any professional services that he or she may have rendered on his or her behalf and Medicare benefits will not be payable for either twice the period of time agreed in the contract by the medical practitioner-that is, 12 years-or for the shorter period determined by the contract. For each medical student who enters this contract-and remember they do so voluntarily, presumably with the desire to work in rural and regional Australia-the Commonwealth will make a $120,000 investment in their education. The Commonwealth has a right to ensure that the medical practitioner will uphold their end of the deal. For non-compliance the disincentive must be a financial one. These sanctions make practical and economic sense. The government cannot implement a valuable initiative and hope to have doctors holding up their end of the bargain without a carrot and stick approach. I support the government’s initiative to ensure that there are doctors in rural and remote areas, and I have enthusiastically supported the government’s overall $500 million health package for rural and regional Australia. I am therefore pleased to commend this bill to the House. Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (11.53 a.m.)-Living in a regional city with an electorate that spans many small rural communities, the problems of numbers of doctors, or the lack of them, has been a constant and serious issue. We recognise through our own experience just how desperately we require a comprehensive policy with regard to training and incentives to encourage rural and regional practices. The Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 seeks to introduce the government’s Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme announced in the May budget. It sets aside $32.4 million per year to create scholarships which will be offered to new medical students. In return, these students will commit to practising in a rural area for a period of six years at the completion of their training. The scholarship will be a taxable amount of $20,000 per year, with the student still responsible for HECS and, of course, expenses. The participants will be obliged to spend six continuous years in a rural area within 12 months of obtaining fellowship of a recognised college or within 17 years of commencing their medical course. I must confess that the announcement of bonded scholarships by the government did come as a bit of a shock to many of us because it was one that the minister did not support when the concept formed part of ALP policy. On 10 September 1998, in a press release, the minister stated: 20832 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 The scholarships are probably unconstitutional due to the limitation in section 51 preventing civil conscription of doctors. I hasten to point out, though, that the ALP policy required an agreement to work for the number of years for which the scholarship was accepted, and not the defined six-year prescription that is set out in this bill. This meant that if a student accepted a scholarship for only two years of their training, they would have been required to work in rural areas for only two years. We believed this would make the scheme significantly more attractive. The bond as set out in the bill that is before the House will be enforceable by section 19ABA in the form of restricted access to Medicare. Should you fail to complete your course or fail to commit to work in a rural area for the required service time, you will be in breach and will be required to either repay the amount with interest or fail to have Medicare access for a specified period of time, unless you fail, or choose not to get vocational registration and decide to stay as a medical officer within the public hospital system. I also note that the bill fails to identify the interest application. We have indicated our support for this bill but I wish to highlight a couple of concerns. The legislation makes some mention of exemptions and waivers but as yet we have no real idea of the exact nature of the contract that will be entered into and no real knowledge of the extent of or criteria relating to the minister’s ability to waive the ban on Medicare access, other than perhaps exceptional circumstances. I am concerned that the minister of the day may deem exceptional circumstances to be somewhat different. Will it be family illness? Will it be family responsibilities? I look forward to the deliberations on this bill in the other place shedding some light on the dark or perhaps missing patches of these contracts. I also note that the legislation requires six years of continuous service in a rural area and question what provision is made for those who choose at that stage of their life to commence a family and access their right to parental leave. Tasmania has one of the most highly decentralised populations in the country, with nearly 60 per cent of people living outside of the capital city of Hobart. Currently, in Tasmania, the definition of ‘rural’ under the RAM classification index will see this program extend everywhere outside of Hobart and Launceston, although the bill refers to the definition of ‘rural’ which applies at the time of signing the contract rather than the current RAM classification, so we will obviously be monitoring any changes to the definition. One of my concerns is that Hobart and Launceston already have significant problems with a low number of practising GPs. It is a common situation in Launceston, for instance, for many doctors to have already closed off their lists and no longer accept new patients. This is an area that will receive no benefit from this program-a program that I understand was initially proposed for both rural and regional areas by the Deputy Prime Minister. The program will offer 100 new scholarships each year. I would be interested to know whether they are for current student places or whether it indicates an increase in student numbers through additional places. Given that the normal practice for Tasmania whenever federal allocation in this area is made means that we get about 2.5 per cent of the allocation, we are probably looking at two or maybe three doctors a year in 2012. That does not go a very long way towards addressing the current problem. It is also contingent on getting young doctors to sign up and say, ‘Yep, that’s right, in 17 years this is the position that I will be in.’ It is not a commitment that a lot of young people are in a position to make. My concern is that young doctors cannot in any way be said to have embraced this scheme. The Australian Medical Students Association have said that such scholarships will do nothing to aid rural health. In particular, their concern was that the option would probably only be taken up by those with an existing interest in rural practice, thereby failing to target additional students. I support the concept of requiring rural practising and feel that it is a Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20833 valuable step in the professional career development of doctors, but I am not convinced that the application of this bill will necessarily meet that need. I am concerned that some GPs might re-evaluate their position after completing years at medical school, a year at a teaching hospital and four years of vocational registration, and decide that perhaps a further six-year commitment in a rural area is beyond them. This needs to be coupled with the manner of addressing the perceived disadvantages of rural practice. It needs to work within a comprehensive system and not be seen as the sole answer, albeit the 2012 answer. The Australian Medical Students Association have indicated that using lucrative pecuniary interest as a sole incentive fails to capitalise on the many positive aspects of rural and remote Australia. As members would be aware, rural areas are competing with the perceived disadvantages of rural practice and against those struggling urban areas. It is a limited resource to go around a very large part of Australia. The disadvantages are seen as not having immediate access to accident and emergency departments, lots of after hours work and a concern about the practice’s financial liability. The minister might say that the latter is addressed by grants but that does not make the practice independently viable. Another concern I have centres around the failure to focus on the full-time equivalent positions when we look at medical work force deficiencies and targets. I note that the department has not given full-time equivalent numbers since the minister was caught out last year claiming a 7.2 per cent leap in rural doctor numbers which, on a full-time equivalent basis, turned out to be a 0.4 per cent increase. The minister is very keen to talk about the number of new doctors trained but does not necessarily equate that to the number of new doctors working a full-time load. It does not accurately reflect the nature of the practice of medicine anymore. It refers to a time when quality of life was not quite as large an issue for GPs and they would often work up to 18 hours a day. Many doctors now choose to job share, with one full-time equivalent position being filled by two, three or even four doctors. There is one practice in TasmaniaI am aware of where nine of the positions make up only five full-time equivalent workloads. The minister must draw his attention to the outcomes and reality in practice as well as his perception of operation. Many young doctors in urban areas are providing an integrated network with other allied professionals, and we need to be ensuring that rural health policy concentrates on the extension of the positioning of the rural practices that other professionals, such as pharmacists, often depend upon. While speaking about other health services, I cannot ignore the crisis in dental health. When the government ripped $55.6 million from the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme in 1996-97, scrapping the scheme altogether, it signed the death warrant for rural dental services. Many private services relied on their public workload for viability. The loss of this workload has made businesses unviable and meant the removal of dental services in rural areas. I hope the minister spends some time turning his mind to this rural crisis as well. The opposition have indicated their support for this bill. We have flagged amendments, which will be moved in the other place, in relation to the clarification of terms of the contracts and the calculation of interest rates. One of my major concerns, however, still centres around the lack of consultation with those young people crucial to the success or otherwise of this scheme-those young people who will be potentially taking up these scholarships; those young people who we really hope will choose to practise in rural areas. I am not totally convinced that this scheme will resolve all of our problems, but I truly hope that there will be some impact. This issue is far too important to rural areas to let it fall over. Unfortunately, on its own, I do not think it is enough, certainly not for Tasmania. I urge the government to expand its view on this issue and look at negating the perceived disadvantages of rural practice and the extension of other health services. I urge the 20834 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 government to acknowledge the true extent of this problem and investigate the broad range of solutions which rural Australians and, indeed, regional urban Australians need. Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000, enthusiastically support it and commend the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Dr Michael Wooldridge, for another great initiative. I think his contribution as Australia’s minister for health over the last four years has been outstanding, and he deserves to be commended very strongly by this parliament for his work. It is a very complex and difficult portfolio. It was regarded as the graveyard of politicians years ago. Michael Wooldridge has turned it around, and I hope that he will continue to be the minister in that portfolio for a long time to come. We have been looking forward to the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 for a long time, because it delivers the Howard government’s initiative and strategy that we would do all we could to attract more doctors and better services to rural and regional communities in Australia. We all know stories about the difficulty of attracting rural doctors. We know the burnout problems of rural doctors. We know that when they look at retirement or, unfortunately, have a health problem themselves they find it is almost impossible to find doctors to buy their practice and to assist them. This has been of great concern not only to members of parliament but also to rural communities. The bill aims to address that and should be read as part of the total mosaic of the strategy by the Howard government to address a number of issues in rural health in Australia. The bill provides for the creation of 100 new medical school places in universities in Australia for Australian medical students commencing next year. The students who will qualify will receive a grant of $20,000 per year. Those of us who live in the country who have had children at university recently or who do have children at university will have a good understanding of the huge cost incurred by country families in trying to get a university education for their children in the capital cities. The $20,000 grant is very generous, quite frankly, and one that I think will act as a great incentive to attract suitable students to apply. The grants are taxable, but are not subject to a means test. The condition of the grant and the scholarship is that the students agree to practise in rural areas of Australia for six years on completion of their basic medical training and postgraduate training. The bill provides for enforcement provisions and penalties for a breach. The idea of providing penalties for a breach and the idea of requiring the students to bond themselves to work for six years is very reasonable. After all, it is taxpayers who are contributing to their education and training. I have not heard from any member of my electorate, or from any medical person, any criticism of the bonding and contracting arrangements. Indeed, I have been quite encouraged. The other day a doctor in Albury-Wodonga was proud to tell me that his daughter was applying for one of these scholarships. He was confident that she would get it and that this was a matter of great happiness in that family which was having difficulty in addressing the question of encouraging their child to go into medicine. The universities will select the scholarship holders through the normal medical school admission process. Students, I understand, will apply to the universities through their medical schools for the bonded scholarships and for a place in the medical school in that university. Students are able to express their interest virtually now for the 2001 medical courses. The legislation must pass this parliament before the end of this current year. It is absolutely important that all the parties in this House and in the Senate get on with it and ensure that this legislation is passed. There are many young people, and many universities, anxious to have the legislation enacted so that we can start to promote this particular scheme and get it under way.",151,Representatives Main Committee
268,Mr Lieberman (Indi) (12.02 P.m.),"I wish to briefly comment on the Health InsuranceWednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20835 The idea of the scholarship, of course, is based on pure common sense, that if the student who is bonded is obliged to work for the minimum period of six years after graduating in a rural and regional area, it is more likely, because of life, that that person will become attached to the community. Who knows, Cupid might strike, and instead of falling in love with a person from one of the big metropolitan areas we hope that the recently graduated doctor will follow his or her instincts and Cupid’s arrow and find someone in the country. That obviously helps to organise the family’s future because we all know that if a son or a daughter marries someone who has not had any life experience in rural and regional Australia-is a city person-it is harder sometimes for them to make that change. Most of them succeed, might I add. If anyone is listening to this and thinks it is not a good idea to move from the city to the country, let me assure you that once you do it you never look back. Nevertheless, it is important to get the recently graduated doctor into the community. This legislation is part of a mosaic of initiatives by the Howard government, and I think they are really working well. With the new community primary care health policy the government has set aside $560 million to address health issues in the country. I have been working recently with the smaller hospitals, some of them non-profit, the famous bush nursing hospitals of Victoria. They have been facing closure because of a lot of problems. However, they are now finding a new direction, a new life. For example, now that the Walwa Bush Nursing Hospital in my electorate has a future, because of a grant from the federal government and with the assistance of the Victorian state government-I acknowledge, as well, the partnership between Commonwealth and state-the three doctors in Walwa have decided that they have a future and can stay in Walwa and continue to practise. So the spin-off is starting to work with this $562 million regional health strategy. I would particularly like to acknowledge that-and we have been in government for only a little over four years-the Howard government’s commitment to Medicare has been sincere, despite the difficulties. We would like to put more money in. We all know that we would like to put more money into health, but it is a bottomless pit in a way. We have increased the funding for the states by 25 per cent in real terms. That is not a bad effort after having inherited approximately $13 billion of deficit. spent more than it earned, increased taxes at record levels and yet charged up to the credit card some of the recurrent expenses. It was totally irresponsible. Furthermore, it had some $90 billion of government borrowing at a frightening rate in the last three or four years. If you look at the graph, it would have sent this country into poverty with the Asian financial crisis that followed after the Howard government was elected. Without the initiatives of the Howard government in managing the economy and addressing these things, we would not have withstood so well the crisis in Asia. The rural health policies include the work force agencies incentives, the rural women’s flyin, fly-out GP service, the John Flynn scholarships for rural placements, and new university departments of rural health-to name just a few. I commend this bill to the House. I call on members of parliament from all parties in the House of Representatives and the Senate to pass it speedily so that the universities can put in place the necessary procedures so that students can apply and become part of this great scheme. member for Indi, a decent bloke who knows that this is a major problem in rural and regional Australia.

271,Mr Horne (Paterson) (12.11 P.m.),"Firstly, let me express my disappointment with the20836 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 vital to the survival of many rural communities. I represent an electorate that would be regarded as rural, but it is hardly remote. Most of it is within an hour’s drive of a major city. I am talking about cities like the city of Newcastle with the John Hunter Hospital, a teaching hospital and the faculty of medicine at Newcastle University or the city of Taree, which also has a regional hospital. So it is hardly remote but we do have the problem of attracting doctors to those towns. I noted yesterday-and we could hardly help note-the Minister for Health and Aged Care coming in to the House in a very childish manner, gloating and saying that the ALP had done a backflip over its policy on or its attitude to the private health insurance rebate. So be it. If that is the best way that the minister can see to spend $2 billion a year without creating any resolution of this major problem or without reducing waiting lists in public hospitals, so be it. I congratulate the government on accepting as policy a proposal that was put forward by the Hon. Michael Lee before the 1998 federal election. Make no mistake, this policy of giving scholarships to doctors was an ALP proposal. It was put forward by Michael Lee. I have here the press release he put out and it is dated 10 September 1998. I am prepared to accept that Michael Lee did that and that the government has accepted it in good faith. We will work together to make sure that it does work. There are a few things that I believe we have to look at because it is not only the case of an incentive and a punishment. There is far more than that behind the fact that young doctors do not want to go into rural and remote Australia. One is the rapid advancement of medical technology. If you are out of the loop of being near a training hospital or a medical school by being out in a remote area for five to six years, then you can be out of the loop of receiving the information. That is one of the reasons why ambitious young doctors do not want to go to the country. If they have high hopes of being a surgeon, of specialising, they want to stay near the hospital so that they have access to that information, because they know that after five or six years out there, when they come back, the quantum gap is just too big to jump. I believe that we need to have some system to allow doctors access back to medical school. It may be for refresher courses; it may take a couple of weeks or a month a year, but we need to ensure that they can find out what they have been missing out on. I do not say this in any sexist manner at all, but I believe that something like 60 per cent of the first-year intake at medical school comprises females. As I go around my electorate, I can count the number of female GPs on one hand. They are not there. Yet the majority that went into medical school were women. It is not a sexist attitude; it is a fact of life that, after they finish university, they get married. Perhaps they marry someone whom they met at university and they will locate in the city and probably be part-time medicos. I do not know what the reason is. I believe that is something that we also need to address. It is going to be extremely difficult. When you live in a democratic society such as ours, you cannot deny people access to medical school. The amazing thing is that, in a small community-and I am talking about a village in my electorate-I recently spoke to a female medical practitioner. She had been a partner in a bigger practice in the city of Maitland. She decided that she wanted to try something different. She and her husband bought a block of land-her husband is not a medical practitioner-in this village, adjacent to where they live. They built a brand new, beautiful surgery. It is a credit to them. She hung up her shingle. I spoke to her a couple of weeks ago at a presentation-she is also a soccer coach-and she told me she has been inundated with people from the surrounding localities. They are coming to a new practice because it is a practice with a female doctor. These are the sorts of good news stories that you occasionally stumble on. Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20837 However, I mention other communities-towns like Dungog. Dungog, for the uninitiated, is 45 minutes from Newcastle, and the town where I reared my family. At that time, 15 years ago, in that town there were five doctors and a hospital. Today, there are two, and both of them have been advertising for the past couple of years to try to interest young people to come there as partners. They are not interested. The number of doctors remains at two. I mention a town like Bulahdelah, in a beautiful place on the edge of the Myall Lakes National Park, on the Pacific Highway, 35 minutes from Taree and about an hour from Newcastle. It has a population of about 2,000, a hospital and one doctor. He is desperately trying to get out of the town. He wants to go to Sydney. His children attend school in Sydney but he cannot get anyone to look at the practice. Yet, money-wise, it is a very lucrative practice. I mention a small community like Karuah. Again, it is about half an hour from Newcastle, on the Pacific Highway. There is one doctor who went there to operate his practice part time. He recently had to have bypass surgery. He suffered pneumonia while he was in hospital. The practice was closed for a number of weeks and the community was without a doctor. These are stories that every member representing a rural community can tell. I do not believe that simply introducing a scholarship and a punishment is going to resolve it. It needs something far greater than that. I believe the rationalisation of practices works. Doctors want to know that they will not be on call every night of the week or every weekend. After all, they are human; they have families and they have the right to expect to have a family life. They are the problems that this parliament should address and which this legislation does not address particularly. This bill is purely about rewards and punishment. I will listen with interest to what other honourable members have to say in this area because we must work on it. Those of us who have lived in Australia’s rural communities know that they are worthwhile and valuable for families: they are wonderful places to rear children. However, it is a terrible situation for families and for young couples who want children. I have mentioned Dungog. The hospital building still stands, but mothers-to-be will not be allowed to have their babies there, except in emergencies; they will be transferred to Newcastle. That is the sort of problem that confronts general practitioners every day. I talked only yesterday to a doctor who told me that he pays annual insurance of $20,000 in order to safeguard himself against being sued for something that may go wrong during a medical procedure. If people are working long hours by themselves, the chance of something going wrong is heightened. That is why towns with a single doctor have very restricted medical services. The opposition is interested in working with the government to resolve this matter, which is vital to all rural and regional areas. I look forward to a positive outcome. I hope that the system will work-if we do not try, we will not know. However, we must ensure that this is only the start: we must keep working to resolve this important issue. Dr WASHER (Moore) (12.23 p.m.)-One brings a lot of life experience to one’s role as a parliamentarian, and this can sometimes prove invaluable when dealing with policy matters such as this. I feel it is important to contribute to the debate on the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000, which deals with the penalties involved with the new Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme. I support the scholarship scheme wholeheartedly. Aside from its obvious benefits for rural and remote areas-I do not think any honourable member disputes the problems we have attracting doctors to the bush-this scheme will offer a tremendous opportunity to 100 young Australians each year. I fully endorse the comments by the honourable member for Paterson. There will be future problems for these young people in the education system and they will need backup services. An ethos of education and culture must support this scheme. These people must be made to 20838 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 feel part of the community and enjoy the quality of life that they rightly deserve. In the west, where a growing number of female practitioners have come through the medical system, I shared the anxieties expressed about whether, because of their lifestyles, they would have the opportunity to commit to full-time medicine and would want to work in more remote sites. To my surprise, in Western Australia at least a lot of female doctors are going into remote bush areas and making a full-time work commitment. Sadly, I have observed that many of our male counterparts have slowed down in that regard. That is a pleasant sideline, but I support that anxiety. The scholarship provides for 100 places over and above what already exist in Australian universities for medical students. So there will be 100 new opportunities created to study medicine, with the extra benefit of having financial help. Students awarded these scholarships will receive $20,000 a year for the time it takes to complete their studies, on the condition that they agree to practise in rural areas upon the completion of basic medical training and postgraduate training. I can remember what a tremendous financial struggle it was, as a medical student, for the vast majority of my classmates and me while completing medical training. The offer of $20,000 a year on the proviso that I practise for six years in the bush would have been very attractive to me as a young man. I was also a farmer’s son. The fact that there have been more than 1,000 inquiries since the announcement of this scholarship just a few weeks ago speaks volumes. It is encouraging, so hopefully it is a scheme that will get people out there. But again, to reflect on what the member for Paterson said, without the backup educational facilities this scheme will not entirely work in its own right. The legislation we are dealing with here today looks at the penalties that make up a condition of this scholarship. If a doctor fails to meet his or her obligation to practise in the bush for a full six years, they will be banned from having a provider number for 12 years. I know that the AMA has labelled this penalty as draconian. That is an absolute nonsense. Yes, 12 years is a long time to be excluded from practising independently. But if you have entered into a contract where you have promised to practise in a rural area in return for receiving taxpayers’ money to support you through university, then you have to accept these boundaries. If the purpose of a penalty is to prevent a person from reneging on a deal, and it is not a sufficient deterrent, what is the point of the penalty in the first place? Those doctors who consider returning to the city to practise before the end of their six years as a mere lifestyle or career choice will not be sufficiently deterred if the penalty is simply that they have to repay the bond. This is especially so if they are coming to the city to practise for a particularly lucrative sum of money. That is not going to help the people in the bush and it will certainly be seen by the taxpayer as most unfair. I would hate to think that, after providing more than $100,000, non means tested, to a medical student as well as an additional place for them to become a doctor-not to mention the costs associated with training-the Australian community’s investment was shortchanged. We are out to fix a problem here. Giving doctors a soft option to return to the city, unless it were in extraordinary circumstances, would not fix that problem. Indeed, this would prove to be a very expensive and time consuming exercise without a decent penalty. There will be ministerial discretion if, for some important reason, like a very serious illness, a doctor has to return to the city. There is a safeguard. It is also worth noting that, even if a doctor does renege on the promise to work in the bush and loses their access to Medicare, there are other options they could take regardless. There are many things that a doctor can do without a provider number. They can work in a public hospital, for instance, or enter into education and training and research. Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20839 The AMA also argues that it is too much of a commitment for a young person to make in signing up for this scholarship. This is also nonsense. Aside from the obvious point that these students are already taking on a huge commitment by deciding to study medicine in the first place-these students are no strangers to the big decisions in life-I do not believe it is any more of an ask that they promise to pay back the community by working in the bush. The obligations that come with the scholarship will be clearly outlined before they enter into any contract. I think it is a tad condescending to say that these students are incapable of weighing up the pros and cons of this scholarship. The huge interest already displayed in the scheme reinforces this. The problem of attracting doctors to areas other than remote or regional is also worth noting. I would be most happy to see the scholarship extended to other areas where doctors are in short supply. I cannot see the difference between paying the scholarship in order for a doctor to commit to practise for six years in a country town like Meekatharra in Western Australia and paying the scholarship for a doctor to commit to practise for a time in outer metropolitan suburbs. These are areas with skyrocketing populations but few or no doctors. This is certainly the case in my electorate, which is by no means defined as rural or regional, but which suffers from many of the same problems of lack of infrastructure and essential services. A suburb known as Two Rocks, for example, has its one and only doctor leaving after six years of trying to attract a replacement. The ratio of doctor to patient was already around one to 5,000. And this is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. I am pleased that this area has now been recognised as an area of unmet need. Hopefully, we will have an overseas trained doctor there soon. It is important that we do not forget these areas when determining where these doctors on scholarship should work. Allowing overseas trained doctors to obtain provider numbers to work in rural and regional areas has already made a huge difference in my home state of Western Australia. This is another example of pragmatic, common sense policy that identifies the problems and offers real solutions. The medical rural bonded scholarships are another such measure. You could say it was a carrot and stick approach, but with an enormous carrot and a very small stick-or possibly even a twig. This is particularly true given the fact that these people may not have ever received the opportunity to study medicine without the scholarship. Doctors practising in rural areas have the opportunity to derive enormous benefits from their time in the bush. They usually emerge as highly skilled, well rounded practitioners. I would hope that, even after six years, many would feel part of their community and want to stay on. I am sure this would also be the hope of their rural patients and the community at large. I look forward to the first intake of these scholarship students and I commend the bill to the House. (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to exclude the payment of Medicare benefits where a medical practitioner has breached a contract to work in a rural or remote area. It is part of the implementation of the government’s Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme. Section 19 of the bill provides the legislative framework for the Commonwealth to enforce the bond. If the medical practitioner breaches the commitment to work in a rural or remote area, the Commonwealth will be able to restrict payment of Medicare benefits in respect of that practitioner’s services. Bonded practitioners in breach of a contract can have their Medicare benefit payments restricted for twice the period they agree to work in a rural or remote area-for example, 12 years. It will also make it an offence for a medical practitioner for whom a Medicare benefit is payable as a result of section 19 to render a professional service without first having taken steps to inform the patient that a Medicare benefit is not payable for the practitioner’s professional services.",157,Representatives Main Committee
272,Mr Adams (Lyons) (12.32 P.m.),"The purpose of the Health Insurance Amendment20840 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 The Labor Party adopted a health policy at the 1998 election which included a bonded scholarship scheme of $20,000 per year for up to 100 medical students. That required medical graduates to work in a rural area of need for the same number of years for which they had received the scholarships. The legislation determines that doctors’ bonded rural work does not begin until after their training has been completed. It is estimated that, on average, this would require doctors to work in rural areas for 12 years to fulfil their obligations to the Commonwealth. It is not clear from the legislation what the nature of the contract between the government and the doctors will be-for example, whether or not penalties could be varied in exceptional circumstances. I think the shadow minister may have received something from the minister, but that information has been locked up. She may have received something in recent times, but I certainly have not seen it. I have some real problems with this change in the way it is worded. I have been speaking to some rural doctors that are operating in the area now and who have been in the training area too and they have some really grave concerns. I suppose the most obvious point to make is that experience has shown that rewards, not necessarily financial, reap better results in recruitment and retention of rural doctors in the long term than penalties do. Rural training alone is not the answer-rural practice needs to be sustainable. If we go through this and look at the main issues, it can be seen that the length of time involved in the training of a young recruit is somewhere in the region of 17 years. At the age of 17 or 18, when most start, this is a terribly long time to commit oneself. They just do not know what they are letting themselves in for, personally or certainly professionally. Over 60 per cent of medical graduates are women and there is a great need for women GPs and specialists in rural areas. They would be far better targeted with incentives instead of being told, ‘If you default, you will lose your ability to act as a doctor.’ Anyway, who knows what rural practice will be like in 10 or 15 years time? Will they have a guaranteed income in a rural practice or will other government policies prevent this or be put in place? A 12-year moratorium is very severe. Surely training in rural areas could be included where this provides a service. Currently service provision is part of GPs’ training. Training is likely to move into rural areas over the next few years. It already occurs for a very few surgeons who are interested. Standards of education and training are not guaranteed. Noone knows yet how the new rural health clinical schools and new GP training programs are going to operate. Opportunities are growing with the new rural clinical schools and university departments of rural health, which give a choice of options. Not being able to get a Medicare rebate hits the community more than the doctors and is going to have more impact on GPs than specialists who have larger incomes anyway and are more able to pay their way out. Students from rural areas who are the ones most likely to become rural doctors are better off financially and without the time commitments, if they go for the RMS and can pay off HECS fees after graduating in rural areas. Students with bonded scholarships are not eligible for other scholarships so, once again, this is a disincentive. This is not a scheme that would attract rural origin doctors, unless they would not get into a medical course in the first place. It could be seen as supporting second-class doctors for the bush. Evidence is that rural origin and positive rural experience during training are the strongest factors in taking up rural careers. The current proposal for regionalisation of vocational training, converting a national program in a short period of time to many small regional programs, increases the risk of a lower standard of training. Standards of training need to be legislated too. Areas where it is difficult to attract doctors will always be difficult, and even more so in establishing appropriate training and supervision. Experience is that conscription Wednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20841 does not work. The Queensland state health cadetships were an absolute disaster for both the community and the doctor and, anecdotally, not many with cadetships continue as rural doctors. In the long term, education and training are only part of the answer to the rural crisis of health service delivery. We need to keep those doctors who are already there and to retain those who undertake conscription, and so there need to be rewards built into rural practice. So far, this has not been addressed well enough. There needs to be better professional and financial support for rural doctors. Paying rural GP specialists an additional fee is cheaper than paying specialists, yet quality of service by GPs is comparable. Apparently, the government has not debated the main provisions of this proposal out in the community with the rural doctors and the trainers. The doctors believe this legislation has a much broader application than just scholarship holders. The new GP registrars are signing up to rural training, with no declared ongoing commitments beyond training. So what is the hidden agenda? They are very worried by the implications. I would have thought those doctors in the government would have heard these alarm bells if they had been properly consulted. For example, there are over 200 new rural GP registrars who are committed to rural general practice and who have signed up with the understanding that, after training, they have no further commitments to rural general practice. Will this section now apply to them retrospectively? This has certainly not been flagged before. The fact that the bill makes no allowance for the circumstances in which a contract may be breached in exceptional circumstances is a worry. GPs who may need to cut short their contract for reasons such as personal illness, family tragedy, pregnancy or in other similar circumstance appear to have no rights. This goes totally against trying to increase the number of rural women doctors that are desperately needed. The percentage of women medical students is increasing. This needs to be taken into account for the rural medical work force, because they will help to keep it sustainable over time if they are happy to remain in their home rural areas. In certain of these exceptional circumstances, they may have to go back to a city for assistance, thus breaching the contract. The rural crisis in health is a crisis in health service delivery. However, there are anomalies in the various rural classifications currently developed. For example, rural areas are declared on city boundaries. Also there is an increasing problem in provincial and suburban areas, with very low doctor-patient ratios. Although the worse does need to be addressed first-rural and Aboriginal-any such longer term objectives need to address future needs rather than just current needs. This does not seem to have been built into the plan of the MRBS scheme or any other scheme. A commitment to working in areas of health service needs, as defined at the time, may be more appropriate. Doctors generally, and ideally all the other health professionals, need to be more engaged in the discussion of future health needs and solutions, rather than dealing with the here and now and being reactive to such proposals. There was a lack of consultation on the bill by this government. I am indebted for the professional advice on this discussion to a number of rural doctors, particularly Dr Strasser from the rural facility of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. She pointed out that we have to be more open in talking with doctors about the needs of local rural doctors before putting more barriers in their way. I know how difficult it is in Tasmania to get doctors to put their hands up to be there, and it is not because of the isolation or necessarily the pay. It is because they have no backup, often in highly stressful situations, for months at a time, and they get very little recognition from 20842 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 their city colleagues for the sort of wide ranging work they do-and we know of rural doctors working every weekend and being on call for up to a month, night and day. I would far rather consult a doctor in the country than one in the town if I did not know either of them. I know that country doctors are used to dealing with a much greater range of medical problems than their city counterparts. I think we have to clarify the nature of the contract between the government and the doctors and, if it is as restrictive as I believe it is, then it should be tossed out and reconsidered in the light of some incentives and ‘carrots’rather than a whole pile of sticks-to encourage students to go to the country. I understand that the Labor Party will be moving some amendments to this bill in the Senate. Again, this coalition government really wants to bash people more than to work through the issues and the problems that Australia has. It really is about saying, ‘We’ll bash you up if you don’t do as you’re told.’ That is their approach. Whether it is industrial relations or whatever, down that track they go. There is a need not just for doctors in rural and regional Australia but for lots of other health professionals as well. Those needs are not being addressed and they should be. There are many holes in that area in my electorate, and it takes a considerable amount of time to work through these issues. There are many doctors working long and hard on the east and west coasts and all through the middle of Tasmania, and they endeavour to give their best. We have new schemes applying to people who work for local councils. Local councils are now striking rates in their municipalities to raise the income to pay for some of the infrastructure for contracted doctors working for companies. There are difficulties in getting overseas doctors to fill in the holes. There are a lot of very difficult problems to be solved. Of course, it is not only in the health professions where we have those holes, Mr Deputy Speaker. As you would know, there are difficulties in getting professional people to fill holes in lots of other areas in regional Australia. But, because we are addressing health needs, that is where I had better stay, otherwise you will pull me up. The difficulties that we all have and that we have all seen in this health area relate to the pharmacy area as well. I have all sorts of arrangements in my electorate to enable pharmaceuticals to be delivered by the school bus, because that is the only transport these days into some of the valleys that I represent. Arrangements are put in place so that the prescriptions that pensioners need are sent in that way because their nearby chemist shop closed many years ago. Those sorts of difficulties need to be looked at. We need to find other solutions. I am finding that within the health area there are some very rigid rules and conditions which maybe we should look at. I am sure they are there for a good reason, but it is time maybe that we started to look at them in a new light to fulfil the need that is applying in some of our regional areas of Australia in today’s world. As I said, this bill is really about bashing people to achieve a goal. It sets out conscription on people which might be a contractual arrangement for 17 years and then you take away the Medicare ticket so they cannot get payment. Therefore, working as a doctor would be pretty difficult because you would probably work for nothing. I do not think that is the solution. Hopefully, some of the amendments may get up in the Senate which may make this a much better bill and help us move towards a better health solution for Australia. We will have the debate in the Senate and we will work through some of the issues that the minister has not bothered doing with the health professionals of Australia, as he should have done. If he had done that, we would be much further down the track with this legislation being a solution to the problem and not, as I said, a bill to bash people about the head with and make them stay somewhere where they probably do not want to be. contributors to this debate on the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area",161,Representatives Main Committee
273,Mr Lawler (Parkes) (12.52 P.m.),"As I listened to some of the comments made byWednesday, 4 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20843 Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000, it became clear to me that there are many people who are not conversant with the act and what is intended by the government. MightI say that in my time at university I would not have minded being bashed with a $120,000 grant to assist me getting through university. It would have been most welcome, and I am sure that many of the medical students I went through university with would have welcomed that as well. It is important to note at this time that the scholarships we are talking about are extra scholarships; they are not taking up places that are offered to medical students now. There are 100 new places. So if we took this scholarship away we would have exactly the same situation as we have had for the last several years-certainly for the 13 years that the opposition was in government. I do not think it is a legitimate argument to say that we are coercing people and using threats. It is an extra provision, something that we are offering to young people that they can take up if they so desire. If they do not, they will have exactly the same opportunities that they have today to study medicine. I understand that the draft contract has been provided to the shadow spokesperson for health and so members opposite would have seen that it does contain details of a student’s obligation and it does contain a provision for a waiver of the obligation at the minister’s discretion, something that I do not think is clear to those opposite in some cases. As a resident of regional Australia, and as a representative of western New South Wales, I would like to wholeheartedly back this government’s outstanding and ongoing effort to address the doctor shortage in country areas. This strategy, amongst several to boost doctor numbers and ensure that the increase is a direct benefit for rural and remote areas in terms of more GPs, addresses the primary concern of country people. A couple of weeks ago on a 2,500 kilometre tour of part of my Parkes electorate I visited six towns in succession and none of those had a doctor, a pharmacist, a vet or a physiotherapist. Certainly, those towns were served magnificently by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. These were not two-horse hamlets on the desert fringe, but substantial communities like Ivanhoe, Wilcannia, White Cliffs, Tibooburra, Wanaaring and Enngonia. The crisis is such that even in major regional cities such as Dubbo, GPs are not accepting new patients into their lists and the patients of a GP who leaves the city often find it very difficult to get access to another GP. With doctors ageing or relocating to areas with less gruelling workloads, the situation is deteriorating and fuelling the perception that setting up a practice in a regional area is a career sidestep for health professionals. The profound absence of doctors feeds upon itself and doctors are understandably hesitant to take on the workload as the only resident GP for hundreds of kilometres. It must be said, as I mentioned earlier, that the Royal Flying Doctor Service has played an invaluable role in making up the shortfall in access to health services for whole swathes of outback Australia. Again, I commend this government on committing $4½ million to setting up another Royal Flying Doctor Service base operating out of Dubbo. It is yet again showing the concern that this government has for delivering medical services to rural and regional Australia. This government certainly has earned the right to say it is turning the tide on the issue of health services for people in regional areas. This year’s budget contained an unprecedented strategy to improve the quality of health services in country regions, with a special, but not exclusive, emphasis on providing more doctors. The previous speaker mentioned that it was a stick approach. Look at some of the carrot approaches that this government has taken in the last four years that it has been in government: introducing the John Flynn scholarships which encourage medical students to spend time in the country, and introducing the RAMA scholarships which are exclusively offered to country students-scholarships of $10,000 a year. None of that was in place before. There are the carrots of the GP incentive program, where grants are made to GPs relative to 20844 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 October 2000 the isolation of their practice and the length of time that they have practised there; the money provided through the divisions of GPs for training support, locum relief and the rural clinical schools, one of which has already been set up in Wagga; and the promise of nine new clinical schools throughout regional Australia. Some of the previous speakers alluded to the fact that it is not enough purely to train more doctors. The important thing is that we get them to train in a rural community where they learn the benefits of living and residing in that community so we will have that carrot approach when they see that it is a very pleasant way of life. But with the combination of programs and scholarships, this government showed its determination to alleviate the shortage in the short term through initiatives like the rural placement program and in the long term through the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme. The immediate success of a rural placement program, which places graduate GPs in country areas for six months as part of the Royal College of General Practitioners training program, is evidenced by the increase by 25 per cent in the number of GPs available in my home town of Dubbo. Effectively, the number has gone up from about 24 to 30. We still have problems, but a 25 per cent increase in the last couple of years, due to the policies of this government, is no mean feat. A further four new GPs are operating in the district outside Dubbo in what represents a real improvement for the people in the area in terms of the actual number of GPs with whom they can get appointments. I understand that the GP practices that provide the training for the registrars in these training programs are now being seen as leaders in the rural areas and other GPs are seeking for their practices to be training accredited practices. This will again expand the service to rural areas. I would like to see it in the practice, for example, in Cobar which I understand is very interested in this option. This endeavour to create more opportunities for people to train as doctors, with $20,000 annually in taxpayers’ assistance on the condition that they serve six years in a rural area, represents the long-term element of this diverse strategy. As this scholarship scheme places more new graduates into country areas for their obligatory six-year term, the non-metropolitan medical fraternity will experience a surge in the number of young, vibrant personnel. More country doctors and a general swelling of the ranks of health professionals, combined with recent technological advances to keep health workers informed and interactively linked to colleagues elsewhere, along with the introduction of the rural clinical schools, will in turn help attract more such professionals to the country. In the same manner as the shortage of doctors fed upon itself to aggravate the problem, a rotating influx of 100 new GPs, year after year, will have a reciprocal effect, with the trend spreading from larger centres to smaller towns and so forth. It is all very well for the opposition to crow about ‘not enough’, ‘too much’, ‘it’s a bashing’ but if this program had been introduced 10 years ago, we would not have the issues that we are facing now. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Defence Force: Reservists (Question No. 1064) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister of Defence, upon notice, on 6 December 1999: (1) How many reservists from (a) Victoria, (b) NSW, (c) Western Australia and (d) other States are now serving on a temporary full-time basis with the component units of 7th Brigade in Brisbane. (2) For what period have the reservists been asked to serve on a full-time basis. (3) What proportion of these reservists were previously (a) full-time students, (b) unemployed, (c) employed in the public sector and (d) employed in the private sector. (4) In respect of those reservists who were (a) previously employed in the private sector and (b) previously employed in the public sector, what measures, if any, has the Government instituted to protect their civilian employment. (5) In regard to University and TAFE students what measures, if any, has the Government put in place to enable them to temporarily defer their studies without penalty. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s questions are as follows: (1)(a) Victoria 94 (b) NSW 12 (c) Western Australia 67 (d) Other States 80 (2) The length of the period of service that a reservist will perform is determined by the task for which the reservist has been engaged. The Directorate General Personnel Army and the reservist being engaged, agree to the period of service. (3)(a) Full-time students 79 (b) Unemployed 25 (c) Public Sector 41 (d) Private Sector 108 (4) (a) and (b) At present, protection is provided by the Defence (Re-Establishment) Act 1965 and Section 118A of the Defence Act 1903. These pieces of legislation provide penalties against an employer who: . hinders a person from serving in the Reserve Forces, . penalises a person on account of their service; . requires a person to take annual leave during periods of Reserve service; and . termination of a contract of employment due to Reserve service. The Defence (Re-Establishment) Act 1965 also provides for the rights of members upon resumption of employment following service. (5) The protection given by existing legislation does not apply to students. Australian Taxation Office: Gunton, Mr Mike (Question No. 1546) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 11 May 2000. (1) Has the Ministers attention been drawn to representations by my constituent, Mr Mike Gunton of Lorikeet Avenue, Ingleburn, NSW, to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) seeking an answer to a question Mr Gunton has been asking for approximately 16 years . (2) Has the ATO provided an answer to Mr Gunton’s question; if not, why not. (3) Did the ATO derive a tax bill of $ 99,000 for this moderately paid PAYE worker; if so, how. (4) Has the ATO initiated bankruptcy action without providing information or evidence of why Mr Gunton allegedly owed this money; if so, how. honourable member’s question: (1) Yes, I was aware of the honourable member’s representations on behalf of Mr Gunton. (2) I wrote to the honourable member in a letter dated 14 March 2000 that provided an answer to Mr Gunton’s question. The Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) advised me that Mr Gunton had review rights under the Taxpayer Charter, with access to ATO reviews and external reviews by independent bodies such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Court or the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Commissioner went on to say that taxpayers requesting an internal review by the ATO, for example by lodging an objection against an assessment, are subject to time limits in applying for such a review. The Commissioner further advised that Mr Gunton’s income tax liability has been the subject of court proceedings over many years and he has had the opportunity to dispute the issues at these times. In addition, Mr Gunton has approached the Commonwealth Ombudsman seeking a review of these matters. The Special Tax Adviser to the Ombudsman declined to investigate Mr Gunton’s claims for a number of reasons. In view of all of the circumstances surrounding Mr Gunton’s case, the Commissioner has decided that the ATO will not review the issues further. (3) The ATO derived a bill for $ 68,406.94 in income tax assessments for the financial years 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984 in January 1985. This amount escalated due to additional tax for late payment with a total liability of $99,888.62 before income tax amendments were issued reducing the liability to $65,229.12 in unpaid tax and $5502.73 in additional tax for late payment. As a result of the income tax liability remaining unpaid Mr Gunton was declared bankrupt on 5 April 1989. The ATO is required by law to provide information to a taxpayer before bankruptcy action is initiated and has complied with the law in Mr Gunton’s case. Australian Taxation Office: Petroulias, Mr Nick (Question No. 1585) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 30 May 2000: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Australian Financial Review on 15 May 2000 entitled ATO ignored advice: Petroulias. (2) Did Mr Nick Petroulias meet with other ATO officials in April 1999 and seek a Government announcement in the May Budget to close off employee benefit schemes designed to avoid tax; if so, what action did the ATO take in response to Mr Petroulias request. (3) In September 1998 did the ATO have advice that a legislative response was necessary to close off employee benefits schemes designed to avoid tax; if so, what advice did the ATO provide him or the Assistant Treasurer concerning this matter. honourable member’s question: As these questions go to matters which are currently before the courts, it is not considered appropriate to provide answers. In this context, the Director of Public Prosecutions has indicated he would prefer that there be no discussion about this matter whilst it is pending before the courts.",164,Representatives Main Committee

Kalejs, Mr Konrad: Extradition Request (Question No. 1648) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 20 June 2000: (1) Is the Minister able to say whether the Latvian Procurator General is drawing up a request for the extradition of former SD Lieutenant Konrad Kalejs to Latvia. (2) Have representatives of the Australian Government confirmed this directly with the authorities in Riga. (3) What time frame does the Australian Government anticipate before it receives the extradition request. (4) Will the proposed Australia/Latvia extradition treaty be completed in time to respond to a Latvian request for Mr Kalejs. (5) What procedure has the Government established for evaluating the extradition request once an extradition treaty between Australia and Latvia come into existence. (6) Will the Minister respond to the request. (7) Will the extradition request be evaluated by a magistrate; if so, will the magistrate have to evaluate whether there is a prima facie case on the balance of probabilities that Mr Kalejs was a Nazi war criminal. (8) Will the Minister request the Australian Federal Police to interview the remaining three witnesses in Latvia in order to establish a prima facie case so that an Australian magistrate might accede to an extradition request for Latvia. (9) What measures are the Government taking to prevent Mr Kalejs fleeing Australia. the honourable member’s question: (1) (3) In accordance with long-standing Government policy, it would not be appropriate to comment on questions regarding progress in a foreign criminal investigation. (4) The Treaty was signed in Riga on 14 July and is expected to be in force by the end of the year. In order to ensure that it can respond to any extradition request received from Latvia in the interim, the Government has arranged for the making of regulations declaring Latvia to be an extradition country for the purposes of the Extradition Act 1988. The regulations commenced on 12 July 2000. (5) If a request for extradition is received from Latvia after the Treaty enters into force it will be assessed in accordance with processes and criteria set out in the Treaty and in the Extradition Act. (6) All requests for extradition received by Australia are responded to at an appropriate time. (7) In the event that a Latvia made a formal extradition request to Australia, the first stage would involve a determination by me, in accordance with section 16 of the Extradition Act 1988, of whether a notice should be issued authorising a magistrate to proceed with the case. Assuming that such a notice was issued, and if the person sought did not consent to extradition, the magistrate would conduct a hearing to determine whether the person was eligible for surrender to Latvia. The magistrate would not be required to determine whether there was a prima facie case in relation to the person sought. Under our extradition arrangements with Latvia, the requesting party is not required to provide evidence regarding the guilt of the alleged offender.",169,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
277,Mr Williams,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to(8) No. As noted in response to question (7), the magistrate would not be required to determine whether there was a prima facie case in relation to any person sought by Latvia. (9) The Government does not have the effective power to prevent Mr Kalejs from leaving Australia. Where extradition proceedings are initiated against a person, a court may issue orders including an arrest warrant and, subsequently, a condition of bail requiring the person not to leave Australia and/or to surrender his or her passport to the court. These are not possibilities at present in relation to Mr Kalejs, as no request for his extradition, or for his provisional arrest with a view to extradition, has been received. Australian Electoral Commission: Provision of Information (Question No. 1757) on 14 August 2000: (1) Has the Australian Electoral Commissioner been forced to correct evidence given to a Senate Committee Inquiry into the provision of information by the Electoral Commissioner to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for the purpose of a mall out on the Goods and Services Tax. (2) If so, what were the circumstances in which the Electoral Commissioner was forced to correct his earlier evidence. (3) What is the correct chronology of correspondence between Mr Becker and Mr Carmody regarding the provision of information by the Electoral Commissioner to the ATO in the period since 1 April 2000. honourable member’s question: (1) On 31 May 2000, the Electoral Commissioner sent a letter to the Chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee comprising 17 matters about which comment or correction was appropriate following examination of the proof version of the Hansard of the appearance before the Committee of the Australian Electoral Commission on 24 May 2000. This is a normal occurrence on receipt of a proof version of a Hansard of evidence given by officers. No external pressure was applied to the Electoral Commissioner to make any changes. On6 June 2000, the Secretary of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee wrote to the Electoral Commissioner advising that his letter of 31 May 2000 needed to be broken into two parts for tabling purposes. On 27 June 2000 the Electoral Commissioner replied to the Secretary splitting his earlier advice into two attachments to this letter, in a format suitable for tabling. in which the Electoral Commissioner amplified his evidence that he had not seen any information from the Commissioner of Taxation to show what would be in the proposed mall-out. The Electoral Commissioner advised the Committee Chair that the Commissioner of Taxation’s letter of 19 April 2000 to the Electoral Commissioner, had advised that the mall out would contain an information booklet along with a letter from the Prime Minister. The Electoral Commissioner advised that he was not in Canberra at the time this letter was received by the Australian Electoral Commission and had no recollection of having seen the Tax Commissioner’s letter before the Committee hearing.

(2) For the most recent year for which data is available, what is the average time in weeks, from the date of first application, that it takes to complete this enlistment process. (3) Can Regular Army personnel who have completed their full-time service automatically transfer to the Army Reserve if they wish to do so, if not, what further checks are they subjected to. (4) For the most recent year for which data is available, what is the average time in weeks to complete the transfer from the Regular Army to the Army Reserve. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Applicants for the Army Reserve (Ares) receive initial careers counselling from Defence Careers Advisers. Provided a prospective applicant meets the basic eligibility criteria of age, education and citizenship they are given an application for entry. As soon as an application is returned, arrangements are made for the applicant to attend a test day. Test day involves a medical examination, psychometric (aptitude) assessment and interviews with a psychologist and an interviewing officer. Subject to being found medically fit, aptitudinally suitable for enlistment and being recommended by the psychologist and interviewing officer an enlistment date is negotiated with General Entry applicants, taking due cognisance of their civilian employment commitments and when they can be released to undertake Recruit Training. Ares officer applicants who are recommended by the psychologist and the interviewing officer are presented to an Officer Selection Board. (2) The average time taken from date of first application to enlistment for an Ares applicant is 13 weeks. However, as indicated in part (1), many applicants are not immediately available for enlistment and must enlist and commence recruit training at a time that is acceptable to their employers. It should be noted that as from 1 August 2000 an Eastern Region Part-Time Recruiting Trial was commenced in which Reserve Recruiting Units will assume a greater role in prospecting for Reserve applicants. As part of the trial, applicants who are found suitable for enlistment by the psychologist and interviewing officer will be enlisted on test day and managed by their Reserve unit until attendance at Recruit Training. It is anticipated that this process will significantly reduce the average time between application and enlistment. Concurrently, Army Headquarters is examining the feasibility of implementing the revised process for Ares recruiting on an Australia-wide basis. (3) Australian Regular Army (ARA) personnel are not automatically transferred to the Ares on request. However, they will normally be transferred to the Ares provided they are not subject to a Return of Service Obligation, are not due to be medically retired and are not subject to disciplinary termination. When considering an application for transfer between forces of the Army, the approving authority must consider: . current Army employment policy, . the member’s service record and qualifications, . the results of the transfer medical board or member’s existing employment standard, . the results of a current Basic Fitness Assessment, . comments by the member’s Commanding Officer and Army Personnel Agency, and . Service needs and vacancies. (4) ARA officers are required to give three months notice of their intention to discharge/transfer, and soldiers are required to provide six months notice. However, exceptions can be made to the period of notice if sufficient justification is provided. Based on the Calendar Year of 1999, the average time in weeks to complete the transfer process from the ARA to the Ares was 9 weeks for officers and 10 weeks for soldiers. Banyo and Bulimba Army Facilities: Enterprise Agreement (Question No. 1813) Mr Bevis asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 15 August 2000: (1) On 30 June 2000 was a message sent to military personnel at the Bulimba barracks in Brisbane saying that (a) due to recent events involving consultations and negotiations, no dialogue was to occur between unit representatives and state or federal union officials, (b) that any inquiries posed by state or federal union officials should be directed to either the Industrial Relations Officer or the Commanding Officer and (c) the request was not intended to gag consultation between management and the union movement but to ensure “we all sing from the same sheet of music”. (2) In his answer to question No. 1104 (Hansard, 16 February 2000, page 13719), did he say that enterprise agreement negotiations were matters between the contractors and the union and not the Defence Department and the union; if so, why does Defence maintain a process of negotiation with unions given that Drake Personnel is the employer and not the Department of Defence. (3) What strategy or approach is involved with the desire to ensure “we all sing to the same sheet of music”. (4) What role does Defence play in the negotiations concerning conditions for contractors’ employees. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) (c) On 30 June 2000 verbal advice was passed to all military supervisors of South Queensland Logistic Group located at Bulimba, Meeandah, Banyo and Enoggera in relation to on-going negotiations between a Defence Contractor, Drake Industrial, and their employees; and a proposed internal work practice trial. The advice reminded junior staff to remain uninvolved in enterprise negotiations between Drake Industrial and their employees; and that only the Commanding Officer and Industrial Relations Officer should communicate directly with state or federal union officials with regard to enquiries over a work practice trial. This was to ensure that information and advice provided to those affected by the trial by unit and union representatives was accurate and consistent. (2) Yes. Defence maintains a process of negotiation with unions only in relation to its own employees. (3) To ensure that information and advice provided to those affected by the unit level trial by unit and union representatives was accurate and consistent. (4) Defence plays no role in negotiations concerning conditions for contractors’ employees. However, Defence does stipulate in its contracts that contractors comply with Commonwealth employment legislation. Defence also specifies the security classifications that contractors’ employees need to obtain for the various services they will provide on Defence establishments. Australian Electoral Commission: Protected Information (Question No. 1821) on 16 August 2000: (1) What safeguards are in place to ensure that personal information sourced from the Electoral Roll maintained by the Australian Electoral Commission is not used by private sector organisations for commercial purposes. (2) Have there been any cases in which any person has been prosecuted under section 91 B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which provides that a person shall not use protected information for a commercial purpose; if so, what were the outcomes of those prosecutions. honourable member’s question: (1) The Electoral Roll, comprising name and address information only, is a public document and is available for inspection and/or purchase without restriction under section 90 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the CEA). The availability of the electoral roll as a public document has long been regarded as integral to the conduct of free and fair elections. The public availability of the roll enables participants to verify the openness and accountability of the electoral process and object to the enrolment of any elector, thereby reducing the likelihood of fraudulent enrolment activity. With recent developments in technology, 1 understand that it may be commercially viable for some organisations to purchase a publicly available copy of the electoral roll and scan it or enter it into a data bank for matching with other information for incorporation into a commercial product. In response to these developments, the Australian Electoral Commission is close to completing a review of sections 89-92 of the CEA dealing with access to the roll. The review will result in the publication of a report by the AEC and is expected to result in recommendations for legislative change. In addition to the name and address details comprising the Electoral Roll, other elector information held by the Australian Electoral Commission may be passed on to medical researchers, public health screening bodies, politicians, political parties and to certain prescribed Commonwealth Government agencies and authorities. Any information passed on to the prescribed Commonwealth Government agencies or authorities is, passed on only after their Chief Executives sign a specific Safeguard Agreement which sets out how the information may be used and specifies that the information will not be further disclosed or used in any other way. Elector information provided in electronic format may be used only for purposes permitted by section 91A of the CEA. Breaches of section 91A of the CEA attract a penalty of $11,000 for misuse. Breaches of section 91B attract a penalty of $110,000 for disclosure or commercial use. (2) There have been no prosecutions under section 91 B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.
