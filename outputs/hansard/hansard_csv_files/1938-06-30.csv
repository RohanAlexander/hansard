We are also told that the officials of the Trade and Customs Department cannot determine, as well as the Tariff Board, whether or not machinery can be manufactured in Australia. I ask the Ministeri f it is proposed to submit this matter to the Tariff Board? I am anxious to hear what the honourable gentleman has to say in regard to that because I have in mind the long wait we have experienced in connection with the board's report on the manufacture of motor engines in Australia. That matter was referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report over two years ago, and' the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett), myself, and other honourable members have been endeavouring to elicit from the Minister some information as to whether that report will be made available before the coming recess. W ill ' there be that endless delay in securing a report from the Tariff Board concerning the manufacture of aeroplanes in Australia? It is important that, if it is possible to do so, the work should be carried out here, and we are anxious to ensure that the com,pany shall not escape its obligation to have such work carried out in Australia.

Bounties are provided for a few industries, but they are chiefly primary industries. The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited says that it does not need protection now because it is impossible, owing to the armament race overseas, to import supplies of steel. That company can compete to-day on a free trade basis.. The steel bounty was wiped Out years .ago. We know that in tariff schedules protection is afforded, for the steel industry by way of duties, but, owing to the difficulty of securing supplies, with -the exception of a small quantity of special steels that cannot be manufactured here, no steel is coming into this country. The importers of these special steels have to wait a long time before their orders a.ro fulfilled. Order! The honourable member is getting away from the bill. out that no. steel bounty is paid in Australia to-day. I am. glad that a' concern with the experience and the past history of the Qantas company is to be linked up with the Empire Airways in this scheme. I wish to pay a tribute to the splendid record of Qantas Airways in 'Australia. Everything the Minister has said in regard to its operations in Queensland is amply justified. It has been carrying on services in different parts of Australia for many years with exceptionally few accidents, and it has played a very important part in making the people of Australia air-minded. Safety is its watchword. Speed, safety, economy, payload and comfort are essential attributes of a commercial typ""e aircraft, but it is impossible to combine the ideal of all of thesefeatures in any. one aircraft; consequently, it is necessary to compromise in the most advantageous manner, and, while speed is the main reason for the use of aircraft in transport, the maximum of attainment in this direction must be limited to cater adequately for safety, economy and comfort. I believe that the Qantas company has more nearly achieved the attainment of that' ideal than any other civil aviation company in Australia. When fhe Qantas",24,Setup

In this connection, I was glad to hear the plan outlined by the Minister for making use of the services which have been operating in the past, and which, to some extent, will be superseded. I particularly regret that, in the outline which the honourable gentleman has given to us, and which we have seen in the press, no mention was made of what is to become of that very excellent service run with the greatest efficiency and little limelight by the Butler organization, from Co'otamundra to Charleville. Mr a remarkable lack of ill-feeling. Any Butler and his staff are entitled to every consideration. One can see quite easily how the civil aviation authorities can make use of the other lines, but it is not such an obviously easy matter to determine what can be done with this organization In the references to undue delay during and there is less red tape, than in the the last two years, not only in this country, but also overseas, the impression was given that the Australian Government was the sole cause of the trouble; that we were, so to speak, unnecessarily obstinate in holding out for selfish points of view. I should like to say in defence of the authorities of the day, that when I flew myself out from England in 1936, at almost every point along the route I heard criticism of the scheme and the expression of very grave doubts as to its feasibility. The criticism may have been rather more.loudly voiced in Australia, but I assure the House that it was voiced also over every inch of the route from the United Kingdom to Australia. Another big problem which has had to be overcome is the provision of facilities through the Dutch East Indies, not because of any hampering action on the part of the Dutch authorities, but on account of the type of service upon which we have decided, which does not coincide with the type which the Dutch are using; consequently their facilities are different from what are required by us. t ' ! an altogether different type; it is a landboats which will make these look almost plane service. The Dutch have bases for [103] commercial land-aircraft military amphibians, which require different facilities from those required by the large flying boats to be used on the service to Australia. Both services are most efficient in their way. I regard as one of the bright spots in the development of British airways and Dutch airways across the world the wonderful spirit of co-operation and friendliness shown throughout by the one country towards the other. The Dutch, probably like ourselves, are notorious for keenness in driving a bargain. If they have driven a good bargain in this matter, it has been done with airman who has flown through the Dutch East Indies is prepared to pay tribute to the wonderful friendliness of the Dutch authorities and the remarkable absence of red tape at their aerodromes. Of all the aerodromes in all the countries that I have visited I know of none at which the officials are more friendly and helpful, Dutch East Indies. It was the only place in my journey out at which I was not asked to produce a passport. I welcome this opportunity to pay a tribute to the manner in which they are co-operating with us. It augurs well for our future rela-' tions in the Pacific, and indicates how strongly the Dutch appreciate the necessity for the two countries to stand together in protection of their mutual interests. Many persons wonder why flying boats are to be used. I do not propose to enter into a technical explanation, except to draw attention to the contention that i i i regard to size we are rapidly approaching the limit to which land aeroplanes can be built, because of the restrictions placed upon their size by the landing grounds that can be made available, whereas the size of the landing areas provided for flying boats is almost unlimited. ""We talk of aerodromes in terms of hundreds of yards, and of landing areas for flying boats in terms of miles. It may be of interest to honourable members to know that while in England after inspecting a line of 27 flying boats which were to be used on this service and the South African service, I the more efficient. was afterwards taken up to the drawing like toys.

Provision is made for single berth cabins, and in size the new machines will quite dwarf the present flying boats. Over distances of the length of our internal routes or the majority of the air routes that the engines in these aircraft require throughout the world, aircraft of moderate size, operating at great speed with frequency of services, will obviously be preferable to enormous aircraft operating less often, but so long as people travel works of the manufacturers. To preright across the world they will demand more space and comfort.than they are content with when travelling for only about one day. One of my regrets-I do not know whether it is as material as I consider it to be-is that the existence of Qantas Empire Airways as a small, self-contained-I will be to some degree interfered with by the introduction of this larger service in co-operation with Imperial Airways. Dp to date, no one who has had anything to do with Qantas can have failed to be impressed by the fact that it is almost a family rather than an organization. Every mechanic treats every machine owned by Qantas as though it were a Derby favourite on which he had wagered his shirt. I feel that, although Qantas is to be left in complete charge of the Singapore to Sydney portion of this route, according to the Minister's explanation its aircraft will at Singapore pass out of its hands and be flown by Imperial Airways' pilots. I do not for a moment doubt the ability of Imperial Airways' pilots, navigators and mechanics, but I feel that the extraordinary pride of Qantas pilots in their machines, such as one takes in one's own horse, motor car or aeroplane, will to some extent be lacking. have organized the matter differently would have been difficult. One plan considered was that the crews of each flying boat should fly the whole of the route between Sydney and Southampton. believe that on very short consideration one will realize that, as a matter of continual routine, the piloting of a flying boat from would impose too great a strain on the crew. I also think it desirable that the Mr Fairbairn. pilots should operate over a comparatively short stretch of the route, in order that they may learn it perfectly. The other alternative would have been to keep our flying boats entirely on the Singapore to Sydney section. In that case there would have been the difficulty caused by the fact overhauling at 400-hour periods, and that at present there is no provision for overhauling in Australia such as it is possible to obtain at the serve the splendid esprit de corps of Qantas, arrangements should be made as soon as possible for the complete'servicing of its aircraft in this country. I am in full sympathy with the desire of the Minister and his advisers to accomplish this objective without undue delay. The criticism which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde) directod to this might also say family-unit, point of the agreement seemed to me to show a lack of understanding of the real intentions of the Government. Had Qantas felt that it would have been necessary for it, at this stage, regardless of cost, to service its own craft completely, and also to provide spare parts for its machines at Australian costs, it may have been alarmed at the possible increase of running costs involved thereby. Naturally a company would desire, in such circumstances, to protect itself as far as possible. Honourable members will recollect that the contractors for the Sydney Harbour Bridge covered themselves against increased cost. exchange. that point, but otherwise it covered itself. Qantas naturally desired to do the same thing. Nevertheless, I urge that arrangeI admit that to ments should be made as soon as possible to service within this country the flying boats on our part of the route. That does uot mean that I in any sense suggest that the craft will not be adequately serI viced by Imperial Airways' engineers, or not be expertly flown by Imperial Airways' crews; but obviously men will find it difficult to take the same pride in the Australia to England aircraft of another company as they take in their own. It is desirable also that the craft to be used in this service should be confined as far as practicable to uniform",26,Setup
15,Mr Pateksoj.',Except in relation to,27,Setup
16,Mr Fairbairn,"True; it failed atclimatic conditions. This will contribute to efficiency. A wide variety of conditions will be experienced on the complete route from the United Kingdom to Australia, and I think it will be generally agreed that aircraft which are confined to the conditions known to predominate in a given section of the route are likely to give better service than machines which would have to meet the great variety of conditions of the whole route. Moreover, mechanics dealing with machines on certain sections of the route will be able to service them more effectively, and will have, a more intimate knowledge of them, than they could possibly have of machines travelling over the whole route. I do not call into question, in any respect, the ability of the officials and men of the Qantas and Imperial Airways to co-operate in the fullest possible degree. On the occasion of ray recent journey from Australia to EnglandI saw something of the spirit of co-operation that exists. I did not hear one Qantas official criticize one Imperial Airways official or vice versa. Buti f anything should go wrong with a machine on a certain section of the journey, it would be only human for the engineers of one company to suggest that those of the other company are responsible. Regarding the spirit of co-operation already existing between the two organizations, I well remember that in flying between Penang and Singapore we entered a storm which frightened the life out of me. When we landed at Darwin Captain Lester Brain, of Qantas, said to me "" I am sorry that I cannot spend the afternoon with you; but I am taking a spare tyre to Penang in the DH86."" I knew that the journey involved travelling through 250 miles of storm, yet this official took it as a matter of course in order to assist the officials of Imperial Airways. One feature of this proposed service which disturbs mo is that the mail matter which will come to Australia from the United Kingdom will carry no surcharge, whereas that which goes from Australia to the United Kingdom will bear a surcharge of 3d. a half ounce. I also appreciate the difficulty of our postal authorities in connection with this matter. If the surcharge were lifted from air-mail matter from Australia to Great Britain, undoubtedly an agitation would quickly arise for the lifting of the surcharge from internal air-mail matter. Of the total cost of £130,000 a year for this service, about £70,000 will be collected by surcharges, so naturally the abolition of the surcharge would tremendously increase the cost of the service to the Government, and the abolition of surcharge for internal services which would have to. follow would be an even greater expense. Obviously, however, a greater bulk of airmail matter will come into Australia at the I4d. rate than will go out of it at the od. rate, for people are naturally a little parsimonious in these matters. It may be said that the reduced tonnage of outward air-mail matter will make more room for passengers, but if so many hundred people travel from Australia to England by this service, approximately the same number will make the return journey, unless the expedient of reduced fares for the outward journey is adopted. As things are, it seems to me that a considerable waste of pay load is probable. I realize the financial difficulties which have faced the Government, but it seems to me to be .inevitable that before very long the surcharge on outward mail matter will have to be discontinued. We sliould, therefore, make up our minds at once to bear the additional cost. After all, two-penny postage has been justified by saying increased postal facilities are now being paid for out of revenue, and have in fact been paid for in this way during the last few years, loan money not being available for the purpose. If the Government abolished the surcharge it would still have a very considerable margin of profit on the operations of the whole department. For this reason it would, in my opinion, be justified in taking the course that I am advocating. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made another point upon which I am at variance with him. He said that the imperial air-mail service really only interested commercial firms doing business inEngland, and people who have relatives and friends abroad to whom they write regularly. That, I submit, leaves out of account a very important factor. The reduction of travelling time between Australia and countries overseas must benefit not only our business interests, but also all the culof real value. Speaking in general terms tural business and social activities of Australian life. great handicaps from which Australian professional and business men, medical leaders of our cultural life suffer, is their separation from kindred interests overseas. Our people definitely suffer in consequence of their lack of personal contacts overseas. When it becomes possible for professional and business men, educationalists and industrial leaders to make quick journeys abroad to keep in touch with new thoughts and methods it will be immeasurably to the benefit of Australia as a whole. Eor this reason, I feci that the observations of the Deputy Lead el* of the Opposition concerning the probable advantages of this service showed a lack of adequate appreciation. Like that honourable gentleman, however, I feel that this is an appropriate opportunity upon which to pay tribute to Qantas. Australians have every reason to be proud of the romantic growth of many of their industries, and also of the outstanding careers of many of our citizens in various professions and commercial undertakings, but I do not think a greater romance has occurred in the history of Australian enterprises than that of the development of the Qantas Empire Airways. member consider that Australia has properly treated aviators? Ohair would consider that I was departing from the provisions of the bill if I discussed that subject at any length, but I may in passing point out, with the -indulgence of Mr Speaker, that the fact that an individual has shown himself to be a wonderful aerial explorer does not necessarily make it easy to fit him into civil activities or public life. I have the greatest admiration for the wonderful work of our aerial explorers but, in some cases, their very virtues and extraordinary fearlessness in attempting great feats have made it difficult to fit them into the ordinary walks of life. We must all have regretted that some of these airmen have been obliged, for financial reasons, to engage in hazardous flights which were not it may be said that the governments of One of the Australia, according to the prosperity of the times in which they have been' in power, have accorded our aerial explorers practitioners, artists and very considerable support. People are apt, at times, to complain that Australia does not provide facilities for aviators comparable with those available in the United States of America; but it must be remembered that although our air routes are as far flung as those of the United States of America, they serve only about 7,000,000 people, whereas those of the United States of America serve between 110,000,000 ancl 120,000,000 people who are among the wealthiest in the world. Having travelled 'over the back country air routes of Australia. I have felt called upon, again and again, to pay tribute to the magnificent work done by our civil aviation authorities in making these routes so safe with the limited money at their disposal. I have flown right across the northern parts of this continent over to Broome, crossing some of the most rugged country in the world, and I have seldom been more than 30 miles from an .emergency landing ground, yet on one occasion, when I flew up the Rhine in Germany in thick fog, my eyes nearly popped out of. ray head looking for landing grounds. At one stage of the journey I flew a distance honourable of 150 miles in which there was only one landing ground. Probablyi f I had its notable pioneer deviated 20 or 30 miles on either side of the ronte that I was taking I might have seen emergency landing grounds. When the difficult conditions of this country are considered in relation to the amount of money available for aerial developmental work, it must bo admitted that those closely identified with civil aviation have done a remarkably good job. Sitting suspended from 12.%.5 to 2.15 p.m. clude my remarks by giving a short sketch of the remarkable record of Qantas, which is of interest because the company is the Australian agent to carry out this agreement. The company was formed in 1920 by Mr Hudson Fysh and Mr T. J. Mclnnes, two flying corps officers, who had returned from the war. They commenced a taxi service between",27,Setup

19,Mr Fairbairn,"I propose to conthe Longreach rail-head and the Wintc-n rail-head, with two war-time aeroplanes purchased from the Government. In 1922, the Government of the day gave them their first subsidized route between Charleville and Cloncurry, a route of 577 miles. In 1925 this route was extended to Mt. Isa and Camooweal. The route flown then became S25 miles. In 1927 a branch line from Cloncurry to Normanton was established, bringing the number of miles flown to 1,040. In 1928 the Cloncurry flying doctor service, Which has since become famous, was established by the Australian Inland Mission with transport provided by Qantas. Qantas has been carrying out the flying doctor service ever since. In 1929 the company extended its route from Charleville to Brisbane, making the total number of miles flown 1,484. An interesting point in the growth of this company is that, unlike the usual transport companies which generally start from the city and work out, Qantas started from the bush and worked in to the city. It has developed from a bush company to an international service. In 1930 Qantas pilots had completed 1,000,000 miles of flying. In 1931 Qantas co-operated with Imperial Airways in an experimental service from the United Kingdom to Australia. By 1934 the number of miles flown by Qantas aeroplanes had increased to 2,477,000, entirely free of fatalities to the passengers. In 1934, when the Brisbane-Singapore service was permanently established, the Qantas Company ended its fourteenth year of existence. Its record was recognized then as one of the most outstanding in the world in air transport. It is certainly an outstanding chapter in the history of Australian aviation. Qantas Empire Airways and the company initiated its service to Singapore, which it has been flying ever since, until the Singapore route. Mr Hudson Fysh its aeroplanes have flown 3,100,000 miles between Singapore and Australia. They have flown over the Timor Sea 576 times I am afraid that the interesting history of Qantas has nothing to do with this bill. it has to do with this bill to Fysh, but also the senior captains. They the extent that I am dealing with have done wonderful work in the last four the record of an agent of the Commonwealth Government. To show how efficient the Qantas company has been is surely to indicate the good fortune of the people of Australia in having such an agent to carry on their work. I shall not continue further with statistical detail, if Mr Speaker thinks I am not in order in doing so, except to point out that in 3,100,000 miles flown, not only have there been no fatalities or injuries to any passenger or member of the staff, but also on no occasion has there been a forced landing. That is a record which is unique in the history of aviation. With all due respect to Mr Speaker, I do not intend to make any apology for commenting upon the wonderful record of Qantas, because it shows what an excellent agent Australia has to carry on this new service on which we ' are embarking. A discussion of the route between Sydney and Singapore would not be complete without a tribute to the very great work done by the meteorological station at Darwin. When the Singapore service was started it did not have meteorological aids, and the average speed of aircraft, which, as the pilots did not know where to find favorable winds, had often to buffet against head-winds, was 128 miles an hour. Since the establishment of the meteorological station that average speed has been increased to 152 miles an hour with exactly the same aircraft. That is solely because the officer in charge of the station is able to tell the pilots at what altitudes they will find favorable winds. ;We are to-day at a milestone in the In 1934 Qantas became history of air transport in Australia, and it would be quite wrong if a tribute were not paid to the men who have pioneered has worked up Qantas from a small taxi service to an organization in which there is a greater amount of co-operation than I have seen in any industry. Not only is it right to pay a tribute to these men, but also, I think, the Government might well consider, when next making out a list of honours, recognizing I submit that not only the managing director, Mr",29,Setup

When the former honourable member for Warringah, Sir Archdale Parkhill, was.Minister for Defence, there was a good deal of press controversy regarding the proposal to make Sydney the terminal point for the service. The then Minister took a very strong stand against this proposal. He argued that, for both commercial and defence purposes, Darwin should be the terminal point; that it was essential that our inland air services should be fostered. It was pointed out that, because of the great distances between inland towns, they could be adequately served only by aerial services. It was further argued that to continue the service down the Queensland coast with flying boats would be merely to superimpose another method of transport upon the railway and shipping services already in existence. .Those arguments were, for the most part, supported by honourable members of the Opposition, and the then Minister declared very definitely that he would not budge from thu position he had taken up. It looks*, however, as though financial interests have scored another victory. The Minister was defeated, and went out of office, and, very shortly afterwards, we were informed that .the Government had. reversed its policy, and that Sydney would become the terminal point for a flying boat service. It was stated that this decision was justified on the ground that, as it was proposed to extend the service to New Zealand, the terminal point should be at Sydney, so that the service could be carried on without interruption. extended possibly beyond New Zealand. this argument was added only as an afterthought; we heard no suggestion of it when the controversy first began. I still believe that the matter should not be regarded as settled, because it is just as desirable now as it ever was that we should foster and develop our inland air services in order to relieve the isolation of people in the outback areas, and to strengthen our defence equipment. I believe that there has been a surrender by the Commonwealth Government to very strong financial interests. for that belief-. Australia retains absolute control over the service from Singapore to Sydney. to make that statement, and we are unable to test its truth because the information before us is so meagre. This agreement is a highly technical document, ancl it cannot be expected that its full purport will be readily understood by laymen. The fact remains that the previous Minister for Defence, who had, presumably, all the facts in his possession, believed that Darwin should he the terminal point. Now the Government has reversed its previous decision, and we are given no satisfactory explanation. The honourable member for Flinders was unable to supply the reason, and, indeed, confessed that he, himself, was not completely satisfied. Under the agreement, many concessions, besides the payment of a subsidy, are to be made to the companies operating this service. For instance, ail the oil and fuel which will be used on service flights, and for trials and tests as well, will be made available to the companies free of duty, and all other taxes to which they might be subject, and this is to apply also to all equipment imported for the purpose of maintaining the service. That is an important concession. Moreover, the companies are to be reimbursed by the Commonwealth for any duties or taxes paid in the Dutch East Indies in respect of fuel and equipment purchased there. Tho agreement also provides that the Commonwealth Government shall pay to Qantas Empire Airways Limited a minimum annual subsidy of £40,000. The subsidy payment will be increased by 8s. per lb. for each pound of mails originating in Australia or its territories carried in excess of 40,000 lb. per annum, but shall not exceed £50,000 sterling. That appears to be fairly clear, but the next paragraph also provides for payments, and I should like to know whether they are to be additional to those in the paragraph I have just quoted.

AmI right in assuming that, under those provisions, the total subsidy may amount to £102,000 a year? in the agreement that the frequency of the service shall be not less than three times weekly, and that it shall be increased if the Commonwealth so requires. I should like to know whether, if the frequency of the service is increased, the subsidy is to be increased also. amount to which the Commonwealth is committed under the agreement is £102,000, plus £30,000 for maintenance. The company is bound to carry all the mail offering, even if, in order to do so, it must put on extra flying boats. undertakes to provide £30,000 for maintenance. I should like to know whether this money is to be expended wholly on the Australian end of the service, or whether it is to be expended on a pro rata basis over the whole route from Great Britain. Singapore to Sydney, and any amount required in excess of £30,000 will be paid, -by the Government of the United Kingdom -Line on account of the' transference of of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) referred to the subsidy which the Government now pays to the Orient Line for the carriage of mails by sea. Paragraph g of clause . 6 of the agreement is as follows:The Commonwealth Government will make , no reduction in its subsidy payments to the Orient Line on account of the transference of mail to the air service, though it reserves 'the right to modify the existing arrangements on other grounds if .and when it considers such step to be necessary. The wording of that paragraph is not very clear. I have reason to believe that those who control the affairs of the Orient Line are also financially interested in Imperial Airways. From 'what I can gather, those associated with the Orient. Line are likely to be equally associated with Imperial Airways, and it looks as if they will be paid both ways. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, in a short space of time the reduction of the air-mail rate will result in approximately 90 per cent, of our first-class mails being carried overseas by air. It does not appear right to me that subsidies should be paid in two directions. The taxpayers of Australia should not be called upon to maintain at the existing high rate the subsidy now paid to the Orient Line for a service which two or three years hence it will no longer be called upon to render. It would be difficult to justify on ordinary business principles the continuation of the present rate of subsidy, whether my contention with regard to Imperial Airways and the shipping interests be correct or not. Clause6 g is not definite in that it ought to provide some means whereby an adjustment can be made to the extent that at least the subsidy for. the air service could be reimbursed by the reduction effected in the payments to the Orient Line. In that respect the Deputy Leader of the Opposition touched a very vital point in this agreement. will that condition continue? seems nebulous to me; it provides that the Commonwealth shall make no reduction in its subsidy payments to the Orient mails to the air service. There is no reference to time. It further provides that the Commonwealth Government reserves the right to modify the. existing arrangements on other grounds if and when it considers such a step to be necessary. Apparently "" other grounds "" will have no reference to the air-mail service. any definite term to the contract? £130,000 was paid until 1931, when it was reduced to £110,000. The point is ] that the weight of first-class mail matter that will travel by air will amount to only about 40 or 60 tons a year at most. \ It is not a very big item. A large proportion of the mail carried by the Orient' company is second-class mail matter.",32,Setup

36,Mr Thorby,"No. A subsidy ofof the surcharge on air mail being entirely removed surely that arrangement would not be continued? that it can be reviewed by the Government and the Orient Line at any time. the agreement definitely states that no reduction will be made. That leads me to the deduction that the interests associated with comjjanies drawing these subsidies would want to be clear that they would not be affected by changing conditions in regard to transport. Those who invest in certain j>ublic utilities such as transport take the risk that changing conditions may vary the mode of transport. I feel sure, however, that nobody wishes to inflict unnecessary hardship on those who have invested tlieir money in this way but the taxpayers cannot be expected to make payments in order to enable obsolete services to continue. I am still at a loss to know why the preamble makes such a definite declaration; but time, no doubt, will show more fully the reasons for if. Defence) [2.50] m reply-In reply to the points raised by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), the contract entered into with the Orient Company was not merely for the carriage of mails; in return for the subsidy, the Orient Company undertook to run to a certain'schedule, and to call at certain ports and pick up and set down first and second class mail matter. It would be a breach of contract if, because we take a small portion of the mail away from that company, we cancelled the whole or any part of the mail contract for which the subsidy was paid. The quantity of first-class mail matter which will be diverted to aerial transport will not amount to more than four or five tons a month. That is a very small quantity when considered in relation to the large volume of mails carried by the Orient Company. The contract under which the mail subsidy is paid to the Orient Company requires the company to call at a number of ports not related to the actual route which will be covered by the flyingboat service. That is why the clause to which the honourable member for West Sydney referred was inserted in the agreement. The Commonwealth reserves the right to reduce or vary the mail subsidy to the Orient Company, not because it proposes to despatch a .certain quantity of mail by air, but because of other considerations entirely outside of this proposed flying-boat service. The Commonwealth does not propose to tie its hands in any way or to allow the Empire air-mail contract to interfere with the contract already existing with the Orient Company. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) asked what subsidy was being paid by the British Government in connection with this scheme. Foithe first three years the British Government will pay £750,000, and at the end of each subsequent three-year period, the amount of subsidy will be reduced to £675,000, £600,000, £525,000, and £450,000, respectively. Those amounts include the subsidies from the various participating countries which will be receiving part service from this organization. The honourable member for West Sydney also raised the point as to why the Commonwealth Government varied the original proposal that the service should end at Darwin and then be taken up by land aeroplanes throughout the Commonwealth. The British Government's proposal was for an Empire flying-boat service, and if the Commonwealth had insisted upon breaking the service at Darwin it would have been necessary to institute a separate service from Sydney to Auckland. A break of this sort in the flying-boat service would have probably resulted in the destruction of the project the British Government had in mind to deliver all outward mails to the various parts of the dominions free of surcharge. The iCommonwealth Government originally took exception to Imperial Airways continuing the . service right through to Sydney, thus virtually taking control of the air-mail service within the Commonwealth. A compromise of the kind referred to by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Fairbairn) was effected,-as the result of which the Commonwealth retained under its control the Australian section of the air route and in return agreed to cooperate with Imperial Airways in the",33,Setup

40,Mr Thorby (Calare,"Minister forservice to Darwin. The Commonwealth even went so far as to say that, as the Qantas Company Lad successfully established an .aii' route from Singapore through to Darwin and Brisbane, it should be entitled to retain control of that section of the route. The British Government, however, promised to provide an Empire flying-boat service in respect of which it undertook to contribute the larger proportion of the cost. It believed that such a service would be a national asset and that it would be possible gradually to extend it right throughout the British Empire. The dominions were asked to contribute only a minor proportion of the cost. It was then decided to accept that proposal, and the agreement embodied in the bill was drawn up. The retention of the surcharge in the case of the Commonwealth will meet only a portion of the total cost of its share of the subsidy, and the reduction of the surcharge from Is. 4d. to 3d. a half ounce, should be welcomed by the people generally. The agreement has been drawn up very carefully to protect Australia's interests in every possible way. The Commonwealth Government has agreed to contribute towards the cost of the .manufacture in Australia of flying boats and parts as .a definite contribution towards the establishment of an aircraft industry in tin's country.

[3.4] I move That the amendment be agreed tn. I am advised by the Crown Law Department that sub-clause c as it stands, will preclude employees of hospitals from making contributions or obtaining benefits under this legislation. I understand that that was not the intention of the honourable member who moved for the inclusion of the paragraph; that he wished to confine the exemption to the medical benefit. I ventured to address the committee when this matter was before it previously. I believe that honourable members are convinced that hospital employees should not be denied the right to make contributions or to obtain benefits under this scheme. If it be necessary to (Corio-Treasurer ) embark on a longer dissertation, I shall be only too glad to do so. cannot feel at all -satisfied with the explanation given by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) for the omission of paragraph c. The request which the amendment featured was that hospital employees who to-day receive a medical benefit the equivalent of or superior to that provided under this bill should to that extent be exempt from tlie provisions of the bill. The Treasurer says that this paragraph will deprive hospital employees of the right to participate in this particular form of insurance. The honourable gentleman knows that that difficulty could easily be overcome by a consequential amendment iu an earlier clause. received an intimation from the officers of the Crown Law Department that, by the passage of this particular paragraph, hospital employees will be disqualified from any participation in the scheme. That, definitely, was not the purpose of this committee when the paragraph was inserted in the schedule. It was then made clear to the Treasurer that he would be required to make the necessary consequential amendment adequately to provide for the position. His unwillingness to do so is shown by his declaration this afternoon.

The bill makes no provision to aid them in their work. On the contrary, an added obligation will be placed upon them to deal with the many cases that will be referred to them by doctors under this insurance scheme. This paragraph was a medium whereby hospital boards could at least have been relieved of the financial obligations which the bill proposed to place upon them. In a speech that I made earlier on this matter, I said that not only is the Government imposing on hospitals an added obligation in that under this scheme they will have to provide for a larger number of patients, but that it is also ruining their prospects of obtaining the public subscriptions which formerly were made possible by means of the voluntary schemes of different firms. If this ban be imposed on all employed persons, many of them will be under the impression that national insurance covers the whole of the treatment in respect of sickness and ill health, and, rates bill, provision was made whereby -consequently, they may forego the opportunity to contribute voluntarily to the funds of a hospital. That will deprive hospitals of a substantial amount of -respect of persons who are to be covered revenue which they now receive. As a further hardship, hospitals are to be required to make a contribution on behalf of their employees for what is now provided by means of their medical services.' The whole thing is grossly unjust. An unfair burden will be placed upon these institutions, and the employees will definitely be deprived of that consideration which is due to them as a part of their employment. I hope that the committee will see the wisdom of rejecting the Senate's amendment, and will insist upon the retention of the paragraph. The necessary consequential amendment could then be made, and equity and justice would be done to hospital employees as well as to the institutions themselves. -T-I support the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). The whole matter is embraced in one point. In the calculation of wages by boards, conciliation committees and other tribunals, consideration of the services provided by the employer in these matters is assessed at a certain value and the wages are determined accordingly. a tribunal is dealing with the matter of hospital employees in Sydney at the moment. For a long time, the different hospitals made separate agreements with their employees, but, under the Hospital Commission, there has been a move for standardization, and a common rule is now being made. All these factors are now being considered in the form of evidence and argument. The employees of the railways and tramways services are provided with a pass to travel to and from their work ancl to visit different parts of the State when on annual leave. The value of those passes and other concessions is fixed at a certain figure, and is taken into account when determining weekly wages. When all is said and done, our contention is that the employees should not be called upon to pay twice for their benefits. In the the payment of employees in government institutions who have superannuation benefits is to be less than is prescribed in by this scheme generally. Whatever the rates for these persons may be they will be fixed upon an actuarial basis. I am at a los3 to understand why any difficulty should be understood in regard to this matter. As hospital employees, speaking generally, receive medical benefits similar to those specified in this bill and pay for them by way of deductions from their wages, it is, therefore, unfair to expect them to contribute under thi* scheme. Certain persons who contribute for superannuation payments have been granted exemption, and hospital employees whose terms of employment provide for sickness benefits, could be granted exemption with equal justification. ber's remarks cover private as well as public hospitals? and philanthropic institutions? inmates of old men's homes are treated",36,National Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 193s

Very well, but why impose a -double charge on the workers to achieve that purpose? the Government is to guarantee the provision of health services. be cited to prove any contention on this point, but we submit that the charges upon employees should not be such as to causethem to pay twice for the same services. [3.17] -On e underlying principle of this bill is that employees shall be assured of tlie benefits provided. Eor that reason the fewest possible exemptions have been allowed. If the partial exemption desired by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) for certain classes of employees is granted, undoubtedly an agitation will be set on foot for further exempdemerits of the clause,, as they have once tions, and the whole object of the scheme may be undermined. hospital employees may, at present, be receiving benefits equivalent to those specified in the bill they have no guarantee that they will continue to receive them. The wide range of hospitals should be kept in mind. We should think, not only of the big metropolitan hospitals, but also of the suburban and private hospitals, and of the mental hospitals and other philanthropic institutions. The Government wishes to preserve continuity of insurance for all the persons entitled to come under the provisions,of the bill. Even persons covered by their terms of employment with some hospitals, may find themselves in different employment next week. They may accept employment entirely separated from hospitals. The Government desires to ensure that in such cases their privileges shall be preserved. In my opinion, when this measure is in full operation, the position of the hospitals will be better than it is to-day. We know very well that in some cases, hospital employees who fall sick are paid, if not the whole, at any rate a proportion, of their wages by the hospital To avoid doing so was the authorities. If the Government's intention is implemented the hospital finances will be relieved of any such burden in respect of insured persons. British scheme extended hospital benefits are provided for definite contributions. certain hospitals the -medical practitioners give free treatment to nurses who need it, but we can have no guarantee that that procedure will not be varied. If hospital employees are insured under this bill, the medical-practitioners on the oue hand and the hospital authorities on the other will be relieved of any obligation to provide them with medical treatment and medicines without cost for, as (Corio Treasurer) the insured persons will be entitled to the benefits of this measure, the medical practitioners and hospital authorities will be fully entitled to make the specified charges in respect of them.

The honourable membra for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) stated in temperate language what sounded like a good case, but 1 do not think that his examples were altogether true to the facts of the case.

Yes; but undoubtedly adjustments will also be made in tlie emoluments of hospital employees. Obviously, the Hospitals Commission of New South Wales will bear this point in mind. The area of the application of this measure should not be restricted in any further degree. I am sorry that public servants have been granted exemption from contributions. I do not know whether that was done in the interests of the State as an employer, or of the public servant as an employee; but certainly it was a mistake. the committee will restore the clause to its original wording. Last week I of the largest hospitals in Sydney, and she said to me, ""Who has taken upon himself the responsibility to say nurses wish to be excluded from the national insurance scheme?'' She told me.that some medical practitioners gave free treatment to the nurses at the hospitals in which they were interested, others charged half-fees, and others felt no obligation at all in regard to the matter. Unless we are careful, we shall add to the anomalies of the scheme. It may be that maids and cleaners in hospitals will be excluded, although clearly they are on a. quite different footing from nurses, and do not enjoy quite the same goodwill from the doctors as do the nurses. This nurse said to me that they would rather pay 2d. a week and have medical attention as a right than save that 2d. a week and accept it as an act of kindness. I appeal to the committee Where is the real to agree to the Senate's amendment, and leave thu clause as it was originally framed. not accept the statement of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) as to the value of restoring this clause to its original wording. I am aware of the conditions that operate in subsidized hospitals in Tasmania, and to some extent in Victoria, as the result of my associatiou with a union. In Tasment of the nurses and the general staff is free medical treatment. When they are ordered off duty as the result of illness their pay continues for a time, but, of course, it eventually ceases: There is no suggestion of charity in the provision of free medical treatment for the staffs in Tasmania. It is their right. In Victoria the same position applies Free medical treatment of the staffs of the hospitals is provided for in the awards of the State wages board. I have no knowledge of what obtains in New South Wales, where the position may be as the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) states it. The Treasurer claimed that the. hospitals would benefit when the scheme had settled down. But I do not think that would work out in practice. The hospital boards will have to find extra money to make contributions in respect to their employees through the national insurance fund, and I do not met a nurse employed in one know where they are going to find it.

The convention of 1929 supersedes a convention dated the 6th June, 1906, which also made provision for the protection of the Eed Cross, but did not go so far as the more recent convention. Legislation to give effect to the 1906 convention was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1911, and this legislation applied throughout the whole of the King's dominions. In 1937, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed a further act to give effect to article 2S of the 1929 convention, but this act does not extend to the Commonwealth. The act contemplates, however, that legislation will be passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, and, in order to remove any doubt as to the power3 of the expressly provides that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to legislate to give effect to article 28 of the convention, and also authorizes the Commonwealth Parliament to terminate the application of the British act of 1911 to the Commonwealth and its territories. This bill will, therefore, make provision to give effect in Australia to the Geneva Convention of 1929, and will terminate the operation in Australia of the British act. which will be no longer necessary. [3.55] -It is almost a pleasant surprise to hear the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hughes) propose that this Parliament should ratify one of the conventions of the League of Nations. It is true that this is a convention associated with the League itself, and not with one of its auxiliary bodies, but Australia's representatives have conventions which Australia has not honoured, much to our disgrace. However, the Government has decided to adopt this convention in order to bring Australia into line with other nations, and its purpose is to securetlie co-operation of all the signatory nations in doing all that is humanly possible for the sick and wounded members of all armies on the battlefield, whoever and wherever they may be. Two or three decades ago, most of us believed that conventions of this' kind would be respected, and that the emblem of the red cross would serve to protect, in all circumstances, those who bore it. It is, however, useless for us to fool ourselves. We know that it is now more of a danger than a protection to shelter under the red cross on the battlefield. Thus, while it is impossible for us to have a great deal of faith in international agreements of this nature, it is our duty to subscribe to them in the hope that some good may come from them. It is 'also provided in the convention that the red cross, or the Geneva cross, may not be used for trade purposes. For years past certain first-aid and medical organizations have used the red cross emblem in their -peace-time work, but there is a growing tendency for the emblem to be exploited for trade purposes, thus destroying its peculiar significance. In brief, this convention covers the folCommonwealth Parliament. it lowing matters(3) The treatment of the wounded and sick of combatants in time of war. (2) The protection of the buildings, equipment, and personnel of the medical services of the opposing forces. (3) The definition of a distinctive emblem or badge which can be easily recognized and respected by all those engaged in war. As I have said, at one time the emblem of the red cross was regarded as an absolute safeguard against deliberate molestation for all those engaged in caring for the sick and wounded in time of war. Unfortunately, we have reached a stage when practically all our efforts to humanize war have been proved futile. Someone has said that we might as well try to Christianize hell as to humanize agreed to other Avar. I believe that to be largely true, but it is still our duty to do what we. can, and therefore I support this measure.

This measure provides for bounty at a reducing rate on citrus fruits exported to all destinations other than New Zealand, over the three years 1938, 1939 and 1940'. The bounty will be at the rate of 2s. an export box for 1938, Is. 6d. an export box for 1939, and Is. an export box for 1940. These amounts apply to the box which contains approximately 1\ bushels.

In that year, following the imposition of the New Zealand embargo on Australian citrus fruits, growers were guaranteed their out-of-pocket expenses on oranges exported to the United Kingdom. The guarantee was renewed in .1934, and, as that year turned out to be particularly disastrous on account of adverse seasonal conditions, a bounty of 6d. a case was granted on oranges exported to the United Kingdom. For the years 1935, 1936 and 1937, bounty at the rate of 2s. an export case was paid.

I submit the bill for the favorable consideration of honourable members. In supporting this bill I express my pleasure that the Government is proposing to continue this bounty for three years although at a diminishing rate each year. No doubt this is intended to serve as a notice to the citrus growers that at the end of that period the Government expects them to stand upon their own feet. This provision is wise, for bounties are intended to assist industries only in the initial stages of their development. orable member for Richmond( Mr direction. Anthony) would not like the protection at present accorded butter producers and bacon growers to be lifted; nor would he be pleased if New Zealand potatoes were admitted free to Australia; but I am not "" one-eyed "" in my advocacy of protection ; I believe that both primary and secondary industries should bo protected. I regret, however, that the Country party is "" one-eyed "" in this respect. The citrus industry is of importance to the Commonwealth because it makes possible the settlement of relatively small areas. It is really one of the outcomes of our closer settlement policy. Numerous returned soldiers are settled on citrus groves in various parts of Australia. In 1916-17 we had 17,000 acres under citrus cultivation, and our production totalled 1,450,000 bushels of fruit. By 1935-36 tlic area had increased to 41,000 acres and the production to 4,430,000 bushels. More than 50 per cent, of our citrus fruits is grown by returned soldiers. Un-' fortunately, some returned men were settled on unsuitable land for which the Government paid too high a price, and we have also had to cope with a certain degree of over-production. Quite recently Mr J. R. Crawford, the economist of the Rural Bank of New South ""Wales, directed attention to another difficulty of the industry. According to a report in the Sydney Sum of 27th June last, he saidThu change in tlie demand from common oranges and mandarins to. navels and valeuciaa has hit badly the coastal and metropolitan growers. Evidently, a remarkable alteration has occurred in the kind of citrus fruit demanded by the market. Sir Richard Linton, when Agent-General for Victoria in London, rerjorted that South Australian navel oranges sold well on the British market. It is interesting to note that 10,000 acres of our citrus country is planted with navel orange trees, and 30,000 with other varieties. Steps should be taken to replace the unpopular varieties by the varieties demanded by purchasers overseas. The Acting Minister for Commerce ,( Mr Archie Cameron) could, no doubt, through his department, do something to stimulate a movement in this a subject over which the Commonwealth has no direct control. edly, at periodical Premiers Conferences and meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council, direct, attention to the subject. Mr AitCHiE CAMERON I have conferred with the citrus growers' organizations on the subject. Minister( Mr Lyons) will also, direct attention to it at the next Premiers Conference. Probably something could be done through the instrumentality of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to deal with the problem. The organized marketing of citrus fruits and the extension of the export trade would undoubtedly be of great value to the industry. Steps to achieve these ends would, in my opinion, be of more assistance to the industry, in the long run, than the provision of a limited amount of money for bounty payments.

Temporary alleviarinn of the kind now proposed does not gi't to the root of troubles in which the growers find themselves. Under the Ottawa Agreement it was expected that the Australian citrus growers would obtain a larger share of the market in the United Kingdom, but actually our exports of citrus fruits to that market have decreased. i l r . AEOKIE C<v&fEROK -But we are in a better position on the Canadian market. that is so. It is in that way that the industry will be permanently improved. Temporary patches upon it will be ineffective. The citrus growers of Spain and Palestine are the largest exporters to the United Kingdom market; but the growers of Brazil and the United States of America also enjoy a large share of the trade, while those of South Africa exported more than 1,000,000 cwt. of citrus fruits to Great Britain last year. The following table sets out the value and total imports ''of citrus fruits to the United Kingdom and also Australia's share of the trade:Cwt. 1933Total Prom Australia 1938--Tota l . . ,,. . . 9,535,000 1935-36-From Australia 1937-Tota l . . . 1930-37-From Australia Those figures show that our exports of citrus fruits to. Groat Britain could be substantially increased. Why is it that we are not obtaining a larger share of Britain's trade?' Undoubtedly the present, situation is most unsatisfactory. Although flip Commonwealth and State governments may be actuated by good motives in seeking to develop this industry, their activities are?obvionsiy ineffective. In the press report of the remarks of Mr J. R. Crawford on this industry, a passage from which I have already cited, it is statedThe loss of the New Zealand market as the result of the embargo applied by the Dominion Government in 1932 was one of the main causes iu the decline of the Australian citrus industry. The speech just delivered by the Acting Minister for Commerce did not indicate clearly whether this embargo had been completely lifted. If not, I urge that negotiations be entered into with that, object. At a conference held in Canberra during 1935, and attended by pathologists and representatives of the Commonwealth and State governments, and also of the Government of New Zealand, it was unanimously decided that the interests of public health were no longer being served by the existing quarantine prohibitions. The present Labour Government of Now Zealand has, on several occasions, expressed the opinion that the continuation of any restrictions on the trade between Australia and New Zealand was not justified. We know that a good deal of the trouble originated in consequence"" of the action of the Commonwealth Government in prohibiting the importation of New Zealand potatoes to Australia because of the fear of introducing the diseases known as corky scab and fire blight. No doubt this subject was discussed at some length by the Minister for Trade and Customs during Quantity. Value. his recent visit to New Zealand, and 1 hope that a statement will be made at an early date to the effect that all the re£ maining difficulties have been overcome. The embargo on the importation of 11,500,000 7,990,000 Australian citrus fruits to New Zealand 46,000 44,000 7,185,000 was imposed by the Dominion Govern39,500 33,000 ment in 1932. I believe that that action 12,492,000 7,955,000 was retaliatory, at least to some extent, 32.000 29,000 for the treatment accorded by the Commonwealth Government to New Zealand potatoes"". The prohibition was modified in 1933 to permit a limited importation of South Australian oranges to New Zealand. In 1934 the Dominion Government again decided to allow oranges from South Australia to enter New Zealand in specified quantities and by certain vessels. I liave been assured that a real demand exists in New Zealand for Australian oranges for which the consumers",46,Second Reading

In these circumstances I trust that in the coming parliamentary recess the Acting Minister for Commerce .will do everything possible to improve the present position in regard to both Australian citrus fruits and New Zealand potatoes. Although the State governments control land settlement, and also the closer settlement programmes at present on foot, the Commonwealth Government could undoubtedly do a great deal to obtain more satisfactory markets for our various primary products. standard of living of the Australian people were substantially improved and their purchasing power increased they would be able to buy a much larger proportion of the Australian citrus crop, but [ shall not dilate further on that aspect of tlie subject at the moment. Citrus fruits are health-giving, but thousands of Australian families cannot purchase them because they have no margin over what is required to purchase the bare necessaries of life. Consequently, fruit on many orchards is left to rot on the ground. 1 believe that the Acting Minister for Commerce will take this matter up with enthusiasm during the recess, and I hope that he will be able to make a satisfactory report! to Parliament when it meets again.

The partial lifting of the restrictions by the Government of New Zealand has resulted in a larger quantity of Australian citrus fruits going to New Zealand now than even went to that country before the embargo was imposed, but the fruit mainly comes from South Australia and a part of Victoria. I hope that in addition to this bill, which I am glad to note has the support of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Probably if the Forde), there will be further scientific investigation of the citrus areas on tbe eastern coast, in order, .if possible, to enable the growers in those areas to export their fruit to New Zealand. The bounty offered under this billis to be paid for three years on a sliding scale. The growers are pleased that it, has not been restricted to one year. ' As the result, of the payment of the bounty, a large quantity of citrus fruit will be exported overseas, and the result will'""he a diminution of the quantity of fruit that'will be sold on the local market, with a consequent appreciation in the local prices. Therein will be the indirect, benefit that some of my constituents will enjoy. New Zealand is anxious to have the disability which",47,Imports Into United Kingdom
99,Mr Gardner (Robertson) [4.45],"reacts against the lifting of the embargo against the importation of oranges from the eastern parts of Australia removed, and to that end it has sent several experts to the eastern Australian citrus-growing districts to investigate the matter. It cannot be gainsaid that at least in certain times of the year there is no danger of harni resulting to New Zealand from the import of oranges from those districts. When the Minister for Defence( Mr of the Commonwealth Government to try Thorby) was Assistant Minister for Commerce, his experience in the New South Wales Department of Agriculture Stood him well in his efforts on behalf of the citrus industry of New South Wales to eliminate this trouble. I trust that the department will not allow the splendid work that he did to remain incomplete. New Zealand-is anxious to meet the growers of New South Wales, and I think that if further scientific investigation is undertaken the present difficulties can be surmounted. I hope that the efforts that have been made to ensure that this bounty will be paid to the citrus growers will have the desired results. I understand that every precaution has been taken to ensure that the bounty will go into the pockets of the growers themselyes. I commend to the citrus-growers the need for them to organize. I regret the disunity that exists among them. They should realize that they would have more hope of obtaining assistance from the Government if they presented a united front. ' It is essential that this, industry should be assisted. The wealth of the country comes from the soil and, although the citrus industry does not rank in importance with the wheat and wool industries, it does contribute substantially to the wealth as well as to the health of the nation. tection is the declared policy of Australia and, in that respect, there is no reason why the primary industries should not be on the same footing as the secondary industries. The citrus industry is also entitled to consideration by reason of the fact that there is no justification for any section of industry to be called' upon' to carry the burden of national policy. will admit' that the citrus industry was disorganized as the result of the embargo which was imposed by New Zealand in retaliation for the embargo which was placed on the importation into Australia of New Zealand potatoes. Ever since that action was taken, the producers who had been planting in anticipation of an extended market in New Zealand have been prejudiced by national policy. In these circumstances, there is an obligation on the part to compensate the growers. Secondary industries have protection, because their costs are higher than are the costs in competitive countries, and, on the ground that tariffs add to the growers' costs, the citrus industry is entitled to assistance. The popular conception was that when the New Zealand embargo was lifted there would be no need for further assistance to the citrus-growers, but prices slump when there is a surplus of the fruit. Citrus fruits are perishable and cannot be held back from the market. The Government 13 justified in granting this assistance to enable the citrus industry to recover from the harm that occurred when'the New Zealand embargo was in full force. The bounty will be paid on a sliding scale, for three years. That is of benefit to the growers. It must be recognized that, although the embargo in New Zealand has been removed from fruit which comes from fruit-fly-free areas, it is the declared policy of the Government of New Zealand to purchase the dominion's citrus requirements through one organization, thus eliminating competition. I believe that the Government has taken the fact that the elimination of competition in New Zealand will result in reduced returns from that dominion into consideration in deciding to pay this bounty as a means of assisting the citrus-growers in exploiting and securing some competition from markets in other parts of the world. I commend to the growers what was said by the Acting Minister for Commerce( Mr Archie Cameron) about their need to organize on a united basis. That is good advice. While the citrus-growers are divided,, their interests are prejudiced. I hope that the market for citrus fruits Every' honourable member in the eastern countries will be extended. I impress upon the House, however, the fact that this bounty is to be-payable only",48,Imports Into United Kingdom
100,Mr Nocx (Riverina) [4.55],"Proin respect of fruit that is shipped abroad to places other than New Zealand; it is not a bounty on production, nor on all exports, and the amount is most moderate. lities now satisfactory for the export of fruit over long distances? satisfactory for fruit exported from Western Australia and South Australia, but the journey from 'Sydney to England is rather too long, and the fruit does not usually arrive in the best condition. However, the taking of fruit off the Australian market tends to prevent a glut, and makes for better prices. [5.2] I support the bill, and I offer the Acting Minister for Commerce( Mr [Quorum formed.] I have here a table Archie Cameron) my congratulations, not only on bringing down this bill, but also on interesting himself in all phases of the fruit-growing industry, and on taking the trouble to acquaint himself with the difficulties that confront the inleave to have the table incorporated industry, difficulties which vary from State to State, and also in different parts of the one State. I believe that I speak .accurately when I say that no other primary industry has suffered more in the last six or seven years than has the citrus fruit-growing industry. In common with all primary industries,' it was, of course, the victim of the general depression, but it suffered more than most because oranges, grapefruit ancl other citrus fruits are unfortunately, and I believe wrongly, regarded as semi-luxuries. For that reasonthey arc among the first to be cut out when bad times come, and purchasing -power is reduced. Thus the industry associated with their production suffers more than those engaged in the production of basic necessities. The citrusgrowers have also suffered because of the increasing output of the industry. In the case of wheat, and other annual crops, production may be regulated from year to year, but that is not possible in the case of citrus fruit. The undoubted prosperity which the industry enjoyed before 1932 encouraged the growers in all States to plan ahead, and to go in for fairly heavy plantings of young trees. These are now coming into full bearing, and the industry is faced with the problem of finding a market for the increased production. This year,. it is estimated that the-production of oranges alone will exceed that of last year by 500,000 bushels. Finally, the industry has, if I may so describe it, been nailed to the cross of political expediency, both in this country and in New Zealand. member admits that the restriction of trade was not due to a desire to keep out , pests ? tent this matter of pests was not put in its true light. The estimated production of oranges for the year 1936-37 was 3,S56,889 bushels, while for 1937-3S the estimated production is 4,303,000. prepared by the officers of the Department of Commerce setting out the production of oranges for 1932-33, and tbe estimated production for each of the succeeding years up to 1937-3S. I ask Hansard. [Leave not granted.] Trade relations between New Zealand and Australia have been in an unsatisfactory condition for the last five or six years. I do not wish to dwell on the .cause; suffice it to say that differences have existed, and the citrus fruit-growing industry has suffered very severely in consequence. Those trade difficulties were the original cause of the embargo imposed by the Government of New Zealand on the importation of citrus fruits from this country. Some time ago, the Government of New Zealand embarked upon a policy for supplying the needs of that dominion in regard to citrus fruits entirely from its own territories, and orchards were established in the Cook Islands and elsewhere. While those efforts were not wholly successful, it is a fact that considerably more citrus fruit is being produced in New Zealand and the islands under its control than was the case five or six years ago. The desire of the Government of New Zealand to protect this newly established industry was one of the reasons for the imposition of the embargo on the importation of Australian citrus fruits, but there were other",49,Imports Into United Kingdom

105,Mr John Lawson,"To some exreasons. However, tlie position to-day is vastly improved. Tlie lionorable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) asked, by way restrictions on trade between New Zealand and Australia were really due to a desire to prevent the introduction of pests. We know that the excuse given both in New Zealand and Australia for the embargo was that New Zealand desired to protect itself against the introduction of the Mediterranean fruit-fly. To-day, however, New Zealand is prepared to admit citrus fruit without any restriction, except in regard to fruit grown in certain specified areas which cannot be guaranteed free from Mediterranean fruit-fly. Those areas are almost wholly within the the coastal districts of New South Wales represented by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Gardner) and myself. Most of the citrus-growing areas of Australia are free to export fruit to New Zealand throughout the whole of the year without restriction, and that, to a great degree, has had the effect of improving the general position. It is estimated that, during the present year, New Zealand will import from Australia 320,000 oases of 70 lb. each. For the three years prior to the imposition of the embargo by New Zealand, imports from Australia, were as follows:Year. 1930 1931 103,000 1932 Thus, the average importations over those three years amounted to 145,095 cases, and those were 60-lb. cases. Compare that with this year's estimated importation of 320,000 cases of 70 lb. each, which are equal to 373,333 cases of 60 lb. each. This is more than two and a half times the average quantity imported for each of the three years immediately prior to the which the citrus fruit-growers in New imposition of the embargo. That inSouth Wales have to contend is the dicates the extent to which the trade Mediterranean fruit-fly, which is exposition has improved in regard to citrus tremely difficult to eradicate. I suggest fruits, and it will be still further that, as a preliminary, this problem improved. It is proposed in this bill to inaugurate the Australian Agricultural Council. a long-distance policy for helping the The average commercial fruit-grower citrus fruit-growing industry by the is beset by a large number of granting of a bounty, not on fruit expests, and although lie is capable ported to New Zealand, which is a relaof dealing with many of them, he Mr John Lnvoxon.

It costs about of inter jectionj whether the 13s. a case to market fruit in Great Britain, where the market is much more precarious than in New Zealand and the wastage due to long distance transport much greater. Nevertheless, it is necessary to encourage exploitation of this and similar markets in order to relieve the local market of surplus production. The Acting Minister for Commerce expressed the hope that, during the next three years, the industry would put its house in order, and in this I entirely agree with him. It will not be an easy thing to do. I have to admit, as did the honourable member for Robertson, that the domestic affairs of the industry are not in the happiest state. There is a-certain amount of disruption within the industry itself. Several distinct organizations of growers are in existence, and I suggest that, when the Government is negotiating with the representatives of the industry, it should see that it gets into' touch with the representatives of all the organizations whioh -justifiably claim to represent important sections of the industry. There is a Fruit Growers' Federation, which represents all sections of fruit-growers generally, and there is, in addition, the 60-lh. cnsi.'K. Hawkcsbury Citrus Association and the 100.000 Citrus Growers' Defence Association, .. 105,000 which are especially representative of the citrus fruit-growers. I understand that, in recent negotiations between the Minister and the representatives of the industry, the last two organizations were ignored. I suggest that they be invited to send representatives to discuss their problems with the department. In my opinion, the chief difficulty with should be brought under the notice of cannot deal very adequately, particuCouncil at its next meeting, which, I larly in tbe coastal areas of New South understand, is to take place in August, Wales, with tlie Mediterranean f r u it fly (ind endeavour .to formulate some scheme for tbe simple reason that flanking the whereby this problem can be tackled in a citrus-growing districts in the coastal much more effective way than it is at areas is a multitude of back-yard present.

I was unable to understand the statement -made by the lionorable member for Riverina( Mr New Zealand potatoes has had a disNock) that New South Wales citrusgrowers were unable to ship their fruit to Great Britain. quantity of the fruit was damaged before it arrived on the British market land in 1935 I had an opportunity to sec New South Wales citrus fruits exhibited for sale in the borough markets. The lemons exhibited were of especially good quality and, judging by appearances alone, the oranges were equal to any exhibited for sale. That fruit was packed in New South Wales and shipped from Sydney, and commanded the highest prices. In 19-28, the South African citrusgrowers were shipping a good deal of fruit to England, but much of it was of inferior quality. The South African Government offered inducements to the citrus-growers to produce varieties which were found to be. most popular in the markets of the Old Country, with the result that when I was in England1 saw a Union Castle boat at Southhampton unloading over 50,000 bushels of South African oranges, which upon inspection proved to be as good as any produced in any other part of the world. I was informed that, as the result of the assistance granted to the citrus-growers by the Government of South Africa, the quality of the product had improved materially. I urge upon the Minister the desirability of instituting inquiries to ascertain the most favoured varieties in the export markets with a view to producing those varieties especially for export. In the opinion of the English buyers the Australian oranges have too many seeds in them; but no fault is found with the condition of the oranges on arrival on tlie English market. The citrus industry is well worth fostering and I trust that every honourable member in this House will support this bill as representing an effort on the part of the Government to improve the conditions of the industry. Honourable members opposite too frequently blame Tasmania for the absence of markets for Australian citrus fruits, and only too often do we hear the statement repeated that, the embargo placed upon the importation of astrous effect on the citrus industrygenerally. As I have said on many occasions, the embargo on the importation of certain New Zealand potatoes had nothing whatever to do. with the decision of the New Zealand Government to impose an embargo in respect of the importation of Australian citrus fruits grown in certain areas. disease in Australian cherries, the New Zealand Government will not permit their importation. that if the cherries are grown in an area infested with fruit fly, but I am quite sure that no embargo is placed on the importation of cherries from disease-free areas. Tasmania had much the same experience as New South Wales in connection with its attempts to eradicate orchard pests. As a preventive measure the Tasmanian Government passed a law which requires that all trees grown in back yards must be sprayed, and provides that those found to be infested with disease may be destroyed.. In Tasmania a householder must either keep his trees clean or lose them. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) that a neglected orchard is a veritable nursery"" for pests. Apparently, however, the New South Wales Government is afraid to bring in a law requiring all householders to keep their fruit trees clean, and because of that the commercial fruit-g'rowers are penalized. The CommonAvealth Government has no power to deal with these matters except in relation to the Federal Capital Territory. They come within the province of the States, and unless the State governments bring down legislation designed to aid the fruit-growers in theeradication of insect pests, the fruit-growers will continue to suffer heavy losses. I approve the main purpose of this bill. I congratulate the Acting Minister for Commerce( Mr Archie Cameron)",52,Imports Into United Kingdom

I suggest, however, that the period hero fixed is too short to achieve any practical results in certain most important directions, and that the tapering oft' is too sharp to give either a sense of security, even for the period covered by the bounty, or the necessary encouragement to induce growers to incur the risk, trouble and expense of establishing a stable, self-supporting market. less than five years. honourable member; and the tapering down should be no sharper than at the rate of 3d. a case a year. Most of the trouble in this industry has been experienced in New South Wales, which has never exported considerable quantities of citrus fruits other than to New Zealand. for three years will not be siifficient to induce any grower to make a change of the varieties grown. In the past, a consistent plan has been followed only in South Australia, and the results have been so uncertain and discouraging that it is unlikely that this bounty will lead to any considerable development or improvement of the existing, rather chaotic, and struggling condition of the industry. However, for the present year the bounty is on a' satisfactory basis, and the provision in respect of subsequent years can be dealt with when the time arrives. I , therefore, do not press the Minister for any alteration of the schedule to the billthat the Acting Minister for CommerceI n committee, however, I propose to direct attention to the safeguards provided in respect of the growers, for whom the bounty is being provided. As the bill is drafted, some fruit may pass into the bands of dealers and be exported by them, the grower being unaware that he is entitled to the bounty. Some obligation should be placed upon the exporter to notify the grower of his intention to export, and thus enable the grower to apply for the bounty. I have much To pleasure in supporting the bill. [Quorum formed.} with other honourable members in congratulating the Government upon having introduced this measure, and the Acting Minister for Commerce( Mr Archie Cameron) on the able manner in which, so far, lie has handled it. I consider that he has made quite a good showing as a Minister in this House, and that he should be commended for the work he is doing. I am not altogether enamored of bounties, but in the present instance a bounty is justified. In the first year it will be at the rate of 2s. a case, in the second year at the rate of Is. 6d. a case, and in the third year at the rate of Is. a case. Some of the finest oranges grown in the world are produced in the electorate of Boothby. WhilstI was in London as Agent-General for South Australia, many experimental shipments of oranges were made from that State, and I was pleased at the manner in which they were received on the London market; there was a great demand for them, and eventually a good trade was developed. Even when the Encouragement of this sort embargo on the export to New Zealand was imposed, oranges from Renmark and the Torrens Valley were admitted into that dominion. The bill is drafted on right lines, and I hope that it will have a speedy passage. Certain remarks have been made in regard to the period of the bounty.

I have asked questions in the last fortnight or so about the refusal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to broadcast the address of the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, Dr. Wand, from St. Barnabas' Church, Ithaca, at 7 o'clock in the morning, and the",55,Imports Into United Kingdom

127,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [6.3],"Ireplies that I have received are not satisfactory. that the public objects to commissions and boards created by Parliament which become autocratic and egotistical in the extreme and develop an exaggerated opinion of their own importance and a disregard for the general public. The position into which the Australian Broadcasting Commission is drifting is one that calls for investigation and reorganization of the commission itself and of its activities. I was amazed recently to read in the press of the Australian Broadcasting Commission's refusal to provide facilities for Archbishop Wand, of Brisbane, to broadcast from St. Barnabas' Church, Ithaca, on the occasion of the church's jubilee. The press paragraph sets out the reason as one of cost. Minister, in reply to a question, said that broadcast by Archbishop Wand last Sunthe General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission had advised that the granting of the request would entail a special opening of the station at 7 o'clock on Sunday morning, whereas the normal broadcasting hours were from 6.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. on week days, and from 8 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. on Sundays, and that the commission considered that the present hour of opening on Sundays, viz. 8 a.m., was a reasonable one. I am not satisfied with that reply. Archbishop Wand and the church authorities in Brisbane in particular and in Queensland generally are also dissatisfied. It was pointed out that the refusal was in accordance with an agreement with the Postmaster-General's Department not to broadcast church services except at 11 a.m. and 7.30 p.m. This, in my opinion, is absurd, for three reasons: 1. On occasions, several times a year, mission from whose decision there apparSt. Barnabas' Church services have ently is no appeal. This is surely a been broadcast at 7 a.m., such as negation of democracy. The power of the on tribution of palms and the first overrides democracy, and if I were the communions, the servioe being followed head of a government it would not be by a breakfast at which the address is tolerated ' for five minutes. Ministers given by some notable person. 2. Many people prefer their religious protest against the unreasonable attitude exercises early in the morning. The 11 adopted by the commission, but when o'clock service is distinctly weak in many they are asked to do something they say churches. Mr Forde. 3. Cost of overtime is alleged, but what It is no wonder is that compared with the high feessome say hundreds of pounds-pai d to certain individuals for half an hour's performance. It also must beborne in mind that the Australian Broadcasting Commission makes good profits, in view of which the extra cost would have been trifling. 4. Recently the test match results were broadcast until 4 o'clock in the morning for several days, and I presume the forthcoming matches will also be broadcast. I do not say one word against the broadcasting of' the test matches. They are justified. In the opinion of all fair minded people, however, the needs of religion deserve au equally sympathetic consideration. The PrimeI would also add to the refusal of the day week, the refusal to broadcast the Premier of Queensland last August at S a.m. from St. Barnabas' Church, when he gave an address to the communicants. Mr Eorgan Smith's address was distinctly non-party and if it had been allowed to be broadcast from the national station his hearers would have derived benefit from it. When the commission refused to broadcast the address one of the commercial stations filled the gap. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has also refused to broadcast the Anglican Annual Communion Breakfast of that church, at which Mr E. A. Cooper, the State Treasurer of Queensland, is to give the address. Although that address will be non-political the commission refuses to broadcast either the service or the address at the breakfast. The lesson from all this is that Parliament has delegated its powers to a comPalm Sunday, for the discommission savours of dictatorship which when approached individually say that they are in sympathy with those who that they cannot intervene. I wish, to emphasize that the Golden Jubilee of the St. Barnabas' Church in Queensland was regarded as of sufficient importance that the press gave much space to it before and after the event, ancl yet the Australian Broadcasting Commission would not broadcast at that function the speech of a very eminent Anglican Archbishop, who has shown on more than one occasion that he is a broad, tolerant man with very high Australian ideals. I ask the Minister to bring my complaint before the Cabinet meeting on Monday with a view to having the policy of the Australian Broadcasting Commission reviewed and to have permission granted for the broadcast of the services ancl addresses at the annual communal breakfast at St. Barnabas' Church in the near future at which the Treasurer of Queensland is to deliver a non-political address. -The Minister representing the Postmaster-General( Mr Perkins) promised to try to get for me a report on the extraordinary censorship by the Australian Broadcasting Commission of Judge Foster's proposed lecture on encroachments upon personal liberty in Australia. Judge Foster accepted an invitation by the commission to speak from an "" A "" class station on the subject of personal liberty, but, when some members of the commission objected to certain parts of his address, and it was censored, he decided not to speak. Judge Foster, whose proposed address I have read, carefully avoided any interference with or any statement that might be construed as hurting the religious susceptibilities of any section of the community. The people of Victoria, who, possibly, know Judge Foster better than do people in other parts of the country, although he is well known throughout the Commonwealth, were'so disgusted at the attitude of the commission that I , along with other honourable members, was asked to raise the matter on the floor of the House. Ministers may be surprised to know that honourable members do not like bringing matters before Parliament; they would rather settle them privately with the Ministers, because that is a better way of having things done. The Minister repre[104] senting the Postmaster-General, however, is in a difficult position, because, when the Parliament is in recess, there is no need for him to represent the Postmaster General, and he does not do so. I do not blame the Minister in this matter. The people of Victoria demand a final answer from the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and I should be pleased if the Minister would approach the commission with a view to obtaining a report for submission to Parliament. I cannot understand the attitude of the commission because the Australian people, as a whole, possess a broad outlook on questions of religion. In the lecture which he submitted to the commission, Judge Foster referred to some figures of the past, and I am led to believe that some of the members of the commission thought that he should not be allowed to do so. The great body of public opinion in Victoria, and I think in the rest of Australia, is that there was nothing in Judge Foster's lecture that warranted the drastic blue pencilling which it received from the commission', and which led to the cancellation of the address. The bigoted attitude which the commission adopted in this matter is itself an encroachment upon the liberty of the people. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 7.30 p.m. rise to discuss a matter regarding which I have been in correspondence with the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) for some time. It was also the subject of a recent interview between us. It concerns certain grants made available by the Commonwealth Government to the various State governments for the purpose of encouraging metalliferous mining, largely for the purpose of providing work for the unemployed. In December, 1934, at the invitation of the 'Commonwealth Government, Ministers for Mines in the various State governments were called into conference at Melbourne to discuss this matter, and at that conference the 'Commonwealth Government agreed-to make assistance available. It was actually decided to make the grant available for only one year, but it was subsequently agreed that payments should be continued for a period of three years. It was expected that the scheme would be put into operation immediately, but delays occurred, and it",56,Casey
128,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports).,,58,Casey
129,Mr Eiordan (Kennedy) [7.30],"I was not until February, 1935, that the first money was made available. By July, 1935, the scheme was fairly launched. Queensland submitted a definite proposition, and because it presented a good case, it succeeded in obtaining the largest share of the grant. In 1935-36, the first year in which the scheme was in operation, the Commonwealth Government contributed £70,000. This sum, together with the £10,000 made available by the State Government, was expended during the fifteen months which followed the inauguration of the scheme, and the result was a marked revival of metalliferous mining in the back country of Cairns, Chillagoe and Charters Towers. At the request of the Commonwealth Government, in 1935, representatives of various States again attended a conference for the purpose of reviewing the progress of the scheme, and at that conference strong representations were made to the Minister in Charge of Development for the continuance of the Commonwealth grant for at least three years, as originally intended. The Commonwealth subsequently advised the States that it had approved of the continuance of assistance, but on a reduced scale. In the succeeding financial years, 1936-37 and 1937-38, Queensland received from the Commonwealth Government £35,600 Queensland has always observed strictly the requirements laid down by the Commonwealth Government for the expenditure of the grant, which was made available to the States solely for the purpose of bringing about a revival in metalliferous mining'and a consequent decrease of unemployment. If the Queensland Government has desired to give assistance in any particular direction^ it has always asked the Commonwealth Government to state whether or not such assistance would be within the terms of the grant. The conditions laid down by the conference have also been observed. importance of such a scheme, having as its object the rejuvenation of a valuable industry, such as metalliferous mining, can be readily appreciated. Many years ago, thousands of miners were engaged in all forms of metalliferous mining, particularly in the back country around Chillagoe. This particular portion of Queensland has in latter years, however, Mr jBiortion. become more or less deserted. The 'Commonwealth grant has assisted men to recommence prospecting in these areas which, from the point of view of metalliferous mining, are as rich as any in the world. To-day, the town of Chartors Towers is languishing, yet towards the end of the last century it was a prosperous mining centre .of considerable importance. It still has a population of approximately 10,000, however, and in recent years the number of unemployed has reached 700. As the result of the Commonwealth Government's assistance to the mining industry, many of these unfortunate people have been able to undertake gold prospecting activities again. Some of them have been very successful. It is not necessary for me to mention their, names, but, if required, details can be obtained from the government authorities. In the interests of these people, I appeal to the Treasurer for a continuance of Commonwealth assistance to the metalliferous mining industry in Queensland. Should the scheme be abandoned, a severe blow will be dealt at out-back communities, particularly in Charters Towers. Not onJy are the miners' organizations vitally interested in the continuation of this grant, but grave concern is being evinced by shire councils and chambers of and £24,900 respectively. commerce. These bodies have requested me to do what I can to urge the Treasurer to extend the Commonwealth assistance for at least two years, even though it be on a sliding scale. It is feared that mining activities will be seriously restricted should the grant cease. The Queensland Government at present holds a substantial unexpended balance in a trust account. That surplus is there chiefly because it was learned some months ago that the Commonwealth Government intended to withdraw its assistance as from midnight to-night, The and expenditure was consequently restricted. The sum at present held in trust, however, would last for no more than three months. I again appeal to the Treasurer to give serious consideration to the urgent requests for the continuation of a grant that means much to a portion of Australia which, in the past, has been, neglected and has not received Ae treatment to which it has been entitled. Should the grant be continued, even on a sliding scale, it would do much to give many out-back localities some semblance of population. In the past the State Government has made money available to prospectors who applied for ""prospectors' assistance"" namely, £2 a week for married men and £1 a week for single men. Assistance was also granted in other directions. In these northern areas, there are mines that have been neglected for many years ancl have, consequently, become filled with ment of the empty spaces of the north is water. Assistance was given by the State Government for the purchase of the necessary machinery to pump the water from the mines, but as soon as mining was resumed the money borrowed had to be repaid. It is largely as the result of these repayments that the trust fund account has It has been possible for the State Governshould be of great assistance to the minment, with the assistance of the mining grant, to undertake metallurgical investiimpetus to the work of prospectors. The gations which have proved of great value to the mining industry in the north. Assay officers have been established throughout the mining districts and many metallurgists have been employed in assaying the numerous samples, submitted by prospectors. If the grant is withdrawn many of these men will be thrown out of employment. The Queensland Government is doing, and will continue to do, everything possible to keep men in employment, and the provision of this grant has enabled it to assist thousands of miners in the sparsely populated areas of northern Queensland. Many thousands of pounds were made available out of the grant from the development of the Portland Roads mine, one of the finest mines in northern Queensland. By the provision of those funds it was possible to construct ment. It is to assist those prospectors, a jetty and also a road from Portland Roads across the Iron Range to the ' Batavia gold-fields. These iron mines are reputed to be 67 per cent, propositions, ancl their developmentwill benefit the areas in which they are situated. I have given these particulars as to how the grant has been spent, not because I think the Queensland Government may be accused of having squandered it-to use a colloquial expression, "" It is pretty tight withits hand-out,"" because it realizes the value of the grant when utilized in association with a policy directed towards securing the greatest benefit from every pound spent. This grant has enabled 'the'mining industry in northern Queensland to be lifted out of the doldrums. I shudder to think what will happen in the mining districts of the north if it be discontinued. I therefore appeal to the Treasurer to continue it for at least two years, even if on a diminishing scale. We all know that from a defence viewpoint the settlevery desirable; the mining grant has enabled the Queensland Government to keep a large number of men employed in profitable occupation in outback districts. The Commonwealth Government, in association with the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia, is been built up. conducting a geophysical survey of the northern portions of Australia, which"" ing industry of Queensland and give Treasurer is well aware of the need for the continuance of the grant because of the large amount of correspondence which has been addressed to him in regard to it. The Government recently announced -that it has entered into an agreement with the British Government to finance a migration scheme for the settlement of migrants in this country, on a fifty-fifty basis, but at the same time it proposes to withdraw this measure of assistance to the Queensland Government which has utilized it for the purpose of keeping in employment good Australians of the best type in the outlying districts of the north. As the result of assistance granted to prospectors in the Charters Towers district, a new field was recently discovered which shows signs of profitable developwho are prepared to leave the civilized centres on our eastern coasts and go into the outback in search of gold and other metals, that I make this plea to the Treasurer to-night. It has been said that this grant is to be discontinued because the money is needed for defence purposes. In my opinion, this grant might well be continued in the cause of defence, because it will help to keep in outback areas men of the hardy pioneering type who would be our best defenders in case of need. [Quorum formed.] avail myself of this opportunity to bring before the House a very serious complaint in connection with the issuing of licences to B class broadcasting stations in Tasmania. A little over two years ago, a gentleman came to my place and informed me that he had made application for the issue of a B class broadcasting licence at Hobart. I communicated with the Postmaster-General, and received a reply to the effect that, as several other applications had already been received for the issue of B class licences, no further confine his remarks to those matters for applications could be considered. Since then, however, several B class licences have been granted. A few weeks ago, I asked the Minister representing the Postmaster-tGeneral( Mr Perkins) if the whole of the correspondence in connection with these applications would be laid on the table of the Library. My request was refused, for what reason I do not know. Why should this "" hush-hush "" policy be adopted with regard to this matter? I also applied for a B class licence on behalf of the Trades Hall, Hobart; that application was also refused. The Premier of Hobart and the Minister for Agriculture, both reputable men, have made applications for B class licences, but have met with no better success. The newspapers and prominent business people in Tasmania have a virtual monopoly of commercial broadcasting in that State, with the result that Labour men are unable to place their views before the public through the medium of broadcasting. In this respect, Tasmanians have been more badly treated than the people of any other State. I have been unable to ascertain why the Postmaster-General refused to table the correspondence in conplies for that industry, the forests of the nexion with the issue of these licences. I doubt very much now whether any applications preceded that sponsored by me two years ago. One is forced to ask what influence is brought to bear in connection with the issuing of these licences. It is time a public inquiry was instituted into this matter to ascertain why it is that a monopoly is granted to a few people to control commercial broadcasting in Tasmania. I support the remarks of the honourable formerly permitted the denudation of member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) in their forest areas have now altered theii regard to the need for the continuance of the mining grant to assist in the development of the northern parts of Queensland. In my opinion, die Government would do well to reconsider its decision in this respect. On the south-west coast of Tasmania there are many miles of very rough country which has never been prospected. Recently tin has been discovered there, and the country also carries osmiridium, gold, and other minerals. Order!

The remarks of the honourable gentleman showed clearly that he was not aware of the nature of the document with which the House is dealing. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) spoke of . the metalliferous mining grant. This matter has been considered by the Government on many occasions. The grant was made, at the nadir of the depression in order to enable the States to help miners. A decision' having been reached, the Government cannot reconsider this matter. The grant must end on the 30th June this year; I shall bring under the notice of the Postmaster-iGeneral (Senator A. J. McLachlan) the representations of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Sir Isaac Forde) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) regarding the Postal Department. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) spoke of an under-estimate by the Minister for the honourable member has not remained in so. the chamber to hear the explanations for which he asked, I can only repeat mates, not the Estimates proper. They are merely the amounts by which the ordinary Estimates have been over-expended. The payment has been taken out of the Treasurer's Advance. The whole of the money was fully expended in the year which ended twelve months ago to-day. vanced for the relief of distress among the unemployed in addition to the £1,000 ? whatever amount was spent under that heading.

I would not do so at this stage .. .. .. 23 had been presented, because I have no 10 wish to detain honourable members. The first matter relates to the failure of the 13 Customs Department to deal adequately with the methods employed by a cotton combine., known as Coates Limited, in its McEwen, J. endeavours to force an Australian firm of Nairn, W. M . manufacturers' agents, indentors and Paterson, T. warehousemen out of business. It is Prowse, J. H . interesting to follow the methods emRankin, G. J. ployed by the Coates combine to achieve Street, G. A. its purpose. The Australian firm comThompson, V. C. menced trading in March, 1937, but the Tellers: unscrupulous methods adopted by the Gardner. S. L . combine to create a monopoly by selling Nock, H . K . certain lines below landed cost will eventually destroy its business. No one will Sheehan, T. deny the right of this firm to conduct a Ward, E. J. business in Australia such as that conducted by the Coates combine in other Gander, J. H . parts of the world, but no outside firm or Riordan. W. J. F. combine should be permitted to use its influence and its wealth to crush a competitor. Three different brands of cotton manufactured by the combine,, known as ""Hercules"", ""New Century"", ancl ""Martlet"" were landed in Australia. Samples of all three were tested by the customs authorities in tlieir Sydney laboratory, and the "" Martlet"" sample was found to be a better quality cotton than either of the other two brands. It is obvious that the combine set out to market, not an inferior grade of cotton, but an equally substantial cotton as its major line at a lower price, in its efforts to squeeze out its competitors. In a letter dated the 16th May, asking the Customs to the matter, the Australian firm was informed that it had been referred to Canberra, and that appropriate action had been taken. Further inquiries revealed that it had been referred to Australia House, London, with instructions that the Coates combine should be interviewed in London with a view to having production costs produced.

195,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [9.15].,"to some extent, touches upon, the right of the department to examine costs of production in regard to articles imported into Australia. I understand that the required information was withheld hy the combine. This indicates how the Ottawa Agreement operates in regard to these matters, when the Australian manufacturer is compelled to produce his costs of production, while his competitor, a wealthy overseas combine, is permitted to refuse to supply that information. The Collector of Customs then used his right under the act to assess a legitimate value on all importations of ""Martlet"" sewing cotton, and I am informed that duty is being levied on a price which is equivalent to the home price of "" Hercules"" cotton. Whether the manufacturers have increased the invoiced price of ""Martlet"" or not, I am not in a position to say, but the fact is that the combine has not made any change in its selling prices, and it still continues to sell goods to the customers of the Australian firm at prices below landed cost. It has recently been stated that the same article is now being imported in colours as well as in black and white, and is sold at a ridiculous price. If this information is correct, it will be hopeless for the Australian firm to attempt to carry on. The Australian firm asked that this matter be ventilated in the appropriate quarter with a view to having action taken to prevent this worldwide combine from using methods in Australia, which have been effective in other countries to crush all competitors. It is not right that an Australian firm should be treated in this way, nor is it right that answer to my question is correct and not the power, wealth an'd influence of any combine should be permitted to override the powers of the Customs Department. It is the duty of this Parliament to take steps to see that no combine is permitted to continue these practices. Yesterday, I asked the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) a question concerning instructions issued to departmental heads in the capital cities. It has been reportedI know that it has actually occurred-that certain selected members of staffs have been asked whether, in the event of war in which Australia is involved, they would be willing to offer themselves for defence work either at home or abroad. I asked further what steps had been taken by the Government to protect employees who felt that in answering unfavorably they might be subjected directly or indirectly to victimization. The reply I received readFrom tlie information given by the honourable member, it is not possible to give a direct reply, but if he w ill furnish further details inquiries w ill be made. Speaking generally, those specific instructions of the nature referred to have been issued by the department. District base commandants have certain responsibilities for the preparation of plans for an emergency which involves consideration of staffing requirements. My question had no relation whatever to base commandants, but applied to the heads of Commonwealth departments. I clo not know whether this action has been taken in Canberra, but I know that questions have been asked in Sydney. I should like to know who issued instructions to heads of Commonwealth departments to arrange interviews with selected members of the staffs, and if the Government did not issue these instructions, am I to understand from the reply given that the base commandants have power to do so without the knowledge of the Government? I cannot believe that that is the case, but if it is we are entitled to know whether departmental heads or members of the military forces have such authority. If no such authority has been issued, the members' of the public service concerned will appreciate an expression of opinion on the subject. They are entitled to know who issued the instructions, and if the evasive, I take it that no such instructions have been issued by the Government and that heads of departments have no authority to clo what has been done. by some of Eric Campbell's mob. tain departments may be endeavouring to set up organizations or ascertain from members of their staffs whether they .would be willing to do certain things, not only in regard to war, but perhaps in connection with civil matters. Another matter which I should like the Government to consider is the advisability of extending superannuation benefits to those officers who",67,Federal Members Rooms Department What Had Been Done In Regard

At that time honourable members expressed the opinion that no section of the public service sliould receive special treatment in this respect and that superannuation benefits should be available to all Government servants. officers who come in close contact with Ministers are fortunate enough to get their ear and have the Superannuation Act applied to them, other officers should have a similar privilege. trust that during this recess the Government will look into this matter to see if it is not practicable to extend superannuation benefits to the officers employed in the Federal Members' rooms in the various States. Many of us are prone to forget the very valuable services which these officers render. They undertake foi us work of a personal nature, and in many respects carry out responsibilities the value of which it is difficult to assess.
