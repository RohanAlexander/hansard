15,Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes,"for which the Postmaster-General's Department called tenders, schedule number C7808, which closed on 4th March, are to be used for television or for telecommunication, or for both, as I understand they can be. If they are to be used for television, are the commercial stations to be accommodated on the same link, or will it be for ABV Channel2 only? Secondly, has this method of telecommunication been operating between Calais and Dover since the 1930's. and last year were all major European cities tied up to London on a television programme on micro-wave? Thirdly, when these towers are erected, will all important country centres be able to receive television by bleeding off the main trunk micro-wave routes? Fourthly, is it a fact that the Melbourne-Adelaide link by micro-wave would cost just over £300,000, as against £2.250,000 for a link by coaxial cable? the honourable member would expect me to be able to answer offhand these highly technical and fairly lengthy questions. It is possible that the steel towers are being considered in connection with the development of a micro-wave system, and if it became necessary eventually to use such a system for the development of television, both national and commercial, I think they would be so used. However, I cannot give the honourable member a firm undertaking to that effect immediately. I undertake to have his other questions fully investigated and to give him a considered reply. of the Minister for Immigration to a booklet entitled ""Australia needs all these people"", issued by the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council. On pages 14 and 15 of this booklet two photographs are shown, one of a workman, and the other of a number of people being naturalized. The caption reads, "" British by birth (left); British by naturalization (right)"". Is it a fact that at naturalization ceremonies the candidates, after taking the oaths of renunciation and allegiance, are informed that they are now Australian citizens? If so, why does the caption read "" British by naturalization "" rather than "" Australian by naturalization ""? Is it because the Government and the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council still regard Australia as a British colony? possibly been a typographical error on the part of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council. By the naturalization ceremony people become British subjects and Australian citizens, but whether we are naturalized or native-born Australian citizens, I hope we are still British. Minister a question which deals with finance for education. Whilst the Government's ready endorsement of the Murray report promises a most acceptable development of this country's tertiary, education, I am concerned with the serious situation of primary and secondary schools, and I ask the Prime Minister whether in view of his statement some lime ago that "" there is no legal reason why the Commonwealth should not come to the rescue of the States in the education field "", the Government might, in the immediate future, prepare a plan for federal aid which would help to overcome serious problems in relation to buildings, equipment, salaries and training of teachers. the honourable member that we have come to the aid of the States in a very big way through our decision regarding universities. For other forms of education and building construction, this Government has, more and more every year, found money for the States.

I have no evidence, and I have never heard it suggested, that buyers' rings of any kind are operating in the Australian wool market. I feel reasonably confident that if they had been operating, that fact would have been brought to the attention of the Government, the department or myself. Nevertheless, knowing the honourable member's great interest in this matter, I will ask the department to gather whatever facts it can, and convey the information to me. I shall then be only too happy to discuss the matter with the honourable member. the question asked by the honourable member for Chisholm, I ask the Postmaster General whether there is a micro-wave link between Melbourne and Hobart at a place known as Arthur's Seat. If so, would not another reflector give Hobart the benefit of television?

Are statistics available showing the production figures for both the local market and for' export? substantial increase in the tuna catch and in tuna canning in Australia. Since 1949, when my good friend, the honourable member for Lalor, commenced research into the tuna industry, I think the catch has increased steadily. It was something like 95 tons in 1951-52, and increased to more than 1,000 tons last year. This year it is expected that 1,200 tons will be caught. An increasing proportion of the catch is now being exported, and is an earner of foreign exchange. As to the waters, I cannot remember whether catches are taking place in the surveyed areas, but I know that there has been an increase in both New South Wales and South Australian waters. It is not thought that Queensland offers sufficient potential to justify operations there. As to statistics, I understand that there are only two major canners. It is not usual to make detailed statistics available in such circumstances. Minister for Trade whether he has seen a letter which has been sent to members of Parliament by a member of the Tariff Board in which it is alleged, against the by Mr Date, a member of the Tariff Board, and, I think undoubtedly signed by him.

30,Mr Mcewen,"A couple of hours ago,letter raises any new point of legal consequence, it will be treated in a similar way. AllI can do is to assure the House that, in all the multitude of points of this character that Mr Date has raised over the years, there has never been a suggestion by the Government's legal advisers that the Tariff Board or the Government has been acting improperly. Mr Clyde Cameron -He says that you altered the nature of the report; that you left out certain parts. whatever of any Tariff Board report being altered after receipt by me as the responsible Minister. I give an unqualified and immediate assurance on that point. deleted? altered and no minority report has been deleted by me or by an officer of the Department of Trade during my administration of the department. If Mr Date claims that there has been an omission of any minority report or any alteration of such report subsequent to his having indicated his position in respect of the report, then that claim will be investigated. Mr Clyde Cameron -He referred to the printed report. my mind on the letter, but Mr Date is liable to make such a claim. If he did, it will be investigated. To put this matter a little more into its correct perspective, I say that of the hundreds of members of the multitudes of boards connected with the administration of this country, Mr Date must surely hold the record for protests on legal and other points. I think that over the last two or three years, his protests addressed to me as the Minister, to the permanent head of the department, to the Prime Minister, to Mr Speaker, and to the Governor General now number about 150. He has the record for all time. Trade a question supplementary to the question that he has just answered. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether, instead of brushing aside this matter in the way that he has, he will address himself specifically to what is suggested in the letter. The suggestion is that the views of a responsible person on the Tariff Board have not been included in the official report. I ask the Minister: Is it known to him that any report by Mr Date, dissenting from the majority view of the Tarifl Board, has been excluded from the official report to the Parliament? Instead of generalizing in his airy-fairy manner, will the Minister address himself to that one question? to the questions that are asked. I shall repeat my reply because it was quite adequate. If Mr Date raises a question of law, as he has done in this letter Dr. EvattI am not talking about the law; I am talking about facts. about the issue which has been raised. You will not push me around. If Mr Date raises a question of law, it will be referred to the Government's legal advisers, as has always been done. That is the first point.

Upon which Dr. Evatt had moved by way of amendmentThat the following words be added to the address:"" But we desire to inform Your Excellency that Your advisers have failed to realize the urgent necessity of putting into effect positive policies and measures, aimed at(a) the prevention of unemployment and the securing of full employment; (b) the building of sufficient homes; (c) an immediate and substantial reduction in the migrant intake until the serious deficiencies present in the existing, prosibility in relation to this problem. gramme are removed; (d) the provision by the Commonwealth to State Governments and local governing authorities of funds necessary for the building of public works and housing, roads, schools, hospitals and services essential to public health; and (e) effective defence administration and organization."". the motion submitted by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser), and reject the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). It is natural that, in a debate of this nature, we should think in terms of the country's economic situation and discuss the various elements that make it up. Until the Leader of the Opposition spoke in this debate the Labour party was concentrating purely and simply on the unemployment problem, and completely ignoring the more favorable aspects of our economy. I believe it is right to say that members of the Labour party have ignored these aspects purposely in favour of an which is hard to ascertain. The number of persons who are registered for employment slightly exceeds 70,000; the number of those who are actually receiving unemployment benefit slightly exceeds 20,000. I suggest that the actual number of unemployed in the community at the present time is somewhere between those two ngures. It is impossible, within the department, to ascertain the actual figure and it is just as impossible for members of the Opposition to ascertain it.. I believe that unemployment is a matter which has to be reviewed from time to time by the Government and by all those who are interested in it. It is, particularly within our type of economy, something which cannot remain static. For many years there was a substantial shortage of labour, and during that period there was an inflationary tendency, the blame for which members of the Opposition did not hesitate to lay at the door of the Government. To-day, apparently, we have a surplus of labour and, of course, the members of the Opposition do not hesitate to blame the Government for being completely responsible for this condition. The Government has never denied that it has some responAt the recent Australian Loan Council meeting, the Government made additional money available to the States, particularly to New South Wales and Queensland, which have suffered worse than the other States from drought. The Government also approved a programme of increased borrowing by municipal authorities. More recently, the Government approved of the release by the central bank of £15,000,000 from special accounts. These actions represented an acceptance by the Governmeni of its responsibility in relation to this great problem. I am sure that each one of us can rest assured that, as may be necessary, the Government will do all within its power in relation to this matter. 1 feel that one is entitled to express regret that, while the Government, during",16,Waterfront Employment

58,Mr Hul Me (Petrie) [3.18],"I supportthe last Budget period, indicated its willingness to provide a substantial amount of money for the standardization of the railway gauge between Albury and Melbourne, there has not been an intensification of that work. I believe that a speeding-up of this project is highly desirable in order to take up the lag in the employment of unskilled labour but, apparently, something has gone wrong with the works, as it were. If the job could be hastened I believe that this would be of considerable assistance. The same can be said of the construcenvisaged by Mr Monk. tion of the Mount Isa railway.

62,Mr Hulme,"I am not concerned with the situation, 1 believe that we, in Australia, are entitled to expect an improvement in the prices which we shall obtain for our primary exports. Each one of us knows that, over the last twelve months, certain States, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, have been seriously affected by drought. I believe that the unemployment in the community to-day, to a very large degree, exists within primary industry because of the drought situation. This was to some degree the reason why the Government made additional funds available to New South Wales and Queensland for drought relief. We, a? a parliament, 1 believe, should think in terms of the comments made by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), on 27th February. The right honourable gentleman, who is perhaps the oldest member of the House, spoke to us in terms of what might be called drought mitigation. I think that much can be done to overcome the problems presented by the drought during the last twelve months if we adopt a national approach-o r plan, if that term is preferred-in relation to drought mitigation and flood mitigation. I turn now to a brief survey of the level of savings investment, the buoyancy of production in secondary industry, and the level of retail sales. Having examined these aspects of the economy, Mr Speaker, I think that there is every justification for confidence. In December last, the deposits of the major trading banks totalled £1,647.000,000. They had increased by £117,000,000 in twelve months, and by no less than £90,000,000 since June of last year, durin? which period no additional amounts were called up into the special accounts by the central bank. That is an important fact which should be considered side by side with the special relief given by the central bank by the release of £15.000,000 within the last week or so. But1 should like to point out that, in 1.957, advances by the banks increased by only £1,200,000. I do not understand why the increase was not greater. I am unable to say whether it was not greater because industry did not demand more from the banks, because the banks did not desire to lend more, or because of a policy determination by the central bank. It seems to me that, as deposits had increased by £117,000,000, there was an excellent opportunity for an expansion of advances in the same period. In the period that I am discussing, savings bank deposits increased by £78,000,000-o r almost 7 per cent-to £1,267,000,000. In 1957, companies listed on the stock exchange raised £99,000,000 of new capital. I stop at this point, Sir, 1 to remind honourable members of what has been happening on the stock exchange in recent months. I suggest that, except for those companies dealing in base metals, share prices have continued to increase. That is a clear indication that the investor has confidence in the present situation, and I point out that there is probably no better barometer of the economic condition of the country than trading on the stock exchange. When we consider secondary production, we can come to the conclusion only that it is increasing healthily. In the five months to November last, there were very few instances of reduced production. In most enterprises, production increased substantially. To take five or six products at random, the production of superphosphate increased by 28 per cent., that of towels and blankets by 21 per cent., that of washing machines by 22 per cent., that of vacuum cleaners by 30 per cent., and that of ingot steel by 15 per cent. In the building industry category, there were no reductions. I believe that these are facts that should be borne in mind by all honourable members and by every member of the community in endeavouring to assess the country's economic conditions. Let us turn now to the new capital expenditure made by manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries. In the six months to December last, it totalled no less than £175,000,000. Does this suggest any lack of confidence on the part of industry in Australia? I suggest that it indicates considerable confidence and definite planning of expenditure, not only for last year but also for the years that lie ahead. I come now to the final item in this brief survey-retai l sales. The latestfiguresavailable are for the September quarter of last year. They indicate an increase of 6 per cent. All of us recall the newspaper reports that spending by the public during the last Christmas trading period broke all records, and therefore we shall probably find, when the figures for the December quarter are available, that, ia that quarter, Britain in these age groups. We are in as in the September quarter, retail sales competition with four or five British Comincreased substantially. So1 come to the conclusions to be derived from the consideration of these aspects of the economy by saying that I believe, first of all, that there is every reason Australian Citizenship Convention, Sir for the community to be confident, and that scare-mongering-whic h is all that we have heard so far in this debate from members of the Australian Labour party-is not justified. The difliculties-suc h as they are -ar e being faced realistically, and there is little wrong with the economy that cannot be corrected by the Government's fiscal policy. But I should like to add that if we judge economic conditions by the standards of Labour's pessimism, we shall do untold and irreparable damage to our economy and our people. In the few minutes that remain to me I want to deal briefly with a matter that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition on 27th February, when he spoke in this debate. The right honourable gentleman dealt particularly with immigration. I shall discuss only one aspect of it-the proportion of British immigrants. We all know that for some months now the Leader of the Opposition has emphasized the desirability and necessity of increasing the percentage of British immigrants. I say quite definitely that it is highly desirable to increase the percentage of British immigrants if possible. In this connection, it was interesting to hear Professor Carrington speaking in the Australian Broadcasting Commission's "" Guest of Honour"" session last Sunday evening. He raised two queries: Can we be sure of getting more people from the United Kingdom? Are the additional people that we want available? Professor Carrington then mentioned two factors that exist in Britain. One was the ageing of the population, and the other was the prosperity that the British people have enjoyed over the last ten years. We desire to bring from the Old Country people in certain age groups, but, as Professor Carrington pointed out, there are not enough people in those age groups to meet the requirements of the United Kingdom itself and to provide substantial numbers of immigrants for the dominions. Australia is not the only dominion that seeks immigrants from monwealth countries in particular. Professor Carrington's remarks agreed with statements made by Sir Douglas Copland and Professor Borrie at the recent Dougles Copland said that the United Kingdom and most of the European countries were suffering from declining numbers in the age groups from which most migrants are drawn. He was supported by Professor Borrie, who went on to say that this situation was new in the experience of Europe for at least 200 years, and pointed out that that sort of demographic structure did not lend itself to large-scale migration. I remind the Leader of the Opposition, who unfortunately is absent from the chamber, that Professor Borrie went on to say that he had not yet obtained adequate evidence to prove that there were many thousands of people in the United Kingdom who were falling over themselves to get to Australia. I point out, also, that it was the Leader of the Opposition who drew the name of Professor Borrie into this debate. From time to time the Leader of the Opposition, and other members of the Opposition, have endeavoured to give the Australian people the impression that there are thousands of people in the British Isles who desire to come to Australia, but who are not being allowed to come because of the attitude of the Australian Government. I say quite definitely that that is not the situation. People of the type desired as immigrants are not available in the British Isles. Further, if they were available, the Government is not adopting policies that would prevent them from coming. member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin) would raise the matter of the Parramatta by-election. In case he is not aware of it. a new member for Parramatta will be sitting on this side of the House very shortly. 1 suggest that the Leader of the Opposition has been misguided in his judgment on this matter of British immigration.

64,Mr Hulme,"I thought the honorablethis matter and used the truth in statements made both within this House and outside the House. It is a pity that the Leader of the Opposition endeavours to cause discontent within the community, and within other countries that make up the British Commonwealth, by the statements that he makes and by his misinterpretation of statements made by others. Anybody who has made a close study of the immigration problem realizes that Australia is unable to obtain from the British Isles the percentage of the total intake of immigrants that the Labour party says we should, particularly within the categories desired. ( Mr Lawrence) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. very dim view of the concluding remarks made by the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme). The honourable member has suggested that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) does not seek out the truth, and does not speak the truth within the House and outside the House. Such remarks bring discredit to the arguments that the honourable member raised earlier in his speech, arguments that were based on abstractions The honourable member studiously avoided the facts facing the ordinary men and women of the community. All members on this side of the House are behind the Leader of the Opposition. If the honourable member for Petrie had listened to Mr Monk's speech the other night, instead of obtaining his facts seconddemand . . . . hand or from propaganda, he would understand that the Labour movement, politically and industrially, approves the policies with respect to immigration and employment that have been submitted by the Leader of the Opposition in this debate. As far as British immigration is concerned, the honourable member's arguments condemn his own government. The honourable member has said that we cannot get British people to migrate here because England has been prosperous, and because the benefits to be enjoyed in the welfare state make it unlikely What does that mean to the individual? that they would wish to migrate to Australia. That is reasonable enough. Unless you can offer human beings conditions in which they would desire to rear their families you cannot expect them to travel 12,000 miles to this or any other country. That is the first serious indictment of this Government, the fact that it has failed miserably to establish a sufficiently high standard of living for Australians, let alone for immigrants. Turning to the issues dealt with by the honourable member for Petrie, particularly unemployment, I think all members of the Opposition agree with the view expressed by the late Mr Chifley when he saidAs far as I am concerned no man in this country wili ever walk the streets looking for work again. That is a simple, straightforward philosophy. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) once remarked that any Australian out of work was a national emergency. That is the way the Opposition looks at this question of unemployment, and the Government is peculiarly anxious to avoid any searching criticism of its attitude towards unemployment. I understand that the honourable member for Petrie is associated with the accountancy profession. He is accustomed to dealing with statistics, figures, and abstractions. The most depressing feature of the Government's policy is its tendency all the time to get back to abstractions, to put itself on some high philosophical plane to which ordinary mortals cannot aspire. Nevertheless, the tendency is, under the Government's policy, for ordinary mortals to end up hungry. This is what the Minister for Primary unemploymentThere has been overfull employment and excess And then we come to a gem of a phrase, one that should be inscribed somewhere, probably on the portals of the Liberal party head-quarters. The Minister added that we should consider this "" against the background of an economy in movement."" That is a lovely statement, if we were not dealing with the livelihoods of human beings. The Governor General, in his Speech, saidThere has been some increase in unemployment. Members of the Opposition represent the great bulk of the people who are unemployed in this country.

67,Industry ( Mr Mcmahon) Said In Relation To,"psychological effect of being unable to obtain work can be very damaging. I saw many cases of this last year when people were being dismissed from the aircraft factories, particularly people who had reached 60 years of age or more. There was nowhere they could turn to. The blow of losing their job at such a late stage in life was one from which some of them found it difncult to recover. A fundamental feature of the Labour party's philosophy is that you do not treat human beings that way. Supporters of the Government may well go out among the people and lay foundation stones, open Sunday school fetes, and spring flower shows, and talk of the rights of the individual. It is a type of political schizoway by the Government's financial or social phrenia, because in this House Government supporters lose all feelings for the rights of the individual. It is inhuman to consider this problem only in terms of trends and figures. The honourable member for Petrie spoke of superphosphate, ingot steel, washing machines, and dealt in various abstractions. He talked of record spending, buoyancy, and confidence in the Government, but none of these things mean anything to a person out of work. The figures themselves are a challenge to the Government. This Government took over on the 10th December, 1949, and there were 1,240 people drawing unemployment benefit at the end of November, 1949. There were 11,181 who claimed they were unemployed when they registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. To-day, quoting the figures of a few weeks ago, there are 27,163 drawing unemployment benefits and 74,765 registered as unemployed. That is a twenty-fold increase since this Government took office. When the Government took over it was handed a buoyant economy on a platter. There may have been overemployment and excess demand, but every Australian in 1949 knew where to turn for a job. If a man was dismissed he knew that he could find another job freely. To be able to do so is as much a part of any system of free enterprise as is the right to own a bank, a newspaper, or a steelworks. The time has come when the Government must realize that these are facts, and that it must change its policy with regard to employment. It cannot be denied that, since 1949, there have been continual fluctuations upward in the number of people unemployed. To each of the families concerned unemployment is a tragedy, a serious blow. For ten or twelve years people have been confident of the future. Many have committed themselves to a higher standard of living. Many have bought household necessities on hire-purchase, and the threat of unemployment can only lead to unhappiness. To accuse the Opposition of scaremongering brings no credit on the honourable member for Petrie, nor on the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). These are aspects that are not faced in any policies. We have heard various suggestions to the effect that there cannot be full employment unless there is inflation. Unfortunately, very little study of this subject seems to bave been made. Very few facts and figures are available from which one could extract information which would support a view one way or the other. Throughout most of history, of course, the ordinary working people have had to face a life of insecurity and want. Full employment for everybody as a public policy was, I understand, written into the United Nations Charter as a result of the pressure and demands at San Francisco of the Australian Government's representatives who were led by fhe present Leader of the Opposition' (Dr. Evatt), but only in very few places has it been achieved. Only under Labor governments ih the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand has it been fully achieved. In the present situation over-full employment-usin g the term to mean a condition wherein there are more jobs than men to fill them-is something that we ought to look for. There should be freedom for the average individual to change his job if he wishes without losing a day's pay. Surely, that it not a fantasy or something that we should regard as Utopian. We have seen this condition exist in various times of crisis. We have no difficulty in employing everybody during war. There is ample evidence that the general standards of living in the community are not rising in accordance with rises in the national income, productivity, and so on. That is shown by the figures quoted earlier by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr The honourable member for Petrie also Cairns). The indices for real wages were 1206 in 1950-51, 1201 in .1951-52-in that year, under this Government, there was a drop-121 7 in 1952-53, 1223 in 1953-54, and 1229 in 1954-55. At that stage the figure started to recede. It was 1213 in 1955-56 and 1212 in 1956-57. Those are the indices which reflect the real standards of living. The honourable member for Yarra also cited figures in relation to marriages. Marriages, of course, are an index of confidence in the future on the part of young people in the community. In 1956-57 the rate of marriages was lower than it had been six years before in 1950-51, at which stage one could disregard statistically the fact that so many people had come back from the war a few years previously. At that time most of those young people had become married. So, despite the view of the accountants and the statisticians, and the various indices, he please address the Chair? whether of bank deposits, wholesale prices, and such like, there are many indications that the real standards of living of the people are not improving at the rate which one has a right to expect. After all, the nation's productivity is rising continuously. There is an increasing number of people. Capital investments of the past-for instance, £600,000,000 in railways-ar e being used now for the benefit of more people. Increasing population should, with due regard to our absorption capacity, mean that the general standard of living in the community will rise, but every figure that we have seems to indicate that that is not so. These matters are of great public concern. They comprise part of the reason why the thinking people, the folk who have the time to give consideration to their politics, are showing reactions against this Government. Despite the great build-up of the Government's candidate in the Parramatta by-election last Saturday, despite everything that the Government could do, despite its effort to label our policy as scarethe 25-pounder, although it fires a shell mongering, a great number of people who were prepared to support the Government in 1955 are now no longer prepared to support it. This is logical enough. When Australians are given enough facts, we can expect them to give reasonable answers. mentioned seasonal conditions, and I think the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr McMahon) used the same argument. They said that at this stage, unfortunately, we were being hit with the results of adverse seasonal conditions. For years we have heard that all the good things in this life have flowed from the Government. Apparently when there are bad things, they are acts of God. As the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) so often puts it, you cannot have it both ways. If it is your responsibility when the country is going well, it is your responsibility to take action tp guard against such events as droughts and a falling off in productivity, and, after all, the drought last year was predicted some time back by the people who know. You should have taken action Order! The honourable member has been addressing the Government as "" you "". Will Government, Sir. It is somewhat difficult to address the Government if its supporters will not remain in the House. Those are points which arise from the speech of the honourable member for Petrie. There are several other matters to which I should like to refer. The Government has spent astronomical sums on defence, and in some respects there is justification for very severe criticism. One is in relation to the introduction of such weapons as the 105 mm. gun. I believe that at this stage of military development, when we do not know exactly what the military tactics and strategy of the future will be, it is very difficult to lay down what sort of forces we should have. Therefore, it is a waste of money to indulge in great expenditure on new weapons which, on the face of it, are not significantly more effective than those which we already have. The 105-mm. guns will cost, I presume. £10,000 or £15,000 each. Goodness knows how many we shall need! The Minister has told us that we have enough 25-pounders. The 105-mm. gun has no greater range than which is 5-lb. heavier. Apart from that, we have a 5.5-in. gun with a range of 11 miles, which is further than either the 25-pounder or the 105-mm. will fire. Radical changes are likely to occur if military tactics are to be based on atomic",21,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

Figures contained in the 23rd Report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, dated 1956, in the table dealing with State expenditure on certain social services from consolidated revenue and special funds, show that the amount ranged from £10 ls. a head in Western Australia, down to £6 9s. 9d. in Queensland. The order of the rale of expenditure in the various States that year was Western Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Queensland. An examination of those figures-if the expenditure per head on education can be taken as any criterionwill reveal that there is a very serious discrepancy between the opportunities offered to children in State schools to take higher education and the numbers who accept that opportunity. The Governor General's Speech contains a reference to the Murray committee's report. It says that the Government has taken some initiative in the matter of univercontinuance. sity education. But it is in the States, during the stages leading up to university education, where the crisis occurs. There is a very serious wastage of students in the Australian community. Dr. Wyeth, of the Melbourne University, refers to this wastage as a deviation of talent. Of every four children who could attend a university three do not do so. In other words, only 25 per cent, of Australian children are receiving education at university level and utilizing the benefits it offers. The present enrolment in universities in Australia is over 30,000. Last year there was a great flurry aboui the Russian advances in technical education. The Party had decided to create a proletarian to take over the cultural ancl scientific leadership of the country. Year after year later, higher schools, and now they were supposed to be ready to become scientists. It was this way. The Party believed that if it went on sending masses of young proletarians to the high schools and scientific institutes a body of rea) talent would develop sooner or later. Those were his comments at the time. The passage goes onBut so far it had not. There was no single proletarian physicist who could measure himself even remotely against the scientists of the old school. Recently, we have had some sort of factual demonstration of the result of putting large numbers of children into the schools. In the end results are produced. The conclusion is that it is first of all up to the Commonwealth Government, if necessary by way of a referendum, io obtain power over education. I know that the purists will say that this would increase bureaucracy and centralization, but 1 feel that many of our education problems-and this is borne out in particular by education surveyscan be solved without over-centralization.

I am afraid that this is the kind of patriotism-thi s false sentiment which deals in racial prejudice-that led one very eminent Englishman to say some years ago. "" Patriotism, sir, is the last refuge of a scoundrel"". How does the Leader of the Opposition justify his new policy? He says that, by reason of the dilution of the Australian population by the intake of immigrants, our Australian way of life and our democratic traditions are threatened. Has any one ever heard more fantastic nonsense? Our annual intake of non-British migrants is less than two-thirds of 1 per cent, of our population. Are our British traditions and our Australian way of life so weak and feeble that they will be dominated by an intake of two-thirds of 1 per cent, of our population each year? It is quite obvious that the right honourable gentleman was speaking with his tongue in his cheek. What further proof of this is needed than the fact that there are influential persons in the Labour movement to-day with names like Bukowski, Schmella and Tripovich-gran d old Anglo-Saxon names!

It Despite this expression of opinion by the can be seen, therefore, that our rate of honourable member, suggestions have been made by honourable members opposite that our immigration target should be reduced by at least 50 per cent. Before the present Government was compelled to introduce some restrictions on the intake of southern Europeans, those people were arriving in Australia at the rate of about 43,000 a year, and the number of applications from southern European countries was increasing. If our total intake was reduced by 50 per cent., and there were to be no restrictions on southern Europeans, we would have the curious position that British immigrants would be restricted in order to allow southern Europeans to come here. Of course, the suggestion made by the honourable member for Yarra is just as fantastic as the one put forward by the right honourable member for Barton. I suggest that the honourable member has recently discovered that there are some southern Europeans in his electorate, and that he is trying to curry favour with them. Nor is there any more realism in the suggestion made by honourable members opposite that we could attract more British immigrants if we provided housing for them. The plain truth is that in the programme of development we have followed in post-war years, housing has been part and parcel of the developmental pattern. in our rate of home construction as a direct result of our immigration programme. Let me give honourable members the relevant figures. In June, 1946, only 65,000 persons were employed in the building industry. In June, 1957, the number had increased to 116,000, and of these more than 46,000 were immigrant industry in the last few months?",27,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

80,Mr Freeth,"If the honourable memdwelling construction has been such that, in the post-war period, 750,000 persons who did not have homes have been provided with them, while at the same time we have provided housing for our increased population. This satisfactory result has been achieved time, Australia lost the opportunity to build only by bringing into Australia immigrant tradesmen who were prepared to take tlieir chances of getting homes, and by bringing other immigrants who were prepared to work in the basic industries needed to produce the materials for home-building and to take their chances of saving and eventually obtaining homes for themselves. That has been part of our pattern of development in Australia. At this point of time-and again let me stress the necessity to look at the broad picture over a long period-ho w futile it is for the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that immigration threatens employment. Immigrants create a demand for goods and services, for food and clothing. They represent just as effective a shot in tbe arm for our economy as would a release of extra bank credit. When demand for goods and services is falling off, how stupid it is to reduce our intake of immigrants and thus cut that demand still further. It is well known that a proper immigiation programme stimulates employment. This has been proved in Australia, because no other country has had less unemployment during the post-war years, in spite of our record rate of immigrant intake, a rate equalled only by the United States of America in its years of rapid expansion. The fact that immigration stimulates employment can also be seen from the fact that even at the end of last December, when our unemployment figures were increasing, there were job vacancies for particular kinds of employees, who would in turn create further job vacancies. At that time there were 24,000 job vacancies. These included 6,738 for skilled manual labourers, 4,667 for semi-skilled mafiual labourers, 4,719 for administrative, commercial and clerical workers, and 2,820 for professional and semi-professional persons, including matrons and nurses required for hospitals. If persons could be found to fit into those jobs, they would in turn create vacancies for other workers, because it is well known that every skilled worker requires two or three unskilled workers to make up the complete production team. Therefore, when the right honourable gentleman opposite suggests that immigrants take jobs away from Australians, he is simply harking back to the old policy of despair that ruled in Australia during the 1920's, when, for the first and become great because of the fears, panics, prejudices and class-consciousness that were preached by the Labour party. The Leader of the Opposition raised the question of our immigration objectives. I thought it was the height of pettiness on his part to suggest that the immigration programme was being made an instrumeni of class warfare, and that employers were trying to bring workers to Australia to make conditions worse for Australian employees. The plain truth is that immigrants come here as work opportunities exist. They come here, in the main, to fill work vacancies which cannot be filled from Australian sources. If they are sponsored and nominated privately, their sponsors must guarantee them accommodation. If they come in with Commonwealth assistance, the Commonwealth sees to it that work vacancies exist. But the right honourable gentleman's propaganda appears even shabbier when one considers that large numbers of immigrants have become employers of labour, on both a large and a small scale. Every honourable member knows of cases in which this has occurred in his own electorate. I could instance the case of a Danish upholsterer who came to Australia and commenced business with a one-man workshop, and who now employs eleven men, including two Danes, one German and eight Australians. There is a Dutchman in my electorate who established a new industry manufacturing fishing rods, and now employs a number of people. He will soon be moving from his little country workshop to the city. Two Dutchmen in Melbourne started a plastics factory with ten employees, and now employ more than 200 people. There are many such cases throughout Australia. These facts show how shabby and foolish the Leader of the Opposition makes himself look when he resorts to the petty expedients to which he has resorted in an attempt to make political capital for his party. Labour's attack on the Government's immigration programme is short-sighted. The Opposition's policy is a policy of stagnation and despair which fails to take account -of the broad picture. The Opposition would have Australia fail in the great task to 'which we have set our hands. ( Mr Bowden) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. able member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) has, completely without success, attempted to belittle the attitude of the Labour party on immigration. It is apparent that the honourable gentleman has no knowledge of Labour's immigration policy or, if he has, he has deliberately distorted that policy. We were informed by the honourable member that the Chifley administration launched the immigration policy of this country, and that that policy was then supported by the entire Labour movement, including the trade unions. I should like to point out that when Labour started the immigration policy it envisaged the continuance of certain social and economic elements in the community' that do not exist to-day. That is why we say that in the present economic -circumstances there should be a paring down of immigration-no t because we oppose immigration in principle, but because we say that the Government, by reason of its inertia and complete lack of responsibility in many directions, has produced conditions which will not permit the -successful operation of the immigration policy envisaged and applied by the Chifley 'Government. The Government has failed to make available to the States the funds necessary to provide urgently needed homes, roads, hospitals, schools and other services essential to the public health and welfare. . It has enough houses, not enough jobs, not enough failed to develop decentralized industries to provide full employment for both old and new Australians. It has permitted an antisocial and unhealthy congestion of immigrants in the capital cities, and has thereby created the most deplorable conditions of overcrowding of families, including young children of both Australians and immigrants, in slum dwellings, that have ever been known in this country. Since this Government came into office these undesirable features of our national life have existed, and they are due to the Government's policy in certain directions. Had a Labour government been in office this state of affairs would not exist. We would have a much better balanced economy. A Labour government would have seen that the States had adequate funds for the construction of homes, roads, hospitals, and many other national works that are so essential in a country with an increasing population. But what have we to-day? A few weeks ago, the Victorian Electricity Commission went to the loan market for a certain sum of money to be used for the development of the Yallourn project and allied projects needed for the extension of electricity services for a growing population, but it could raise only 62 per cent, of the necessary amount. Why? Because this Government has deliberately encouraged the use of money in other directions to the exclusion of the need for improved public services. It has not encouraged investors to put their money in public loans to finance the development of public services needed to cope with our increase of population resulting from immigration. We find that State governments, local governments, water boards, sewerage boards and so on all over Australia are struggling for lack of the money they need to carry out essential services. Under a Labour government that would not be the case. If the Chifley Government had stayed in office, succeeded by a government led by the present leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), we would have possibly 150,000 to 200,000 immigrants coming to this country annually without dislocation. But this Government, by its inefficiency, its lack of realization of the broad fundamentals essential to any immigration policy, has fallen down on the job, and the Australian people are suffering as a result. There are not provision of essential services. Because of the unfortunate state of affairs that has arisen from the Government's maladministration of the nation's affairs the Labour movement has said that, unfortunately, there must be a diminution of immigration activities. We have said that we are forced to advocate a decrease in the number of immigrants, not because we do not like immigration or do not like southern Europeans or other immigrants, but because we wish to protect the immigrants already here, and those still to arrive under the Government's policy of bringing people",28,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

82,Mr Bird (Batman) [4.31],"The honorhere willy-nilly whether or not there are sufficient houses and public services to provery least two or three lines about it, or a vide for them. It is because the Government has allowed the economy of this country to run down that Labour has had to say that, unfortunately, although a Labour government inaugurated the immigration scheme, there should be a decrease in the numbers of immigrants. This need has arisen because of the Government's lack of recognition of the facts of immigration. We also declare, without equivocation, that we strongly support a policy of immigration based on the foundations laid down by the Chifley Government. If this Government can get back to the foundations of the immigration policy laid down by the Chifley Government, which would ensure the provision of employment, houses and other essential services for immigrants and old Australians alike, we would certainly support an increase of the number of immigrants to 150.000 or possibly more annually. f suggest that members of the Government who wish to know who is opposed to immigration should look at themselves, because by their very inactivity and their policy of misdirection of labour and material they have made this country unfitted to take the number of immigrants that it should have in its present state of development. The real culprits in respect of cutting the number of immigrants are honourable members opposite. If they accepted the responsibility implicit in the original conception of immigration by the Chifley Government I have not the slightest doubt that we would be able to absorb 150,000 or more immigrants annually without any dislocation. I do not think the statements of the honourable member for Forrest deserve any further consideration, because he failed to convince anybody. One of the most disturbing features of the present political situation is the increasing arrogance of the Government. Problems of the most momentous nature are bypassed in a casual fashion, or flippantly was talking about when he suggested that dismissed with an airy wave of the hand. the housing position would be corrected The contents of the Governor General's somewhat this year by the building of Speech amply demonstrate the truth of this 71,500 homes. They have no confidence in contention. Having a full realization of the the Prime Minister's contention that the tragic housing position the Opposition was housing position will automatically correct appalled that no mention of the Governitself over a number of years. We have to ment's intentions in relation to housing face the fact that no amount of glib, oratical was made in the Governor General's sophistry can brush aside the stark, cold Speech. One would have expected at the small paragraph. But there was no mention of it. To me, and to other members of the Opposition, the Government's approach to the housing problem is almost unbelievable. The Government seems to think that it is only a question of time before the problem will solve itself. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) is one of those who apparently believe that to be the case because, in a number of statements he has made over the last twelve months, he has said in a desultory fashion that the situation is being corrected. Only a couple of weeks ago he stated that the estimated rate of completion of houses for this financial year would be 71,500. Immediately master builders read that statement they came to the conclusion that the Prime Minister was talking a lot of hot air. A few days ago, the president of the Building Industry Congress was reported in the "" Melbourne Age"" as follows:The Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, was pulling figures out of the air to cover up the great housing shortage which was developing, the President ot the Building Industry Congress, ( Mr W. Balcombe Griffiths) said yesterday. The report continued""In Sydney last night, Mr Menzies said the estimated rate of completion of homes this financial year was 71,500,"" Mr Griffiths said. "" Lastfinancialyear the figure was 65,000 and it was not likely that thisfigurewould be reached this year,"" he continued. Mr Griffiths said it would be interesting to hear how the estimate was arrived at, for the building industry had no knowledge of the fact that extra money had been made available to houSe-hungry people. Later, the report statedThe President of the Builders' and Allied Trades Association ( Mr W. H. Hunt) said Commonwealtb Government economists should come down from their ivory towers and have afirst-handlook at home building. In other words, men in the building game -no t members of the Labour party or Labour party sympathizers-hav e said that the Prime Minister did not know what he reality that there is a great housing shortage and that it is getting worse. Little has been done by this Government to catch up with the post-war lag. Now, an acute situation has arisen which threatens to make the plight of the homeless indeed desperate. I refer to the changing pattern of Australian age groups. The over-all population of Australia is increasing at the rate of 2 i per cent, a year, which is one of the highest rates of increase in the world. It is made up of a H per cent, natural increase and a 1 per cent, increase from immigration. If this growth remains fairl) constant, as is expected, the population will rise from 9,700,000 to 12,000,000 in the next ten years, an increase of 24 per cent. This overall increase, in itself, will impose great and grave social changes. But when one analyses the increase into its changing pattern of age groups, the full implications become very clear and they are very threatening. The most signincant change of all will be in the number of young people between the ages of 20 and 24 years, the ages at which most people marry or contemplate marrying. In the next ten years the number of people in this group will rise by 55 per cent. The Government should know these facts and should embark upon a housing policy which will make provision for this explosive quality, as somebody in the home-building world termed it recently. Because we have to face this situation, the Government should have embarked upon a policy calculated to step up the rate of provision of houses and schools, and transport and domestic services. Is it doing that? Of course, it is not. To-day, we find that the deficiency in these services is greater instead of smaller. Apparently, the Government is living in the present. It does not even look five or six months ahead, let alone a year ahead. Bceause this position will obtain for the next few years, the need for courageous, massive planning in housing is most imperative. It is due to the Government's inactivity that housing is desperately short. Does the Government realize that 1,500 marriages take place each week in Australia, but that only 1,275 houses and flats are being constructed weekly to meet this demand? In other words, the supply of home units falls short of the current demand by 200 a week. That figure does not take into account the terrific lag brought about by the war and post-war conditions. These facts would be less disturbing if the production of dwelling units were increasing, but, in fact, it is diminishing. I know that these figures have been quoted ad nauseum, but I want to remind honourable members that whereas in the year ended June, 1952, 78,113 houses were built, in the year year ended June, 1957, only 65,540 houses were builta reduction of 12,573. Yet, in the corresponding period the population of Australia increased by 1,000,000! Under this Government, so complacent in its ivory tower, nearly 13,000 houses less were built last year than were built five years ago. As I have stated, many more marriages take place than the number of houses constructed each week. The number of marriages will increase by 50 per cent, during the next ten years because there will be a greater number of people in the age group from twenty to 24 years. Yet the number of houses being built is decreasing, year by year! It is high time that the Government alerted itself to this perilous state of affairs. This problem has been talked about, argued about and written about for so long that there is no longer any doubt about what should be done. Enough money should be put within the reach of prospective home builders by the Government. The Government can find money for other things. I suggest that, under the present circumstances, housing is No. 1 problem in the community. What is the good of bringing immigrants to Australia while the number of houses being constructed in this country is falling every year? This is bringing about a position which the founders of the immigration policy never envisaged. Under the present policy of financing homes too much is demanded by way of deposit. Even when a purchaser has a deposit hefindsit very difficult to get a loan. Usually, if he does succeed in getting a loan the interest rates are so high that he has to send his wife out to work in order to help to pay the weekly instalments. In other words, the person who wishes to own a home is up against three obstacles. The first is to save the deposit. The second is to beg or borrow a loan because virtually he has to go down on his bended knee to any lending institution to get money. The third obstacle is to pay the loan off, because £5, £6 or £7 a week is outside the capacity of the average working class family to pay. The traditional sources of housing loans, "" Age"" say about the Government's attithe co-operative societies and the public banks, are lending less each year. The priopinion, that newspaper has in recent yearsvate sources which used to make money available for housing, the insurance companies and the private banks, show no enthusiasm for housing at all. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister inadvertently admitted the existence of a grave housing problem when, a couple of weeks ago, in this House, he said that if the insurance companies and other institutions which had once been big lenders for housing returned to that field the housing lag would be well on the way to being removed. In other words, the Prime Minister admitted that the banks and the bigger financial institutions are not doing anything to ease the housing problem. Yet he had stated only a couple of months earlier that the problem would automatically solve itself in four or five years! He cannot have it both ways. Dr. Evatt -We have man-power and building to enable the nation's development materials available for home-building. plorable and disgraceful housing conditions in every State.

I do not indict the Government for its attitude towards housing merely because I am a member of the Australian Labour party, and my indictment is by no means the only one. People and organizations who could never, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as supporters of the Australian Labour party, are indicting the Government. What does the Melbourne tude to housing? I must say that, in my become one of the most conservative in Australia. Nevertheless, it indicted the Government in its issue of 30th December last, in a big article headed "" Unhappy Old Year for Housing"".

That is what the Melbourne "" Age "", which is a wonderful supporter of this Government at election time, thought of the position of the building industry last year. Even if the Government will not take my word for it that the housing situation is getting worse, it should take some notice of the Melbourne "" Age"", which is one of its staunchest supporters.

If royal visitors travelled by train, the people of every hamlet and village-to use a term somewhat unusual in this country-coul d display on their own ground their sentiments towards the Royal Family. stop tour, but that would be quite sufficient. I guarantee that whatever the cities might do, however lavish and elaborate their welcome might be, it would be put to shame by the people on these little whistle-stop tours. I suggest that the people responsible for organizing future visits, whether it be a State government or this Government, should inquire into this matter. Instead of crowding the cities with thousands of people who never get an opportunity of seeing these Histineuished visitors even from great distances, we should afford country people an opportunity of seeing them, even if it is only a flashing glimpse of them passing by. as the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr contrasted with what the honourable memDuthie) suggested. The railway services would provide comfort no less than that provided by the airways, and the journ<*v« would not be so tiring, nor so trying. Th-? only obiection might be that the tours would take a little longer. When speaking in a debate such as this it is difficult to restrict oneself to particular subjects, ln this instance, I know that 1 could devote my speech to a criticism of the amendments proposed to the Address-inReply by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), and of his arguments which, I say, are entirely unsound. I could point out that the main criticism of the honourable member ment did not adopt the socialist policy of the direction of labour. The honourable member asserted that the Government's biggest fault was its misdirection of labour. I could spend my time talking about that. good many members of the Opposition, if not all, pray that the One who provides will not provide so well while there is a Liberal government in power, so that there may be death, destruction, and chaos in the country, on which the Labour party battens. I have assumed, of course, that members of the Opposition do say their prayers at night. If1 were to speak in such a fashion I should be denying myself the opportunity of dealing with subjects of a constructive nature. I could point out that the argument of the honourable member for Batman with regard to housing should have been addressed to the State governments. The State governments are responsible for housing. I might point out to the honourable member that since this Government has been in office, the annual amount allocated to the State governments for housing and other government purposes has been increased to such an extent that it puts to shame the paltry pittance offered by the Chifley Government. I could point out all that, but if I do so I should be losing an opportunity of dealing with subjects that I consider far more important. If there was any substance in the points made by members of the Opposition, then speakers on this side of the House would be justified in dealing with them. I could point out to the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant), who spoke so cliblv about the freedom of the individual in emnlovment, how his argument ber for Batman said about direction of labour.

Governments have provided unemployment relief for that particular purpose. ment has increased the amount so that today it is far higher than the amount provided by the honourable member's party when it was in power. This Government does give the unemployed a chance of having something to eat, whereas they had to look jolly hard for something to eat during Labour's rule. The idea is to cover the transition period. Members of the Opposition want the worker to suffer no loss of income whatsoever Opposition members -Hear, hear! the Opposition agree, and in return the worker will accept this condition: He will work where, when, and how he is told to work by the Government. That is the condition that the Labour party wants, the only condition. The honourable member for Batman said so, and on one occasion the Leader of the Opposition also said so. I could continue to speak along these lines, completely destroying the Opposition's argument, as so many speakers have already done, and, 1 have no doubt, as other speakers will do, but there are other we get sufficient money to use for subjects with which I should like to deal. I could mention all these things, but I do not wish to. I shall just let them pass. During my absence for Lang might think that my absence was not long enough. Perhaps, during my absence, the honourable member was able to get away with some things about which other honourable members were not as well informed as I am. I want to deal with the Governor General's Speech where reference is made to the increase in unemployment that has taken place due to unseasonable conditions. The Governor General says that action has been taken to meet the circumstances and to make funds available to governments and local governments in order to tide them over this period. The present taxation plan was introduced at a time when there was an absolutely unsatisSupporters of the Chifley Government fiable demand for labour, often for jobs that were not of an essential nature. Labour, materials, and almost everything else was in very short supply. We had the aftermath of the socialistic policy of scarcity, created by the Labour government so that it could introduce and retain rationing and controls. This Government did away with all that. The Government had to overcome inflation, which occurred consequent upon Labour's policy of scarcity, a policy that was applied by the socialist Chifley Government. This Government applied taxation measures that were restrictive. 1 believe that the economy has now reached a position where that policy should be reviewed, because there is an abundance of everything in Australia at present. I see no fear of inflation if we reduce taxation to the extent where private industry, the income earner, and other taxpayers, are able to apply their money in the development of this country and the expansion of their industries in their own way. The people should not be compelled to supply their money to governments so that it may be spent in ways that are not always in the best interests of the people. Instead of appealing to the people to supply money to the Government in the form of loans, with a charge upon posterity for the works that the Government carries out, by our restrictive taxation programme immediate capital expenditure. I believe that the time has come to review this matter and say to industry, "" We shall encourage you to expand and to undertake all the development which is within your capacity. For that purpose we shall relieve you of the restrictive taxation which has been part of this Government's successful policy down through the years."" I bave in mind the fact that a budget will come down later this year. Now is the time to make a complete review. We must realize that the Government has arrested the terrific inflation brought about by the tremendous shortages which were the natural consequences of the Chifley Government's policy of rationing and control.

But I warn this Government-and any other government, for that matter-that what is being provided in connection with water supplies for Western Australia is a mere drop in the ocean of requirements. We on the western coast of this country compare the provision of a paltry £3,000,000, £4,000,000, or £5,000,00 for water supplies in Western Australia with the hundreds of millions of pounds provided by this Government for water supplies in the eastern States. I refer to the Snowy River scheme and various other schemes which have received Commonwealth assistance in past years. I say to the Government and to the Parliament that we in Western Australia are entitled to a far greater share of the funds which it is the responsibility of this. Government to provide for national development. Western Australia needs far more for water alone. For very many years I have advocated 1 that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization should endeavour to develop apparatus for converting salt or brackish water into fresh water. The CSIRO. has been very busy on this matter. I would like to see the organization maintain its interest and become busier still. I do not mean a huge plant for the conversion of sea water. While such a plant might be handy, it is not what we want. We want smaller plants which can be used on individual farms. Underground in Western Australia we have ample water, but it has too high a salt content to be useful for stock or garden purposes. In America and elsewhere, processes for extracting salt and providing fresh water are being developed. The CSIRO. has worked on the problem, and I receive reports from the organization occasionally, but I should like to see the organization far busier on the problem than it has been. The Government must be a little more mindful of returning to Western Australia a fair share of the great national wealth that it provides to the CommonweaUh. Toomuch has been taken from it by the Commonwealth Government and the easternStates because of the fiscal policy of the nation over the last 50 years. It is not sufficient for us to have a cabinet meeting in Western Australia once in 50 years, and then only when we talk about secession, Government's treatment of Western Australia. I would to goodness that the Government were afeared again that we would secede. Then we might have another cabinet meeting in Western Australia. I pay a tribute to the Government for itsprovision of £2,500,000 for development in the north-west. There is a problem which the Government cannot ignore for very much longer. It is as big a problem as the constitutional relationship between t'ne States, and we cannot continue to neglect it.

102,Mr Leslie,"I think I am prepared toits token measure of assistance, has indicated its acceptance of responsibility for the point of view. They do not want to go development of the north-west. I know that many schemes and plans for the north-west have been advanced. Some people ask for full exemption from income tax and measures of that kind. I do not mind if the people there get exemption from income tax, but I do not think for one minute that that is the answer to the problem. I have discussed this matter with the men and women-particularl y the womenwho go to the north-west of Australia. One working woman put it to me quite plainly. She said, "" IfI have a remission of taxation of £50, £60, £100 or £200, how will it benefit me and my family if we have not the amenities and the educational, medical, hospital, recreational and transport facilities that are engaged elsewhere? Exemption from taxation will influence me, but the provision of amenities and necessary public utilities will induce me and people like me to go into the north-west of Western Australia."" That is the way in which this Government and the State Government have to look at the problem. I am not concerned about exemptions from taxation. Good luck io these people if they can get away with it! I do not think such exemptions will draw anybody to those regions, but they may draw a little investment. I am concerned with peopling the State. People will go to the outback if we provide them with amenities and facilities reasonably resembling those available in other more populous and developed parts of the Commonwealth. This Government needs to be a stimulus to the State Government. In my opinion, the Government will never do anything for the remote parts of the country until it has provided those things. So what does it propose to do? Will it give us the schools, hospitals, roads and other facilities? These are the things which are necessary for development. It is of no use to put a man on a rice farm or some other developmental project unless these facilities, which cost money, go with it. The Government must say, "" We will provide you with the money"". The northern regions will advance only when people there have the facilities that they want. I do not think that the pioneering spirit has died in the young people of Australia, but they look at the matter from a different out and rough it as their forebears did. They want some home facilities and comforts. They are not prepared to live in a hessian humpy and bury their butter in water and sand to try to keep it cool. Those days are gone. In these modern times, I do not blame any one for not being willing or agreeable to accept those conditions when they can so easily get better facilities provided at a small cost for their health and happiness. I sincerely appeal to the Government to examine this question of the development of the north-west. A sum of £2,500,000 is a drop in the ocean in connection with what is required to supply water in Western Australia. If the Government wants to see whether it is justified in assisting that State -and I particularly draw the attention of my friends representing the eastern States to this pointI ask it to consider what it would mean to the national economy if Western Australia were to decide that it would be an independent part of Australia The trade that Western Australia conducts with the eastern seaboard is worth £90,000,000 a year, but the eastern States buy back only a mere fraction of that value in our goods. If we in Western Australia were free to trade where we liked, thc amount of money that we spend in the eastern States would go five times as far as it does now. But we are compelled to trade here with the eastern States regardless of whether the people in those States are concerned about our welfare. That situation has been brought about because of the fiscal and economic policy of all federal governments. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Governor General's Speech is noteworthy, not for what it says but for matters on which it is silent. No positive approach has been made by the Government to the problems of the nation on the homefront or in the international sphere. The Government's policy is one of laisser-faire.

104,Mr Morgan (Reid) [5.21],"Th efact in the following article which appeared in the "" Sydney Morning Herald "", on 26th February last:For different reasons, bank credit policy and banking reform were features of the Governor General's Speech at the opening of Parliament yesterday-the one being conspicuous by its absence and the other by its inclusion. On the whole economic position, let alone the role that bank credit might play in it, the Government has confined itself to a string of platitudes. . . . Not only has there been no action, apart from the Loan Council gesture, to steady the rapid rate of increase in unemployment, in addition we haven't had any candid statement of the Government's economic viewpoint. In combination, the latest deflationary turns in the overseas and domestic economic situations are more distinct than any of the inflationary turns against which the Government's advisers were prompt enough to advocate action in recent years Shades of the horror Budget-To repeat, it is the rate of drift that is causing concern. . . . There is no inflationary threat at present. Too much is being unnecessarily left to chance. There should be some prompt stimulation of credit especially for housing. As the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" points out, the situation here must be looked al also in the light of what is happening overseas. I refer to the ominous signs of recession in Great Britain where 500,000 are unemployed. Nearly 5,000,000 are unemployed in the United States of America, and there is a similar dangerous trend in many other western countries where capitalism is enthroned. This was pointed out and those countries were enumerated in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" to-day. The situation is very grim. Indeed, it calls for prompt and decisive action to counteract or lessen its effect in this country, but the Government merely adopts a "" wait and see "" attitude. As in previous years of office, the Government fumbles around and makes no intelligent or scientific approach to the urgent problem of housing. Despite increased demand through natural increase of population, large-scale immigration and young couples marrying, there has been a very substantial fall in the number of homes being constructed-abou t 15,000 fewer a year than in the peak period seven years ago. This is a grave social problem and all boils down to a question of finance for which the Commonwealth is primarily responsible and with which the States cannot cope on their own, despite efforts such as that of the New South Wales Premier recently in convening a conference of interested bodies and individuals to set up a committee to go into the question. This problem calls for the setting up by the Commonwealth of a national housing authority, empowered to co-ordinate housing construction in Australia, regulate the flow offinance,create more stability in the building industry and keep down costs, as opposed to this Government's past policy of "" boom and bust"" which caused inflation and instability and drove skilled workers into other avenues of employment. The Chifley Government's plan aimed at an ultimate target of 80,000 houses annually, this being the figure recommended by the wartime Commonwealth Housing Commission, after a comprehensive survey of requirements of the post-war period, to overcome the lag and meet current needs. That plan should be immediately restored. Likewise the Government should undertake a more positive programme of national development, providing for, in particular, national highways, as well as adequate finance for local government works and for semi-government bodies to take up the lae in employment. Such a programme should also fit in with an orderly plan nf immigration. The need for a national roads plan was recently stressed by Mr R. S. Wilson, executive vice-president of Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Company (Australia) Limited. He warned that Australia should not repeat America's mistake of underestimating the value of roads, which, he stressed, are the arteries of a country. He pointed out that Australia was developing more rapidly than the United States of America. He said that in the last seven years Australia had increased its population by 18 per cent, as compared with 12 per cent, in the United States of America, and the number of cars in Australia had increased by 84 per cent more than twice the United States of America rate of increase during that period. Local government bodies which have to provide so many essential services and amenities are the Cinderellas where Commonwealth financial assistance is considered. A new deal for them is urgently required. In my own electorate, as well as in other metropolitan areas, the position is desperate. Finance is urgently needed for sewerage, roads, kerbing, guttering and other facilities. One newspaper columnist, in referring to what he described as "" Sydney's shame "", commentedIt is a standing disgrace that a city like Sydney which prides itself upon being progressive has large unsewered sections where primitive methods of sanitary disposal are a constant menace to health. The United States Government has had to admit that a new deal for local government bodies is the right approach. Eisenhower has asked for large-scale credits for public works in order to take up the slack in employment. In contrast to the measly grant of £1,000,000 recently made by the Australian Loan Council to New South Wales for local government bodies, the Minister for Local Government in that State, Mr Renshaw, pointed out that a minimum of £2,500,000 is needed to retain the present labour force in employment and avert more unemployment. A total of £3,600,000 was sought by these bodies for urgent and essential works. But the Commonwealth maintains a stony-hearted attitude towards their demands. Apart from Australian Loan Council grants, the Commonwealth could utilize the resources of the Commonwealth Bank or release special deposits to private banks at low interest rates for local government bodies. This would be a sound investment because repayment by the local government bodies would be secured by the rating power vested in them. The Government's policy of credit restriction and high interest rates is fallacious and is causing stagnation and unemployment. Such a statement is not mere Labour propaganda but the considered view of many responsible citizens and industrialists. For example, Mr C. P. Puzey, Director ot the Australian Industries Development Association, had this to say recently in a report to his associationUnemployment to-day was the outcome of an official monetary policy based on false promises. The events of 1957 had proved wrong official forecasts made earlier in the year. Those predictions wereEmployment would increase. Business would show marked improvement. Inflation would threaten Australia's economy. Mr Puzey went on to sayTight monetary control had made it impossible for banks to use the improved cash position to pump money into the economy. Official policies failed to appreciate the significant decline in investment, particularly the fall in home construction. They also did not take into account industrial capacity expansion-representin g more than £200,000,000 in new production annually. Dealing with the growing army of unemployed, which was then 60,000, but which, of course, is now much higher, he saidAt such a time it is amazing to hear strong rumours that an increase in interest rates is President likely. Mr Puzey addedNot only will we require a policy designed to stimulate investment, public and private, but the stimulation of consumption expenditure could be equally important. That is the crux of the situation; Mr Puzey reaches the very core of the problem. Unless credit is pumped into the economy to keep up consumption, production will slow down with consequent mass unemployment snow-balling, as it inevitably must, unless prompt and vigorous steps are taken to prevent it getting out of hand. The decrease of 13,000 in the number of building trade workers last year, as disclosed by the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Carver, must have its repercussions on consumption and industry generally, in view of the number of allied trades dependent on the building industry. It is the key to them all. As it slows down, the others follow automatically. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the easing into the economy of £15,000,000 through the Central Bank during the last fortnight a belated and somewhat begrudging recognition by the Government of its responsibilities-wil l be followed by further releases of finance until the economic rot has been checked. It is to be hoped, also, that the Central Bank, and if necessary, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) will exercise their undoubted powers under existing banking legislation to ear-mark part of this money for home building at moderate interest rates, in line with the Chifley Government's policy. This Government's policy of slavishly following Britain in its financial policy has also proved to be fallacious and has contributed to the present unsatisfactory situation, as recent overseas news indicates. After all, Britain's problem is different from ours. She is a small, densely populated country dependent on trade and the manipulation of the £ sterling, whereas Australia is under-populated and under-developed. Australia's development is urgent and vital for our defence and future security. The financial columns of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" of 3rd February contained the following reportTO FALL SOON. London, February 2nd British economists believe that Britain will soon reduce the 7 per cent, bank rate, according to Reuter's financial correspondent. The Government boosted the rate by 2 per cent, to its present level last September to fend off a crisis in which the pound sterling was in "" peril"". This drastic step worked by helping to sten. inflation inside Britain and halting big selling ol the £ by foreign speculators. But since then othei countries have gone in the opposite direction by cutting their bank rales steeply. Their reason is that recession, rather than inflation, has now become the enemy to be fought. By making money cheaper to borrow they are hoping lo stimulate trade. The world trend of falling money rates was led by Western Germany, Canada and the United States, and recently joined by Holland. All these countries have cut their bank rates during January. The London bank rate is now double that of West Germany and more than double New York's. The result is that Britain's rate has been left high and dry. Many prospective home buyers in this country, also, have been left high and dry because of credit restrictions and high interest rates which, with high capital costs, have made it impossible for them to purchase a home on terms within their means. I do not say any more about the home front; the recent Parramatta by-election indicates that the people are aware of the Government's deficiencies in these matters. In addition, the press, which usually supports the Government, pointed out that the result of the Parramatta by-election was a warning to the Government. The"" Daily Mirror "", in an editorial, saidMr Menzies and his Treasurer, Sir Arthur Fadden, should take it as a warning; a warning that the people will not stand indefinitely for credit restrictions, a housing shortage, an unrealistic immigration policy and growing unemployment. Unless the Government heeds the lesson of Parramatta, it wil] find that by the time of thc next general election the drift away from it will be far more serious lhan was Saturday's. That is the writing on the wall for the Government. A similar negative attitude and lack of constructive approach by the Government also prevails in the international sphere. The Governor General said that the cold war continues. The first phase of it, we know, has been on the propaganda front. It is now shifting to the economic and political front by subtle infiltration methods, and that could be more dangerous and effective than the propaganda. In the first phase, the propaganda front, the Soviet bloc seems to have been highly successful from its point of view in spreading fear, suspicion and distrust, in creating division within our ranks and in keeping the Western world in a constant state of jitters, keeping us on the defensive all the time and causing us to make huge stocks of armaments for an eventual showdown. The timing of such a showdown, if it ever happens, is necessarily in the hands of the Soviet, but we have allowed it to take the initiative at every twist and turn of the cold war. Even the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) would admit that that is so. The Soviet has its sights fixed on its ultimate objective of WOTW conquest by international communism, while the free world, the democracies, capitalist society or whatever term may be used to describe the Western nations, fumbles along aimlessly and complacently, hoping to muddle through somehow in the end, as of yore. We must pull up our socks. We must know where we are going and what we really want, or we will be engulfed and enter a dark age. That may be sooner than many expect, although some, I am sorry to say. accept its inevitability and do not care. This is a dangerous philosophy and is becoming all too prevalent here, because of the Government's failure to create an awareness of the situation in the minds of the people and to build up public morale. This failure is evidenced by the manner in which the Government has dithered around with civil defence. Apparently it has now abandoned civil defence because, significantly, there is no mention of it in the Governor General's Speech. The Government appears to have accepted the viewpoint of its defence advisers, that "" it could not happen here "" in the foreseeable future, despite the ominous signs and fastmoving events to Australias' near north. This attitude reminds one of Singapore, the invincible stronghold, and the Brisbane line strategy. Spending £1.000,000 a year on security services, preparing dossiers, is no solution. That is a purely negative approach. A better approach would be to spend the money informing the people of the facts of the situation. Give them the truth and they will respond! In the struggle for world power, the unaccompanied by human happiness and committed countries of Asia, Africa and the Middle East hold the key. Australia must be alerted to the effect of the Afro-Asian bloc set up at Bandoeng and Cairo. Soviet Russia has played a leading part in welding these nations together on a racial or colour basis. We have, as an example, the support given to Indonesia at Bandoeng and in the United Nations, and the latest developments in Indonesia itself. Indonesia could easily turn Communist, and in that event our position would be most precarious. At least, it could become another Korea with Australia and New Guinea right in the front line. 1 regret that the Government is not willand I regret that there is no indication of a ing to extend the scope of the Foreign solution in the Governor General's Speech.

Full employment is an ideal that must be social usefulness, and the industrial era must embrace it if it is to survive. The unhealthy conditions, the monotonous grind and the insecurity that are the lot of the average wage-earner in this age of industrialism make people easy prey for agitators and power-hungry individuals who capitalise on the legitimate grievances of the workers. Workers must be allowed to share both the fruits and the responsibilities of industry, and to receive the benefits of technological discoveries and scientific advances, such as automation, so that they may develop culturally and live a full life. We have to work hard for a solution of our problems before some other system is foisted on us, Some draw consolation from the fact that newspaper reports yesterday of his statement concerning Soviet threats to certain A summit conference may bring about a of trumpets and with great hopes of the establishment of a true and lasting peace. Let us have more conferences on the level, for a change-that is, among the ordinary people who constitute the real foundations of society.

Let the ordinary people mingle and get to know and understand one another. As President Eisenhower has put it, let us place our diplomacy on a people-to-people basis. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) rightly says that the cold war is a battle for the hearts and minds of people. With fast transport available, such cultural exchanges as 1 suggest are easily practicable, and any expenditure thereon would constitute a better investment than the huge amounts of money that are spent on armaments. Society should be like a pyramid standing new era.

This could happen, Mr Speaker, a lot sooner, especially with a government in office that seems oblivious of the dangers or how to cope with them, and is thus unable to give a lead or awaken the people to an understanding of our dangers. It is a great pity that a more hopeful outlook was not demonstrated in the Governor General's Speech on these great national and international problems, because I have no doubt that if the nation could be pulled together, on a basis of co-operative team work, and if it were given the right leadership, it would go ahead and rise to heights hitherto undreamed of, in a great progressive The answers to the problems confronting us to-day are simple, in the view of",38,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
105,Mr Turner (Bradfield) [5.46],"If Ithe other side of the House, and of the attitude adopted by Labour supporters in the recent Parramatta by-election. There are some legitimate reasons for concern in the present situation. We know that the price of our wool on the world's markets has declined, as has the price of base metals. We know that our wheat harvest has failed. All this has meant that there is less money in the pockets of primary producers, and this in turn must reflect its effects throughout the economy. In other words, due to conditions over which the Government can have no control, we face a minor recession. But I would point out that we faced a very much greater slump after the boom caused by the Korean war, a slump that was overcome, or cushioned, by monetary measures and did not cause any grave inconvenience to the people of Australia. I see no reason why, in the situation in which we are now placed, we should accept the fears and the feelings of panic that the Opposition seeks to engender in the minds of the people. Of course, the situation in the United States of America does give cause for some disquiet. If unemployment should increase in that country the effect must be felt in the United Kingdom's economy, and that country is the principal market for Australian goods. I can only believe that the Americans will not-becaus e they dare not -fail , holding, as they do, world leadership. They cannot alford to allow unemployment to increase. The results would be far too catastrophic, not only for that country but for the world. I believe, therefore, that, facing the ecoof these policies with which all of us nomic situation squarely, it would be fair to say that Australia does not have to confront impossible problems, and the world situation is not such as to cause undue gloom. What1 fear is another result altogether and it may be that time will prove me to have been right. WhatI fear is that, as a result of the baying of the Opposition, the barking of the pressure groups and the bally-hoo of the press, the Government may be induced to enter on another period of inflation, to give another twist to the inflationary spiral. I believe, not without realism, and having regard to the past and looking to the future, that this is by far the most likely outcome of the present situation-anothe r twist of the inflationary spiral. It is that possibility which I wish to examine now, because there are things that can be done in the forthcoming Budget, matters that can be put forward in the policy of the Government parties at the next general election, steps that can be taken to meet the situation that, I believe, is going to arise within the course of the next twelve months. I am dealing with the effect of inflation upon those who are living on fixed incomes and relatively inflexible incomes. I should say, first, that I believe that the middle classes do not wish to see unemployment, because they do not wish to see the misery that we have, unfortunately, experienced in past years, and also because they do not want to see-n o decent person wants to see-the social frictions that arise when people are living under crowded housing conditions, when young people are not able to develop their independence by living in homes of their own. They do not wish that situation to exist. I make that quite clear at the outset, because I do noi want to be misunderstood. I do not want it to be thought that I am advocating a restrictive policy, in order to hold inflation, that would result in wholesale unemployment and in the continuance of present housing conditions. Let me not be misunderstood on that point. But should the people on fixed, and relatively fixed, incomes be those to shoulder the whole burden of inflation, assuming that inflation is the only means of ensuring full employment and of getting houses built? Are they the people who should shoulder, in the future as in the past, the whole burden agree? Those people are squeezed between the big battalions of labour and the heavy artillery of business. The workers do not suffer from inflation. Their wages rise with the times. Business does not suffer either, because a situation of full employment and high demand means more profits, and fixed assets increase in value as the value of money declines. So neither the big battalions nor the heavy artillery that are trampling down and pounding the middle classes to pieces suffer from inflation. The whole burden falls on those least able to bear it, and the Government cannot afford to see that situation continue. Let me refer now to the decline of the value of money before I go on to point out what it means to this middle section of the people. The pre-war £1, on the basis of the C-series index figures, is now, if my arithmetic is correct, worth about 7/1. It is probably worth less than that, because the index does not give a fair indication of the decline of the value of money. In each of the last two years the rise in prices generally has been of the order of 5 per cent. This means that in another decade or two the pre-war £1 will be worth precisely one pre-war shilling. I am concerned with the effect of this on those people who are being ground between the upper and nether millstones. Who is it who suffers? First, the widows and spinsters, the mothers of schoolage children who have been left by a bread-winner with certain savings, some perhaps invested in such things as Government stock, mortgages and preference shares -in other words, gilt-edged securities. There is nothing less secure than gilt-edged securities. To-day they are like a block of ice standing out in the noon-day sun. Or, to vary the simile, they are like someone standing on the top of a rock, but with the tide already around their feet or their middles. Then there are the people who have put their savings into life assurance policies. They have bought a policy that they thought was worth £5,000, but in twenty years it may be worth 5,000 shillings. Then there are the people who are living on annuities, or superannuation which generally does not increase with the decline in the value of money, although in some cases there have been such adjustments. Then you have tbe class of landlords, about which our friends opposite can wax so eloquent. IfI had their eloquence I would point out that those are the people who have been most unjustly treated since the war. They have had no justice and no mercy. The owner of property, the landlord, has been left with a nominal income. The tenant has, in fact, become the virtual owner of the landlord's property. There can be no justification for this situation, These are not all the classes of people wbo are being affected by inflation. There are other people on fixed and relatively fixed incomes like clergymen, professional men, executives, scientists, teachers and so on. It is true that all those people have had their incomes increased as the value of money has declined, but in nothing like the same proportion as the increases in the incomes of people on wages or people engaged in business. Age pensions also always tend to lag behind the rising cost of living. Of late there have been more imposts on the classes of people I have mentioned. Train fares and tram fares have increased, as have also municipal rates, education fees and motor registration fees. Of course, there are those who would say that people who pay education fees are merely indulging in a luxury. I do not take that view, because I believe that people in this country ha%'e a right to have their children educated in church schools, and should be in a position to exercise that right, instead of the reverse. In this Christian democracy, if indeed it is a Christian democracy, that should be a right and not a privilege. All the people I have mentioned have borne the brunt of taxation. Everybody has been taxed, but none has suffered more from taxation than the middle classes. Why has taxation been heavier upon thern than upon others? In 1956-57, a total sum of 455,000,000 was spent on developmentpublic works of one kind or another-by the Commonwealth, the States and semi-government and local government authorities. Only about £50,000,000 of that sum was collected from net loan raisings. Something like £300,000,000 was derived from taxation, the balance being made up from other sources. So the people who have borne so much of the brunt of taxation have had to contribute more than their fair share of the amount of £300,000,000 raised from taxes for developmental purposes. I am not complaining about development or the immigration programme associated with it, although I believe the immigration programme has been excessive. I have said so in the House before, and I repeat the statement because I still believe it. It will prove to be true. It is already proving to be true. I am not complaining about a development programme and an immigration Drogramme that are properly proportioned. They do provide the dynamic to our economy, and I would be against their elimination. The point I am trying to make is: Who should pay for them? Should the burden rest entirely on the shoulders of those least able to bear it? Those programmes have contributed immensely to inflation, which has hit hardest those on fixed and relatively fixed incomes. Let us have this policy by all means, but let us have an equitable adjustment of the burden. I say that there should be development, that there should be full employment, that there should be more housing. But at whose cost? Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. of the sitting 1 had asked a question. Before stones to seek some compensation for the I answer that question, may I briefly reburden that has been imposed upon them. capitulate the burden of my argument. I pointed out that throughout this debate and during the by-election campaign at Parranumber of people in the community.

The Australian Country party, for many years, opposed the increase in the tariff wall because its members knew that the tariff that of providing compensation to the would adversely affect the costs of primary retired generation-thos e people who proproducers. But after a time they realized vided, as they thought and hoped, for their that the tide was too strong to be resisted old age, but who found their savings had and, instead of opposing the tariff, they dwindled, had been eroded, and had sought compensation in other fields. They melted away as a result of the inflation sought a home-consumption price for certain commodities. They sought freight concessions from the State railways. They sought exchange depreciation and any other means whereby they could find some compensation for the rising tariff. The tide could no longer be resisted. I believe that since we are committed to policies of full employment, development and so forth, the tide of inflation is irresistible. It must go on. If that is so-and here I come to my analogy-it is for those who are crushed Let it be clear that I speak for a large notice in "" Hansard "", the honourable member for Sturt also advocated during the last The second problem of age pensions is",43,British Economists Expect Bank Rate

107,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [8.9],"it is all right, and there is to be, as there ought to be, an expansion of credit in the next few months, because £15,000,000 is to be released from the special accounts of the private trading banks by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. When the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) was asked to-day what he, as the Treasurer, and the person to whom the banking system should ultimately be responsible, was doing to ensure that this £15,000,000 would be made available where it was most needed, he said he would take a few days to prepare a statement about the matter. There is something else that I should like to mention, in passing, about these special accounts-somethin g about which there has been very little publicity so far. I refer to the decision taken, a week or two ago, to raise the rate of interest payable on these special accounts from 5s. per cent, to 15s. per cent. It will be remembered that, about two years ago, the rate of interest more than 200,000 people a year-abou t payable on these accounts was reduced after the Opposition had pointed out that the increase in overdraft interest rates made then would have the effect of greatly inflating the profits of the private banking system. Ostensibly, this was not the purpose of the increase in overdraft interest rates, which was intended to have an overall restricting effect on the economy. In consequence of the protests made by the Opposition, the rate of interest payable on the special accounts was reduced. At the present time, the deposits in those accounts total about £325,000,000, nearly £300,000,000 of which has been drawn off from the various private trading banks. An increase of the rate of interest payable on the special accounts by 5s. per cent, to 15s. per cent, will innate the profits of the private banking system by about £1,500,000 in twelve months. I suggest that a reason for this action-and , even better, a reasoned statement about it should have been given to the House by the Treasurer. The £15,000,000 of credit that is to be are broken down into the numbers in governreleased will be lent at the average rate of mental employment and private employinterest of 5 i per cent., and can be lent at ment, and a further distinction is made up to 6 per cent. One of the effects of this between males and females. The trends will be to inflate the profits of the banking that have been in evidence for some months system by about another £700,000. The were indicated as long ago as October ot banking system, in effect, has been promised last year in one of these glossy publications a present of more than £2,000,000 over the which emawtfe t""n such profusion from this next twelve months, in addition to the Government. Whether any one in authority benefits of the Government's efforts to destroy the present controls over the banking system. Why has the Government chosen to increase the rate of interest payable on the funds in the special accounts? I suggest that either the Treasurer, or the Prime Minister, who, I understand, is to follow me in this debate, should at least indicate to the Australian people the reason for the increase in this rate of interest, the first effect of which will be to inflate the profits of the private banks. The principal matter discussed in this debate has been the declining level of employment. We who belong to the Australian Labour party believe in, and Government supporters assert that they believe in, what is called full employment, which is based on the right of every individual in the community who is able and willing to work to do so. In a country such as Australia, with a population growing at the rate of 90,000 being net increase from immigration, and more than 120,000 being natural increase-ful l employment, if it means anything, should mean an increase, month by month, and year by year, in the total employment in Australia. To a government the supporters of which pride themselves on being the apostles of private enterprise, it should mean rising employment all the time in private industry. In a community that believes in the right of the family to develop, it should mean an increase every month in the total number of males in employment. I propose, in the next few minutes, to subject the gross, or aggregate, employment figures to tests designed to show whether they satisfy those requirements. It is true that, in December, 1957, there were, in the aggregate, more people in employment than in December, 1956, but there were not 60,000 more. I regard an increase of 60,000 a year as a conservative estimate of the desirable increase in employment each year. The employment statistics takes much notice of them, 1 doubt. After listening to the various replies given by Ministers to quesuons asked in this House, I suggest that the Minister at one end of the front bench does not know what the Minister at the jther end is doing. Whether the Prime Minister, as the overriding authority, can get them all into harness and pulling together, I do not know. As long ago as October, 1957, it was pointed out that there was a signincant and serious trend in total employment in manufacturing industries in Australia. Australia must continue, for many years, to depend on employment in manufacturing industries, and in what are called tertiary activities, to means that men are being dismissed from absorb the great increase each year in the number of people on the labour market. In fact there has been a decline in the past twelve months in the number of males employed in manufacturing industries. Honourable members should remember the creed of members of this Government, those aposdes of private enterprise, who say that they are in favour of giving Australian families a fair deal. At the end of 1957 -''here were fewer males in employment than there were 12 months previously. Fewer people were in private employment, and the total employment figures are only as respectable as they are because of the increase in female employment and in the despised sphere, so far as this Government is concerned, of government or socialised employment. What of the creed that the Government is supposed to stand by? This Government reminds one of the old fable about the king who really had no clothes on at all, but whose courtiers milled around him telling him how well dressed he was, until a small voice pointed out that he was naked. This Government is naked and devoid of any policyFor the Parramatta by-election the Government chose a paragon as a candidate. When the people had the opportunity they did not look at the glittering figure of the candidate chosen by the Government; they looked to the candidate of the only alternative party. The Government has good reason to be fearful, despite the words of the Prime Minister, who said at Parramatta that the great thing Australia had to fear was fear itself. As custodians of the welfare of the people, the Government must examine the trends of employment in Australia much more systematically than it has done in the past, because in the Opposition's view the reduction in employment cannot be blamed primarily on seasonal factors. The problem is much more deep seated than that. It goes to the very structure of industry itself. In its Survey of Manufacturing Activity in Australia, the Department of Trade points out that there has been increased efficiency in manufacturing industry in Australia, which is a good thing, unless it work and are not taken on elsewhere. That, instead of indicating efficiency, could be the road to economic ruin. Structural changes are taking place in employment in Australia, and the Government has made no plans whatever to meet that situation, a situation that has been developing, not during the past few months only, but for a number of years. In fact, in the "" Monthly Review of Business Statistics "", it is shown that the index figure for wage and salary earners employed in factories increased steadily until 1950-51, when it was 1,408. Since then, the figure has steadily declined, until now it is only 1,280. Of course, over that period the population has increased, but the manufacturing industries are now providing a smaller proportion of total employment than previously. We hear a lot about being at the dawn of the automation age. Members of the Opposition do not regret that some of the drudgery of employment will be removed, and that technology and science should be applied to relieving people of the burden of industry. But it is no good releasing people and not finding something for them to do, or providing them with an income. That is the serious situation facing Australia to-day. Something like 26,000 people are to-day drawing unemployment benefit, and about 70,000 are waiting to get jobs. It has been interesting of late to see how the Government relies not on the nominal wage, but on something that it calls the average wage, which at the moment is £17 or £18. The failure of 26,000 people to earn £18 a week in the course of a year",47,British Economists Expect Bank Rate

It is quite impossible, even within the extended time permitted to me by the House, to deal exhaustively with all of them. 1 might take you up on that. But, Sir, before I deal with those matters, I hope to be allowed to correct a statement made just now by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean). He was talking about the building of new houses for ex-servicemen. He appears to be under the impression that there is a waiting list. I think perhaps he has failed to realize that with the very largely increased sums of money that the Government has made available under this head-no w £35,000,000 in this year-ther e is in respect of the building of houses, the acquisition of new homes, no waiting list at all. I merely mention that because what the honourable member said, no doubt quite inadvertently, may give rise to serious misunderstanding on the part of those who listened to him. Now, Sir, I turn away from that, because I cannot undertake to answer all the speeches, to deal with the attack made by the Leader of the Opposition. He referred to unemployment, he referred to housing, and he referred to immigration. No doubt my colleague, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Townley), can deal, with great satisfaction, with the particular charges that were made on the subject of immigration, but, Sir, I just want to make one comment. The right honourable gentleman has of late become tremendously pro-British on the subject of immigration, and in a recent speech at what, hitherto, has been a non-political meeting, the Australian Citizenship Convention, he said that, while the Australian Labour party wanted a proportion of 60 per cent. British and 40 per cent. non-British immigrants, it called also for an immediate and substantial reduction in the immigration intake. So that means two things: He says that the Government has, migrants, though the well-known fact is that we take all British migrants for whom a berth can be found. In the second place, having alleged that discrimination, he goes on to say that the overall programme ought to be. reduced. I referred to the charges as being made by the right honourable gentleman because quite obviously it is not made by his party. It is very interesting for everybody to reflect upon what are the views of the Australian Labour party. Dr. Evatt -Not at all. able gentleman does not like it, but he is going to get the facts to-night. He may be interested to know that although he uttered those sapient words in January of this year, one of his staunchest supporters in this House, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), in February, only a week or two later, made a broadcast in Victoria on the "" Labour Hour "", setting out the Australian Labour party's policy on this matter. Did he say that we were discriminating in favour of Europeans? Did he say that the overall immigration programme was too great? On the contrary, in a spirited blow for independence-thi s may be another schism in the party, for all I know-h e saidThe Australian Labour party says that Australia can and must maintain a migration programme far larger and better than that of the Menzies Government which has failed so badly. So, while the right honourable gentleman says, "" Make it smaller "", the other doctor, the honourable member for Yarra, says. "" Make it bigger "". We cannot pretend for one moment that we are not offered a fair choice, but are the people of Australia being offered a fair choice? Having gone on to say, "" We say that it is a disgrace that the overall figures have been so low "". this is what the honourable member for Yarra said: "" We say that it is a disgrace thai southern Europeans have been discriminated against "".

The current need-that ing to see honourable members opposite embracing one another and disagreeing with one anothera rather pleasing domestic scene? 1 want to say no more on that subject because it will be dealt with in particular, and it deserves close examination, by somebody else. I just want to make a very short reference to the second of these problemsthe problem of housing. It has become very fashionable within the Opposition and elsewhere to talk about housing in terms of deficiencies. All you have to do is to say that it ought to be so much, and then if it falls short of that figure, however much the figure may be worth, intrinsically, you are able to say that there is a deficiency of 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000. Psychologically, this is rather clever propaganda, but it is not a bad idea to look at the positive facts occasionally. Of course, housing is a great problem, and the principle upon which the Government has acted-withi n the narrow limits of its power, because this is not primarily a Commonwealth matter Opposition members -Oh! opposite cannot roar off the Constitution like that. It would be much better if some of them read it. But every sensible person in the House knows that it is not, primarily, in unless roads and other essential services, a Commonwealth responsibility to provide housing. Everybody knows, also, I think, that the present Government has done far more about housing than its predecessors ever thought of. In this very year, the Commonwealth Government, directly or indirectly, is finding £77,000,000 for housment out of Commonwealth revenue. ing. The principle on which the Government acts is that by every means, by action, example or persuasion, it should meet the normal annual demand for housing and make a substantial reduction in the accumulated arrears of dwellings every year. That has been the principle upon which this Government has acted. I should like to point out to honourable members that if they examine the figures for the current year they will begin with a statementI do not think it is a conservative figure; it may be a little on the high from the new annual demand, or the recurrent demand as I will call it, is of the is to say, the number of home units that would have been built if there were no accumulated arrears-is 53,000. The estimated completions for the year will be 71,500. That is to say, the current need of 53,000 will be met and 18,500 taken off the accumulated arrears. As accumulatsd arrears are of the order of 90,000 or 100,000, it follows that in this one year the current demand is met and approximately one-fifth of the accumulated arrears is reduced by construction. If we are to debate these matters in a sensible fashion and address our minds gravely to this important problem, we will agree that that is a pretty good achievement in one year. fact; that is the only trouble about it. member for East Sydney, every fact is untrue, because every fact confutes him; therefore, he must say that it is untrue. I do not work out these facts; they are worked out by people who have no politics but are concerned with the statistics of the matter. I want to mention only one other aspect of housing. We are not to talk about the housing problem as if our one business is to build houses. One cannot build houses usefully for people to live such as water and electricity are provided. To make these available, public works are necessary. A very great percentage of the public works performed by the States during the last eight years has been financed by money found by this GovernTherefore, if we take the housing problem and look at the other problems associated with it-becaus e it is not possible to separate it from these other matters, without which housing is relatively uselessand add everything together, it is quite permissible to say that the amount of money being used for housing by this Government is not £77,000,000, but very substantially more than £100,000,000 a year. Of course, members of the Opposition always have a bit of a go at this matter. Nothing that we do is any good, in their",51,British Economists Expect Bank Rate

120,Mr Menzies,"To the honorableopinion, naturally. Whatever number of houses may be built is not suflicient. That is quite intelligible, but I think that some members of the Opposition ought to do a little reading of the record. I cannot help reminding them that when their government was in power and had all the capacity within its hands to do what honourable members opposite say ought to be done, that government managed in five years-and I am taking five completely post-war yearsto see 200,000 home units built in Australia. This Government within its first five years of office saw built not 200,000 but 389,000 home units; and during the last two and one-half years, another 184,000 home units were built. We were responsible for almost as many homes in the last two and one-half years as the Labour government built in the five years when it turned its attention to housing and had at its disposal all the power, all the goodwill and all those emotions which honourable members opposite now so painfully demonstrate about this problem. That was their performance; and this has been the performance in our time.

It is not to be described as a great pool of unemployment; it is not to be described as a great number of people idle, and the right honourable gentleman knows it. The right honourable gentleman also knows, right down in his heart, that no government, even one led by him, can guarantee that for all persons under all conditions there will be a job of the kind desired in the suitable place. Let us face that simple fact. No government can guarantee that, and, though he has a convenient memory, the government of which he was a member never succeeded in achieving 100 per cent, of people employed in that sense at all. long way. able member for Lalor will remain silent. the honourable member is making all the noise, because sitting on his right of full employment now! nonsense.

It is just as well for you to remember that when you start making extravagant claims about the present state of affairs. As a matter of fact, since numbers have been mentioned, I will just say this: When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, he felt a little unhappy about the fact that there had been a large number of people receiving unemployment benefit during the coal strike and as a result of the coal strike in 1949. In order to get away from that, he saidThe numbers of those in receipt of unemployby pretending, shall I say, that any number ment benefit in that period were only tiny when compared with the position that came into existhan a few hundred is a grave reflection on tence in 1952-53 under the regime of the present the Government and shows that the GovernGovernment, and compared with the position to-day.

There were 118,000 people on unemployment benefit. Now, according to the right honourable gentleman in his speech the other night, and repeated by interjection to-day, that was a tiny figure compared with those who were receiving unemployment benefit in 1952-53 or are receiving it at the present time. I have looked at the figures. In July, 1949, there were 118,000. The highest figure in 1952-53 was 42,000. To-day it is something of the order of 27,000. Now, the right honourable gentleman cannot laugh thesefiguresoff, unless he is prepared to say-and he is prepared to say many things-that 118,000 is a tiny figure compared with 42,000 and a tiny figure com pared with 27,000.

The point that I am making is that in any circumstances in an economy such as this, we will have some fluctuations and those fluctuations will, we hope, be within very narrow limits. because of some exceptional circumstance such as the coal strike the fluctuation is one within very broad limits. Forgetting all about slogans, Sir, the real that with an economy such as ours, it is task, the human and social task of the Parliament and of the Government is to keep these numbers to the lowest possible level. Having quoted the figure now, all 1 need to say is that, for every hundred persons normally available for employment, very nearly 99 are at this moment engaged. If honourable gentlemen opposite and if the right honourable gentleman, their Leader, want to correct the feeling that a disaster has overcome Australia, then he ought to have a look at other countries and compare what is going on here with what is going on in the world. I have no apologies to make for the fact that, even with some change in unemployment figures, we still have little more than 1 per cent, of the total work force unemployed. I do not want to embarrass honourable members opposite by saying so, but that, of course, is why Mr the rest of the calendar year, because there Monk, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said on Sunday in Melbourne that there is no serious unemployment problem in Australia. it? serves the widest publicity. The honourable member for East Sydney says of the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, speaking on unemployment, "" What would he know about it? "" I profoundly regret these little differences that spring up among my friends opposite. I know that they had one or two on their hands, but if I am now to understand that there is a first-class brawl with the A.C.T-U., whose president is alleged to be incompetent and to know nothing about this problem, then all I can say is that there are many people who will welcome the news. We have this number of unemployed at present, small though it is when considered as a percentage of the work force. But one thing is certain: our real task in this matter is to do everything in our power to prevent that number from becoming substantial, and to reduce the number as efficiently as we can. This, Mr Speaker, is a matter However, occasionally, that does not call for violent, panic measures. Any government worth its salt would never dream of using violent and spectacular measures to deal with something that is relatively small. The fact is necessary to serve judgment and balance and to use a bit of good sense, not be unwilling to act but not be dragooned into taking extravagant action. We had a special meeting of the Australian Loan Council some weeks ago. A question was asked in the House about it only the other day. This special meeting was requested by a number of State Premiers, the reason being that a certain amount of unemployment existed, and that some of the States were running into deficit on their accounts and they were a little troubled about carrying out their programmes of expenditure. At that special meeting we had to deal with four months of the year, March, April, May and June. We had to deal only with the last four months of the financial year, and not with will be another meeting of the Australian Loan Council in June, when we will discuss all the estimates and proposals for works and loan expenditure for the financial year 1958-59. That will be the time for considering what ought to be done, and how, with regard to the new financial year. The Commonwealth representative, having heard the State premiers, agreed, first, that the local government borrowing programme should be extended by £3,000,000 for local government purposes, because it was felt by us and by the State premiers, including the Premier of New South Wales-perhap s honourable members opposite have also had a quarrel with him-that local governing authorities were in a better position to put works in hand quickly and to take up some local unemployment than any other authority would be. ( Mr Ward interjecting)-",54,British Economists Expect Bank Rate
146,Mr Ward,What would he know about,55,British Economists Expect Bank Rate
147,Mr Menzies,"That interjection demember for East Sydney wiil remain silent. with respect, Sir, is, I. think, a valiant hope. When the honourable member for East Sydney spoke in this debate, he said that it was nonsense to talk about local government authorities being able to borrow another £3,000,000, that we had, in effect, pulled the legs of the Premiers, and that it was a characteristic piece of deceit by me. If he makes that accusation concerning me, what will he say about his own party's Premier in New South Wales, who said that not £3,000,000 but as much, as £5,000,000 could be borrowed in his own State, and who asked to be allowed to borrow that amount? That, I think, is an interesting commentary on the situation. In the second place, the Commonweallh made a special grant of £5,000,000 to the States. It was not a loan or anything of that kind, but a special cash grant-and again in respect of the period of four months. familiar, of course, with these problems than I , says that £5,000,000 is peanuts. 7 still think that £5,000,000 is a substantial sum of money. If you want a Prime Minister to say, when dealing with the present symptoms, that £8,000,000 is not enough, and that it should be £80,000,000 or £800,000,000, then I am not the man fot the job, because that would be sheer lunacy. An amount of £1,000,000 out of the £5,000,000 granted to the States was divided between New South Wales and Queensland, because those two States had been most affected by drought. The balance was distributed amongst the States according to the tax reimbursement formula. We indicated that we would like to believe that a substantial proportion of the additional grant would be used for purposes of housing, and, interestingly enough, the State Premier's agreed. In the case of South Australia, every penny of the cash grant is going immediately into housing. Tenders will be let within the next few weeks for the construction of the extra houses. In the case of New South Wales £1,000,000 of the extra money that the State will receive as a result of this special grant is going into housing. The bulk of the money given to Victoria is to be used for housing. We have, therefore, provided the local government authorities with the opportunity to obtain extra finance to the extern of £3,000,000; we have given a measure of drought relief to the two States mosi affected; and we have provided a large amount of additional money, for the next four months, to ease the housing problem. It should be remembered that we have been dealing with these matters as interim matters only, because at the Australian LO M Council meeting in June we will discuss the problems in the broad, and in the light of the then circumstances. I remind honourable members, however, that further relief has been provided by the Commonwealth Bank releasing £15,000,000 more from special account into the liquid resources of the trading banks. I hear some honourable member opposite talking about hire purchase. This money will not be invested by the banks in the hire-purchase field; it will go into the liquid assets of the trading banks, as trading banks. able member for Yarra is always wanting to have it both ways, as I apologize to my friends for repeating. One moment he is clamouring for millions of pounds in credit to be released, but when some is released he says, ""What are they going to do with it? This is no good! We are being put into the clutches of the trading banks "". I always thought that one of the objects of the releasing of credit by the central bank was to irrigate the resources of the trading banks, because they are the retailers of money just as the Commonwealth Bank is the wholesaler. Those things are the things we have done. But, on top of all that, and much more importantly, if the problem be adequately understood, it is our policy to encourage industry to expand, rather than to seek to undermine its morale and confidence for party-political gain. To do the second of those things is the most dreadful act. That is the most dreadful thing that has been done by the Opposition, which is always seeking to prophesy gloom.

I am happy to say that they do not appear to have had very much success, because in the last week or two, despite all this gloom, what have we seen? In the State of Victoria the industrial development that is going on is beyond all precedent. People are bringing money in from outside Australia and investing it to the tune of many, many millions in vast enterprises. Is that because they have no confidence in our economy? Is that because they have no belief in the stability of this place under its present management? Of course not! And because all this is a good thing for the country and a good thing for employment, it is a bad thing for unemployment and, therefore, it is a bad thing for the Opposition. There is another aspect of the same thing. grammes of development. Whenever the Leader of the Opposition talks of employment, he thinks of it solely Australia ought to open his eyes to what in terms of Government money and Governis about to happen in Australia, with, for ment jobs. But private industry-primary , example, enormous developments in secondary and tertiary-is by far the greatest Whyalla involving, in effect, the creation employer of labour in Australia.

I want to say only one thing more in the time left to me. The Australian economy is a healthy economy. It is a balanced economy, and because ft is a balanced economy it will always be subject to slight, movements one way or the other. That is inevitable in a balanced economy. We will, in some particular circumstances, move into a little touch of unemployment. We will, much more frequently, as we have found in recent years, move into a state of affairs in which there are unfilled jobs. Each of these has its great economic disabilities. Therefore, what we have to do, as those responsible on the Commonwealth Government level for those matters, is to preserve a balance, taking into account always the favorable factors and the unfavorable ones. It is quite true that there are unfavorable factors. There are lower metal pricessubstantially lower. There are lower wool prices. Wt have lower farm prices. We have had, in two States in particular, a measure of drought. These are unfavorable factors. What have we done? Have we just looked at them and said, ""Well, that's a pity! ""? On the contrary, the whole trade policy of this Government, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Trade of expanding our commercial opportunities with other countries, in order to build up our exports, to strengthen the markets for the things we sell, wool being a conspicuous example. At the same time, with all those unfavorable factors in mind, let me remind the House that internal activity is, in fact, constantly being stimulated by a high rate of internal saving for investmenta much higher rate than some people in Australia give us credit fora remarkable volume of overseas investment in industry in Australia and great proDear me!

Tn addition to the factors I have mentioned, which are good factors, we have the one referred to by my friend and colleague the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) to-day. There has been a remarkable degree of industrial peace. You do not have industrial peace in a country like ours unless you have a good measure of industrial justice. These things have prevailed, and they have been a great factor in our internal activity. We have enormous technological advances, and we have an immigration programme. Some say the immigration programme is too big, some say it is too small;",56,British Economists Expect Bank Rate

155,Mr Menzies,"The moment a greatbut a programme which has enriched this country with a million new citizens can hardly be regarded as not having contributed lively stimulus to activity and to thought and imagination in our country. All those things are the best justification divulge any method to correct them. Let for confidence, not for calamity howling. I can remember, as I have no doubt other honourable members also can remember, that every year for the last eight years Labour has prophesied mass unemployment or disaster. This has been the annual dish. It has been like the haggis on St. Andrew's Night. I am privileged on St. Andrew's Night to stab the haggis, and it has been my privilege for eight years to stab this silly argument that there will be mass unemployment and disaster. Year after year members of the Opposition have fallen back, professionally unhappy but personally delighted at finding that the disaster has not come. Therefore, Sir, notwithstanding that we have 1,600,000 more people, including 1,000,000 immigrants; an enormous pressure on our resources; from time to time, on account of demand, a shortage of capital, replenished as it is from time to time by great importations of private capital and some public capital from overseas, we have had, for most of this period, an over-demand for labour. We have bad record public works programmes, and we have had, I believe, one of the great periods of national development and industrial expansion. Yet when we find that we have stability and a high reputation abroad, when the country is regarded by people outside as a proper field for investment, we still have people here who say, "" No, everything has gone bad "". I do not know what they will say when they discover that in the last six months of 1957 the deposits in the trading banks increased by £90,000,000 and savings bank deposits increased by £40,000,000. In those circumstances it is pretty hard to support prophecies of gloom. So, I want to say to the House that it is nonsense to claim that there is great unemployment in Australia. The unemployment of one person is, for that one person, a tragedy. But if you look at unemployment from a national point of view it is a very small proportion. honourable gentleman's time has expired. right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) is unwilling or unable to understand figures. It is little wonder, therefore, that he is unwilling or unable to devise or me deal, first of all, with the first set of figures thai he gave in a purported correction of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean). The Prime Minister said ihat there was no waiting time for people who wished to build war service homes. He is correct to the extent that if one wants to build a war service home one can, without delay, get the successive draws on the division as ones architect's certificates are presented. But the right honourable gentleman did not state to-night, as he stated on 25th February last at question time to the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan), that persons who want to purchase homes through the War Service Homes Division have to wait for eighteen months. Those people who want to purchase houses through the War Service Homes Division will not get them thisfinancialyear, or in the next financial year, but only after the commencement of the financial year after next. Those people are not an inconsiderable number because, every year, between 6,000 and 7,000 persons purchase homes through the War Service Homes Division. Half the people who get assistance from the War Service Homes Division get it to purchase homes. The right honourable gentleman said that, with the greatly increased amount of money being made available this year to the War Service Homes Division, more homes would be supplied. Tn fact, fewer homes will be supplied this year than were supplied with the £30,000,000 a year provided in the last few years or the £28,000.000 provided in the years before that. In an answer which the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) gave me a few months ago, he said that in the first year in which £28,000.000 was made available for war service homes, the financial year 1952-53, 12.422 homes were supplied. In 1.954-55, when the amount was increased to £30,000,000, 12,788 homes were supplied. In this year, when £35,000,000 will be made available, it is be supplied.

He would have who, from another place, superintends the one believe that the figures for July, 1949, nation's housing requirements. Only twelve were typical of the whole of that year.

He said that ment of the figures. He said that in July, if a rate of commencement of approxi1949, 101,000 persons in Australia were in mately 77,000 houses a year could be mainreceipt of unemployment benefits. But in tained, in four or five years the back of the the other months of that financial year problem would be broken. Seventy-seven the number averaged 2,000. For the whole thousand houses a year! What has been year, the average number of people in the record? Last year 67,000, not 77,000, receipt of unemployment benefits was houses were completed. That was 10,000 10,247 a month. Let us compare those short of the target. figures with the record of this Government. In the financial year 1952-53, the average number of people in receipt of unemployinstead of overcoming the lag in four or ment benefits each month was 29,984 and in five years, as Senator Spooner anticipated, the last financial year the average number it will only be overcome in ten or twelve was 12,666.

But their occupations are concerned. Everythe Commonwealth can deal, and always body is entitled to the same conditions has been able to deal, with housing for whether they are Australians by birth or by people in the forces or people wbo have choice. I propose to deal in greater detail with the Prime Minister's statement on housing. any Government supporter to reconcile the If that rate of construction continues, time. It is a vanishing target. The Prime Minister said that housing was been in the forces, for public servants, or for people who live in the territories. Yet, in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory the waiting list for houses is greater than it is in any other part of Australia. The Prime Minister made out that an amount of £77,000,000 was being supplied by the Commonwealth for housing this year. True enough! But it is not enough. The sum of £35,000,000 that has been made available for war service homes has not sufficed to keep up the number of houses previously built and purchased through the War Service Homes Division. Every year, for several years the number of people who apply for war service homes has been 10,000 greater than the number who received war service homes. The Prime Minister would have the public forget that, under section 96 of the Constitution, we can make grants to the States for any purpose. Under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, all the money so far spent by the States has been provided by the Commonwealth. One becomes tired of hearing this Prime Minister refer to the deficiencies of Commonwealth powers. He was one of those who advocated the defeat of the referendum in 1944, which would have given the Commonwealth the power to deal with housing. He wants it both ways. He will not let the Commonwealth have the power, and then he complains about the Commonwealth's want of power. Let me now deal with the position of housing commission houses. This year, the housing commissions will provide fewer houses than at any time during this Government's term of office. In 1955-56-and here, again, I am citing figures provided by Senator Spooner in reply to a question I asked without notice-the five mainland States provided, through their housing commissions, 11,937 houses. Last nnancial year, the same five States provided, through their housing commissions, 8,343 houses. That is, 3,594 fewer homes than in the year before were provided through the housing commissions. What other sources of housing finance are there, Sir? We were told two years ago that licences were being given to the private believe that the borrowings approved by the savings banks in order that more money should be made available for housing, and a condition of the granting of the licences was that up to 30 per cent, of the deposits with the private savings banks could be provided for housing. In actual fact, none of the three private savings banks has devoted anything like 30 per cent, of its deposits to housing. None of them has devoted more than 10 per cent, of its deposits to housing. We have been told that more money will be provided for co-operative building societies. But in New South Wales, the State which pioneered the co-operative building society movement, and which has more co-operative building societies than the rest of Australia, the amount of money provided last year from sources other than the Commonwealth was less than in any year since World War II . It was £5,478,000. The previous year, it was £6,627,000, and in the year before, £6,815,000. If it had not been for the subvention diverted from the State housing commissions at the will of Senator Spooner, the co-operative building societies would have provided fewer houses than in any year since the war. The Prime Minister refers to the Chifley Government's record. We do not mind the comparison one bit, because, in the last full financial year of the Chifley Government's term, 60,057 houses were commenced as compared with 69,453 in 1956-57, and in the year held in common between the Chifley Government and the Menzies Government, the figure was 68,302. There is no doubt, therefore, that if the Chifley Government's housing policies had been continued the lag would already have been overtaken. But in actual fact, we are now receding further and further. Let me give the number of completions for the last three calendar years. They were 1955, 78 289 houses; 1956, 70,117; and 1957, 67,065. There has been a continuous diminution. The number of houses commenced-the real barometer of the availability of finance has declined from 75,832 in 1954 to 67,739 last year. The target is receding further'and further, and less and less of the demand is being met. I turn now, Sir, to another figure given by the Prime Minister-the figure of local government borrowing. He would have us Australian Loan Council last month will automatically provide a degree of employment and local government expenditure in excess of any in recent years, but that is not so. Let me go back to the financial year 1952-53. In that year, semi-governmental Had local authorities in Australia raised £98,300,000. This financial year, given the extra £3,000,000, they will be permitted to raise only £92,000,000. In five years, there has been a large decline in the amount. And, of course, there is no guarantee that the amount approved will be raised. The interest rate to be paid on these borrowings is higher than at any time since the war, and the population of Australia, the spread of our cities, and the demand for local government expenditure, are higher than at any time since the war. It all boils down to the problem of unemfor their public works on funds provided by ployment. The Prime Minister was gracious enough, in his last words, to concede that unemployment bears harshly upon the person who is unemployed. He seems to forget Australia's obligations, freely entered into, under the United Nations Charter, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which lay down that every one has the right to work and to free choice of employment -no t 98 per cent, or 99 per cent, of the population, but everybody. The Declaration of Human Rights is, as it says, a declaration house has to borrow money. He borrows of the rights of human beings not of percentages. In Australia, 70,000 people want employment, and we have 70,000 failures by the Government to comply with the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Is it any excuse to say that there are 4,500,000 unemployed in the United States of America, or 500,000 unemployed in Canada? In the United Kingdom and France-that is, in the longest established countries of Western Europe-ther e are not as many unemployed, proportionately, as in Australia. The unemployment in this country is not marginal unemployment; it has persisted for some months now. The relevance of public works and housing to the unemployment situation is that those trades in which employment has fallen in the last twelve months are those in the building and construction group. In December, 1956, there were 97,000 men privately employed in the building industry. In December, 1957, there were 84,000a drop of 15 per cent, in twelve months, which is considerable. Taking all building employment, including private employees engaged on housing, and employment on the construction works of local authorities and State governments, the number declined from 210,000 to 197,000 between December, 1956, and December, 1957 a drop of 6 per cent. It is in those fields, therefore, that we can most readily overtake the lag in employment. If money is made available for housing and for local authorities, the lag in employment in the worse fields of unemployment can be overtaken. If the Government were honest, it would admit that its attempts to cope with inflation have been confined to the two fields of expenditure which the Commonwealth can most readily control, housing and public works. All the State governments depend the Commonwealth. Local authorities can spend only money which the Australian Loan Council permits them to borrow. The loan council does not guarantee the borrowing, but it approves the amount. AH the fields in which the home builder or home purchaser borrows money can be dealt with by the Commonwealth under the Australian Constitution. In nine cases out of ten, the person who wants to build or buy a it from banking or insurance institutions, and the Commonwealth has power over banking and insurance under the Constitution. As long as people borrow from banks and insurance companies to purchase and build houses, the Commonwealth can determine the availability of their funds. The Prime Minister makes a virtue of the fact that a great deal of State expenditure has come from Commonwealth taxation. Honourable members on this side of the House are sick and tired of hearing that statement. The Commonwealth provides money from taxation for its public works and for some of the State public works because it can thus avoid scrutiny of its own expenditures by the Australian Loan Council. The Government can go to the council, which is supposed to co-ordinate the expenditure of Commonwealth and State alike, and say, "" Do not bother about our expenditure. We are not going to borrow money; we are going to use taxation "". Therefore tbe States are unable to participate in the superintendence over Commonwealth expenditure which the Commonwealth has over State expenditure. The money given to the States comes largely from taxation. It is loaned to the States, which must repay it with interest. As the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) said recently in reply to a question by the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb), the Commonwealth interest bill has remained stationary throughout this Government's term of office. The interest bill of the States during this Government's term of office has trebled. That is largely the crux of the problem with regard to houses and public works. Not only is money scarce; it is expensive. This is a high-interest Government. People who have to borrow money for public works or houses must pay more now in interest than ever before. When this Government came to office the interest rate for home loans was 3 i per cent. In 1952 the interest rate rose to 4 i per cent. Early have several times followed the honourable in 1956 it rose to 5 per cent. As a consequence, if a person borrows £3,000, to be repaid over 30 years, his monthly payments will be £2 more at 5 per cent, than they would be at 31 per cent. The house is the same; the quality is the same. The money may have been borrowed when the ruling rate was 3% per cent, but without any variation of the contract with the building society or with the bank, the Government has twice raised the interest rate. That is not an anti-inflationary measure. The house has been built, yet the owner has imposed upon him this extra interest payment to his bank or building society. The same applies to Housing Commission homes. Under the old agreement, which expired in June, 1956, the interest rate on money borrowed to build Housing Commision homes was 3 i per cent. Under the new agreement, which came into force in July, 1956, the rate has been 4 per cent. Consequently, you will have houses adjoining one another in the same project, one completed and occupied in June, 1956, and the other in July, 1956. The former house has a rental of 10s. less than that of its neighbour, brought about by a completely governmental increase in interest rates. Such a state of affairs could be avoided and should now be reversed. This Government believes in high interest rates. It believes in controls through interest. The Opposition is sometimes chided with desiring controls, or imposing controls in war-time in the form of licences. Just as effective and much more onerous a form of control has been imposed on all local and developmental works, and on housing, and consequently on the employment of Australians new and old, by this increase of interest rates, this placing beyond the new home owner and the new home builder of the means that will give him employment and accommodation suitable for his needs. This Government has controlled inflation in those two respects and has tried to do so in those two respects only. Housing and public works have beea the principal victims, since this Government can most easily control them under the Constitution and can cover its tracks by blaming the banks and State governments whose expenditures it manipulates. member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) in this House, but I find it rather difficult to do so on this occasion because his speech was particularly dull. The honourable member is capable of making a much better speech. I refute the allegation made by honourable members opposite that there is delay in providing finance for the building of war service homes. There is no delay in that respect, although there is some delay in the provision of finance for the purchase of homes by ex-service personnel. According to the Opposition, Australia wants more homes. Surely, it is much more laudable to provide money immediately for the building of homes rather than for the purchase of existing homes. The honourable member for Werriwa said that in the last year of the Chifley Government 82,000 homes were started. Of course, they were, but that number was not completed in that year. People forget that fact. It is easy to start a home, that is to dig the foundations, if you have the labourers and the implements; but in those days there was a shortage of materials. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to-day gave the figures in relation to home building in those days when he stated that approximately 40,000 homes were erected annually. So, it is futile to compare the commencement of 82,000 homes under the Chifley Government with the achievements of this Government in any one year. I do not think the Opposition is sincere in its approach to the housing problem. Honourable members opposite are continually harping on the housing shortage because the subject has political value, but",58,British Economists Expect Bank Rate
158,Mr Anderson (Hume) [9.45],"II do not think they are sincere. They continually refer to finance. Several speakers opposite have said that the cost of a home is too great for the working man. If that is true, being members of a trade union party, why have members of the Opposition taken no action to lower the cost of housing? The greatest proportion of the cost of a house is represented by the wages of those engaged in its erection and in prothat in the sort of political fighting that ducing building materials. Members of the Opposition could direct trade unionists to work a 44-hour week, but not once has the House heard from any Opposition member a suggestion that when workers are building homes for fellow workers, they should work a 44-hour week and thus reduce the cost of housing by 10 per cent. One of the main problems in connection with housing is that the cost of a house is too great. However, over the last two years', due to the action of this Government, in respect of us, surely it is equally right there has been a definite downward trend in that cost. It must be borne in mind that if vast sums of money became available for the erection of homes and it was not expended with care and reason, the cost of building would rise again and would be beyond the financial resources of the average wage-earner. It would be useless to have men and materials available to build homes if the people could not afford to finance their construction. As the Prime Minister has said, housing is mainly a State responsibility. Most of the States have now eliminated their housing problem, but it remains acute in New South Wales. There is a shortage of money for housing, but the other day the Electricity Commission of New South Wales was able to purchase two coal mines for £1,800,000 cash. That action will not produce for the commission one more ton of coal than it could buy under previously existing circumstances, but the State Government tied up £1,800,000 that could have been used for building homes or schools. Where is the point of accusing the Commonwealth Government of cutting short money for housing in New South Wales when the State government diverts money for that purpose? That money will remain locked up for keeps. It can never be used again. It is tied up in a capital purchase of coal mines. A new method of criticism is creeping into the attacks of the Australian Labour party. I think this is because the members of the party are completely devoid of ideas. Member after member of the Opposition rises nowadays with cuttings from the capitalistic press. They say, "" Look at what the press says. Look at what your friends say. Look at what the ' Herald' says about this and that"". They are so bereft of ideas that they must quote some leader writer for the capitalistic press. I suppose takes place here the principle is that all is fair in love and in war and that one may use any implements that come to hand, but to me the Opposition's use of the press in this way savours of the use of poison gas in war. Why should we be saddled with the capitalistic press? If press criticism of the Government is so correct, honourable members opposite should read what the press says about their own policies. I commend it to them. If the press is right in the criticisms it makes of the Australian Labour party. If honourable members opposite do not read those criticisms, I assure them that they are not very flattering. I listened with great perplexity to the speech of the honourable member for Yaira( Mr Cairns) in this debate, and I read the report of it with great perplexity. He always introduces the doctrinaire approach. The whole of his speech was a confusion of figures. It was full of mumbo jumbo. He used vital statistics for births, deaths and marriages, and every other sort of figure to try to prove the verysimple proposition that during the last eight years under the present Commonwealth Government the country had gone to the dogs and that the standard of living had lowered. He uses this mumbo jumbo of figures because he makes a doctrinaire approach. The matter is quite simple and one does not need arguments. In the last eight years, has the standard of living improved or has it declined, as contended by the honourable member for Yarra? When we came into office there were 200,000 refrigerators in Australian homes. To-day there are 1,500,000. How many motor cars are there in Australia today? Is it not true that one in four of the Australian population owns a car? Is that indicative of a lower living standard? Every day of every month about 16,000 new motor cars are being registered and thousands of refrigerators are being sold. These are the things that reflect standards -of living. The standard of living cannot be raised by eating more, because one's capacity to eat is limited. One's standard of living cannot be raised by having four -or five houses. A rise in the standard of living is indicated in the way one lives. It is foolish for any one to try to prove by mumbo jumbo that during the last eight years standards have fallen. If even the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin) applied for a doctorate on the same material, he would probably get it. The honourable member for Yarra always uses the same doctrinaire method of attack on big business although apparently a big labour movement is all right. Let us analyse his ideas. If the production of motor cars were in the hands of small companies, would the price be within the capacity of a wage-earner to pay? Of course not. It is only because big business mass-produces cars that a wage earner can afford to buy one. Why does the honourable member always attack big business? In all his speeches in this House we find this curious and constant attack on the capitalist system, yet Australia has one of the highest standards of living in the world, although not according to the honourable member for Yarra. As everybody knows, one of the points on which Labour has been attacking us, is the question of full employment. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr the owner wanted to sell. But that policy Whitlam) referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the right of a man to have a job. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) went further than that. He referred to the time when America questioned the desirability of full employment and said that high levels of employment were sufficient. But the Leader of the Opposition said dictatorially that under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights a man had a right to a job. I remind him that within that document there was also a declaration of the right of free association and free assembly. How does the right honourable gentleman reconcile that right with compulsory unionism, which is contrary to the provisions of the declaration? Yet he uses the declaration when it suits his purposes. You do not act on principle if you select only those things that suit your argument. Of course, everybody is entitled to a job but, as the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said, it is not always possible for a government to provide a job. Probably a government like that in Russia could, because if employment was not available, a job could be found in a concentration camp. Under the system that we have successfully followed in this country, we have provided jobs for people, but there are one or two factors which make this very hard, particularly in New South Wales. To obtain jobs, people may have to move from one area to another area. Even the late Mr Chifley said that nobody could expect always to find a job within sight of the town clock. He recognized the need for a moving population. The landlord and tenant laws of New South Wales are one of the factors which aggravate the unemployment problem. A man living in Sydney, knowing that he can get a job in Wollongong, finds that he cannot get accommodation there. In the average country town, in spite of the housing shortage, 20, 30 or 40 houses are for sale. Thousands of houses and flats are for sale in Sydney. In my own town of Young to-day, 30 houses are for sale. People wanting to buy homes find that the owners cannot sell if the homes are occupied. How easy it would be for the State of New South Wales to exclude any home which is not rented to-day from the provisions of the landlord and tenant law. Then future tenants could be given a week's notice when does not suit the trade unions. It does not suit all those people who are battening on the landlord as the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) said this evening. A great injustice is being inflicted on homeowners and hundreds of people are being denied homes which they could rent quite easily if the owner could obtain possession when he wanted to sell and could find a buyer. In addition, if the house-owner were given justice, people would again invest money in the building of houses for rental purposes. To-day that desire to invest has been killed, because it does not suit the doctrinaire to give any justice whatever to the landlord. When the Leader of the Opposition was talking about full employment, he referred to the actions of the United States of America to combat unemployment existing there. He cited various courses of action that that country took. Usually, he refers to action by the United States only with disapproval, but this time it suited his purposes to use it in support of his argument. He said that one action taken was the lowering of interest rates. The right honourable gentleman is not a very clever economist, as even he will admit. Two years ago, before the interest rates in Australia were raised, we were having continual rises in the cost of living, but it is significant that as soon as our troubles has been inflation. When the interest rates were raised, in conjunction with increases in bond rates, stability came into our economy. Let honourable members opposite argue as they will, the cost of living has not risen, but has actually gone down since the interest rate went up. Honourable members opposite say that our economy has gone bad. I challenge them to say that the economy has become unstable in the last two years under higher interest rates. Creeping inflation has been stopped and the economy has become stable. Not one honourable member opposite denies that that is so. If the economy is not stable, why is it that the trade unions destroyed. That happened in Germany are asking the courts to increase the basic wage? They go before the Arbitration Court and contend that industry should be able to pay the workers £1 a week more in the basic wage. But here, in the Parliament, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) and his confreres say that the Government has ruined this country. They cannot have it both ways. Members of the Opposition belong to a trade union party, and their representatives have gone to the courts asking for an increase of £1 a week in the basic wage. Yet, in this House, honourable members opposite say there is unemployment and disaster throughout the country. They are either talking humbug or deliberately telling untruths; and there is very little difference between the two. An increase of £1 a week in the basic wage would cost the economy £62,000,000 a year. Would that help to relieve the unemployment which Labour is talking about? When we get down to brass tacks, the more one examines the policy of the Opposition, the more one suspects either chicancery or political manoeuvring. Their arguments do not make sense to me. If the economy is unstable, they have no right to ask for an increase in the basic wage; if the economy is sound, they are justified in seeking an increase. The great battle that we have had in Australia is not to be compared with that in the United States of America. The reasons for the American economic recession are quite different from ours. There are many of them. One is the conversion of military policy from the use of aircraft to guided missiles. That has caused a great deal of trouble industrially in America. One of honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) was speaking the other day and said that inflation was not serious, I interjected that he was talking nonsense. I do not often interject. I ask honourable members to consider what happens when a depression, or deflation, takes place. If a country's economy is sound, there is usually over-production and employees are dismissed because there is not sufficient demand for the goods manufactured. But the currency remains sound. On the other hand, when inflation is the trouble the value of money falls and is completely after World WarI . A condition like that is followed by a depression. Which is worse, uncontrolled inflation or a temporary depression? The honourable member for Wilmot said that he had been in Parliament longer than I have. Probably he has been, but that fact does not necessarily indicate that he has greater capacity. It may indicate that he has a safer seat. Our fight has been mainly against inflation, and we have succeeded. I repeat that the economy is so stable that trade unions have been asking the courts for an increase in the basic wage. One of our problems is the calamity howlers. The Prime Minister warned that the first step towards bringing about a depression is to cause loss of confidence. That has been done, and it is to be hoped that the people will wake up to this danger in the utterances of members of the Australian Labour party. I want people to cast their minds back over the last eight years. They may remember the time when the press-the capitalist press from which members of the Labour party like to quote articles so frequently-talke d about the "" horror budget"". It was alleged that everything the Government did was wrong. But if people analyse what has happened to the economy of this country since 1950 they will realize that Australia has weathered successfully all the problems that have beset it. Anybody who says that this -Government has not done a good job is not basing his criticism on facts. The most outstanding fact is that no other country in the world is attracting more foreign capital than is Australia. No one -can tell me that an investor of capital does not know where it is safe to invest his money. Of course he does, and the fact that Australia is one of the most popular fields of investment in the world to-day is proof of its stability and of confidence in this Government. The Government looked ahead and prepared to meet a possible increase in unemployment. It increased its contribution towards public works. It increased the amount of reimbursements to the States. It increased its allocations for war service homes. It increased the allocation of loan money to the States. By these means it prepared the way to combat unemployment which might come about as a result of drought, a recession or a fall in overseas prices. The Government's policy has been justified by the action it has taken, and that fact will become more evident as time goes on. I wish to make one particular point with any one interested in this question to read regard to action the Government might take that book. I believe that at the present to relieve the consequences of unemploytime there is a loss of confidence in trade ment in rural industries. One of the main unions among the rank and file. For causes of depression throughout the world example, on the waterfront in Tasmania has always been a fall in prices of primary two Australians have been denied employproducts. How does the farmer combat ment because they refuse to subscribe to a that? The most effective way of doing it is political fund of the Labour party. Standto increase production and lower his costs. over tactics have also been engaged in by That can be done by installing modern people employed by the New South Wales machinery, using more scientific methods of railways in Sydney. farming, sowing better quality seed, the conservation of water, the building of better fences, and so on. To do that he needs ( Mr Lucock) -Order! The honourable financial help, and if he has not sufficient member's time has expired. income of his own he must try to borrow money. Bank advances to rural industries were in the vicinity of £220,000,000 in listened with interest not very long ago 1955, £213,000,000 in 1956, and to the Governor General's Speech in another £200,000,000 in 1957. The amount has place. With the exception of those comdecreased progressively. I believe that the record release of plete disagreement with everything con£15,000,000 credit can be properly applied tained in the Speech. During the time that to housing and other necessary purposes, I have been a member of this Parliament, but I am strongly of the opinion that there I have never seen a more innocuous docushould be a new release of credit to assist ment presented by any government as its rural industries. It is from unfavorable programme to meet the needs of the country conditions in these industries that a great deal of unemployment stems. If the rural industries are not prosperous, that condition is reflected in many directions. It is time to infuse fresh capital into the rural industries, especially as prices for primary products are now depressed. If moden machiney and other necessary improvements could be purchased with new capital, graziers and farmers would be able to increase their production and lower their costs. The returns would build up their finances and every one would benefit. Another point relates to trade unions. The London"" Spectator"", in its issue of 24th January last, published a commentary on a book entitled ""The Crisis in Trade Unionism"" which was written by Mr Charles Curran. It was written on lines along which I have been thinking for some time-that a crisis is coming in trade unions. One has to examine very carefully all the ingredients necessary to develop a better community and a higher standard of living. These can only be provided by private capital, but the question arises of whether trade unionism will fulfil a useful function in time to come. Trade unions form a very important part of our life.

160,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [10.10],"Ito-day and to give effect to policies that will halt the growing numbers of unemployed. 1 do not intend to spend much time in dealing with the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson). It is quite apparent to every one that he knows little or nothing about the subjects that he sought to discuss. I shall take one example. He said that the cost of living has been reduced since interest rates were increased. In its report published on 30th June, 1957, and released recently, the Victorian Housing Commission saidThe one per cent, increase in interest rates in 1955 with a majority of 10 223 votes has resulted in an increase in rent of lis. to 12s. approximately per week in each housing comfication of Mr Beale at that time appeared mission home. That is in the State of Victoria. The honourable member said that wages represented the main source of costs associated with housing. What about the profits of those who provide paint, of those who sell the land, of those who provide the steel and a dozen and one other items, all of vvhich contribute so greatly to costs that they place homes outside the reach of the average man and woman? The honourable meniber also spoke about providing war service homes immediately. I have in my files letters which show that the War Service Homes Division is sending people to finance companies to get temporary accommodation at rates of interest ranging from 8 per cent, to 12 per cent. Those people are paying £8, £10 or more each week in interest while they are waiting for this Government to give them money so that they can provide their families with homes. Like all members of the AustraJian Country party, the honourable member for Hume does not believe in good conditions or wages for the working people. He blames high costs on those who receive wages. The honourable member showed that he was completely ignorant of the great issues on which he tried to address the House to-night. However, I have other matters with which I wish to deal. It is significant that, in this debate, the Government has not seen fit to give any Attention to the vote of censure passed on it in the Parramatta by-election. I lisented to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to-night. He spoke about housing, unemployment and other problems. He also spoke about those matters in Parramatta. in Parramatta? should not interject; he should enjoy histime in the Parliament while he can. Parramatta has given him an indication of what the people think of the Government to-day. Let us have a look at the situation in Parramatta and see how a vote of censure was passed on the Government for mattersabout which we have criticized them. The Parramatta electorate is regarded as a blueribbon Liberal seat. It was vacated by Mr Howard Beale, QC, who had been returned over his Labour opponent. The only qualito be that he was a former member of theLiberal party executive, with a rather undistinguished record at the Bar. In addition to that, he subsequently earned thetitle of the most costly Minister we have ever had with the cost-plus system which gave us St. Mary's, Bell Bay and other expensive instrumentalities. What did the Liberal party do to show that the Government's programme wouk' suit the people and was endorsed by the people? It selected as Liberal candidate Sir Garfield Barwick, who is now being awaited in the Parliament by those with an eye on a place in Cabinet as the plague awaited in some countries. Sir Garfield Barwick is an eminent Australian legal personality, known in New South Wales as well as the Prime Minister is-probabl y better and more favourably. He is a man ot capacity and achievement and one who is reputed to have given up a legal practice worth between £30,000 and £50,000 a yeat in order to serve the people. Prior to the by-election we were led to believe that he would go straight into the Federal Cabinet, and that he was the Prime Minister's peisonal choice to succeed him in that high office. In other words, excluding the honourable member for St. George, this Liberal member elect for Parramatta was the glamour candidate of the century, and one who would be expected at least to equal the capacity of the former member and to poll a similar majority. Some of the headlines in the newspapers have been, "" He'll give up a fortune for politics"", ""Brilliant at the Bar, will he become Prime Minister? "" and "" Canberra",66,British Economists Expect Bank Rate
161,Mr Graham,What did you speak abour.,67,British Economists Expect Bank Rate
162,Mr Daly,"The honourable memberhurdles for Sir Garfield "". They have all spoken in the highest terms of the capacity of this great and distinguished Australian, and I take nothing from him. I think that he is the best candidate the Liberal party has had for centuries. I only marvel ai the fact that a man with his wisdom should join the Liberal party, and if he comes here and is content to sit behind the present Ministry, then he has not a quarter of the brains that he is said to have. Reference has been made in the press to his tremendous legal prowess, his store-house of constitutional know-how and his scalpel-like mind, with the suggestion that those attributes should earn him Cabinet rank within a year or so. Everything is there: he is to take over the leadership of the Liberal party. On the other hand-and I say this quite sincerely-Labou r selected an outstanding candidate, a man who has rendered great service to the constituency and who is, in his'own right, a notable Australian. The voting at the by-election proved that the people of Parramatta thought that he was not only an excellent Labour candidate but also a man who might worthily represent the electors in the Parliament. What happened in Parramatta after the electors had read of this great man who had stepped down from a job with an income of -£50,00 0 or £60,000 a year? An intense campaign was conducted by the Liberal party. The Prime Minister spoke in the electorate. The honourable member for St. George should watch this, because the Liberal party lost 500 votes in the area in which the Prime Minister spoke. It is a pity that he did not visit more subdivisions. The Liberal candidate had an army of workers, regular propaganda on television, radio, press and public meetings and literature-enoug h to herald the arrival of a king. All the Liberal supporters simply shook with excitement when they met this new man who was to take his place in the Parliament and lead his party to future success. All the great issues were discussed in Parramatta. immigration, housing, financial restrictions, socal services and the many other problems on which the Government has been criticized, were discussed. One would have, thought, even knowing the incompetence of the Government, that the background of its candidate would have placed its ineptness in oblivion and that he would have been elected overwhelmingly. The Governmeni clouded the issue further by holding the by-election in the middle of Her Majesty's visit, hoping that the newspapers would leave ii alone. Let us look at what came out of thii grand campaign and at what the people of Parramatta thought of the record of trw Government on the issues that confront us. The Liberal majority is now about 4,859less than 5,000 votes. After a close scrutiny of the independent candidate's preferences, we find that the Liberal majority has slipped by more than 6,000 votes. To-night, the Prime Minister has told the people of the commendable job that the Government has. done. I can understand the interest of the honourable member for St. George in the figures. He has a right to be interested. In fact, I do not mind his interest, because St. George is a seat very like Parramatta. In the Eastwood subdivision of the Parramatta electorate-the blue-ribbon subdivision of all blue-ribbon subdivisionsthe Labour vote increased by 500. In this subdivision there were no new housing settlements. In the Rydalmere subdivision, the change was almost revolutionary. There, the Liberal candidate polled 3,696 votes and the Labour candidate polled 5,214 votes. In the previous election, the Liberal candidate polled 3,383 votes and the Labour candidate polled 3,128. In addition to that, in 1945 the Liberal party secured majorities in each and every one of the sub-divisions in the electorate, but on this occasion the Labour candidate won five out of the eight sub-divisions by a clear majority. Do not forget that the Prime Minister went to the electorate and spoke for this outstanding candidate. He discussed these important issues. He even said that unemployment was psychological. That statement, if I may use the expression, is on a par with the Prime Minister's statement last year, to the effect that only a shortage of man-power and materials prevented the people from having homes. Questions of unemployment, To summarize the position with regard to the Parramatta by-election, I point out that the Labour vote increased from 37 per cent, in 1945 to 44 per cent, on this occasion. At the same time, the Liberal vote decreased from 62 per cent, to 56 per cent. There was a reduction of 6.3 per cent, in the Liberal vote, and a corresponding increase in the Labour vote. I say to the honourable member for St. George-wit h due sympathy because at one time. I was in similar circumstances-that a repetition of such a vote next December will cause his cheerful face and those of many other honourable members opposite to be missing from the Opposition benches of this Parliament. The point I make is that this Government, which to-days says that it enjoys the confidence of the people, that there is no unemployment or want in the community, and that the standard of living is higha Country party member said so a few monents ago-o n Saturday faced the electors on these issues and was overwhemingly defeated except in blue-ribbon sub-divisions of the electorate, and even in those sub-divisions its majority was substantially decreased. This occurred at a time when the Government had the glamour candidate of glamour candidates to offer to the electors. The Parramatta by-election constituted a striking vote of censure on the Government, ft is of no use for the Prime Minister to say that 6,000 is a good majority. Of course it is a good majority, but let us be quite honest about the matter. If the former honourable member for Parramatta, Mr able member for Angas( Mr Downer), that Beale, could gain a majority of 10,000, then surely Sir Garfield Barwick should be able to double that majority. That is a fair proposition, and I make it in all sincerity. Any man who could not double Mr Beale's majority must be carrying a pretty big load. I point out these facts to-night to show that the people are fed up to the neck with honourable members opposite who will not understand the realities of the present situation and will not realize that not only are there many unemployed persons in the community, but also living standards are lower than they have ..been at any time since World War II . What will happen to this wizard, Sir Garfield Barwick, when he arrives here? I am not attacking him personally; I am dealing with the practical politics of the situation. Who is going to make way for him? Will it be the Prime Minister? Will it be the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt)? After all, the Minister has travelled the world, and has learned all there is to know about unemployment, from Capri to Miami. He has returned and told us that we have 74,000 unemployed, when everybody knows that the correct figure is about 174,000. The only practical contribution that the Minister has ever made to the unemployment situation, or, at any rate, the way in which he has at least got into the limelight, was by returning from his last world jaunt and entering a competition, wearing a synthetic suit, and winning a prize for the bestdressed man in a "" Wear More Woollens"" campaign. I ask again, "" Who will make way for Sir Garfield Barwick""? Will it be the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer)? Will the Minister for Air( Mr Osborne) stand aside, or will it be the Minister for PriMinister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) give way? As we all know, Sir Garfield Barwick is an eminent legal man, so he will probably end up as Postmaster-General. Let us consider the back-benchers. Will the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury) make way for him, or will it be the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme), that financial wizard who discourses so cheerfully in this Parliament? Will the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) stand aside, or will it be the honorup-and-coming young South Australian member? Whoever it is who decides to stand aside, let me advise him to do so quickly, because Sir Garfield is a backbencher now, and after the next election he will be a member of the Opposition. He has, therefore, only about nine months to spend on the Government benches. I make these statements to show that the problems facing this Government are real ones. What happened to Sir Garfield Barwick, the eminent Liberal party candidate, in Parramatta, is an indication of what the people think of this Government. The Government should take a lesson from the Parramatta by-election. It should realize, for instance, that it is about time the members of the ministry stayed at home. It has been said that travel broadens the mind. If this is the case, the Ministers of this Government must have cinemascope minds. They have all been around the world. An amount of almost £100,000 was provided in the last Budget to allow them to continue their travels. Only once since the last election have all the members of the Cabinet been in Australia at the",67,British Economists Expect Bank Rate
163,Mary Industry ( Mr Mcmahon)? Will The,"one time. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) and a number of others come here only for holidays. The reason why I point out these facts is to suggest that the people of Parramatta want a ministry that stays in the country and faces the problems that the people know exist. I do not attack any person who has to make a trip abroad on business, but I suggest that this Government has set an all-time record, and the vote in Parramatta sbould be an indication that the people want Ministers who will carry out their jobs. As some one has said, it is a pity that some Ministers ever return here at all, and that if they did not they probably Mary's factory, and that it has spent would not be missed. However, you cannot effectively administer a country if you have absentee Ministers. The people of Parramatta have made it clear that this is their view. What other matter should be considered as a result of the Parramatta by-election? The Minister for Labour and National Service has said that there is no unemployment. Every one knows that to-day thousands and thousands of persons are unemployed. They know that although the Minister has given the figure as 74,000, it is probably in the vicinity of 174,000. Throughout the country there are men and women who want work. The Government is sponsoring an immigration scheme under which persons are now being brought to this country and being given the unemployment benent immediately on arriving here. I can cite instances of this from my own constituency. It is as unfair to the immigrants as it is to our own people. Yet the Government says that there is no unemployment. It is of no use for the Prime Minister to tell us that there is no unemployment, and to cite a lot of figures. He knows that the 1949 coal strike was a national crisis, and that it caused widespread unemployment. We have a government that boasts of its capacity to employ people, but which refuses to make money available so that employment may be provided. Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that there is no money available for developmental work because the private banking institutions are lending their money at exorbitant rates of interest through hire-purchase companies. They will not make money available for homes or for developmental works at lower rates of interest because they can make greater profits through their hire-purchase activities. Honourable members opposite say that because a man has a motor car and a refrigerator he is enjoying a higher standard of living. The only reason why many people have these things is that they can borrow a few pounds to buy them, but they cannot borrow money for homes at lower rates of interest. Another lesson that the Government should learn from the Parramatta by-election is that it must carefully consider its defence policy. We know that the Government spent £23,000,000 on the St. £1,250,000,000 on defence since 1949. In another place the other day Senator Kendall said that the members of the army should be employed in shooting kangaroos and rabbits because guns will be of no use in the next great connict. Is it any wonder that at the by-election the people of Parramatta showed their displeasure with the Government? The treatment meted out to pensioners is scandalous in the extreme. The miserable pittance that they receive from this Government is something of which the Government should be ashamed, when one considers the decline in the purchasing power of the £1. Interest rates at present being charged result in the exploitation of men and women in all walks of life, ex-servicemen and others. The Government stands idly by while financial racketeers and exploiters take full advantage of the sufferings of the people and extract from them every penny that they possibly can. There is a grave shortage of schools and hospitals. Many developmental works are required throughout Australia. Yet the Government refuses to make money available, and tells the people that there is no money for the carrying out of works that would help to ease the unemployment position. Honourable members opposite know as well as I know that if war broke out to-morrow there would be money unlimited for the defence of this countryand rightly so. It is time that the government of the day made some more money available in order that men and women may be employed and this country developed. These are some of the lessons that the Government ought to learn from the result of the Parramatta by-election, which was a striking indictment of the Government and if so, when does he propose to make them its incompetence. It was a vote by electors available? on the question of growing unemployment, to 2.indicate of which they may shortly be the victims, and it was a vote against the Government's committee, stated that heavy doses of X-ray restrictive finance policy.

He ought to remember years, that unemployment is growing rapidly in leukaemia is of much more recent date as is the this country under the financial policy of testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs? this Government. I summarize the position by saying that at the Parramatta by-election the Government had a chance to win support on the issues that confront the people of this nation. It had the opportunity to have its record endorsed. The Government from parties put everything they had into the several occasions in regard to various aspects of campaign. They told the people of that the radiation problem. electorate things that we believed to be untrue and knew to be untrue, and they in course of preparation. Meanwhile, in accordhoped that the people would swallow them. effectively But the result was a damning indictment advising the Government of the measures necesof the Government and its policy, which sary to ensure that the health and welfare of the was shown by the very reduced vote for community are safeguarded in these matters. the Government's spectacular candidate in the by-election. Let the vote in Parrawould matta be a lesson to the Government. leukaemia in any country. Undoubtedly that vote heralds the demise of the Government in the not far distant future.

Mr Ward asked the Minister for Supply, upon notice1.

It is stressed that the figure could be considerably greater. For example, the National Academy of Sciencies. 1956, in "" The Biological Effects of Atomic Radiation"". records a factor of between 60 and 150 for a similar estimate.",69,British Economists Expect Bank Rate

Prior to August, 1957, these amounts were £3 3s. a day and £5 5s. respectively. 2. It is not felt that the staff effort involved in specially assembling the details sought could be justified. However, in the last financial year total expenditure in respect of the items mentioned above was approximately £431. National Service Training Scheme. Mr Ward asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice1. How many ballots have been conducted by his department, in connection with the national service training scheme? 2. Is it still the practice to maintain a ban upon the publication of the results or to prohibit any persons present from disclosing information in relation to the ballots as was the case in respect of the first ballot? 3. Why is the strictest secrecy being observed in these matters? 4. What persons are permitted to be present during the holding of the ballots? Mr Harold Holt -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Three. 2. Yes. 3. and 4. The practice that has been followed since the first ballot has been for me to nominate an honourable member to preside over proceedings. In addition to the appropriate Departmental officers, the following are invited to be presenl at each ballota prominent citizen selected by me to make the draw, a senior representative of the Army, representatives of the press and radio stations, and employer and trade union members of the Ministry of Labour Advisory Council. Following the ballot, each registrant is advised personally and officially of his position in respect of call-up. The results cf a ballot are not made public for a variety of very sound reasons. Basically these are concerned with the need to avoid confusion and misunderstanding on the part of registrants as to their obligations in relation to National Service and to keep administrative costs of the minimum.
