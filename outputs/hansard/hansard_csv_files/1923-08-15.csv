15,Mr Charlton,"The Governmentbe told that I am taking up the time allotted for the discussion of this measure, but we, on this side, are not as docile as are the Government supporters. We are the representatives of the people, and we insist that our rights shall not be infringed. A t the last election, the majority of votes was cast for the Labour party. We have the confidence of the people, and must protest against the Government trampling upon their rights by rushing through measures without a proper consideration of them. Have honourable gentlemen opposite any conscience? Do you know the difference between right and wrong? member to address the Chair. Speaker, I ask whether the Government are following the proper procedure, and whether they are acting in the interests of the people? It is quite possible that when the War Service Homes Bill is >assed it will contain many defects, and ! eave loopholes for further scandals. The Government threaten to proceed with new business after 11 o'clock to-night. If they intend to govern the country in this way, we might as well go home. What rights have we in this House? What can we do for the country? It is time we proclaimed from every platform the Government's inability to carry out their business. .Throughout my oolitical history I have endeavoured to be fair and reasonable, but I have never yet known a session to be closed after ten or eleven weeks merely to suit the convenience of the Prime Minister. The Government do not consider this party. Their supporters ignore the proceedings of the House until the bells ring for a division. We are kept here at extraordinary hours to permit the right honourable gentleman to go abroad. This has never occurred in the history of any other country. Honourable gentlemen opposite probably think that they are exceptionally clever. They have the ""gag"" at their disposal, and they are using it to the utmost. No body of fair-minded men would attempt to do such a thing. If they had any spark of manhood in them, they would refuse to accept the dictation of the Prime Minister. Their attitude is a disgrace to the conduct of public affairs of this country, and it is time some one indulged in frank speaking. The right honorable gentleman, in his desire to go overseas, is subordinating every interest to his will. He is a "" come-by-chance "" Prime Minister, the' biggest fluke that ever occurred. I do not know but what there was a breach of faith in the formation of the Government. member is not discussing the question before the House. I feel. I am absolutely disgusted with the attitude of the supporters of the Government.

During my twenty years' experience in the Federal Parliament and a State Parliament I have always endeavoured to. obey the Standing Orders, and I hope I shall not be caused to do otherwise. Why should we sit twelve hours a day, and allow legislation to be bludgeoned through this House merely to suit the convenience of the Prime Minister? What is taking place is no credit to the supporters of the Prime Minister, who are just as guilty as he. I hope the Prime Minister will have sufficient manhood to withdraw the motion. Under the Standing Orders, he can bludgeon legislation through this Chamber. T venture to say that, if this House adjourns on Thursday week for the purpose of giving a banquet to. the Prime Minister, in view of the disgraceful methods of the Government in conducting the business of the country, and the treatment received by the Opposition, this party will refuse to attend the function. am prepared to support the motion conditionally upon getting some information from the Prime Minister about the business likely to be brought before this House.

I ask the Prime Minister to indicate to the House the nature of any new business. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) wanted to know whether the gentlemen who support the Government have any conscience. through this Chamber the Government ancl their stipportcrs have no need for such an encumbrance. They have set a limit on debate. There is one step further, and that is to suspend the Standing Orders, and prevent discussion altogether. I am reminded of the linesAlight was right iwihen C'icsar (hied upon the stones of Koine: Might was right when Joshua led 'his hordes o'er Jordan's (fon.ni; Might was right when German odds swept down on Paris .gay: The maxim of the ancient world is the maxim of to-day. The Government have used their might, and used the "" gag."" They do not know what is right. Without any analysis, Bills are rushed through this Chamber, though crudely and rudely drafted. It is evident that the Crown Law officers have not had sufficient time to consider them properly. The Government exercise their power by. brute force. Honourable members opposite are endorsing a .policy of which, if opponents of the Government, they would bitterly complain. No information is volunteered by Ministers concerning their Bills, and honourable members have torely upon their investigations outside this' Chamber. One of the newspapers to-day, commenting on a certain measure, substituted for "" 2 "" the figure "" 1 . "" No explanation is made by the Minister. Owing to the short space of time at the disposal of Ministers, they, themselves, cannot give the necessary attention to the measures they introduce. If the Prime Minister persists in his present attitude, he will leave Australia with a very bad taste in his mouth that will by no means be diminished when he returns. I rise for the purpose of showing the muddle into which the business of the House is being brought by reason of the actions of the Government. On the business-paper this morning fifteen important questions appeared, not one of which could be answered because, owing to the length of time honourable members are asked to sit, Ministers are unable to attend to the work of their Departments. I . was astounded when I saw that the Prime Minister intended to move this motion. Do the Government intend to rush through legislation at high In forcing legislation pressure from 11 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night, and then introduce new measures when honourable members are worn out and"" are not in a fit state mentally to give to those measures the consideration that is warranted? The time which honourable members have between sittings must be devoted to sleep. This is not responsible government-it is fhe rule of the jungle; it is brute force. There is also a good deal of stupidity in if. I strongly protest against this action of the Government. Those honourable members who support the motion will regret their action in the future. Parliament . might as well be closed up altogether. Why work this joke on. the people and endeavour to convince them that legislation is being properly considered by their representatives? The War Service Homes Bill contains provisions affecting the men who fought in the war. Honourable members are not able to anaylze that measure, or give proper consideration to it. Do the Government hope that by the use of these tactics honourable members on this side will become so worn out that it will be possible to slip through important legislation having as its object the giving of assistance to the big interests represented by honourable members opposite? If they do, they will be disappointed. The Opposition will continue to expose these tactics.

During my long political career there have not been circumstances which I regret so keenly as those that have existed during this session. The position is a serious one. My Leader( Mr Charlton) has been "" gagged "" on,no fewer than 113 occasions when be has attempted to address this Chamber. What is the reason for it? Isi t because the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) occupies a higher position socially? Isi t because the Leader of the Opposition owns to humble parentage, and by his own efforts has raised himself to the position he now occupies, and has demonstrated his ability to assist intelligently the development of this country? There must be some reason underlying this action of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman is one of Australia's fortunate ""sons. He has possessed opportunities which enabled him to have a university education. He was enabled to go to the Middle Temple, in London, and obtain a legal training. -Order! The honourable member for East Sydney is well aware that the matter to which .he is now referring has nothing whatever to do with the motion. I ask him to confine himself to the terms of the motion. sir, like me orable member will not discuss / the motion, I shall put it to tlie House. object of the motion is to enable the House to proceed with new business after 11 o'clock at night. I do not believe there is a living soul who will contend that propei consideration can be given 1 to legislation if this practice is adopted. SinceI have been a member of this HouseI have always endeavoured to be in nry place from the beginning to the end of every' sitting. I realize tlie responsiafter 11 o'clock at night, after honorbility and the duty which I OAVC to my constituents. When I went before the electors of East SydneyI told them that, it' I were elected, I would faithfully carry out my duties. I challenge you, Mr Speaker, I challenge the Prime Minister, and those supporting him, to say that those duties can be satisfactorily performed under the conditions proposed. I have had experience of parliamentary life in Australia, extending over a period of forty-five years, and I say, without hesitation, that every scandal that has occurred has been the result of legislation which has been passed at a late hour of the night. Does .the Prime' Minister, and those sitting Behind him, know that after 10 o'clock at night the press does not report the proceedings of this Chamber? Does he not realize that these conditions do not > make for a good report of our debates by the official staff? Will any honourable member.deny that there is some reason, which does not appear on the surface, that is actuating the Prime Minister in v this course of action ? Has not the Prime Minister, during this session, used every power conferred upon him by the Standing Orders, to force through legislation. The rights and privileges of honourable members during recent years have been slipping away from them one by one. The men whose portraits hang in the Queen's Hall would never have tolerated such action as this. They were men of ability, and they believed that it was necessary to conserve the privileges and the liberties of honourable members. This standing order was framed to prevent the victimiz-. ing of those who happen to be in a minority in this Chamber. What is proposed is beyond human endurance. When .Parliament agreed to increase the salaries of honourable members it did so in the belief that that action would result in greater attention being paid to the affairs of the country. It was not intended that honourable members should be . brought to an early grave. Members of the Labour party with whom I had been associated have gone to an early grave because of the efforts they put. forth to make Australia an example in the eyes of tlie *world in regard to its social legislation, and the improved conditions of the people. Good work cannot be done if Bills are to be brought in able members have been sitting continuously for twelve hours.

He could not have been more sincere in his appeal to the Prime Minister to allow the business of this House to be conducted in a proper manner. I feel confident that the people generally will endorse the action of the Opposition in protesting so vigorously against this proposal. I am the son of a Britisher who loved liberty dearly, and I feel constrained this morning to speak a word for the liberties of the people of my adopted country. It is a retrograde step that is proposed, and the country must suffer through it.

We are getting towards the close of the session, and up to the present progress has been made according to the programme of the Prime Minister. The hour for meeting has already been changed from half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon to 11 o'clock in the morning, and now the Government ask for power to introduce fresh business after 11 o'clock at night. Our Standing Orders were carefully drawn up by former members of this House, with a view to preventing business being brought on at an hour when members might be absent or tired ,out. Standing order No. 70 is a protection, not only to honourable members, but to the country at large; nevertheless, the Prime Minister breezily moves its suspension. The right honourable gentleman has said that the Government does not desire to have all-night sittings, but the suspension of the standing order really encourages the evil. Surelyi t should be sufficient to devote twelve hours a day to the programme of the Government? It is a grave reflection on honourable members opposite to say that, in the absence of the (South Sydney) Prime Minister, not one of his colleagues is capable of carrying on the business of Parliament for a week or so. I should be ashamed to be a supporter of a Government the leader of which had so bad an opinion of his colleagues and party. The members of the .Country party have almost an equal share of power in the Cabinet, with the ex-Leader (Dr. Earle Page) as Treasurer, and yet they allow that gentleman to be snubbed as he is when, the Prime Minister tells him that ho is not competent to conduct the",18,Business After 11p M

46,Mr E. Riley,"I appeal to the combusiness of this House for a time. The truth is that the Government is trying to do too much. An attempt is being made to establish a record, the only result of which must be ill-considered and ineffective legislation. I remind honourable members opposite that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has to examine every measure, so as to be able to intelligently and effectively criticise it . ten Ministers who introduce Bills, and they have at their disposal all the machinery of government, with which to thoroughly inform themselves. The Leader of the Opposition enjoys no such advantages. In the name of common sense and fair play, I ask the Government to give the Opposition a chance. Are the Bills introduced by the Government not worth discussing? If they are not, they ought not to be on the notice paper. ""Would the Prime Minister, if he were in opposition, like to be treated as we on this side are ? We have been working every day of the week from. Monday to Saturday, with extended hours, and, as I have already indicated, the rush and hurry can only result in ill-digested legislation, which will give rise to confusion, and possibly expensive litigation. Why, this morning we were told by Ministers that they had not had time to obtain answers to questions of which notice was given yesterday. I cannot blame Ministers for this under the circumstances, but it is a most extraordinary occurrence. If we cannot do all the work this session, let some of it stand over t ill the state of the House. next session. It ought to be remembered that the last election was fought largely on the question of the conduct of business by the ex-Prime Minister( Mr W. M . Hughes), and I warn the present Government that they are making a great mistake. This is not a party question, but one to be settled by the entire House, and my own opinion is that a day of twelve hours is enough. I endorse the remarks of my Leader( Mr Charlton). Even the Prime Minister will admit that when that honourable gentleman makes a request in this Chamberi t comes from the most reasonable man here. too. patient, courteous, and considerate. I do not know whether the fact is recorded in Hansard, but the Prime Minister has intimated that he is exceptionally thankful to the Opposition for the way in which they had met the Government up to, practically, the other day. Are we to fritter away the rights ahd privileges for which the Radicals of the old days fought ? The There are eight or methods of the Government are enough to make some of these old political pioneei'S turn in their graves. We met on the 13th June, and to-day is the 15th August, .almost two months to a day, and < the Parliament has already done work that usually occupies six months. Even when a period of six months is allotted, mistakes are made in legislationand I can quite see that next session will be devoted to amending measures. If there is any spirit of fairness in the majority of honourable members opposite, they will give more consideration to the position of the Opposition. When I realize the work that faces us in the next few days, I feel inclined to ask the State authorities to send round a factory inspector to deal with the sweaters in this institution. I certainly think a prosecution would .lie against the Prime Minister. . As the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley), has pointed out, we have the exhibition this morning of Ministers, one after the other, admitting their inability to answer questions on notice. [Quorum formed.] the business of the country is absolutely neglected. The answers to some of these questions were required as early as possible-to-day, but in the rush Ministers are unable to supply them. Last week, £62,000,000 was voted to the accompanying snores of tired members on the Ministerial side reclining on the seats. However, if we are denied the right to speak here, we still have the right of addressing public meetings. I hope that in the coming recess the platforms of the country will ring with denunciation of the disgraceful conduct of the Government and their supporters.

What is meant by the taunt of honourable members opposite when they ask, "" Do you blame the Prime. Minister for shutting up Parliament ?"" The meaning simply is that there is no one competent to take his position. Could anything be more humiliating to Ministers aud supporters of the Government? This is the time for plain speaking, and plainspeaking there will be both here and outside. The step proposed by the Government is retrograde and disgraceful. Surely honourable members opposite have opinions of their own? However that may be, they now present a miserable spectacle as dumb dogs and tools of the Leader of the Government. made that honourable members on this side have spoken too frequently. charged with obstructing the business of the House that we were unable to retaliate.

Government is to suspend standing order No. 70 to enable opposed business to be taken after 11 p.m. will probably present a measure at that hour, and after the second reading has been moved, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) will probably be allowed a quarter of an hour in which to debate the Bill. It is mentally and physically impossible for honourable members to give /proper consideration to important measures, in the early hours of-the morning, in such a limited time. I have great respect for the institution of Parliament, and for the Standing Orders, which have been framed with a view to carrying out business in a reasonable and proper way. I have never supported the application of the closure, and I trust that I shall never be guilty of doing so, because, in Parliament, the freest possible discussion should be allowedAlthough we are the largest party in this House, we are in a minority, but the day is not far distant when a Labour Ministry will occupy the Treasury bench, and when that time comes, I shall see that every honourable member has the right to freely discuss whatever measures may be submitted for consideration. I know that it will be said that a Leader of this party yas once responsible for a procedure similar to that now proposed, but on that occasion I did not support him in amending the Standing Orders. The position is different to-day. If the Labour party was in power, and there were only five honourable members in Opposition, I should extend to them the utmost courtesy, and allow the fullest possible opportunity to discuss Bills of national importance. It is a diabolical trick for any Government or party t* deprive the representatives of the electors of their right to be heard. The guillotine will fall from time to time during the remaining days of the session, but, thank God, another guillotine will descend, not upon the representatives of the Opposition, but upon those who have debarred us from exercising the rights and privileges which were fought for and maintained by the fine old radical fighters in the early political history of Australia. I support the Leader of the Opposition, and shall resent every effort made to encroach upon the liberties, rights, and privileges of the people of the Commonwealth. No other Government would seek 'to restrict the debating of important matters in this House, as is now proposed by this Administration. I 'know perfectly well what the Labour party would do in similar circumstances. It would not impose restrictions of this character. A Labour Ministry would not dare to submit such a proposal, because it could not possibly expect the support of its followers. This matter has been discussed in the caucus room of the Nationalist party, and those who showed signs of resentment have been flattened by the party steam-roller. ' Even now the supporters of the Government do not seem to realize the enormity of what they are attempting.

He is actuated more by the desire to leave for London than to conserve the welfare of Australia. helped by his docile followers, who have not the courage and probably not the ability, to speak on the Biil, but sit like so many dumb-driven cattle, and vote as they are told my emphatic protest against the policy [12.16] -As a new member, I am beginning to realize why the Northern Territory has been neglected for so long. The explanation is that honourable members are not allowed an opportunity of intelligently national importance that come before the 'House. liament, the thought has occurred to me that the Government would be wise to replace this pretence of legislation by a picture show. There is an excellent place for hanging a screen, the pictures could be projected from the Strangers' Gallery, and from time io time the Prime Minister during his travels abroad could send back a film to add to the programme. The Sergeant-at-Arms might stand on the steps outside the building, and act as spruiker, to advise the public that a sponsible government has been reduced to a farce. The War Service Homes Bill, a measure of vital importance to Australia, is to come before the House,, and members will have no opportunity of discussing it . We have received invitations r to a dinner to the Prime Minister on Thursday week, and I understand that it is proposed that the House shall adjourn . to enable us to attend. In ordinary circumstances I should be pleased to attend such a function; but, whilst I have no desire to show disrespect to the Prime Minister, I think the business of the country is of paramount importance. Therefore, if an. official dinner must be given, it should take place during the ordinary dinner adjournment. If it is impossible for the Parliament to dispose of a certain programme of business before the 24th August, surely the proper course' is to either postpone the business or prolong the session. Every honourable member has a perfect right to discuss each That measure, but last night we witnessed the spectacle of three soldier members desiring to speak on the second reading of an important Bill, with only twelve minutes remaining before the guillotine would fall.

Every honourable member on both sides of the House is in favour of that measure, and I believe that honourable members of the Opposition equally with honourable members on this side of the House, will agree to every clause in the measure, when it has been explained. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) said that last night three soldier members of the Labour party desired to speak on the second reading of the War Service Homes Bill, but were ""gagged."" There were not three members of the Labour party, let alone tbree soldier members, in the chamber when the guillotine fell. One soldier member of the Opposition was in Sydney.

If honourable members opposite think that that is fair and bonny play they have forgotten the meaning of the term. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) said that there were not three returned soldier members of the Labour party in the Chamber last night ready to speak on the War Service Homes Bill. The paid hireling of the Government ber knows that it is unparliamentary to apply the word ""hireling "" to any honourable member. I ask that it be withdrawn. paid servant of the Government, which means the same. His duty is to get his docile flock to stand behind the Government, through thick and thin, and when he finds that honourable members on this side are putting up a fight, he makes a statement which he hopes will encourage the Ministerialists iu their docility. statement he made was contrary to fact. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr the member is. The fact of the matter Yates) was on his feet when the guillotine fell last night, aud two other soldier members-the honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Riley), and the honourable were in the chamber at the time. has any sense of decency he will withdraw his incorrect statement, and apologize for having made it . He also said that honourable members of the Opposition had declared that they intended to obstruct business. Wo' are not doing so. If we had attempted to unreasonably obstruct business I could understand severe measures being taken by the Government against us, but our attitude throughout the session has been reasonable, and on various occasions the Prime Minister has admitted that the Opposition has helped the Government in the transaction of business. I say frankly that our Leader has treated the Government too kindly, and my experience in life has been that if one is too lenient to one's opponents, they interpret that forbearance as weakness and proceed to abuse it. The Leader of the Opposition has very onerous duties to discharge, and his task becomes heavier when the House sits for such long hours. The Prime Minister is quite prepared to undergo the ordeal of continuous sittings because he has the prospect of a six-weeks sea trip, which will enable him to recuperate. No such prospect is before the Leader of the Opposition. Honourable members opposite should, in fairness, consider these facts. The 'sole reason for all this bustle and hurry is the desire of the Prime Minister to go to London. In the last eighteen months this House, honourable members of Avhich are paid £1,000 per annum to attend to the country's business and legislate for the benefit . of the people, has been in session for only three months. I challenge any honourable member on the other side of the House to accompany me into his own district and fight a campaign for a month on the attitude the Government have adopted, and on his attitude of sitting silently behind the Government. I make bold to say that no honourable member could face his district The in such a campaign and justify himself. I do not care which district it is or who is that many honourable members opposite have two or three jobs, and they want to get back to their farms, their offices, or their gardens as soon as possible. But when honourable members accept membership in this House, the business of the country should be their first consideration. They cannot justly excuse their action in assisting to close Parliament by saying that they wish to get back to their ordinary business. I feel very strongly on this matter, although this is the first speech I have made in protest against the action of the Government. I admit that I have thrown some strong interjections across the chamber, but no honourable member can say that my attitude is unjustifiable. Honourable members were elected, to represent the pieople and to do certain work, ahd they should do it. I can understand the desire of the Prime Minister to go back to Great Britain. He left that country a few years ago, as a private citizen, and he desires to go back now as the Prime Minister of -a great Commonwealth.

I ask the honcan only become possible with the -permission of weaklings. Honourable members opposite can take that statement as they like. Minister is trading on the inexperience of the new members he has behind him. I was once a new member, and I freely admit that for the first three years I was in this ChamberI did not know the ropes, and I felt strange. That is the position of a number of honourable members behind the Government at present. In the party room they are told that certain things happened iu other sessions, and that the Government proposals are quite a!ll right. I have been a fairly close student of Hansard, and I say, without fear of contradiction, that at no period .during our twenty odd years of Federal parliamentary history has Parliament met for only three months in eighteen months, and in. that period had the "" gag"" and the guillotine applied as the Government is now applying it. Tl.e thing that galls me more than anything else is the remembrance of the attitude adopted in the last Parliament by some honourable members who are now sitting behind the Government. I refer to the representatives of the .Country party. I have great respect for many of those honourable members, and I like to chat with them and obtain their advice on certain matters; but I cannot comprehend how they can sit behind ihe Government and assist to restrict the >:ights in the precincts of the House. of the people, when only last year they were so emphatic that Parliament should be free and untrammelled. In the last election campaign, as well as in the last Parliament, their Leader boasted of their desire to restore proper parliamentary government. We find, however, that although twenty-five measures are on the business-paper, honourable members are not to be permitted sufficient time to deal properly with any of them. The Government has given us less than a fortnight to complete the programme. The Mr Galo. Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart) is a party to this. -The honourable member will realize that he has had more than reasonable latitude.

We have reached the limit of our endurance of the extraordinary way the Government is conducting the business of this House. Before honourable members. I support this motion, I ask them to consider for a moment the unfortunate history of some of the best statesmen who have been elected to membership of this Parliament. A heavy mortality has occurred amongst members of the Federal Parliament. The severe strain that has been placed upon some of,the ablest men who fyave entered this Chamber has resulted in their early death. Those men, however, were not obliged to submit to such procedure as the Government has been following during the last two or three weeks. The strain that is now being put upon honourable members is almost beyond physical endurance. Honourable members are unable properly to I rise to make a personal discharge their duties or to stand up under the heavy load of work that the Government is heaping upon*them. An extraordinary course is now proposed to which honourable members should not consent.

When he was prea sitting extends beyond a certain period they cannot possibly endure the strain ahd do their work as it should I do not wish to do the be done.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: Standing order 262A, section vii , which was adopted by the House on the 16th October, 1918, and applies to the limitation of debate, saysThe closure adopted by the House on the 23rd November, 1905, shall not apply to any proceedings in respect of which time has been he or any other honourable member may allotted in pursuance of this standing order. I rule that as a certain time has been allotted for the consideration of the measure under discussion, under section vii of standing order 262A, providing that the closure shall not apply to any proceedings in respect of which time has oeen allotted in pursuance of that standing order, the motion submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, whilst not the closure in precise terms, is the same in effect. sent from your ruling. I am reluctantly compelled to do so. The standing order, as quoted by you, is without ambiguity. It says that the closure shall not apply to any proceedings in respect of which time has been allotted to the consideration of a particular matter under the guillotine provisions-that is to say, the closure is not to apply to discussions generally on any ques-tion, but it may be applied to any individual member. it is quite competent for the Committee to decide that certain members shall not be heard at all, and that one or two honourable members shall be allowed to occupy the whole of the time allotted under the guillotine provisions. The object in preventing the moving of the closure when the guillotine provisions have been applied is to prevent the time allowed for the consideration of the particular matter being further restricted,, than the House has decided that they shall be. That is obviously the intention of the standing order. The House deliberately allots a certain time for the discussion of a matter. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN"" Order! from your ruling, sir. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I have recognised that. dissent ? your ruling? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I wish to inform the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) that there is a way under the Standing Orders by which dissent from my ruling.

The Committee can always control its individual members, and it is always within the province of the Committee to carry the closure against any individual. The real point in this case is that a certain amount of time has been allotted for the consideration of the Bill, and when that time has elapsed the guillotine will automatically operate. The closure cannot be applied to bring about a greater limitation of the debate than that imposed by the resolution of the House, but there may be a limitation imposed upon the time occupied by an individual member. I hope that honourable members generally realize the position, and will not decide this question in a party spirit. I hope, too, that they will acquit me of wishing to do so. My object is to preserve the rights of honourable members generally. The rules and procedure of Parliament have been laid down, and have been found to work out very well indeed. They are intended to preserve the rights and liberties of honourable members generally, and should not be lightly set aside. If the present ruling of the Chairman is allowed to stand, one honourable member might get up, and deliberately waste time i u the most tedious way. bourne Ports moved that the Minister for Works and Railways be no longer heard, and the Chairman ruled the motion out of order on the ground that a time limit had been fixed for the debate.

I support the motion to dissent from your ruling. The division upon the point raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was nothing short of a reflection upon honourable members opposite. least a dozen of them voted in the dark. It is very interesting to find that the honourable member for Swan is the victim of the guillotine, which he helps to operate: He has been a very consistent supporter of the Government through thick and thin, right or wrong, and he has always been ready to build a little bridge to enable the Government to escape from any difficulty. He voted for the limitation of the speeches upon this Bill, and, consequently, he was not able to make upon 'the second reading the speech which he intended to broadcast through his electorate. make it on clause 1. It was amusing to us to see the honourable member hoist with his own petard. reading last night when the honourable member was away. away. I was here and heard the speech. The honourable member was not able to say all he wanted to say, and perhaps when he saw the proof of his speech this morning he realized that it was not worth distributing to his constituents. Therefore, he attempted to make another general speech upon clause 1. The honourable member for Ballarat detected that the honourable member for Swan was actually discussing sub-clause a of clause 2 on page* 5 of the Bill, and he drew the attention of the Chair to that fact. You, sir, ruled that there was no point of order in the honourable member's objection. I would not mind if we could all make a second-reading speech on a clause of this B ill ; but even a loyal, diligent, thickshould not be treated differently from honourable members of the Opposition.

The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) was rather out of order, because the standing order states that honourable members must confine their attention entirely to the clause under notice; but it may be wise for us to defeat this motion, and up-, hold the Temporary Chairman, so that honourable members may discuss this' Bill fully.

Last night the Minister stated how anxious he was to avoid past scandals, and he stated that he intended to exercise a strict supervision over the War Service Homes Department. The Minister will prove his sincerity by accepting the amendment. It does not place any onerous duty upon him or the Department. Many scandals have developed concerning War Servioe Homes, and each succeeding Minister has shifted the responsibility to some one else, and very often at considerable expense. The Minister should be held responsible for the transactions of this Department. I would go further than the amendment of the honourable' member 1 for Darling, and restrict the expenditure for the building of a home to £1,000. Few of these buildings cost more than that sum. under the proposed amendment twenty transactions would involve £20,000; but if the clause is allowed to stand, the Commissioner will be responsible for the expenditure of about £40,000 on those transactions. If the amendment had proposed a reduction to £500 instead of to £1,000, it would have received my support. port the amendment. proposed by the Minister is a strong indictment of the preceding Minister. The original Act provided that when an does not object to this provision? expenditure of £5;000 was contemplated, the Commissioner should submit his proposal for the approval of the Minister. on record its true meaning, so that the The proposed clause is tantamount to people may see how the past administrasaying that the Commissioner and Detion has been carried on.

It is not which could restore the equilibrium of a very nice thing to say of a predecessor, the nation after four years of war, but probably the Minister has found that and it is now disclosed how that Governsuch was the case. The previous Minment did it. Evidently the Minister is ister is not at present in this House, not sure of himself, or sure of his officers, since he has been dealt with by the so he places this limitation on unapproved electors. I remember that one Minister expenditure, and restricts his own power. of the Crown, when referring to the I shall support the amendment, but Kidman-Mayan contract, stated that not because I have any doubt or some one ought to have been put in fear in regard to the present Minisgaol.

The words "" and . obtain "", as proposed by the Government, mean that the preceding Minister has not carried out his job. I want to know whether previous 'expenditure was submitted for the approval of the Minister. This is a national Department, and the "" saviours of the nation"" spent money indiscriminately. The chickens are now coming home to roost, and this is one of them. The Minister admits' a deficiency in 1 the neighbourhood of £3,000,000, caused in our efforts to give our suffering warriors the best that the nation can give them. But who has had the best that the nation can give? Those with whom the Government are now pleading to reinvest in the loans. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN, As has been pointed out, Order! mark is not quite apropos of the amendment, but it is relevant to the position as we find it to-day.

Year after year they approached the Federal Parliament for assistance. I remember in the early days moving a motion in another Chamber of this Parliament, that the system of distributing revenue collected in all the ports of Australia should be altered. I showed clearly that if the motion were carried Tasmania would benefit by some £80,000 or '£90,000 in revenue. Chamber that the request was reasonable. However, the motion was lost by one vote. That started the idea of adjusting the financial arrangements between the State of Tasmania and the Commonwealth. It was recognised that, sooner or later, the system would have to be altered. In 1910, the Labour party came into power, and almost immediately a resolution was carried that a Royal Commission be appointed to inquire into the whole of the financial arrangements between Tasmania and the Commonwealth. The Commission reported that Tasmania had lost, since Federation, at least an average of £90,000 a year for ten years. The report was based on irrefutable evidence taken from all possible sources. Tasmania's revenue over those ten years, instead of increasing, had decreased. which Mr Fisher was Prime Minister, passed an Act making a special grant of £500,000 to Tasmania, spread over a number of years. Later, an additional £400,000 was granted. was paid in yearly instalments, and when the last instalment was falling due the Tasmanian financiers were very much disturbed because the Treasury. collected only from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 from all sources. 45,000 taxpayers. Mr O'KEEFE -That is so. The Treasury was face to face with a dead loss of £80,000 or £90,000. An attempt was made in this Parliament to renew the grant for another term of years. In justification of Tasmania's claim, I point out that Western Australia, in the early years of Federation, obtained from this Parliament a considerably larger amount. When the last instalment was paid to Tasmania, it was proposed that a further grant should be given over a further term of years. The last Parliament granted £85,000 for one year. The then Treasurer stated that it was intended to hold a Conference between the Commonwealth and the State financial authorities during the following year, when the whole question of the financial adjustments would be considered. As we know, the Conference was held, and the financial proposals of the Ministers at the Conference have not yet been adopted. Tasmania is certainly entitled to the grant proposed I satisfied that by this Bill, but it should not be a yearly arrangement. It should provide for a special grant of £100,000 a year, over a term of five years. After that period, the financial situation could again be reviewed. Eveni f the grant were £100,000 a year, I doubt whether it would be on a par with that paid to Western Australia. ern Australia is £140,000. Mr O'KEEFE -Western Australia has a larger population than has Tasmania, but I submit that greater justice would have been done if this Bill had proposed a special grant. we suggested to Tasmania was contingent on the acceptance of our proposals. The Labour Government, in Mr O'KEEFE -On every occasion when I have had the opportunity, on the public platform and elsewhere, I have urged that £100,000 was only a fair sum, That amount but that the payment of it should not he subject to an arrangement made from year to year. I do not feel inclined to move an amendment, simply because I am satisfied that it would not be carried. I am not disposed to offer any objection on the score of the amount, but if any honourable member opposite desires to move that it be increased, I shall support him. However, I welcome the Bill as. at least, an. instalment of justice long overdue, though I should have much preferred if it had provided for £100,000 over a term of five years. new financial agreement Tasmania will get much mdre.

I am doubtful what would happen if the proposed new arrangements are accepted, seeing that the Commonwealth would then withdraw the per capita payment of 25s. per head, allowing Tasmania to practically cover the whole field of taxation with the exception of that relating to companies. Of course, the new arrangements would be quite satisfactory to the large land-holders and other wealthy people-the y would be splendid for the land monopolists of the State-bu t if the per capita, allowance were withdrawn, the Tasmanian Government would have to raise an equivalent in other directions. Bitter experience has shown me that the Legislative Council of Tasmania always leans to the side of the wealthier classes. I have not; the slightest doubt that the Tasing to conjecture what the resultant'finanmanian Government, in order to make up the loss of the per capita grant, would increase taxation on the necessaries of life, and thus place the burden on the shoulders of those least able to bear it. That has been the way of the Tasmanian Government ever since the State had Government, with the one bright exception of a Labour Ministry for two years and a half.

[Quorum formed.] am pleased that assistance is to be granted to Tasmania. the Commonwealth has power to assist necessitous States, and Tasmania,I think, comes within that category. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) has said that he doubts very much whether this assistance should continue; so there is just a chance that this may be the last grant to the State. I do not quite know what Tasmania Grant [REPRESENTATIVES.] BUI. the position of Tasmania will be if the new proposed financial arrangements are accepted.

He then stated that, as the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth had to come up for review, he could only say that the present arrangement with Tasmania could not continue indefinitely. I do not think we should be put into the position of having to continue it indefinitely; but so long as the State is in need we are bound to come to its assistance. What the Prime Minister means by "" indefinitely "" I do not know, but I shall be pleased to support any proposal to aid Tasmania if aid be required. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) and others are advocating the creation of new States, and it is interestcial relations would be if their ideas were carried into effect. would not want any financial assistance! that; I have often heard similar statements. When the new States, if they com,© into being, are allotted their fair share of the public debt incurred by the States from which they are carved, and all the paraphernalia of sovereign States is adopted, it is quite possible that financial assistance may be required by them, and that the Commonwealth will be placed in a most difficult position. I do not wish to Be misunderstood. I am not opposed to the establishment of local government in restricted areas, but to set up sovereign States all over Australia is very likely to lead to difficulties much greater than those we are experiencing in the case of Tasmania. It will be seen that care and caution are required when dealing with Under the Constitution, proposals of the kind. My own opinion is that there ought to be one Parliament only, and that State bodies, such as provincial councils, shire councils, or municipal councils, should be endowed with sufficient power to deal with all matters of local concern, leaving the larger interests to the -Commonwealth.

When the subject of the Tasmanian grant was discussed' previously, the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman) had some observations to make. He then objected to the grant, but to-day he supports it . The honourable gentleman then said that the application for the grant afforded an argument against the creation of more "" t in p o t "" States, and that ,the practice seemed to be to spend, and keep on spending. He added that taxation was up to breaking point, and members should not be "" b l u f f e d into making the grant merely because a certain number of votes are at stake."" Since that time the honourable gentleman appears to have undergone a conversion, though I do not know who in the Cabinet possessed the influence to bring it about. Trade and Customs realizes now that the grant is a right, and not a charitable g if t . so publicly. conversion was due to representations by the honourable member and his friends. The' Tasmanian representatives looked after the interests of their State very well, and I support them, because I think that the claim to this grant is genuine. proposal that is fair and reasonable, ana J think the proposed grant is necessary. I know of many of the disabilities that Tasmania labours under, especially its isolation. Nature has endowed the State with good land, a healthy climate, and fine water-ways, but it has the disadvantage of being unable to have railway communication with the mainland. Mr O'KEEFE why there should be a regular service by Commonwealth steamers. were made by which the Tasmanian producers could market their products, possibly the financial position of the State would be so improved that it would not require to ask for this annual dole from the Commonwealth. That is a matter that should be considered by the Government. idle ships, including those captured from"" the Germans, which have cold storage in stallations, and they should be employed in carrying the primary products of Tasmania and other States to markets overseas. Tasmanian members should urge that policy upon the Ministry. I am sure' that the people of Tasmania would not ask for a grant from the Commonwealth if they could do without it . The island State cannot be properly developed unless provision is made for. the producers to get their f r u it and other perishable products to market. I remember the former member for Franklin( Mr. McWilliams) telling the House of the great losses suffered by Tasmanian producers, owing to the fact that steamers with refrigerated space were not calling at the island to l if t their f r u it and vegetables. If some reasonable provision could be made to meet the circumstances of Tasmaniai n this regard, there would be no need for the State to come to the Commonwealth for assistance. There is no reason why, if its disabilities were removed, it should notbecome prosperous. I recommend honourable memMinister for bers representing Tasmania to endeavour to induce the Government to make some of the steamers of the Commonwealth Line available to assist their people. TheI thought that perhaps his Prime Minister has said that this is the last grant that Tasmania may expect from the Commonwealth. have earlier next year. I . am ready to support any representatives w ill require to do so. It is in the power' of the Prime Minister to provide shipping services for the island State, which will mean to its people, not merely £85,000, but, perhaps,£1,000,000, and will provide more employment, and make the State generally prosperous. I support the B ill . When this grant by the Commonwealth That is the reason was first sought, we were told that it would be required for only the one year, but ever since Tasmania has been coming If arrangements cap in hand for financial assistance from the Commonwealth.

I am sorry to have kept the House waiting for a moment or two, because evidently every moment is precious at the present time. for the reduction of postal rates. Such a reduction is, I think, necessary. Practically every section of the community has been asking for it . The request has not been confined only to people living in city areas; it has also been made by the residents of country areas 'Many deputations have waited upon me to ask that the existing rates should be somewhat reduced. It is necessary that this Bill should be passed if effect is to be given to the financial proposals set out in the Budget. Practically every country has reduced its postal rates from those existing during war time, to something like the rates which existed in pre-war days. Australia is practically the last country to come into line in this regard. For quite a long time we have been receiving mails fromabroad with-a rate of l ^ d . per half ounce, whilst we have been charging external rates of 2d. per half ounce. An extraordinary anomaly is created by the rates for inland postage by an Act of this Parliament, and the whole of the rates for postage abroad by regulation. In the case of telephones, the rates are fixed by regulation, whilst the rates for telegrams are fixed by an Act of this Parliament. That has been the practice followed in this country for many years, and it is proposed to let it remain in operation for a little longer. We estimate that the loss of revenue that will be occasioned by the reduction of the postage rate from 2d. per half ounce to l j d . per ounce, will be somewhere, in the vicinity of £930,000. We have made big profits in the Post Office during the last few years. I have no doubt that some honourable members representing country districts will be inclined to say that profits made by the Post Office should be utilized for the extension of the services of the Department. If that practice had been followed, we could not expend the amount it is proposed to spend at the present time on the extension of these facilities. Up to 1912, practically no commercial records of the business of the Post Office were kept. From that time onwards records have been kept. A charge of 3-J per cent, as interest on assets has been made against the Post Office, and I find that from 1912 to 1917 the operations of the Department showed a loss of The Bill is to provide £2,031,417., From 1917-18 up to the present year we have had profits amounting to £4,084,830. If the extension of the services of the Department, had been determined by the profit made by the Post Office, we should have had only some £2,000,000 to spend over that long period.

The internal postage rates proposed will be found set out in the schedule to the B ill . It is only fair to state what is proposed in regard to rate's not governed by this legislation, but fixed by regulation. The letter rate for New Zealand and other parts of tha British Empire w i ll be l £ d . per 1 oz., instead of 2d. per | oz. On letters for foreign countries, the present rate is 4d. for the first 1 oz., and 2d. for each additional 1 oz. It is proposed to reduce -3d. L£d. for each additional 1 oz. On lettercards, the present internal postage rate is 2d. each, and it is proposed'to reduce it to l ^ d . It is proposed, also, to reduce the letter-card rate from 2d. each to l | d . each for the British Empire and for foreign countries. This will make the letter-card rate a universal rate. The present rate on printed papers, as prescribed, is I d . per 2 ozs. or part of 2 ozs. We are in this B ill proposing a rate of I d . for 4 ozs. The same rate w ill apply to New Zealand and the British Empire. The rates on books printed outside and inside Australia are set out in the schedule to the B ill . In 1914 our letter postage rate was I d . ; in 1918 the rate was l i d . , and in 1920 it was in creased to 2d. per £ oz. It was necessary in 1920 to raise money for special purposes, and this was one of the means by which money could easily be raised. The increase in the rate provided £720,000 per year additional revenue. think that any man would propose to continue that levy in the existing condition of affairs. papers is quite another matter. It is not proposed to reduce the rate on bulk postages of newspapers. depend on the kind of newspaper ? Is there not a condition that the paper shall contain a certain amount of news? I do not expect the' registered newspaper. It is proposed to allow the rate on bulk newspapers to remain as it is-J4d . per 20 ozs. There is no country in the world that imposes such a low postage rate on newspapers as Australia. What happens as a result of our liberal rate is that news-agents get through the post-office half-a-ton or more of newspapers, posted in bulk at the rate of l ^ d per 20 ozs. As a matter of fact, many of these papers are addressed to individual ' subscribers. The actual postage on them is a fraction over i d . per paper. It is unreasonable for the press to ask for a lower postage than that obtaining at present. Country newspapers have not the weight of the city papers, and more of them can be sent at the 20-ozs. rate. The postage rate in the country districts is thus less than, Jd. per newspaper. The terms of the B ill are very liberal. We have to remember that the Railway Department that rate to make no special concessions for the carfor the first 1 .oz., and riage of newspapers.

Honourable members w ill recognise that the press are in a good position. The rate for 20 ozs. is $d. higher than it was in 1914. The rate for letters is | d . higher than it was in 1914.

The Leader of the Opposition must recognise that it would require more than a casual knowledge of postal rates to warrant any alteraping Bill He must be consistent. He tion of the Bill. The Minister( Mr Gibson) has pointed out that a loss of £937,000 will be occasioned by the passage of this Bill. He considered that it was unwise for the Postal Department to make big profits, but that a profit of £1,250,000 had been made last year. on the postal service they had expended £2,000,000 last year, and intended to expend £4,000,000 this year, and £3,000,000 next year. With that I am in hearty accord. Every honourable member wants to see better telegraphic and telephonic facilities. The point is whether this is the proper way to deal with this Department. It is admitted that its profits have been paid into revenue. I take it that the. revenue this year will be about £1,250,000. £1,500,000. £4,000,000, and to charge the interest against the Post Office. I want to know why the £1,500,000 profit could not be utilized by reducing the £4,000,000 of borrowed money to £2,500,000. This would conform with the Government's intention to run everything on business lines. because there have been losses in the past, the profits should not be used for.postal purposes. What did the Government decide to do when they passed the Shipping Bill? They decided to place the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers under a Board of Control as a separate business. The capital was written down to place the venture on a proper footing. But, with the Post Office, the excess profits are placed into revenue, and at the same time money is borrowed and charged against this Department. This is retarding the progress of the Department. If the money earned by it were utilized to extend the postal facilities, then less money would be borrowed, and a less amount charged against the Department. The Department would be run as a business proposition, and cheaper postal rates would possibly follow. £1,000,000 will be taken up by concessions. member the other day voted for the Shipcannot advocate that the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers should be placed on a business footing while objecting to the same principle being applied to the Postal Department. and the other was practically losing that amount.

This can be considerably reduced by utilizing the revenue The Minister contends . that, for departmental purposes. The Minister stated that he hoped no amendment would be made in Committee.

Not only the defective carriage of mails, but the small receiving and non-official post-offices and small telephone exchanges urgently require attention. As an illustration I may cite a telephone exchange in my electorate, where there are 1,700 effective calls in the year. In addition, the lady in charge sends large numbers of telegrams over the telephone to the nearest telegraph office; and for all this work she is paid the splendid salary of £4 5s. per annum! arbitration award. the award was altered; in any case, I suppose it was an award by the Public Service Arbitrator. charge has to provide the room in which the exchange is installed, and the Department, in order, I suppose, to cut down expenditure, so as to be able to reduce the postage rates to the large business interests, has informed her that she must operate the telephone for only three hours per day. This she endeavours to do, but, after allowing for Sundays and holidays, it means that the exchange is worked for 900 hours in .the twelve months. Then, the restrictions put on this and other country exchanges constitute a great hardship and danger to the residents. farmer was away from home, and his house in charge of his wife and two children, three haystacks near the homestead caught fire. If the lady in charge of the exchange had strictly followed the instructions of the Department, and only operated it for three hours in the day, there would have been most serious consequences. The haystacks weie destroyed, but because of the prompt aid summoned by telephone, the homestead was saved. The operator, ignoring the departmental instructions, called up sevural farmers in time to prevent, greater damage. In that district at the present time, pneumonic influenza, mumps, and bronchitis are prevalent, and the telephone is operating day and night calling for doctors and nurses. Yet the-Department continues to pay this lady £4 5s. per annum! This is a shame and a scandal, which should not be tolerated by this House for five minutes. operator's only source of income. Had she had no other, she would not have had the offer to take charge. tale before. The honourable gentleman told us in the past that many of these anomalies were to be righted. Does the Government accept as a principle the necessity of linking up outlying districts in the back country with a telephone system, so as to make the lot of country people not only more pleasant, but safer? Happily, this, operator, in spite of her small salary, works many more than the official hours, and all for the sake of humanity. Very often half-a-dozen people wish to ring up at the same time, and the three hours soon slip by; but, like the ""guillotine"" of the Government in this The person in Chamber, the departmental order prevents the use of the telephone, even if some one be dying. so. arrangement as in other post-offices? office, but a telephone exchange.

In places like the Northern Territory and north Western Australia, families who am andeavouring to develop the empty spaces are struggling for a living. Some of them receive a mail only once in two months, and they have recently been deprived of the opportunity of using the lettergram for business purposes.

If he does that, a good deal of hardship will be averted, and considerable assistance will be given to the people who are pioneering under very bad conditions. I consider that the people of the "" o u t back"" should receive as much consideration, or, even more, than their confreres of the south. Government proposals represent a remission of about £1,000,000 of taxation. While the Government is pirepared to surrender that amount of revenue, postal facilities from one. end of the Commonwealth to the other are being starved, the conditions 'of the employees in the Department are shocking, and some of the buildings in which postal work is conducted are disgraceful. It is a remarkable fact that in many suburbs and country towns the most dilapidated and outof-date building is the local post and telegraph office. Some of them would be condemned by the local health authorities, if they had the power to do it , because of their insanitary condition. It ' is disgraceful that the Postmaster-General should propose to give away £1,000,000 of revenue, while his Department everywhere shows evidence of such shocking neglect. The parsimony of the Department is illustrated by its treatment of junior officers. They are paid a salary of £106 per annum, equivaI shall get to my point lent to £ 2 0s. 2£d. per week.

Out of his salary of £ 2 Os. 2$d. per week he was compelled to pay 35s. per week for board and lodging. He held' a fairl y responsible position under the Government, and hundreds of pounds of public money passed through his hands .every month. He had a balance of 5s. 2Jd. with which to clothe himself, pay his laundry bill, and meet the hundred-andone little expenses that a young man has to incur. When he complained and a'sked for an allowance to meet his increased expenses, the Department wrote to all the hotels and boarding establishments in the district to inquire whether cheaper board could be obtained. It is remarkable that a. vast Government Department, which can throw away .£1,000,000 per annum, should write dozens of letters and use a large number of "" O.S."" stamps in seeking to get cheaper quotations for the board of a junior officer. Probably the Postmaster-General w ill reply that the salary was fixed by the Public Service Arbitrator. only a creature of the Government, and is doing the work of the anti-Labour forces in this country. He is in receipt of a large salary, but when this junior officer's case came before him he delivered a lecture on the danger of young men who are living away from home having too much money to spend. He said that ,an excess of spending money would not be good for the young fellow. If in creased payments were made to him he might waste the money on cards and horses. It is about time that sort of parsimony ceased. I w ill not support the remission of one farthing of the taxation to the wealthy people u n t i l the Dewill give me permission, to get a gang of partment pays a fair and decent living wage to its employees.

Great necessity exists for building new offices. I . do not wish to say much about my own electorate. The people in it are well able to take care of themselves, as shown by their wisdom in returning me to this Parliament; but I must mention the case of the post-office at Balmain East. I have endeavoured for some time to get the Department to put a decent building there. The Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson) told me two or three weeks ago that his chief inspector was about to visit Sydney. He asked me whether I had any matter I would like inquired into.

The Chief Inspector visited the place, but. because of tbe fumes and the insanitary state of the building, he got out of it as quickly as possible. Unofficially be expressed surprise that people should be asked to work under such conditions. The walls of the building were damp and dirty, and the appearance of the place was filthy .

An independent inquiry should be heid by an impartial person. Everything is smothered up from the knowledge of the Deputy, and it is made to appear to him that the work of the mail room is being satisfactorily managed. I might mention that, besides the staff being called upon to work excess time, as previously stated, all recreation leave has been stopped, and even thus they cannot cope with the congestion. Besides being understaffed, the mail room has now beoome too small for the work performed in it. The frames, furniture, and facilities are quite out of date, making it impossible for the officers to do their work efficiently and expeditiously. Methods forty years old are still in vogue. When the officers ask for the necessary materials for carrying out their work, they are referred from one head to another, each one evading his responsibility, and if any mistake is made, or things go wrong, the men are made the scapegoats, and they have no means of getting juBtice. Owing to the insufficiency of the. staff, mails often miss, the whole central mail, including Rockhampton, which happened quite recently, as also did a northern mail, including Townsville. Other mails too numerous to mention have also missed. It is only by the good graces of the railway officials that mails do not miss more frequently, because, owing to the reasons quoted above, mails are despatched from the General Post Office with barely time to catch the train. The railway officials will be able to substantiate this statement.. There is such chaos in the office through congestion that small mail bags containing' registered articles are often missed for days and weeks, and turn up in some corner of the office, having been buried amongst catalogues and other classes of mail matter which have been unconsciously placed upon them. Such an instance occurred on the 6th July,, 1923, when the mail from Cooroy, containing registered mail, was missing for over a week, and turned up after lying under some ^second class mail matter all that time. Of course, the men were made the real 'scapegoats. American mails arriving in Brisbane on 15th June remained in the office unsorted until Sunday, 1st July, and were despatched to country offices on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th July, or nearly three weeks after the Postarrival of the mail in Brisbane.

I am afraid I cannot hear the honourable member any longer on that line; he must stick to the Bill,, or desist. if the postal rate were allowed to remain at 2d., the Department, with the revenue received, would be able to provide the additional postal and telephone facilities that are so necessary. The Postmaster General cannot justify this proposed reduction. I oppose it because it is sought at a time when people have not efficient services, especially in the country districts, and even in the cities. I have instanced Brisbane, where, at the General Post Office, there is inadequate accommodation, and an insufficient staff to cope with the volume of work. As one who represents a country electorate containing approximately 74,000 square miles, where the people have asked for telephone services timated that I cannot hear argument, any further on that question. The honourable member must apply himself relevantly to the Bill. master-General, even at this stage, to refrain from reducing the postal rates. I shall use all the influence I may have in the House, by my vote or in any other way, to prevent a reduction, with a view to improving the existing services, and more generously treating the employees. This Bill is in the interests of the great commercial houses of Flinders-lane, which really control this Government, to the detriment of the people of Australia. rather astonished to hear honourable members opposite talk of £1,000,000 as the revenue that will be lost by this proposed reduction in the postage rates. As a matter of fact, the actual amount will be £530,000, taking last year's total as the basis. that the amount is £930,000. not say that.

While there are very many business men who send out hundreds of letters every day, there are probably 2,500,000 people who, on an average, post no more than one letter per week. Some of the big business, firms will receive a big concession, but that made to the ordinary family is large also. I remind honourable members that, although there has been a profit during the last five years of £4,080,000, much of which was raised to meet war expenditure, the loss in the previous five years amounted to £2,000;000. It will be seen that over the last ten years a profit of only £200,000 a year has been made by the Department. The charge that the Government are doing nothing for the outback people will not bear investigation for a moment. Last year £2,000,000 was expended, and expenditure of £4,000,000 is proposed this year, and something like £3,000,000 for next year, much of which is for out-back extensions. There are two other matters to which I would like to call attention. I suggest that in the matter of postage, friendly societies are entitled to special consideration, and I trust that the regulations will son) to make provision in this respect, if it is not already made in the Bill. I know that it is not proposed to make any reduction in the bulk rates, but I was hoping that the Postmaster-General would have given some slight concession.

It is on behalf of the latter that I make this plea. I am in favour of cheap postage always. I agree with that writer who said that the civilization of a country may be judged by the number of letters written and newspapers published. time when the Government of Queensland used to deliver newspapers throughout the length and breadth of the State, and even to the Home Land, free of charge. In regard to an interjection I made earlier in the evening, I wish to make it clear that the postage of the Solomon Islands was not increased during the period of the war. General will agree with me that the postage rates in those islands are cheaper than those in Australia. to newspapers. Islands never charged more than Id. for letters, whether sent to Australia or the United Kingdom. In Australia it costs 2d. to send a letter across the street, and the Postmaster-General that he does not that is why so many agencies save money by the hand delivery.of letters and circulars. I have often wondered why the Postmaster-General did not. make a regulation preventing such deliveries, because they represent a big loss to the revenues of the Postal Department. If the Minister proposed to reduce the postage upon letters to Id., I would support him, not for the sake of big commercial enterprises, which I have fought at times as bitterly as has any member of the House, especially when they supported the National Association, which the Age exposed, but because I believe that the lower the postage rates the better for the community. I recently spent six weeks in Western Australia, and I heard there great complaint against the excessive postal charges. I post regularly to one farmer in that State a valuable American magazine. He posts it to another readers of farmer, who in turn sends it to a third farmer. The postage on that journal from America to Australia is 3 cents, but it costs me 4d. to send it to Western Australia, and it costs the receiver 4d. to send it to the second farmer, and the second farmer 4d. to send it to the third. Thus Is. is paid in postage for the circulation amongst four people of an educational paper of great value.

I have been informed by the Postmaster-General that Australia is the only large nation whose Parliament settles the postage rates. I hope that as long as the honourable gentleman remains in office he will help me in preventing the fixation of these rates being intrusted to departmental officers. I have respect and Therefore, the Postmasterfriendly regard for many men in the Postal Department, but I hope that Parliament will never surrender the right of fixing these charges. No departmental officer has the same opportunity as has a member of Parliament to meet the people and learn their views.

Money would be saved in so f a r as accommodation would be provided for many of the Commonwealth Departments that are now scattered about Melbourno, for the office accommodation of which the Commonwealth is paying unnecessarily something like £30,000 per annum. I endorse the complaint that has beeif made regarding the pittance paid to those in charge of allowance post-offices. No clerk or teller in a bank has as many and diverse duties to perform as 'has the ordinary postmaster or postmistress. Often while waiting to send a telegram I have watched these officers at work. An old age pensioner would come in , and the postmistress would have to do the duty of a teller, making the payment and entering it in the books. Then she would pay out repatriation money and invalid pensions, sell a 2d. stamp, and receive a telegram. Perhaps the next person to enter the office would ask the postmistress to witness his signature to an application for a vote for the Federal or State Parliaments. I think the Postmaster-General w ill agree with me that, most postmasters and postmistresses are underpaid for the splendid work they are doing. It is a matter of wonder to me that.they avoid making mistakes. A person writin g to me from Tasmania put the case in a nutshellNow, it is the shameful 'allowance that is paid to these officers. They are paid, such as it is, on the scale rate, and a mighty obsolete scale it is. It is an absolute disgrace to any Government to pay such paltry salaries to their officer's, the way they do.

During the time when the States controlled postal matters I endeavoured to get the payments increased, but the Postmasters-General of those days were very hard-hearted. They may have had some excuse in the fact that they had a constantly recurring deficit, but the postal accounts were not kept so accurately then as they have been during the last ten years. During the first five years of the last decade, the operations of the Postal Department showed a loss of about £2,000,000, but during the latter half of the decade a profit of about £4,000,000 has been made.

398,Dr. Maloney,"I understand that I have previously said so much about the maladministration of the Postal Department that the Government, if it had any decency, would have resigned. I desire to say a few words about the Sydney General Post Office, and I should like to remind representatives of country districts that even in the metropolitan areas postal conditions are far from being ideal. made to obtain a new site for the postThe Sydney General Post Office is the most congested in the world, and it.« income is the greatest in Australia. About fifteen years ago the Department made a promise to build a General Post Office suitable for the city of Sydney. Sydney Chamber of Commerce held its annual meeting, and if the Postmaster General, had heard the remarks made at that meeting about the Sydney General Post Office, he would catch the next train to Sydney to try and improve matters. The Sydney General Post Office has been neglected for many years. It was built in 1874, and extended in 1876, but since then ho increased accommodation has been provided in it . Honourable members should realize that Sydney has a population of over a million, which is more than the total population of Queensland and Tasmania. Twelve years ago I endeavoured to get the Postmaster-Generail to make better provision for the girls working in the Telephone Department. I went so far as to offer to spend £300 myself to ventilate the building in which they were working. Nothing has been done. I call the attention of the Postmaster-General to the post-office in William-street, Sydney. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Lambert), who has been Lord Mayor of Sydney, will corroborate my remarks in this connection. The Sydney City Council has spent £1,500,000 to widen William-street for half-a-mile, and its work cannot be completed because we are told that the William-street post-office cannot be removed for two years. Herald, the Daily Telegraph, and other Sydney newspapers have pointed out how the work of widening this thoroughfare has been obstructed because of the post office. A t the last Federal elections the then Lord Mayor of Sydney, a Liberal, who tried to win my safe seat from me, did all he could to blame me for the situation created by the 'refusal to remember intend tb connect his remarks move the William-street post-office. Fortunately for me, I had kept my correspondence with the Department on the matter. Notwithstanding that, I had a hard job to convince the people that I had done what I could to get the post-office removed. It is five and a-half years since I got the first letter from the Postmaster-General's Department on this matter. I was told that provision had been office. I went to the office of the Works Department in Sydney, and saw plans and specifications which had been drawn out for the erection of a new building. I waited for two years, which I thought gave the Department a fair time to act. Last week the Nothing had been done in that time so far as I could see. When I went back to the Department I learned that the plans which had been drawn had been rejected as unsuitable, and new proposals had been made. shifting only the post-office. The telephone exchange, with 5,000 subscribers, must also be removed. That will cost £200,000. We will do it as soon as we can. drew up the first set of plans knew that the telephone exchange would have to be altered. The Department should have had the decency to tell me what' had been done. I knew nothing about it until I communicated with the present P ostmaster-General. everything we propose to do. predecessors did not do so. It is not very much to ask that the' Department shall advise people when it intends to make alterations. Twelve years ago the introduction of the automatic telephone service in Sydney was proposed, and one of the biggest firms in the city spent £960 in preparation for the installation The Sydney Morning of that system. They have not got it to-day.

Before the Government reduce the postal charges it should provide a sufficient service for the people. I challenge the Postmaster General to name anybody who haa requested this reduction. I advise the Postmaster-General to take early steps to remedy the condition of affairs which exists at the General Post Office and the William-street post-office, Sydney. Sydney General Post Office is a building of which any city may be proud, but on its balconies are a lot of wooden hutches which serve as telephone boxes. They have been put on the balconies because there is no room for them in the building. As they are made of nine timber, which anybody with wicked and vicious intentions could easily.set on fire, they are a menace to the building. pointed out that people in the country have complaints about the postal administration. I assure the honourable members who made those complaints, that the people in the city have as much to put up with on account of postal maladministration as have the people in the country. It should be remembered that any surpluses which the Postmaster-General, has are provided by the city people. The country postal services do not pay, because the mails have to be carried great distances, and the telephone and telegraph lines have to be run out for many miles. In the cities the revenue is so great that the Department shows a profit. I wish to refer briefly fo the conThe Post Office would not necessarily be ditions which prevailed for a long time at the Oxford-street post-office in Sydney. I had a hard job to get any alteration made there, although the revenue was £180,000 a year. Whenever the Public Service Commissioner was asked to send additional assistance to that office, care Was taken not to send a person with big feet, because the accommodation in the office was so limited that no room could be found for such a man. I had a great struggle to get that condition of affairs altered. As the representative of Sydney, I suffer much abuse on account of the inadequate accommodation at the General Post Office, and the inaction of the Postal Department with respect to the William-street post-office I may say that I get "" particular hell "" because of these things. Even when I get in the trams in Sydney, passengers turn to me and say, '' Look here, West, why don't you get that damned old post-office shifted from the middle of Williamstreet 1 "" I ask the Postmaster-General to take compassion on me. In its present position, the William-street post office is dangerous. There is a great deal of traffic in that street. I think three persons were killed in it in one week by motorists. Honourable members can therefore understand the indignation of the The people. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) knows that what I have said about the William-street post-office is true. I am satisfied to have brought the matter under notice, because I did' not wish to provide any persons with a lever to turn me out of Parliament. It has* been I wish to repeat what I have said before, and that is that I am against the proposed reduction in postal rates. If I were not, I consider that I would have no right to refer to postal grievances. I am in a position, to link up postal grievances with the reduction in revenue contemplated from the proposed reduction of rates. It is reasonable to suppose that with a reduced revenue employees of the Post and Telegraph Department are likely to receive less generous treatment than they could otherwise look forward to. I admit that profits made by the Post Office go into the Consolidated Revenue, and that money required for works must be drawn from the Consolidated Revenue. required to balance its accounts, but if it did not show a profit, I think the Treasurer would not be very willing to advance large sums to extend its services. In the circumstances, I view with a certain amount of alarm the reduction of postal rates proposed by this Bill. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) made, for an old member of this Chamber; the astonishing statement that the contemplated reduction of £930,000 in revenue will cover, not only losses of postal revenue, but also losses of revenue on telephones and other facilities provided by the Department. It the honourable member would read the Treasurer's",70,Forde I F I Disclosed The

This means that for the vast majority of the people of the Commonwealth the reduced rate will represent a saving of only £216,000, and consequently the proposed reduction really represents a gift of over £700,000 to ""big business"" in Australia. No matter how much we may desire cheap postal communication, such a proposal in the interests of "" big business"" is not likely to receive-the support of Democrats in this Chamber. Let me pay some tribute of praise to my ex-fellow-officers of the Post and Telegraph Department, in which I served for seventeen years. say that, considering the magnitude of its undertaking, the Post and Telegraph Department is a pretty well-managed concern. ThoughI say this, I believe it to be my duty, if I know of matters which can be remedied, to bring them before this Chamber. Department are required to pass medical and other examinations, which prove that they are above the average in general health and in scholastic attainments. That being so, I believe it to be our duty to treat them in such a way as to offer some incentive to young men to join the Service and keep up its present high standard, and at the same time to give 'those already in the Service some encouragement to carry on. When we consider that the services of this Department extends throughout the Commonwealth, and to very remote places,' which district inspectors can visit only at long intervals, whom I wish to refer. If the Minister the fact that there is so small a number of defalcations occurring is a proof that we have in the Service a very fine class of men, of whom we may well be proud. To refer to some matters which I think require to be looked into, I may mention, first, the promotion of a certain class of telegraph messengers. present difficulty has arisen out of the war. Messengers who entered the Service in 1912, say, at the age of fourteen, thought they had an assured prospect of early promotion if they showed the necessary ability. Mr A. Green. ever, is that, due to war causes, at whatever of advancement. A number of these messengers are now twenty-five rates. There are probably years of age, and because of the provision made for preference to other persons for ' positions in the Clerical DiviOn the reduced letter rate sion, these young men are debarred for ever from qualifying for promotion to that division. I am prepared to do all that is possible for the returned soldiers, but I do not consider it is right that the future of these young men should be ruined because they entered the Service in 1912 and were too young to enlist and go to the Front when war was declared. They represent a comparatively small number, but they are suffering a grave injustice in that they have no pos-, sible chance of promotion. I believe that examinations within the Service should be held, and if these young men I can qualify they should be given the first opportunity of transferring to the Clerical Division, and before the appointment of other persons from outside the Service. I want to refer to the senior assistants and senior positions generally, particularly in Western Australia, a State The employees of the which I know most about). ( Mr Watkins) I am afraid the honourable member will not be in order in doing so. nect my remarks with the Bill. The contemplated reduction of postal revenue by £930,000 per annum, due to the proposed reduction of rates, will in all probability mean that skimping methods will be pursued in the Department. It will be impossible for the Postmaster-General in that case to deal justly with the officers to will agree to withdraw this provision from the Bill, I shall be able to show him how, with the additional revenue, he may remedy certain grave injustices. Very few officers of the Postal Department in Western Australia have a higher designation than that of "" assistant,"" 'which Their really means that a man must be a jackof-all-trades, and opportunities for promotion above that grade are limited. Because of this contemplated reduction in postal charges, and the probable reduction in revenue, the PostmasterThe fact, howGeneral will not be able to go to the Treasurer, and, pointing to an overflow-",71,Forde I F I Disclosed The

408,Mr A. Green,"I think I can coning Treasury, make a request for additional funds to improve the prospects of these postal assistants, among whom are included officers in the telegraph, telephone, and the engineering branches, telegraph check clerks, and despatch clerks. Just as in Napoleon's armies every private felt that he carried a marshal's baton in his knapsack, so should every employee in the Postal Department feel that the way is open to him to rise to the highest position in the Service. The question of superannuation is also affected by the Government proposals. No doubt, the Postmaster-General has heard of this complaint before, but I may be pardoned if I repeat it . Every unmarried employee in the Public Service has to contribute to the Superannuation Fund at the same rate as a married man, but his relatives receive no benefits in the event of his death. This anomaly ought to be rectified. The dependants of unmarried men should receive the same benefits as the dependants of married men. petrated, and in this case upon defenceless women. Hitherto, when a gir l on the eve of her marriage retired from the Department, she was entitled to an allowance. This concession has now been withdrawn. As honourable members are awart, the girls employed in the Public Service have to dress in keeping with their position. This involves considerable expenditure, and as a consequence a girl has very little opportunity of saving against the time when she is going to be married, ""When the parliamentary allowance was £600 a year, and there was a proposal to increase it to £1,000, no doubt many honourable members made this mental calculation"" When I get £1,000 a year, I shall probably be able to .live on £600, and save £ 4 0 0 . "" We all know, of course, that nothing of the sort happens. but still it is a fact that, with our in creased parliamentary allowance, there has been a corresponding increase in expenditure. The women employees of the Postal Department and other branches of the Public Service are in the same position, and it is to be regretted that the retiring allowance has been withdrawn in the terms of a memorandum issued from the Public Service Commissioner's Office on 5Jfch July, on' the' ground that there was ho provision-for it in the Act. T am quite sure that honourable members did not realize when the B ill was being passed that the regulation referred to, and framed in accordance with the Act , would be withdrawn, thus working a grave injustice upon women employees in the Public Service. The Postmaster General assures me that he is not a member of the Public Service Board. I am sure that I have only to mention this injustice to insure the reinstatement of the privilege hitherto enjoyed. The district allowance at Geraldton has been discontinued. If there had been a reduction in the cost of living commen; surate w i th the proposed reduction in the postal rates, I could understand it ; but there has been nothing of the kind. According to Knibbs' Quarterly Statement, the issue of which, unfortunately, was discontinued in 1922, out of thirteen places mentioned in Western Australia, Geraldton was the t h i r d highest on the list relating to "" cost of living "" figures. Still another injustice is being perI n those circumstances, there is no justi< fication for the alteration. Another grievance is the reduction of the travelling allowance. I know the Postmaster General is not a party to it . The responsibility rests upon those who insist on the postal reductions. B y sweating the employees, they lessen the loss to the Department. In Western Australia, and presumably throughout Australia, the travelling allowance for linesmen, as from the 19th July of this year, was reduced from 14s. 6d. to 13s. per day. This is, no doubt, in accord w i th the cheeseparing policy of the Government, and it is most unjust to the servants of the Department. I hope the Postmaster-General w ill seriously consider the various matters I have placed before him. New regulations concerning sick leave have been issued, and this complaint It may be very reprehensible, has since been forwarded to meThe Public Service Board, in the new regulations recently promulgated, has made 'very inadequate concessions for sick leave in the case of returned soldiers, inasmuch as the regulations contain absolutely no concessions for permanent war-caused injuries, but only for injuries that are of a temporary nature of not more than three years' duration after discharge from the Australian Imperial Force. This is most unfair to those returned soldiers at present in the Service, whose injuries are of a permanent nature. . To illustrate thiB, I would particularly point out the:case of soldiers who have lost a limb and those who have 'been badly gassed and are now suffering from permanent chest or lung trouble complaints such as T.B., &c. In the case of the amputee, changes of the weather sometimes cause acute nervous troubles and pains in the stump, rendering him unfit to perform his duties, also the amputee requires time off periodically for the purpose of repairs to his old artificial limb or the fitting of a new one. Tn the case of gas patients, changes in the weather, particularly during excessive heat, cause acute aggravation of the complaint from which he may be suffering as a result of having been gassed. In view of this aspect of the case, the Board should be asked to rectify this gross injustice to returned soldiers by making adequate provision for permanent war-caused injuries, as the new regulations have evidently been compiled-to suit the case of fit men whose injuries are only of a temporary nature. To overcome this, I would suggest that in addition to the one week per year for each years' service provided, there should be added, in the case of returned soldiers, a clause providing that:In the case of returned soldiers, they shall cerned for the interests of the postal be allowed any sick leave that may be necessary on account of permanent waicaused injuries, provided that same is certified to by a duly qualified medical practitioner, or any medical officer that the Board may specify. I would point out that the Department would be protected from imposition, because the fact that a medical certificate was necessary would render imposition impossible. I have'no sympathy with people who absent themselves from work and thrust their duties upon their fellow workers. During my seventeen years' service I have known some very good servants, and a few wasters. I have a great deal of sympathy with men whose sick-leave is to be reduced. While I recognise that the Department, to justify their proposals, require to make drastic alterations, I trust that they will do nothing to harm the returned soldiers. tract from a letter I have received on that subject:The soldier is appointed on 1st July, 1922, and .ante-dated as before, to 15th May, .1916. As the .regulation stands he would only be entitled at 30th June, 1923, to one week on full pay, two weeks on half pay, and four weeks on third pay. Had that privilege not been withdrawn he would have been entitled to seven weeks on full pay, fourteen weeks on half pay, and twenty-eight weeks on third pay. A large number of returned soldiers have been appointed to the Postal Department, and rightly so. Many of these men, alM.r. A. Green. though able to do postal work, are suffering from permanent injuries, and are affected by climatic conditions. I appeal to the .Minister to issue special regulations to cover returned soldiers who are suffering from war injuries. -The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), acting under a misapprehension, strongly criticised the proposed postal reductions. His conclusions were taken from wrong premises. He assumes that because the Postmaster-General has seen fit to remit a considerable amount of taxation to the benefit of the country, the country interests and the employees of the Postal Department will be neglected. As a member of the Nationalist party I have as much concern for the country interests as has the honourable member, and, as I have previously asserted on the platform, I am just as much conemployees. What is the position? I am satisfied that the Postmaster-General is doing more at the present time to provide postal, and particularly telephonic, facilities in the out-back country than has ever previously been the case. Therefore, I do not share the fears of honourable members opposite. Considerable concessions are to be made for trunk-line telephones in the cities and country towns. Cheaper rentals are charged, and more liberal provision is being made in the erection of country telephones. We are invariably told that taxation is passed on. Therefore, there will now be £1,000,000 that these merchants, to whom honourable members opposite refer so frequently, will be able to remit, and thus we can hope that great benefit will This is an exaccrue. I am in sympathy with honourable members opposite in their desire'to assist employees in the Department. In my electorate there are officers who have rendered valued and efficient service for periods ranging up to twenty years, yet they are not receiving an adequate salary. There are postmasters who are receiving only about £260 per annum. Although it might be contended that the matter of remuneration can more properly be dealt with by the Arbitration Court, I trust that the Postmaster-General will tangibly recognise the great services which have",72,Forde I F I Disclosed The

In New South Wales the Deputy Postmaster General, who occupies a position requiring in the man who holds it the possession of expert knowledge, receives a salary of something like £800 or £900 a year. That is totally inadequate. In America, I feel sure,' positions cf ( similar importance carry a much greater salary, and I contend that that officer should receive at least £1,200 per annum. If the more highly-paid officers were given increases, the inspectors and others holding more lowly positions could have their salaries raised, and the whole service would benefit. -Away over on the Sydney side there is a picturesque and historic spot.

I shall endeavour to be equally successful. I intend to oppose the reductions set out in the Bill. I fail to see how the Postmaster-General can justify them. He cannot say that a man does not receive value for the money he spends when he has a letter carried for the small sum of 2d. It is not fair to propose this curtailment of our sources of revenue. It ia a sop to the commercial community, to the big institutions, and not to the ordinary taxpayer. Some honourable members suggest that it will be returned to the general community in lowered prices. Does any one seriously contend that there will be a reduction in the prices of wearing apparel or of food, and that rents will come the rate of postage, and because those who make use of the postal facilities are allowed to increase by 100 per cent, the weight of matter carried at the reduced rate? We ought not to pass this Bill until the Minister makes quite clear the benefit that, is to be conferred, and to whom it is to go. ""There is neither I rhyme nor reason for the reduction at the present time in the manner proposed. A Near Botany great deal has been said regarding the development of Australia and the settlement of people upon the land. If there is one way in which we can bring the country closer to the city, it is by providing telegraphic and telephonic facilities. A reduction in the letter rate will not assist the people on the land one iota. If the amount which the MinisterI beproposes to forego were expended in providing increased facilities for country people, a great deal more good would be done. The cost of running the Department will be increased as a result of this proposal. It must not be supposed that the commercial community will not take Eut to-day people of ful l advantage of the privileges given them.

A letter-carrier, for instance, will, practically, have to clear about double the amount of matter that he does now. The ordinary taxpayer who writes two or three letters a year, as a rule has not the need to write enough to take advantage of the increase in the weight; and, therefore, all the advantage will go to the large business houses. If there are any surplus funds they should be used for extension purposes, and to make up for a reduction in the telephone rates. Once a telephone is installed, apart from ordinary depreciation, which is negligible, the revenue is, practically, all profit. telephone calls was raised in the cities and suburbs to 2d., but we hear of no reduction in that charge. There is scarcely a constituency in which the people are not crying out for increased facilities. The telephone is, no doubt, of the greatest convenience, not only to the city dwellers, but, in the case of trunk lines, to country residents. It is an unwise move at the present juncture to reduce the postage rates; but if a reduction is made, I remind the Government that, while the public get a quid pro quo in the service rendered, the emoluments of the men in the Department are not what they ought to be. I now call attention to the position of returned soldiers who were appointed on a six months' probation, and after they had had two years' service, were made permanent employees. October, 1922, the Public Service Act was amended so as to provide that returned soldiers who had been employed continuously for a period of not less than two years might be permanently appointed without examination if the chief officer certified that their duties had been performed in a satisfactory character, and that those duties were of a nonclerical character. tained in that provision should be honoured in letter and in spirit. service of these men ranges from two to six years, with an average of four years. They are placed on the lowest grade, and their service dates only from their permanent appointment. They suffer much Mr Yates. injustice in more ways than one; and I hope that a fair deal will be given to them. They are paid the minimum rate of £132 a year, plus the cost of living allowance of £30, and the basic wage allowance of £12, making a total of £174. Prom this, however, is deducted £1 2s. 5d. per fortnight in respect of two and a half units under the Superannuation Act; and this, of course, reduces their wages very much. They desire that'their service shall date back to their employment as temporary employees, when they were two» or three years younger, thus reducing the amount of their subscriptions to the superannuation fund. This is clearly a justice that should be done before any reduction in the postage rates is sanctioned; and I The charge for hope the Postmaster-General will consult the Public Service Board on the matter. This is only another instance of a neglected or half-honoured promise made to returned soldiers. If the Government requires a good Public Service, it must have a satisfied one. I understand that there are some 23,000 returned soldiers thus situated, or who will become so situated as they are made permanent employees, and they ought not to be allowed to suffer what they deem to be a grievance. The only other matter to which I have to refer is connected with a book of poems by an ex-member for Wannon, and a sympathizer with the Labour side, Mr J. K. MacDougall, which has for a long time been held up by the postal authorities. It is said that the matter is in the hands of the Attorney-General; but some On 5th explanation should be made by the Government. It is a work breathing fine sentiment right through. I can suggest a reason why this book is under the ban of the Postal Department, inasmuch, as I have said, the author is a sympathizer with the Labour movement. In my opinion, the ordinary taxpayer never expected or desired a reduction in the postage rates, and the Bill is only to The promise conplacate a certain section of the community, whose interests honourable memTho bers opposite naturally represent. am opposed to this Bill.

The Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson) is not only reducing the letter postage, but is also increasing the weight which may be posted for the minimum charge. When one considers the conditions under which postal employees are working, it is unreasonable to give a sop to a section of the community which does not need assistance. By reducing the postage on letters to l | d . , and. increasing the weight to 1 ounce, we shall benefit the bigbusiness houses chiefly. I have been to considerable trouble to ascertain the bulk of a letter which could be despatched for l£d. under the proposed alteration, and have found that' at least ten sheets of foolscap could be dent. I have not had sufficient time to ascertain the number of sheets that could be sent in a letter weighing half an ounce. The Nationalist section of the composite Ministry has put in this peg for its own supporters, merely because the representatives of the Country party have received certain concessions in connection with sulphur duties. The Postmaster-General, who is now supporting Second Column.

If the Minister could assure honourable members that a reduction to the extent of £700,000 would be made in the price of commodities in consequence of reduced postal rates, I would support the clause. The Postmaster General knows very well that the bulk of the people of this country will not benefit by the proposed reduction in postage. I am sorry to find him and other members of the so-called Country party allied with the representatives of Flinders-lane in serving up this sop to the big business people.

424,Mr Coleman (Reid) [11.14],"Iand admit that in the administration of his Department he has done his best, and has treated members generally with courtesy. But I am at a loss to understand how he can reconcile his Country party principles with a proposal to reduce postal rates, when there are complaints from all over Australia regarding the limited facilities for telephone communication in both country and suburban areas. I would draw his attention to the fact, that in the outer suburbs of Sydney and elsewhere, there has been a substantial increase in population in recent years, and that the residents of those districts have to depend upon allowance post-offices which are not nearly so satisfactory as permanent post-offices, with permanent staffs. In view of the complaints from country districts, and the pronounced dissatisfaction in the outer suburbs of big cities, I support the amendcity electorate which I happen to reprement. I have had occasion to draw the Minister's attention to the need for improved postal facilities in my electorate, and, although he has provided in the Estimates for the partial construction of four very necessary post-offices as a result of my insistent demands, he,has not provided the f u ll amount required for their completion. In view of the fact that the comthe postage that it had in pre-war days, plaints which I voice seem to be general, I think that any reduction in postal charges at the present moment is unjustified. I warn the Minister and his party of the consequences when they next face the people, who sent them here in the belief that they would legislate in the interests of the country. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [11.16] I wish to state three reasons which impel me to support the amendment. I represent a city constituency, where I know that a reduction in postage would probably be a popular move. I support the amendment because I know, in the first place, that many of the postal employees throughout the Commonwealth are not receiving sufficient wages. Many of them could receive an increase, and they would not even then be receiving the basic wage. The second reason is that in the country districts of Australia, with which I was brought into close touch when I represented the whole of my State in another place, the postal facilities are provided. Much has been said to-night about the miserable rates of pay of those persons who are in charge of allowance offices in out-back parts. The third reason is that we members of the Opposition who sup-, ported an increase in the rates of invalid and old-age pensions, were told that the Government could not afford to pay it. We moved an amendment to the Estimates which would have had the effect of increasing old-age pensions. Until the Government increase old-age pensions, until the postal employees of Australia are well paid, and until the allowance pestmasters and postmistresses in remote parts of Australia receive reasonable remuneration for the work they do, I shall not feel justified in, supporting a proposal to reduce the rate of postage on letters from 2d. to l$d., although I know that such an alteration would be popular in the sent. ; master-General) [11.19] -The Government cannot accept the amendment. Australia should keep abreast of the times. As a fact, we are the only country that still has a twopenny rate of postage on letters. Every other country has reverted to or, at least, has come down a step towards it. The proposed rate of l^d. per oz. in Australia compares with l^d. per 2 ozs. in the United Kingdom, l ^ d. per oz. in Canada, Id. per oz. in the United States of America, and l^d. per oz. in New Zealand. We are still 50 per cent, above the pre-war rates of postage, because in those days we had penny postage. Honourable members seem to think that, in order to reduce the rate from 2d. to l^d., we shall have to curtail some of the postal and telephone facilities. That fear is not well grounded. If we were to apply the whole of the profits of the Post Office to tlie extension of those facilities, we could only do so to the extent of £200,000 a year; but, as honourable members know, the postal revenue must under the Constitution. be paid into the Consolidated Revenue of the country. We spent £2,000,000 last year; we shall spend £4,000,000 this year, and we propose to spend £3,000,000 next year on improving the services of the Department.

The Postal Department renders a great service now for 2d. ' It is, in fact, the cheapest service rendered in the community. It is unthinkable that we should remit postal charges amounting to £1,000,000 while we have such a heavy national debt to carry. There is no great clamour for this reduction. I have not been approached by one business man in Sydney to vote for it. I admit that the Postmaster General is doing the best he can in existing circumstances to provide communication facilities for the country, but Imust also admit that up to date I have not obtained many bricks for post-offices. I have had a number of nice letters from him, but they are not bricks and mortar. Under present conditions the Committee should keep to the 2d. postage rate. I am in agreement with that part of the amendment which fixes the rate of is employed in the Defence Department 2d. for an ounce; but as we have talked to-day to do practically nothing. for a considerable time in Australia about getting back to pre-war conditions, I think the time has arrived for us to return to the I d . postage rate for -J-oz. letters.

I consider that there is too great a difference in the weight of letters to justify us fixing a 'TninimTim 2d. rate. The ordinary letter which honourable members receive from their constituents consists of two sheets. People in the country rarely write letters larger than that.

I should like an assurance from the Postmaster General( Mr Gibson) that the journals issued by farmers' organizations, rural associations, or trade unions, can be sent as newspapers at the rates prescribed. A journal I have-in my mind is one that has been existent for forty years, and only a few weeks ago was challenged as a newspaper. up for a considerable time, and it required three members of Parliament to convince some of the postal officials that it was one that ought not to be challenged. The words ""as prescribed"" sometimes prejudicially affect very deserving newspapers, as they may be called, issued by associations. These journals are usually issued for the information of members of an association, The Comorganization, or union, and I do not see why they should not pay the same rates 14 as those enjoyed by the giant daily newspapers.

In reply, I am to inform you that in August, 1921, a Royal Commission (Tbe Royal Commission for Suffering and Damage by Enemy Action) was appointed to consider cases in which there is a mora) claim by British nationals, other than those belonging to parts of the Empire to which a separate share of reparation receipts has been allotted, for compensation for suffering and damage arising out of tbe oats of tbe enemy during tbe war within Annex1 to PartV in . of the Treaty of Versailles, and to moke recommendations as to the distribution of a sum of not more than £6,000,000 out of tbe first receipt on account of reparation allotted to the Exchequer of the United Kingdom in ex gratia payments to such persons. This Royal Cororaissaioo in due course, when they were of the opinion that ample time bad been given for lodging or proper and bond fide claims announced by advertisement in the papers that their lists would be closed on tbe 15th February, 1928, and at the end of the year a further advertisement was published, fixing a closing date for cases of whioh tbey had been notified to some Department or other in sufficient time, bad not been supplied with tbe necessary particulars. But to prevent injustice by a too rigid enforcement of these dates, the Commission have reserved to themselves power to admit special coses where exceptional circumstances of excuse for delay in lodging them ore proved to tbeir satisfaction.
