Sir JOHN. FORREST -What is meant by Australian waters-the waters within the three-miles limit? three-miles limit are the territorial waters of the States; but, under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has power to make laws in respect of fishing in the waters outside those limits. Sub-clause 2 must be amended by substituting for the words "" in tins or casks "" the words "" as prescribed "" to make it harmonise with the schedule. A further amendment must be made in sub-clause 5. Clause9 gives the Government power to increase or decrease the maximum amounts column of the first schedule, although there is no power to take money from one item and give it to another. Last night the opinion was expressed that the Government should only have power to expend in a subsequent year in connection with a particular item unexpended balances connected with that item. Take the item of cotton as an illustration. The maximum amount which may be expended upon that industry in any one year is £6,000. Under the Bill, the Government have power by regulation to vary that maximum by increasing it. another ir£m. opinion that the power of the Government should be limited to the expenditure upon any particular item of the unexpended balance of any previous year. Therefore, I intend to move the omission in sub-clause 5 of clause 3 of the words "" subject to the power of alteration by regulation,"" and to add to the sub-clause the following words:"" Provided that where the maximum amount in respect of any item has not been paid in any year the unpaid balance or any part thereof may be paid in respect of that item in any subsequent year in addition to the maximum amount for that year."" . balances will only be expended upon the particular item for which the money has been appropriated? the proper word to use.

Consequently, I suggest that the honourable and learned gentleman should move to recommit the whole of the clauses which he desires to have amended. hands of'honourable members unduly, and therefore I will accept your suggestion, sir, and move That the Bill be now recommitted to a Committee of the whole House for the reconsideration of clauses 2, 3, 4, and 9. am glad that these clauses are to be recommitted.

This amendment is intended to meet the objection urged by the honourable and learned member for Angas during the course of the debate upon the clause. He suggested that in its original form bounty might be claimed upon goods produced in Australia from materials which had been imported. This amendment makes specific provision that the goods upon which bounty is payable must be manufactured ifrom Australian products. should like to ask whether there is anything in this clause to prevent fish which have been' caught by boats manned by Japanese from being transferred to other boats, and brought into the Commonwealth to be preserved?

I am inclined to think that the Bill in itself is sufficient to enable us to deal with the matter, but the point is worthy of consideration, and I promise to look further into the question to put it beyond doubt. [n.i] -The point raised by the honourable and learned member for Illawarra is a sound one. It seems to me that under the clause as it stands those who tin fish in Australia will be able to claim bounty upon their products, irrespective of whether or not the fish have been caught by coloured labour. that the goods must be produced by white labour. . proposed to be inserted seems to have an important bearing on this question. into the matter, and if necessary to propose a further amendment. I do not know whether other honourable members are blessed with better hearing than I am, but I find it very difficult to follow the wording of amendments verbally stated.

In this case the manufacturer or canner would be regarded as the producer, and when fish were tinned in Australia it would be held that they had been produced here. Under the B ill goods in respect of which bounty. is claimed must be manufactured in the Commonwealth. understood the Minister to say that fish on which bounty is claimed must be produced in Australia. Australian waters, and tinned in Australia. B ill prohibits the employment of coloured labour in catching fish on which bounty may be claimed. not to be permitted, the sooner we establish an Australian Navy the better. The Customs officers who will be charged with trie administration of this measure will not be able to patrol our 8,000 miles of coast line in order to see that only white labour is employed in the fishing industry, in so far as it is affected by this B ill ; and our Australian Navy would be afforded excellent training in carrying out that work. It seems to me that in connection with this matter we have another illustration of the fact that in passing a Bill of this kind we are merely playing with legislation. Notwithstanding that the Attorney-General is supported by the honourable member for Angas in proposing this amendment, I do not think that it is necessary. In some instances it will entirely fail to effect the object we have in view. The item relating to fish, as it appears in the schedule, to my mind covers the whole point, and leaves to the Government a far more effective means of prescribing where fish shall be caught, and how they should be treated, in order that bounty may be claimed upon them. preserving of fish, and not with the question of where they should be caught. inclined to beThe amendment provides lieve that it will enable the Government by regulation to deal with both operations, but if there is any legal difficulty in the way, then I as a layman must bow to the opinion of the lawyers in the House. WhilstI hold as strongly as does any honourable member that fish on which bounty is paid should be caught in Australian waters by white Australian fishermen!,' I recognise that Australian fishermen might at times be properly employed in other than Australian waters. Should we provide that fishermen who wish to claim this bounty should not go beyond an imaginary boundary line in making their hauls ? vision in connection with the pearl fisheries of Australia. such an amendment as this should be made. be served by the insertion of. the words "" caught in Australian waters."" It would be better to empower the Administration If a i l to see that the to prescribe by regulation within what limits fish must be caught to entitle bounty to be claimed on them. I agree with the If coloured labour is Attorney-General that white labour only should be employed, but no useful purpose would be served by restricting the operations of Australian fishermen within a certain distance from our coast line. Such a provision would be mischievous. I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that Australian fishermen should have the area of their operations extended beyond the narrow limitations imposed by this measure, but I do not agree with him that wg should leave to the discretion of the Administration the determination of what extension should' be allowed. Since we desire to create a seafaring population along the Australian coast, our object should be to allow Australian fishermen to make their hauls wherever they please; provided that the fish are caught by white Australian fishermen, and preserved by white Australians, bounty should be payable upon them. the honourable member for Wide Bay that I did not suggest such an amendment as that 1 now before the Committee. was the father of the proposal.",18,Bounties Bill

That heading now reads, "" Period dating from 1st July, 1907 during or in respect of .which bounty may be paid."" Thus, by amending the heading to the. second column of the first schedule, we have already provided that if a bounty is not paid during a particular year, it may be paid in a subsequent year; yet the Attorney-General is There now proposing to provide in this clause that although the bounty may be earned in one year, it may be paid in a subsequent year.

The bounty must be earned before it can be paid. The amendment made in the heading to the second column is designed to extend the time of payment, so as to enable a bounty earned before the end of the period to be paid, if necessary, in a subsequent year.

That being so, and in view of the fact that it is difficultto insert in the headings of a schedule all that is necessary in the way of reservations, I think that the Minister should take power to make regulations prescribing further conditions to be complied with in order to entitle the grower or producer to any of these bounties. That would allow the Minister for the time being administering The Attorney-General proposes this measure to go a little further than clause 9 already provides,and. to impose such additional conditions as might appear necessary.

It may be said that the clause as it stands gives the Minister for the time being sufficient power to make regulations, but I think that it would be as well to make the provision I have suggested. Under the Acts Interpretation Act regulations must be submitted to Parliament, and either House can by resolution prevent their coming into operation. We should therefore have a check upon any proposed regulation by which a Minister sought to go any distance beyond what is contemplated by the Bill. As the conditions which I have in mind would tend to restrict rather than to extend the operation of the Bill, I do not think that we should run much risk in intrusting the Minister with slightly increased powers in this regard. I therefore move That the following new paragraph be inserted :"" (e) For prescribing in respect to. any goods a n y further conditions to be complied with in order to entitle the grower or producer to bounty."" There is a great deal of danger in this amendment. the regulations and the Bill itself would give rise to legal difficulties. imposed would have to be consistent with the Bill. culties might arise. We do not desire that those who enter these new industries-wh o take up these very arduous speculationsshould have the foundation on which they may claim a bounty made insecure. The effect of the amendment would be that a man who had embarked upon one of these industries on the strength of a bounty offered under the Bill might subsequently have imposed upon him other conditions which would deprive him of the fruits of his industry. Such a regulation might be passed a year or two after he had commenced operations. will be invited under this Bill to lay the foundations' of these new_ industries are not likely to be lawyers. They will look at the Act and see that so much money is available, over a certain number of years, for cotton ginned, or some other article; and, satisfied with that, they will set to work to honestly earn the bounty by establishing an industry But when they have incurred half the expenditure, and their plants are approaching maturity, a regulation may be issued which, perhaps, disqualifiesthem. be got over by fixing a maximum period in which any regulation could be issued? stances, once the trees are planted, the money has been spent, and the people are committed to the project. They do not reap any advantage for some years, and yet, in the meantime, a regulation may be issued which alters the entire basis of the bounty. The conditions of the bounties should be made as simple and as firm as possible, in the interests of the objects of the Bill, which, itself, sets out the cardinal points of the contract. We lay down terms and conditions of a contract with persons in reference to the establishment of some new industry; and the moment those persons begin to plant they accept 'the contract. A power, on one side, to alter a contract after it is entered into, is never supposed to exist except under some extraordinary circumstances; and it would be a dangerous power to give to the Executive. Any inconsistency between As a layman, I fail to see what advantage there is to be gained by adopting the five sub-clauses of clause 9. The first part of the clause, which gives the Governor General power to make regulations which are necessary or convenient, is quite sufficient. The only effect of the sub-clauses must be to limit, in the minds of some people, the power of the Executive to make regulations, and when far-reaching powers are claimed by the clause itself, there is a danger in placing these limitations. It would be better to omit the whole of the sub-clauses, andleave the Executive responsible, as they ought to be, for the prescription of every necessary regulation. -The possibility outlined by the honourable and learned member for East Sydney, that the conditions under, which a The people who bounty is paid may be varied some time ahead, after men have taken preliminary steps to enter an industry, would be in the highest degree unfortunate if it were realized. In fact, I cannot conceive of an Executive taking such a course. My ownidea is that the Executive, between the passing of the Bill and its coming mtooperation, some few months afterwards, will have time to look round and see what conditions are applicable to the various industries.

201,Mr Groom,"This clause is a placardBill, the consideration is, what is the intention of Parliament in giving this legislative power to the Executive ? The intention is to ascertain the very classes of information which are necessary, as, for instance, the market value, than which no better example could be found. Also it is said, and rightly said, that a Bounties Bill which involves the distribution of moneys to persons who produce various articles, necessarily involves the determination of the quantities to be produced; and these are the very classes of powers which are, in my opinion, included under the general power. From my own experience as a lawyer, I cordially endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Wide Bay as a layman, namely, that the subclauses are likely to lead to confusion. with a good deal of what has been said by the honourable and learned member for Flinders as to the undesirability of prescribing a number of powers to follow the general power, but it is necessary in some cases to give specific powers. If a claimi were made for a bounty by a producer, how could any dispute as to the market value be overcome, except by means' of a lawsuit, or by some such provision as this, which enables the Minister to declare the market value? It is difficult to find out, in law, what the market value is, and in sheep sales, for instance, there have been a lot of cases to decide as to what was the nearest available market in order to settle the question. I think the Executive have very wisely taken power to declare what the market value is, and thus settle any dispute which may arise with a producer. It may be said to be too great an arbitrary power to give to a Minister, who, of course, may be wrong. Mr W. H . IRVINE I think that that power is given under the general provision of the clause. cause, according to the schedule, the bounty is to be paid on a percentage of the market value, and, unless the Minister be given this , power, there might be a law-suit in respect of each item and each producer, because the decision in one case would not affect another case. only are the difficulties which have been mentioned worthy of attention, but the wording of the beginning of the clause seems to me unnecessary. We all know that the Executive cannot make regulations which are inconsistent with the B ill ; that,. I think, is a rudimentary principle of construction. the amendment, and I ask leave to withdraw it. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. a regulation prescribes a minimum, the Courts may declare it to be inconsistent with the Act, wherein no minimum is prescribed. The Judges might say that this is a matter which could not have been overlooked, because the Legislature deliberately provided a maximum and omitted to provide a minimum. I admit that it is difficult to provide for a minimum, but I advise the Attorney-General to take power to make regulations prescribing a minimum. If he does that, no question of law can arise. ter. should like to know from the Attorney General why the words "" in particular "" are used ? It seems humiliating for the Parliament to say that the. Government shall make regulations for giving effect to the Act, and, "" in particular,"" for certain purposes. I do not know _why the words are used. Do they, mean that the power to make regulations in regard to other things will be more open to attack? would do. ral with the particular power. the Government shall have power to make regulations, nothing is gained by this distinction. All regulations will have the same authority, provided that they are not inconsistent with the Act. Mr W. H. IRVIN E (Flinders) [12.35].

212,Motion (By Mr Groom) Proposed,"was not able to be present during the debate on the motion for the second reading, and, as the Committee stage did not fur nish a convenient opportunity for the observations i wish to make, I take advantage of this motion to express my very great regret that the Government have not acceded to the request for the postponement of the measure until after the delivery of the Budget and the introduction of the Tariff. That course should have commended itself to Ministers in their own interests, as well as in those of the public; because they have a very great stake in the success of the measure. They must be desirous that the measure shall produce the benefits which it is stated will result from it. But the success of the measure will be jeopardized if it is taken through its final stages before the reports of the Tariff Commission are in the hands ofhonorable members and the Tariff proposals submitted. I have always considered that the appointment of the Tariff Commission has been justified by the enormous amount of useful information which the labours of its members have procured, information which will be of value to honourable members of all shades of fiscal opinion. of the Commission are as important in connection with the consideration of the proposals contained in this Bill as they will be in connection with the consideration of the Tariff. I have never had the antipathy to bounties which I have to protective duties. Years ago, I pointed out that there are several very important differences between the effects of bounties and the effects of protective duties. when bounties are given, the public know to a penny how much they may be called upon to pay. In the second place, they know what the money is being voted for ; in the third place, who is to get it ; and, in the fourth place, how long the obligation of providing it will last. But a more important difference is this : The encouragement of an industry is a national object, and should, therefore, be paid for out of the national pocket. which involve pecuniary burdens should be met by national contributions. My objection to encouraging industries by the imposition of protective duties is that, instead of the necessary money being taken from the national pocket, the system penalizes those who are encouraging an industry by buying its products. doubt that, as a general rule, the effect of [48] a duty is to increase the price of the article upon which it is imposed. The basis on which duties are levied supports that contention. A fact which commends itself to every one, unless he sees that a positive mischief to the community results from it, is that in Australia, happily, labour reaps a richer reward for its industry than it does in most other countries of the world. That in itself is one of the greatest blessings that can happen to a country; that wages are so high that there are difficulties in the way of competing with other countries in which they are low and the hours long. One of my strongest reasons for looking askance at efforts to promote industries by artificial means has always been that, in competing with countries where wages are low and production cheap, you enter upon a very arduous enterprise which can never be wholly successful whilst the disparity exists. I suppose every man who possesses any humane instincts hopes that the disparity will exist so long as other countries continue to pay low rates of wages. Of course, the larger hope is' that everywhere wages will rise to a higher level, that the people in the more populous countries will come to reap as rich a reward as Australian The reports labour obtains for its industry. That is an aspiration in which every friend of humanity will indulge. But so long as the inequalities I have spoken of remain, there is a perpetual obstacle to success, that is, where there is competition between a country where wages are high and countries where wages are low. I have, therefore, felt that in cultivating the great natural industries of Australia, we stand in the happiest position, In the first place, because our labour is helped by the productive energies of nature. If we view our natural industries, what do we find? That a beneficent nature has put great wealth within our reach. The. pastoral industry, for example, furnishes the staple production of Australia, and from it the prosperity of all our other industries may be said to be derived. The moment the. price of our wool rises in the markets of the world, and our yield increases by reason of good seaNational purposes sons, comfort flows more freely through every channel of life in the Commonwealth. One of the grandest things about an industry like the pastoral industry is that nature is working for us. The wool on the sheep's backs grows day and night, and our prosperity and success is proportionate to the manner in which we work in harmony-with There can be no our natural advantages. We stand at the head of the whole world in some respects.",29,Bounties Bill
213,Mr Reid (East Sydney) [12.36],"IOur wool', whether for quality or for quantity, has placed Australia, at the head of an important branch of human, industry, a grand position for any country to occupy. This is a very young country, sparsely populated, but in the wool industry Australia has arisen to the highest pre-eminence amongst the countries of the world. That, has come about because nature does nineteen-twentieths of the work for us. The man who desires to see nature drawn upon, in order to uphold the prosperity of Australian labour is not necessarily an enemy to Australian industry. My1 protectionist friends may be right, and I mav be entirely wrong, but the desire that Australian labour should, be devoted to those industries in which nature works hand inhand with it seems to me a desire which representsthe truest interests and the highest advantages which labour can possess in Australia. kindly feelings upon enterprises which bring us into competition with countries where the conditions of labour are not so happy, and where production is cheap, because the lot of the people is an unhappy one. The argument which has always seemed to be the strongest argument that a protectionist can use-and it is a fair argument too-is that the difference between the conditions sur1 rounding AusraJTan labour and the labour ol other countries requires that some sort of protection shall be extended to Australian labour if our manufacturing industries are to succeed. That is an argument which ought to appeal to every one as the great argument in favour of a protective policy. It we are to have a protective-TariffI wishtomake it perfectly plain that I am prepared to assist in every possible way to insurethat the benefits of that policy shall go to the people whose claimsfor consideration form the very backbone of the protectionist argument. has madea protective policy possible in this those reports, just as we were shutoff from country ? labour shall be enabled to earn properwages in prosecuting those industries which the law supports. At the same time, theremust be a fair return assured to those whoinvest their capital in those industries, because we cannot expect industrial' speculations to be carried on, unless weallow afair and legitimate profit for the enterprise and-' capital invested inthem. But whilst that ought to be remembered, any state of things in which the major benefit goes not to the labourer in thefactory, but to theinvestor, is a-distortion of the policy Mr Reid. Mr S'PEAKER --May I ask the right honorable member to connect his. remarks with the Bill under consideration ? ing that I have no more to add upon th-ait branch of the: subject. I feel that I was trespassing, sir, and I am very much obliged to you for your indulgence. Free-traders may well look upon a. Bounties Bill with a far more kindly regard than they could display if they were considering protective duties. In the first place one of the most commendable features about this Bill is that it aims at the development of the primary industries which spring from the soil. It has its roots in. those natural industries which will be developed only by developing the natural resources of Australia. That is a good thing in itself. There is no sphere in which enterprise is more arduous', in which the I do not look with the same rewards are more uncertain than in attemptsto establish new industries:whether in towns or' in the country-bu t especially in"" the country. Therefore I have shown no strong opposition to many of the items contained in this Bill!. But I do most sincerely regret that in this most difficult endeavour of ours to select the right commodities with whichto experiment and to prescribe conditions which will be most likely to make these experiments successful, the Government have deliberately cut off from us' the reports of the Tariff Commission, whichincidentally deal with almost every one of these items. Speaking generally, there is scarcely one item in thesegreat industrial experiments-som e of whichtake usinto quite' unknownsphereswhich is not interlaced with the 1 Tariff Commission's reports, for which we are paying thousand's of pounds, andwhich I 'believe will be worththemoney over and over again.

226,Mr Reid,"principle of parliamentary procedure.. I am only stating that which is familiar to -most honourable members having experience in public affairs when I assert that the greatest difficulty associated with the whole problem of representative government in all parts of the world, and perhaps more especially in Australia, relates to the management of financial proposals. Under the most advantageous circumstances, we do not in any case manage our public finances with anything like the same prudence or sagacity that is displayed by ordinary men of business in the conduct of their affairs. Under the most favorable circumstances, the only security which the public have for the exercise of a reasonable degree of prudence or sagacity in the management of the public finances, rests in the practice which requires the Government to be prepared at the commencement of each session to outline its financial proposals. That practice, so far as I know, has always been adhered to in all Parliaments. ' It must be remembered that the necessity for our being called together at least once a year arises primarily from the duty resting upon the Government of the day to render, first of all, an account of its stewardship during the previous year, and then to inform the Parliament what are its financial proposals in' respect of the succeeding twelve months. In connection with this Bill, we have had a very serious departure from that principle. We have only to consider the analogy of an ordinary business institution in order to see for ourselves what an important departure this is. We are really in the position of directors of a great public company, of which the shareholders are the taxpayers, and it is our duty as directors to have before us all the materials necessary for determining any business proposal submitted by the manager or managers of the company before we can either agree or disagree with them. If , for instance, we were directors of a large trading or insurance company, and the manager brought forward a proposal to increase the salaries of all the clerks by 10 per cent., we should naturally inquire, "" Upon what material do you base this proposition?"" Should we agree for one moment to such a proposition if the reply was, "" We do not know exactly what were the returns for last year, or what will be the expenditure next year, but we think it is only fair to make these advances""? We should naturally say, "" Before you ask us as trustees for the shareholders in this company ""-and as members of this Parliament we are trustees for the public"" tosanction any considerable increase of expenditure, or to hypothecate the revenue of the company to a' large extent, it is necessary that you should present to us a f u l l statement, showing the revenue to be expected and the expenditure which it is estimated will be necessary next year."" Such an attitude is based upon ordinary principles of common sense that must appeal to us, irrespective of the parties to which we belong. It is undoubtedly a fact that the Federal Parliament from the first has been in the fortunate, or perhaps I should say in the unfortunate, position of having 'at its disposal a stream' of Customs and Excise revenue enormously greater than any legitimate expenditure that it may be called upon to incur. This vast stream of revenue has been flowing past its door. It has had only to dip in its bucket and draw from that stream, the money necessary to provide for a practically unlimited expenditure. It has not been compelled to place on its expenditure the necessary constitutional check of finding ways and means-of providing the necessary funds. In almost all Parliaments, at ordinary times, when a Government submits a proposal for any great expenditure it has to find ways and means-to submit proposals for providing the necessary funds. As a rule it can do that only by imposing some fresh burden of taxation on the people, or by depriving them of some advantage costing money which they have hitherto enjoyed. This Parliament has had no such check upon its operations; but the time is coming when that state of affairs will no longer prevail. If ever there was a time in the history of a country when it was most essential to the proper management of the public finances' that the particular safeguard to which I have referred should be applied it is the present. We are rapidly coming within a very narrow margin of the limit of our constitutional power of expenditure. We have before us certain policies which must very soon be dealt with by this House-the ' acceptance of which will undoubtedly involve a very large and permanent increase of expenditure. I need not refer to them in detail. We have heard a great deal about immigration, and the necessity for peopling this Continent, as well as tor making further provision for coastal defence. Unless all the talk indulged in both inside and outside this House with respect to those; matters is the merest clap-trap, unless it is so much wind, then undoubtedly in the development of this country we shall necessarily have to find the means for a large permanent addition to our annual expenditure. As the leader of the Opposition has said, we look to the future with grave misgivings;, we have grave misgivings as to the direction the present Government propose to take in dealing with these great national subjects. which the Acting Prime Minister made in reply to my criticism on the motion for the second reading of theBilla speech which consisted mainly of what I may describe as parliamentary amenities directed at myself -ther e was one relevant observation. That observation, the only one that seemed to me to be in any degree relevant to the question at issue-wa s very significant. I refer to the statement made by the honourable gentleman that he personally was in favour of, and had been elected to support, the imposition of direct taxation by the Federal Parliament. I repeat that such a statement made by the Acting Prime Minister in his place in this House is a very significant one, and fills me with serious misgivings. is a strange thing to fill one with serious misgivings. Mr W. H . IRVINE the Federal Parliament -should impose direct taxation at the present time certainly causes me very serious migiving. I know it does not affect the honourable member in the same way. He aind the partu which he leads welcome every possible addition to the expenditure, because they know they can use it as a lever to force us into a position in which direct taxation will be necessary. Mr W. H . IRVINE honourable member would not for one moment admit that that is his position, but in asserting that it is I am simply asking honourable members to use their own common sense, and to draw this inference from every act and the whole conduct of his party. had said that I would welcome any step leading to direct taxation the position would be different, but to say that I and the party to which I belong would favour any expenditure so as to insure the imposition of direct taxation is quite another matter. . MrW . H . IRVINE the honourable member an injustice. . I know that in debating any question he himself seldom does an injustice to any one. But I will say this-and it is a practical, legitimate conclusion to draw-that when we find the whole of the party which the honourable member leads supporting absolutely, andt without a single protest, a measure providing for the hypothecation of ,£530,000 of the revenue-whe n we find them absolutely prepared to swallow the whole of the provisions of that Bill without having from theI n that very remarkable speech Government any indication whatever of what their financial proposals are to be-it is only reasonable to assume that they have an object in view, and that they are. perfectly indifferent as to what the expendituremay be, provided it leads to what is obviously their great goal, the imposition of a land tax. Mr J. H . CATTS -Some of the honourable member's own party are in the sameposition. Mr W. H . IRVINE The Opposition* corner protested most strongly against the Bill being submitted in this way. Mr J.

In view of this position of affairs, I saw no great reason why we should insist on the Budget statejraent being made before the Bounty Bill -was introduced. The honourable member for Flinders say's that it is evident that I and other members of the Labour Party wel-come any form of expenditure because it tends in the direction of the imposition of -direct taxation. I do not think that that is a justifiable statement. I and a great number of the members of 4he Labour Party took last session in regard to penny postage, for instance, was an indication that we are not willing to wildly -deal with the revenue possibilities of the -country. peat the dose 1 members of the Labour Party are still alanost unanimously against any proposal of the sort, which involves, for a considerable .time, such a large sacrifice of revenue. anember mind saying why ? would be in order in giving my reasons on athis occasion. I am prepared to give my .reasons; but I think I explained myself .in very distinct and ample terms on the Ad-dress-in-Reply. I do'not feel that we could, -under present circumstances, afford to sacrifice revenue, seeing that it is required in :so many directions. But I desire to point out a. reason why, in the present situation, we should not be guided by the remarks of either the leader of the Opposition, or the honourable member for Flinders. It goes without saying that an over-whelming majority of members are in favour of the general' principle of giving -some kind of encouragement to the development of new industries by means of boun-.ties. That principle was affirmed on the :second reading, when this Bill was passed without a division, and, so far as I can rsee, that vote reflects the decision of the -country. attitude of the honourable member for .Flinders and the leader of the Opposition mean? It means that this great country, which has decided in an unmis-. takable way on this course of action, is in raising possibilities under the Constitution are so limited, that we dare not consent to the expenditure of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year, lest we may be exhausting the exchequer. Surely we have not reached that stage. It is a poor compliment to Australia to suggest that a small expenditure like this could stand in the way of the accomplishment of its legitimate ambitions. I can hardly conceive that the honourable member for Flinders would, seriously put forward such a contention. If we were in a state approaching bankruptcy or impecuniosity, from a national stand-point-if we had already taken advantage to the f u l l The attitude which of our taxing possibilities under the ConstitutionI could understand this anxiety about what, after all, is a comparatively insignificant and trifling amount. a year spread over fifteen years. £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year, surely we have not reached such a pass that w6 must hesitate about, giving effect to the decision of the electors bn a big national question. Boiled down, the question amounts to whether we have sufficient resources, or sufficient confidence in ourselves, to undertake this expenditure. If the honourable member for Flinders were to say that we should delay until the fiI do not know that I nances are explained, I could understand his attitude; but short of that, I do not see anything to be gained by following the course he suggests.

I do not see that there are any other questions really at issue, so far as the contention of the honourable member for Flinders is concerned, than whether, first, the people have decided upon, and, secondly, whether we can afford the expenditure, and, perhaps, in the worse result, waste a sum of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year., As I have said, I do not see that the reports of the Tariff Commission are likely to materially affect the attitude of this House in regard to the larger portion of these proposals. to be dealt with in the schedule is cigarw a l l "" the Tariff this time. leaf that is not at present grown in Australia, and that item is not likely to be have the session closed before Christmas, altered in any material degree by the I am glad of that assurance; otherwise, Tariff proposals. fined to the high-grade cigars of the capitaindefinitely held over, or, at any rate, list, is it not? the honourable member should seek to conciently serious in the suggestion that there fine, the working classes to low-grade should be delay, to justify us in refusing cigars. point! only of the interjection, I admit. question of the ultimate destination of the Flinders, entered my protest, and pointed cigars does not seem to be so much at issue^ out the unwisdom of pressing this matter as the importance of the industry, which forward before the financial position of the the growers of the leaf will create in AusCommonwealth has been declared, and tralia-that seems to be the really imbefore we have the final reports of the portant point. member is encouraging a luxury which hehas joined in condemning.

That is exactly the point which members of the Opposition are raising here.

I am quite sure that the public will be glad to know that there are a number of honourable members upon this side of the House' who recognise the gravity of the financial situation. The honourable and learned member for Gippsland seemed to entirely lose sight of the fact that the first example which he gave us occurred in 1902. Why, in that year we were on the fop of a financial wave. The Government did not then know what to do with the Commonwealth money. There was no agitation then for the transfer of the Northern Territory, no proposal for the construction of a transcontinental railway, or for the establishment of an Australian Navy, and no talk of assisted immigration, or of the necessity for levying direct taxation. But everybody who reads his newspaper knows that all the States are now beginning to express the most seiious apprehension with regard to their futurefinances,seeing that year after year the Federation is returning them less and less money. wealth has handed over to the States a great deal more than they were entitled to. to every pennv that we do not spend. ing to discuss that question. very well"" that under the Constitution the States are entitled as of right to three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue collected, and to as much more as is not expended. as they can get, I suppose? lect that our constituents are also the constituents of the various States.

I We say that the repeat that in 1902 the position of the Commonwealth was very different from what it is to-day.

The public will naturally look to this House to exercise at least as much discretion as a board of directors of a private concern. As the honourable and learned 1 member for Flinders has very properly said, we are practically in the position of a board of directors. We have an unlimited capital upon which we can call. We are appointed as directors to manage the affairs of this country. As the honourable and learned member asked, "" What would be thought of a board of directors who brought forward a project which involved the giving away of a large amount of the company's money, having asked the manager how it would fit in with his financial arrangements for the year, and having been informed, ' I cannot tell you,' or ' I have not had time to look into the matter.'

If that question involving an annual expenditure of £.180,000 cannot be dealt with until the Budget has been delivered, can any honourable member doubt the wisdom of postponing the further consideration of this Bill, seeing that it will commit the House to an expenditure of nearly half-a-million ?

This Bill belongs to a class of legislation no longer within the scope of the States Parliaments; but I am sure that. if they had an opportunity today to grant bounties for the encouragement of rural industries, they would be prepared to vote much larger sums than we have asked the House to agree to.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I should like to do something of the sort. I did not intend to speak to this motion, but I could. not resist the opportunity to point out the unfairness of those who invariably seek to place the States before the Commonwealth -to give consideration to the position of the States without regard to that of the Commonwealth.

It is mostly poor people who pay Customs taxation; and it is only right that the cost of developing industries should not be thrown wholly on that section of the community, but should be provided for by direct taxation. There is always a tendency to extravagance when we .are dependent on the Customs for funds for projects of this k in d ; and there are one or two items in the schedule which would never have appeared there had the means to be provided by direct taxation. I am fortified in my position by some remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta, who, in speaking on direct taxation, said that to admit of discussion at this stage on the merits or otherwise of direct taxation. The matter before us is the Bounties Bill; and I ask the honourable member not to go bevond the question before the Chair. the motion for the third reading is before the House? third reading, may I move an amendment that the money for the bounties be raised by means of direct taxation? competent as an amendment to a motion for the third reading. I am not allowed to give my reasons for preferring that the cost of the bounties should be met by means of direct taxation, rather than by indirect taxation? with the honourable member so far. Since he rose, the honourable member has stated that ihe thinks the necessary funds ought to be found by means of direct taxation, and he was quite at liberty to proceed in that way. But I understand him now to be proceeding to institute a comparison of the merits of direct and indirect taxation; and I say that that is 'going beyond the question before the House. I cannot give any authority beside my own in favour of direct taxation? to simply state that I am in favour of direct taxation, and neither give reasons nor quote authorities to for t if y my position? DoI understand that I cannot just if y my position by quotations from the opinions of any one else? ber is asking so many questions that I really have some difficulty in deciding which to answer; but the ruling I have already given is sufficient to cover the whole. The honourable member is not in order in debating, either on his own authority or the authority of anybody else, the relative merits of direct and indirect taxation. The honourable member is in order, and I did not interrupt him when he was doing so, in expressing his opinion or anybody else's opinion that the funds for the-purposes of a Bounties Bill had better be provided by direct than by indirect taxation. that the proper way to raise money for this particular purpose is by ""direct taxaI t is beyond my power tion, which possesses many advantages over indirect taxation. One ground for my contention is that direct taxation leads to less extravagance; and there are other reasons .which I desired to advance.

I wish to let the people know orable member is endeavouring to evade the ruling I first gave. If the honourable member for Parramatta has ever said in any way ""that, for the purpose of a BountiesB ill , direct taxation is better than indirect taxation, the honourable member for Barrier is at liberty to quote the remarks; otherwise, I ask him to obey the ruling which I have already given. for Parramatta has said that the most I have not interfered equitable tax that can form part of the financial system of any country is a land tax. ber knows as well as any honourable member that that question has no reference whatever to funds provided for the payment of a bounty. bow to your ruling, sir, but I point out that a BountiesB ill is part of the financial business of a country, and I take it that HaveI the whole includes the part. If the honourable member for Parramatta says that the proper method of raising the funds is by direct taxation, I should like to read his remarks, which I have here in print.

The honourable member for Gippsland tried to place -the honourable member for Fawkner in a false position, but had he read the whole -debate to which he referred he would have -.seen that the money proposed to be distributed was an assured and ascertained balance. There is, moreover, an essential -difference between the conditions under which a State Parliament does its work and :those which exist here. Notwithstanding what the Treasurer has said, it is our duty to consider the interests of the States, be the Union. I am not in sympathy with the -cause the action of State Treasurers must -depend upon' the Commonwealth financial proposals. In my opinion, the original in-tention and purpose of the framers of the Constitution was to confine the Commnn-wealth to the expenditure of the money coming to it from duties of Customs and Ex-cise, and it is. rapidly becoming clear that : the line of cleavage between parties in this House will be between those who, like the -members of the Labour Party, favour the imposition by the Commonwealth of direct taxation, and those who do not. In my -opinion, such action by the Commonwealth would be an interference with State rights, ;and. would unsettle State conditions. The -object of the protest which has been made .has not been to embarrass the Government, 3iut to express the opinions of those who -'think that Ministerswouldhave been better in this House, who does' not know what he --advised had they filled up the time which :must elapse before the Budget can' be de> livered with measures not involving heavy -expenditure. .able to strike some items out of the schedule -of this Bill,, and thus reduce the total of -what some honourable members opposite are pleased to regard a trifling amount, but which I think a very considerable one. Had. the proposal been to apply some such sum to the encouragement of more important industries, and had it been brought forward .at the right time, I should have considered it a desirable one. Ministers have not. acted in the way that was to be expected of men filling high and responsible administrative positions. As I said when speaking on. the motion for the second reading, not one honourable member on this side can be rightly accused of having cast reflections upon the credit of the Commonwealth. The suggestion of the Prime Minister that -that has been done is unworthy of him, and -of the intelligence of the House. The Government might have treated with more consideration those who wish to help them in passing just and prudent legislation. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [3.50] I wish to say a few words as one who has supported the Bill, though thoroughly recognising the force of the arguments of those who complain that its introduction was inopportune. Reference has been made to the fact that its methods of finance have brought the Commonwealth into disrepute in the States, and there are very few persons, either inside or outside this Chamber, who are not aware that there is a considerable feeling against the continuance of agitation which exists, and I do not defend itpresentation. Colonel FOXTON -Much of the dissatisfaction which has been caused is justifiable, and is directly traceable to Federal methods of finance and administration. I should not have referred to the matter had it not been for the personal reference' of the Acting Prime Minister to myself. He said that the Commonwealth Government and Parliament have been subjected to considerable abuse and complaint because of the methods of finance which have been adopted. I interjected '.' deservedly so,"" and the only defence he had was to tell me that I am a young member is talking about. It is only a very few yearssince he was a young member of the House. Young or old, as the representative of a Fortonately, 'we have beenconstituency, I have the right to express my opinions here-as much right as he has, even though he may be Acting Prime Minister-and I intend to assert that right when it suits me to do so. Besides,' F know, from a somewhat bitter experience, that what I said is true. A Government of which I was a member found itself obliged, because of the financial arrangements of the Commonwealth, to obtain additional revenue or to make other arrangements to meet a deficit to the extent of something liko £500,000 a year.

Recently, I permitted certain -mineral specimens from the Northern Territory, and, more lately, others from Tasmania, to be shown on a table in the corridor leading from the Chamber. So fai as I am aware, these specimens are not being shown with a view to promoting the flotation of a company.
