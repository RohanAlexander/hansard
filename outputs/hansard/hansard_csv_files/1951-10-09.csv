GOLD. in a position to state whether the Canadian Government has given permission to Canadian gold producers to sell gold on the free markets of the world? Has the right honorahle gentleman any information to impart to the House concerning the attitude of the International Monetary Fund or that of the Government of the United States of America in connection with increasing the price of gold? Sir the course of the afternoon, I hope to be permitted to make a statement on the gold position and the views of the International Monetary Fundi n that connection. Later: Treasurer) -h y leave-As a result of -recent discussions hy the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund, there has been a substantial change in the fund's gold policy. This was announced by the managing director of the fund in a statement issued on the 29th September, in the following terms:In .Time. 1047, the fund issued a statenient monetary gold of 22 carat or lower finerecommending to its members that they take effective aetion to prevent external transactions in sold at premium prices, because such transactions tend to undermine exchange stability and to impair monetary reserves. From time to time the fund haa reviewed its recommendations and tiie effectiveness of the action taken by its members. Despite tiie improvement in the payments I shall be very position of many members, sound gold and exchange policy"" of members continues to require that to tlie maximum exteut practicable gold sliould be held in official reserves rather than go into private hoards. It is only as gold is held in official reserves that it can he used by the monetary authorities to maintain exchange rates and meet balance of payments needs. However, the fund's continuous study of the situation in gold producing and consuming countries shows that their positions vary so widely as to make it impracticable to expeci all members to take uniform measures in order to achieve the objectives of the premium gold statenient. Accordingly, wliile the fund reaffirms its belief in the economic principlesinvolved and urges the members to support them, the fund leaves to its members the Questions which cannot be practical operating decisions involved in their implementation, subject to the provisions of Article XV., section 2, and other relevant articles of the articles of agreement of tinI.M..1.'"". The fund will continue to collect full information about gold transactions, will watch carefully developments in this field and will be prepared, in consultation with members, to consider problems relating to exchange stability ond any other problems which may arise. The interpretation of this new statement is a matter of considerable importance but of some difficulty. Press sources have reported that the managing director of the fund has stated that member nations of the fund may now sell as much processed gold at premium prices as they wish, but that they should continue to ARTH UR FADDEN -During guard against, private hoarding. It seems clear, at least, that while the f u n d has reaffirmed its belief in the economic principles involved in its gold policy, and continues to urge members to support those principles, it is now the responsibility of each member nation to judge how and to what extent it will implement the fund's policy statement, so long as sales, are not designed to direct gold into private hoards. They will not be bound to any particular procedure, or limited to the sale of any specific amount of gold or to any particular proportion of their newly mined production.

Producers who choose to sell gold in this way will forgo the subsidy assistance at present paid under the Canadian Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act.. South Africa has for some time past heen selling substantial quantities of gold in premium markets, and is expected to expand its current sales. Some other countries are also expected to follow suit. Unless, therefore, last, in response to a question asked by there is a substantial increase of the demand for gold in the world's premium markets, it might be reasonable to suppose that the pressure of increased supply would force down the current premium. During the period of acute shortage of dollars and other hard currency, when Australia was drawing heavily on the sterling area dollar pool, Australian gold production was acquired by the Commonwealth Bank and sold to the Bank of England. Nearly a year ago sales of currently produced gold to the Bank of England were suspended, and the new production has been going into the Australian gold reserve, which is required to underpin the Commonwealth's credit in hard currency countries and to provide a reserve against any emergency demand for hard currency. The gold-mining industry of Australia has recently made representations urging the Commonwealth to support a higher world price for gold, and to subsidize Australian mines which are being adversely affected by the rapid rise of costs. The Commonwealth has, in fact, strongly represented the case for a higher world price, and will continue to do so. The question of subsidy is more difficult, particularly as certain forms of assistance which might commend themselves to the industry ara inconsistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. Further discussions with representatives of the gold-mining industry are taking plaee, and the effect of thd fund's decision on premium sales of gold will be thoroughly canvassed during those discussions. Honourable memhers may rest assured that the interests of Australia and of the gold-mining industry will continue to receive the very careful attention of intensifying, maintaining, or relaxing and interest of the Government.

Minister) -by leave-On the 28th June the honorahle member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) concerning the introduction into Australia in imported timbers of the wood pest known as sirex wasp, I outlined the complex problems involved and informed the House that I had written to the State Premiers seeking their co-operation in setting up a committee of inquiry. Although the State governments are. of course, primarily responsible for the major part of Australian forests, the matter was considered to be of such national importance that the Commonwealth suggested to the States that the conflicting evidence for and against the maintenance of quarantine services against sirex wasp should be thoroughly examined by an impartial tribunal. Some delay occurred before replies were received from the States, but all States have now indicated their agreement to the course of action proposed by the Commonwealth. Certain persons were suggested by each State for membership of the committee, from which the Commonweajth has selected the following:Chairman, Sir David Rivett, formerly chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and now chairman of the Advisory Council of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Repea rch Organization; Dr. H .

It is designed to further the interests of the nation as a whole. Therefore, the fact that it is unpalatable to some sections of the community is of little consequence. I am sure that even the most severe critics of the budget, provided that they can subjugate their selfish interests, will very shortly be grateful to the Government for its patent honesty of purpose and its approach to the urgent problems that confront the nation. BeforeI comment upon certain aspects of the budget, 1 shall refer to the paucity of the arguments that have been advanced by honourable gentlemen opposite. From the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) downwards-perhap s I should say upwards-the y have followed the party line entirely. Theirs has been a reckless partisanship, which has ignored the interests of the nation. Unlike the Government, which has put the nation above party, they have put their party before the nation. The Leader of the Opposition, in referring to the budget, used a string of adjectives. He described it as "" stupid, futile, unjust, sinister, dangerous and reckless "". Those adjectives could well be used 'in writing a pen portrait of the right honourable gentleman himself. Tactics similar to those that were used by the Opposition and their fellow travellers in the last referendum campaign are being used now in an endeavour to make this budget unpopular with the nation. Such tactics are not in the best interests of the people of this country. During the referendum campaign, the vilest tactics were used. With reckless abandon the truth . was completely distorted, I suppose it is too much to hope that a party wbich, on that occasion, placed party before nation will, on this occasion, put the nation first. The Leader of the Opposition is famous for his defence of communism. In a question that I directed to-day to the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Gasey), I referred to the text of a broadcast from Moscow Radio. Apparently Moscow Radio believes that the Leader of the Opposition is the protector and the great liberator of Australian Communists. I think that it is quite right. The honourable gentleman is tunning true to form. He has always supported the attitude of the Communists. objectionable to me to hear the honourable member for Bass( Mr Kekwick) say the Leader of the Opposition has always supported the Communists. The honourable member for Bass has expressed an opinion. There is no point of order. why the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) does not feel happy, because I know that his views are not in conformity with those of his leader, who is consistently inconsistent. After the budget had been presented, the Leader of the Opposition demanded that a referendum should be held on it, but when a referendum on communism was foreshadowed he did not want a bar of it. That is typical of his approach to our political problems. He is the most adept political acrobat that this country has known.

Indeed, the Service grew fourfold during its term of office. Now, hecause this Government is honouring a pre-election promise to effect economies in the Service, there is a great outcry. It ia said that the action of the Government is inhuman, monstrous and ruthless. Yet, during the term of office of the Chifley Government the Service grew from a strength of approximately 39,000 to almost 200,000. The members of the Liberal and Australian Country parties undertook to effect economies in the Service ancl to make available for more of retrenchment should rest with the essential production labour which hacl been grasped by that great octopus. It is obviously a move which will be appreciated by the public at large. In any event, these mass dismissals, as they are called, represent a mere 10,000 members, or 5 per cent, of the Service, and I consider that there is room to make further retrenchments. I am not opposed to the legitimate public servant, the genuine officer who does.an efficient job. I have every sympathy for him. As I see the position, he suffers a great deal of frusfair way in which to handle the matter is tration hecause of the overloading of certain departments and the inefficiency of the whole machine. I have no doubt that many genuine public servants woulcl be glad to see still further dead wood cut away. I have heard a great deal concerning the overtime that is heing worked in the Service. some of those who were retrenched worked overtime right up to the time of their dismissal. I rather think that overtime is a racket. Indeed, I treat it with a great deal of suspicion. I have been informed by a most reliable authority that the working of overtime by public servants in Canberra has heen a distinct racket. I have been informed, very reMr Kekwick. liably, that it frequently happens that a public servant signs on to work overtime, goes away to the pictures, returns from the pictures and then signs off. Opposition members interjecting, that practice is not infrequent in other parts of the Commonwealth. I agree that if there is any foundation for the stateTerritory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) that publicservants who have had 20 or 30 years' service, or who are about to reach the retiring age are being dismissed, the matter should be investigated; but I treat those statements with a great deal of reserve. If they aro true, I suggest that such action is a reflection upon the departmental heads who select the officers for retrenchment, because, all other things being equal, they should not be retrenched. I am not at all happy that the poweiPuhlic Service Board. Mr Ward interjecting, member for East Sydney is not in his seat and is interjecting repeatedly.

Unless and until that is done, we cannot claim that we have effected all the economies that are necessary in that gigantic pool of labour.

There are We have been told that thousands of jobs available to the persons who are dismissed. It is merely a matter of common sense.

""Where would honourable Tlie increases of taxes, proposed in the budget have been well Direct taxes have been increased by 10 per cent, only, which means that a person who now pays tax of 2s. 6d. in the £1 will pay 2s. 9d. in the £1,' and a person who now pays 10s. in the £1 will pay lis. in the £1. I commend the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) for the imposition of a flat increase of 10 per cent, over last year's tax payments because administratively it is simpler to do that than it would be to replace the entire tax scales; and, of course, it will be a simple matter to repeal the increases when the emergency that made them necessary has passed. The proposed increases compare favourably with the increases of taxes imposed by Canada, where the increase is 20 per cent., Kingdom the increase is. considerably greater than ours is. The Government's policy in regard to indirect taxation is obviously one of placing first things first. A distinction has been drawn between essential and. non-essential goods. It is significant that only two of the 156 food, clothing and other items included in the "" C"" series index which is used as a foundation for the basic wage, have been increased in price as the. result of the budget. equipment and tobacco products. All other increases of tax are on goods that are not included in the "" C "" series index and are, therefore, not regarded as essentials. There could not be a fairer distribution of tax between essential and non-essential goods,, although there may be some anomalies between what one . party considers essential and non-essential and ' what another thinks about it. is that the incidence of indirect taxes will apply equitably. The major essentials of life are food, clothing and shelter. Aus^ tralia is now facing a potential food shortage. It is a dreadful state of affairs that this country, which has been famed for long as a primary producing country, should have to face the possibility that in a short time it may suffer from food shortages and be forced to import essential food items.. The budget is intended to prevent such a situation by penalizing non-essential production so as to divert labour from non-essential to Mr Kekwick. essential production such as the producdistributed. tion of food and housing. Labour will find its own level without direction because of the penalties imposed on non-essential goods. First things should come first. One of the unfortunate features of the present era is that employers, by outbidding one another for labour, are aggravating inflation. It is time that employers and members of chambers of commerce and manufactures got together, and came to an honourable agreement not to bid against one another for labour. ber believe, that the workers are getting too much? conditions are fixed by arbitration courts and by the United and wages tribunals, and I am content and New Zealand where to leave the matter to them. The Government isdeserving of commendation for what it has done for pensioners. The present increase of 10s. a week is the largest that has ever been granted in the history of the Commonwealth. I know that the increased cost of living has made things diflicult for pensioners but it is our duty to look at the overall picture. I have the greatest admiration and respect for age pensioners.

Obviously they are doing a thousands in a single year. Had the rate good job, and are doing their share to of enlistment been reduced, and transfers place the economy of the country on a made where necessary, the size of the sound footing. Public Service could have been adjusted without hardship to any one, assuming deliberately ignored certain methods that there were, in fact, too many public which were available to him to correct the servants. Much nonsense has been talked economic ills of the country. In effect, he by members of the Government merely placed himself in a financial strait-jacket for the sake of political window-dressing. before he brought down his budget. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) I have in mind particularly the control wishes the people to believe that the Goof prices, which could have played an imvernment by dismissing 10,000 public serportant part in the fight against inflation. vants is making a great contribution to It has been used in time of war and has the economic recovery of Australia.

The Treasurer has no all of this year's allocation. It is dear, idea of how to implement prices control. therefore, that the Government proposes He would be well advised to read some of to raise by taxation more revenue than the numerous books on the subject in will he necessary. The honourable member for Bass In preparing his budget, the Treasurer been found very satisfactory for keeping prices on a sound basis,. as may be The' the publication to which I have referred. Experience has established two main facts about price eontrol-first , that it has little the library, particularly Federal Price Control, by Julia Emily Johnsen. Every member of the Government who has spoken on the budget has mentioned prices control. It keeps obtruding into the discussion because it cannot be kept out. Later in his speech, the Treasurer saidThe notion that prices could be held down by paying subsidies to offset eost increases belongs to the order of ideas which sees a cure for inflation in price and cost controls. As a general policy, tlie Government rejects both ideas together and it has, therefore, made u review of existing subsidies in the light of the ment spending. There is no doubt that financial position. That review has resulted in a decision to remove the subsidy from wool, which will greatly increase the cost of woollen goods. It is quite clear that the Treasurer has rejected prices control without having given any sound reason for having done so. Honourable members can only assume that some persons behind the scenes have said that they do not want prices control and that, therefore, the Treasurer will do without it. The second form of control which the Treasurer rejected was capital issues control, which had heen enforced by the previous Government. The present Government discarded it immediately it came into office on the ground that it was not wanted. The present Government intended to do without controls. That is the cause of the great trouble that the Government is facing at the present time. Immediately there was a rush to invest funds in private enterprise. Prime Minister has stated, wherever money flows, labour flows also. Labour flowed after the capital which was invested in all sorts of enterprises, including what had been called the luxury trades. I do not consider that any trade is a luxury trade, because everything has a use for somebody and what the Australian people want is very much dependent on their temperament. That is a part of democracy. Money began to flow into various other industries, many of waich started in the hope of making profits. They did make huge profits. Now the Government has re-instituted capital issues control on a scale that has not existed in this country before. It is endeavouring to make amends for the mistake that it made earlier. The Treasurer has said, in rffect, "" The Government has made a mistake in allowing these industries to become estabAfr. Joshtta. lished and so it will put a 66$ per cent, sales tax upon their goods in order to cut down their sales and ruin their business This policy is supposed to lead men to other industries where they will he more useful. Let us consider the case of a diamond setter who has followed his trade from boyhood. If his business is taken away what can he turn his hand to? A treasurer may sometimes correct financial instability by means of governthis is a very useful measure at certain times, but whilst public spending may be increased during a depression in order to stimulate trade and provide jobs there are times when the Government cannot stop spending money. It is not possible for the Government to stop spending at the present time. It has to provide millions of pounds for defence which is a legitimate expenditure. The Government is obliged to spend that money and cannot withhold it in order to reduce the amount of money in circulation. Some of the means of correcting economic maladjustments are not always open to the Government. In those circumstances, the amount of government expenditure cannot be controlled by the Treasurer and he should have remembered that fact when casting his budget.. It is absolutely essential that the Government should have a sound loan market on which to float its loans but, at the present time, government loans have been As the sabotaged. I noticed the change that took place in the market for government bonds immediately the present Government took office. I know a farmer who sold his property for £15,000 a couple of years ago. Because the Labour Government had heen in office a very substantial demand had developed for government loans which were then gilt-edged. This farmer decided to invest his £15,000 in government loans while seeking another farm, thinking that when he found a suitable property he would he able to cash the bonds, the interest from which would pay for his brokerage and leave him a little profit. By the time he found another farm the present Government had come to office and when he sold his bonds he was dismayed to find that he did not receive £15,000 for them. The market had started to weaken because there had been no control of capital issues. There was a flow of capital to private enterprise away from government loans. This state of affairs should have made the Government think but it still refused to institute capital issues control and so the d r if t continued. Ricketson, the chairman of the Australian Foundation Investment Company Limited, when addressing the twentythird annual meeting of the company, said. . . on 18th June last of the text of "" a frank warning"" given hy the Commonwealth Treasurer, Sir Arthur Fadden, .to the Loan Council, to the effect that support for Government Loans was declining. Sir Arthur was reported to have said that Australian governments would find it extremely difficult, perhaps completely impossible, to obtain thc new loans in prospect for the coming year's programme. He was furtlier reported to have said tliat a "" new approach to tlic problem of providing the new capital that Australian governments require for essential purposes will have to he worked out"", and to have gone ou to refer to the decline in bond prices, immediate slump in prices of Commonwealth securities being implied. Whilst this "" warning"" resulted in an immediate slump in prices of Commonwealth loans on the Stock Exchange, its full significance was not recognized at the time. Indeed, there was a feeling in some quarters that the publication of the statement was more or less accidental. Subsequent events, however, proved that it was premediated and that it was a prelude to a radical change of financial policy. This view was later supported by the announcement of the new and greatly increased rate of 3} per cent, for the Commonwealth loan to bc launched in August. It was most unfortunate that this rate became known during the currency of the £0,000,000 loan at 3£ per cent, which was being offered by tlie Stale Electricity Commission of Victoria. The premature disclosure of the new Commonwealth rate inevitably resulted in torpedoing "" the S.E.C. Loan, after vigorous requests from the Premier of Victoria for permission to increase thc rate on the latter issue it is, but no one has told the right honorhad fallen on deaf ears. The announcement of the new Commonwealth loan rate served to create great dissatisfaction the confidence of the people in the loan amongst investors who had subscribed to recent Commonwealth loans and to the S.E.C. Loan. This was only natural, as it involved them in a,n immediate' paper depreciation of from £7 to £S per cent, on their holdings. It had the further serious effect of creating grave uncertainty as to the future trend of interest rates, thus promoting the deterioration in confidence to which I have already referred. Tliis feeling was further accentuated when it became known fchat even the 3$ per cent, rate had not been sufficiently attractive to ensure the success of the Thirteenth Security Loan of £40.000.000 which closed on the 12th September, and which, according to a statement by the Commonwealth Treasurer, was undersubscribed by £7,700,000. . . . Though considerable harm has already been done as a result of recent developments, it is even now not too late to retrieve the situation. Nevertheless, the process of restoring confidence will demand bold and courageous Mr Staniforth steps under the initiative of the Commonwealth Government. Mr Staniforth Ricketson's report illustrates the point that business people generally believe that the Treasurer destroyed the confidence of the investing publio in the loan market. Mr Staniforth Ricketson is a very competent observer who has kept to his subject. H is views are also borne out by the following statement made by the Treasurer in his budget speech:It is impossible at this stage to forecast what amount will be raised by public loans during the financial year, but it would seem that even the reduced programme of £225,000,000 is substantially in excess of the capacity of the loan market. To the extent that loan raisings fall short of the approved programme the Commonwealth will need tofinancethe balance from its own resources. The right honourable gentleman is afraid that he w ill not be able to get the money he needs because he knows the state of the loan market for which he is responsible. He continuedThe requirements for redemptions which may. arise out of the maturing of £72,000,000 of Commonwealth and State debt in November, 1051, aiid April, 1952, cannot as yet be estimated. There is no reason why the Treasurer should be in this sorry state of uncertainty abotit the future. One grain of sense in his budget speech was the statement that the budget is a most useful means of remedying the difficulties of the times through which we are passing. Of course able gentleman how he should essay the task. It is obvious that he has destroyed market by a process of bolstering investment in private enterprise. In the absence of capital issues control, private enterprise has been able to attract the bulk . of investment money. The huge profits made hy private enterprise have caused money to flow away from government loans. Mr Staniforth Ricketson gave an analysis of the market",30,Budget 1951 52
111,Mr Wight,"W h o is he?financial authority who has underwritten many Commonwealth loans,, including the last one. It is perfectly clear that the Treasurer in the budget had a most useful means of restoring confidence in Commonwealth loans. He should have imposed appropriate rates of income tax on dividends received by the holders of preference and ordinary shares-o n those enormous dividends that the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) referred to last week which have attracted the investing public and destroyed their confidence in Commonwealth loans. Is there any virtue in investing your money in private enterprise when the Commonwealth is languishing for funds to meet its weapon with which to combat the present legitimate loan expenditure, amongst other things to meet the cost of providing war service homes for ex-servicemen? Capital expenditure on war service homes .should be provided entirely from loans, but the Government proposes to provide it from revenue hecause it is afraid that it will not be able to raise the requisite money by loans. A national obligation rests upon the people to ensure that government projects shall be adequately financed. Great national projects such as the Kiewa and Snowy Mountains, hydroelectric schemes the undertakings of the Joint Coal Board which, have assisted us to achieve record coal production, and other national projects should not languish for want of funds. As the Prime Minister said in answer to a question last week the prospects of brighter than he had hoped. Money should be made available for these projects without delay. These ventures should be financed by government loans. Insurance; companies, trustee companies and other investors are interested only in the yield which they receive from their investments. By -imposing proper taxes on the yield from investments in private enterprise the Government could make government loans more attractive to investors. That policy was followed hy the Labour Government but it has been rejected by the present Government which, afraid of failure on the loan market, is endeavouring to raise its capital requirements by imposing additional taxes on the workers. I foreshadowed the present state of affairs not long ago when I discussed the proposal for the appointment of a Commonwealth' Bank Board. The softening-up process is now being, employed and in future those who lend money will undoubtedly receive even higher returns than they have received in the past. A Melbourne. newspaper commenting on the budget recently had this to sayBad and all as it is, we have to pnt up with the budget. It admitted that the budget is a bad one. The most important task that confronts us is to restore a sound market for Commonwealth loans. In the budget the Treasurer has at hand a useful economic inflationary state. amazing tonote what an unholy me3S the Opposition is making of this budget debate. Possibly we can understand it when we realize that Opposition members generally are forced to take their cue from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), who. made such an appalling: mess of his speech on the budget, that his followers feel that they must bolster his speech in an attempt to show there was really something in it. Honourable members have just listened to the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) who was said to have been a bank manager before he entered politics. I suggest that if he was a hank manager he must have used a lot of influence to get the job, or that during future development are even the whole of his speech he was talking with his tongue in his cheek as far as he could push it. He said that the Government, during the preceding twelve months, had not spent its defence allocation. reason why it is true is that instructions were given to trade unions throughout the democratic world that every endeavour was to be made tosabotage their governments' defence preparations. Sabotage of defence preparations was not peculiar to Australia.

It is well to remember that a member of the Canadian Parliament named Fred Rose supported Communists against his own Government, and sold to a foreign power certain details of uranium 235.

However, it cannot be denied that a certain number of our people are members of the Communisc party. To the honourable member for ""Watson( Mr Curtin), who has interjected, I say that it cannot be denied that a certain unfortunate section of the community can be classified as simple-minded and moronic. The whole speech of the honourable member for Ballarat seemed to be directed to an advocacy of a return to the system of controls in vogue during the war years. In 1949, the last Labour Government was thrown out of oflice hecause of its continued advocacy of economic controls. The controls imposed by Labour governments had grown to such fantastic proportions that the people feared to allow the Labour party to remain any longer in power. That is the reason why the Labour party now occupies the Opposition benches as a mere divided mob. Honourable members opposite are at present divided into three or more factions.

Unfortunately, a Labour government eventually regained control of the country and, unable to cope with mounting inflationary pressures, allowed them to develop 'until to-day Australia has reached a stage of supreme inflation. When the Menzies Government was elected to office in 1949 it was unable to do anything ahout inflation because of the existence of a hostile Senate. The Scullin Government also bad a hostile Senate, but the difference between that Government and the Menzies Government is that the latter government hacl the courage to go to the people and ask them to take control of the Senate out of the hands of the Opposition.

I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition is not here also to hear what I am about to say. In his speech in this debate the Leader of the Opposition based his argument on the story of a motor car. He said that if less petrol is put into a motor car it will travel velocity of money will be slowed by in a shorter distance and it will go more slowly. He meant that if the speed of nioney could be regulated it would have no retarding effect on inflation. Inflation is a superfluity of money and an inadequate supply of goods existing in the one community. The superfluous money is used to bargain for the goods. When the "" volume"" of money is spoken of, we do not mean merely the quantity of money, as the honourable member for Ballarat should know. The volume of money means the quantity of money in a community multiplied by its velocity. For example if there were £1,000,000 in Australia and that sum were to change hands only once a year in the purchase of goods, then only £1,000,000 would have been spent. Therefore, the volume of money in Australia under those conditions woulcl be only £1,000,000. If the £1,000,000 should change hands 50 times Mr Wight. in the year then the volume of money at large would be £50,000,000. At present in this country there is a large quantity of money moving at a high velocity. Therefore, it can be said that we have a large volume of money in Australia. It is well known that there is an inadequate volume of goods to meet the demand, and this Government has been charged with the responsibility of bringing those two volumes, one of money and one of goods, into a state of balance. Apparently the honourable member for Watson is having difficulty in understanding me because he appears to be asking the honourable member sitting behind him to enlighten him. For his benefit, I shall proceed in even simpler terms. I suggesl that honourable members should picture in their minds a chemist's balance having on one side a large cube representing the volume of money, and on the other side a small cube representing the volume of goods. In order to bring the economy into a state of balance it is necessary to reduce the size of the large cube and increase the smaller one. We intend to obtain that state of equilibrium by means of this budget. We intend to employ anti-inflationary pressures which will cause a shrinking of the volume of money by braking the velocity of money. Let us take a practicable example of that. The creasing taxes on non-essential goods. A man who goes into a shop to huy a luxury article may hesitate to do so because it has increased in price, and may eventually put his money back into his pocket. By so doing he will be preventing his money from competing for the limited quantity of goods that are available. Opposition members interjecting, opposite are finding difficulty in following my reasoning, that may he because they are sadly lacking in intelligence. 1 am sure that most memhers of the committee are quite, capable of understanding my remarks. When customers are deterred from making purchases because of the increased taxes on non-essential goods, those goods will remain on the retailor's shelves. The retailer in turn, will refrain from placing further orders witli the wholesaler for similar articles. Even",35,Budget 1951 52

However, the Australian Labour party appointed a special committee to investigate the society, and the finding of that committee was that it was a Communist organization. Once again we saw the spectacle of a member of the Evatt family championing the cause of the Communists. It is a serious matter that we should allow that state of affairs to continue. The supporters of the Leader of the Opposition know only too well that they have no confidence in him and that he would sell out the Labour party as quickly as he would sell out the Communist party, and I believe he would sell out Australia. If honourable members opposite ridicule that suggestion, let them explain why, at a caucus meeting, they moved a motion of no confidence in the right' honourable gentleman and his colleagues on the parliamentary executive of the party because of their pro-Communist activities. Members of the Opposition remain quiet when I make that charge because they know it to be true.

Yet like a hypocrite the honourable member went on the hustings and supported the Communist cause. I strongly commend this budget because it provides a weapon to overcome inflation,, which is the only factor upon which members of the Australian Labour party, socialists and Communists prosper. They wish to see serious unrest develop in this country as a result of inflation. The budget is designed to overcome inflation. For that reason every member of the Government parties supports it whilst all honorahle members opposite oppose it hecause they do not wish to see the Government overcome inflation. honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) has just indulged in one of the most vicious speeches that I have yet heard in this chamber.

The Leader of the Opposition will have his greatest victory at the next general election when he will be returned as Prime Minister despite all attacks that may be made upon him by persons like the honourable member for Lilley. All that that honourable member did when he addressed the committee was to attack the Australian -Labour party and to indulge in smear tactics against not only members of that party but also prominent clergymen in this country. He would not be game to repeat outside the Parliament the remarks that he has just made about Bishop Burgmann. those statements at any time. ber, when he attacks the Australian Labour party, should remember that there were 250,000 unemployed in this country when Labour last assumed office during the depression in the late 'thirties. He spoke about the Government honouring its pledge to put value back into the £1. I am astonished that he is not ashamed to make such a statement because this Government's record is one of broken promises. The budget now before us is another instalment of that record. The Government has failed to honour any of the promises that it made at the general slections in 1949 and 1951. ber prove that statement. able members on both sides do not cease making an uproar I shall deal with interjectors. tralia will deal with honourable members opposite at the first opportunity. In an advertisement that was published in the Australian Women's Weekly of the 10th December, 1949, and which was sponsored by the present Government parties, the following statement was attributed to the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), whose photograph, incidentally, appeared over it While encouraging produetion to the full our Government will hold itself ready to paj before us in this respect will mean that price subsidies in appropriate cases; parloans will not be made available by the ticularly in respect of items affecting the cost of living of basic wage-earners. Yet the Government now refuses .to increase the .subsidy payable on dairy products and thus obviate a further increase of the price of butter although the necessary increase will involve an addition of 2s. to the basic wage. On the contrary, the Government has declared that it intends to withdraw price stabilization subsidies. The proposed increases of the sales tax will have the effect of robbing the kiddies of this country The CHAIEMAN -Order! The honourable member may not impute such a motive to the Treasurer or to any other honourable member. He must withdraw the term ""robbing"". proposed increase of the sales tax will mean that the children of this country will be obliged to go without Christmas stockings and ice-cream. I admit that the budget contains some worthwhile proposals for which, in fairness, one must give credit to the Government. In this respect I refer to the abolition of the sales tax on goods that are normally purchased hy community hospitals. Such action, however, is long overdue. This concession will enable community hospitals to carry on the services that they are rendering to the sick. They will thus avert the necessity to close their doors. I urge the Government to abolish the pay-roll tax in respect of employees of community hospitals. Such action would not involve it in substantial financial loss. One hospital in my electorate pays £250 annually in pay-roll tax. party introduced the pay-roll tax. party introduced it. Let us do what is right for a change. If the Government exempted community hospitals from the payment of the pay-roll tax, the hospital to which I refer would be able to install urgently needed equipment and would thus he able to provide better service.

The South Australian Housing Trust built approximately 800 homes last year and of that number, 600 were purchased by ex-service personnel with the help of loans that were made available to them by the War Service Homes Division. However, in the future, houses that are erected by the Housing Trust in South Australia will be classified as existing houses. The result will be that, henceforth, the purchasers of those houses, if this proposal is not reviewed, will have to seek loans elsewhere. Already, the Premier of South Australia, Mr Playford, has approached the Prime Minister on that subject, and I sincerely trust that all the representatives of South Australia in this chamber will join with me in urging the Government to make it possible for ex-servicemen in that State to obtain loans through the War Service Homes Division, instead of being compelled to look elsewhere for such financial accommodation. All those dwellings are new. The Government appears to have overlooked the fact that the houses exist, and that the proposed legislation will prohibit ex-servicemen from borrowing money with which to purchase them. The proposed increases of social services benefits, although they will be accepted with grer.t satisfaction by the recipients, are still inadequate, in view of the high cost of living. Sooner or later an Australian government, regardless of its political opinions, will be forced dismissing many public servants. Honorto accept the obligation to pay pensioners 50 per cent, of the hasic wage. This Government should at least continue to pay to them approximately the same percentage of the basic wage as was paid by the Chifley Government. The increases of sales tax ruthlessly attack the people of Australia. The higher sales tax on popcorn and ice cream will extract another penny from a child who purchases those sweets. The new proposals are harsh and unjust.

He does not understand the position. ilr. Galvin. ber for Canning( Mr Hamilton) may be able to afford the increases of sales tax, but the little people, the family men, will be hit hard by such proposals. man cannot dismiss such matters so lightly. I am stating facts. The Treasure^ ( Sir Arthur Eadden) has increased the sales tax on various kinds of cosmetics, and in order that he shall not be accused of discriminating against the womenfolk, he has also increased the sales tax on razor blades aud hair oils. I have been wondering ever since the right honourable gentleman presented his budget to the Parliament whether he and his supporters, when they were children, speculated on what Father Christmas would bring to them, and had their eyes on particular toys. Because some parents, unfortunately, were unable to buy expensive toys for their kiddies, the story had to be invented that Father Christmas simply did not have suflicient of them to satisfy the demand. Next Christmas, parents will be able to inform their children with a scrupulous regard for the truth, not that Father Christmas has not suflicient toys for all, but that the Treasurer had deprived them of the money with which to make the purchases. The Government seems to have gone completely berserk since the defeat of its referendum proposals last month, and is ahle members opposite formerly made great play of the fact that ex-servicemen would be protected when staffs were being retrenched in various departments. Two or three weeks ago, I brought to the notice of the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) the fact that in South Australia ex-servicemen with dependants, who were employed in the transmission section of the General Post Office, were being dismissed, while new Australians were being retained in employment. I do not assert that new Australians should not have jobs. Indeed, I believe it to be our duty to ensure that they shall have employment. But I also believe that the Government should honour the promise that was made to ex-servicemen, particularly as it constantly boasts about what it",39,Budget 1951 52

143,Mr Galvin,"The honorahle gentleintends to do for them. The Postmaster-General investigated my complaint, and although I have not yet received a reply from him, I understand that all the notices of dismissal that were issued to those ex-servicemen in the Postal Department have been withdrawn. I refer to that matter now, because the circumstances show clearly that the Government is ordering dismissals of staff without giving serious thought to the categories of men who are affected by them. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) said that departmental heads, when they recommended the retrenchment of officers, would regard efficiency as the principal consideration. The issue of notices of dismissal to ex-servicemen indicates that departmental heads are taking it for granted that efficiency is the measuring stick. .Some ex-servicemen have had a rough time, and cannot possibly be so efficient as are some of their fellow employees. Because of the Ministerial direction on efficiency, new Australians are being retained in employment, and ex-servicemen are being dismissed. A few weeks ago, 98 technicians in the Postmaster-General's South Australia, whose sole function was to install telephones for subscribers, were dismissed. They had ample work to occupy them, and were, in fact, working overtime. Yet, on the water, coming here from England, are immigrants who have been engaged by the Government under contract for two years, to do the 'same class of work was done by those 98 technicians who have been dismissed. The contracts under which those immigrants will be employed here specify that, after the expiration of two years, they will be engaged as permanent members of the Public Service, or if they are not satisfied with conditions here, their families and themselves may return to England at the expense of the Goverament. The whole idea seems cockeyed to me. The Government is dismissing technicians, and yet is bringing immigrants here as technicians to do similar work. Obviously, the Government is making a token gesture in an effort to convince the people that it is fulfilling its pre-election promise to streamline the Public Service. That is about the only pre-election promise that the Government has even attempted to honour. The Government should exempt from sales tax goods that are purchased by national fitness councils in the various States. At present, the Government makes a grant for national fitness with one hand, but takes away a part of it with the other hand through the medium of the sales tax. All sporting goods are subject to that imposition, and persons who take part in activities that are associated with national fitness are penalized. 'The Government should investigate that anomalous situation. In South Australia, and probably in other States, nurses who are employed by the District and Bush Nursing Society are doing a magnificent job, but, unfortunately, that organization is extremely short of funds. A big appeal is now in progress in South Australia for money to enable that body to carry out its work. For the twelve months ended the 30th June last, 116,479 visits were made by those nurses to persons who, in the main, would have been admitted to hospitals, had beds been available for them. Those people have to be treated at home Department in by district nurses because there is no hospital accommodation for them. The Government would have to contribute towards their treatment if they were in hospitals, and it is being saved expense because there are not enough hospitals in the country. Therefore, I consider that it should earmark a sum of money to be paid as a grant to the society. It would be well advised to consider the proposal favourably. The Treasurer warned the Australian people to expect a shock when the provisions of the budget were disclosed. The warning was not unwarranted. The Government has failed dismally to fulfil the promises that were made in 1949. It pleaded for a fair go in 1951 so that it could honour the undertakings that it had given to the electors. It was given a fair go, but we are still waiting for it to produce the results that it promised to achieve. people. many people left in Australia if it continues to inflict on them such severe",40,Budget 1951 52

He repeated all the hackneyed catch-cries that we have heard in this, chamber so often during the last two years. He completely ignored the serious change in the international situation.

However, he has not taken into account that the previous budget was recast quite a number of times because of changes of the international situation. It is reasonable to assume that when the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden) was preparing the 1950 budget he had in mind reducing taxation. But what happened? In the middle of the preparation news was received of the outbreak of hostilities in Korea. We were then awakened to the fact that the international situation was deadly serious. Yet the right honorahle member for .Barton completely ignored the seriousness of the matter in his very important speech on the budget. It is a matter for amazement that, when he was Minister for External Affairs in the former gentleman completely ignored the defence requirements of this country by refusing to allow the Americans to use Manus Island"".

What a scandalous statement! We were not informed of the details of this budget until it was brought down in the Parliament. Grayndler, who is the Opposition Whip and has had a long experience in the Parliament, was a very close friend of the late Labour leader, Mr Chifley. Prom his statement it would appear to people outside the Parliament that it is customary for honourable memhers to be given pre-knowledge of budget proposals. I do not believe for a moment that that was Mr Chifley's practice, but the complaint, if I may so describe it, of the honourable member for Grayndler that members of the present Government parties were not informed of the f u l l details of this budget until about half an hour before it was presented to the Parliament may cause people outside the Parliament to believe that members of the Australian Labour party received advance information about budgets from Labour Treasurers. Having .regard to the fact that many members of the Opposition are wealthy, the Australian people could not be blamed if they came to the conclusion that those honourable gentleman accumulated their wealth by making use of information of that kind. I do not believe that to he correct, but the grossly irresponsible statement that was made by the honourable member for Grayndler could have the effect of discrediting the memory of the man who was his friend and the party of which he is a member. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) made some very rash statements. He said that the Government's claim that there is a threat of war is only a pretext to enable it to condition people to higher taxes. What an irresponsible statement! Everybody in this country must be made to understand that there is a threat of war and that the Government has a duty to establish our defences upon a proper basis, yet an honourable member who, in a previous medical attention and enjoy other benefits. parliament, was Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker, has tried to raise doubts about that in the minds of the people. The Opposition should accept its responsibility in this matter and should join with the Government in internal position in this country and of the international situation. Much has been said about a reduction of the strength of the Public Service. As The honourable member for far as I can judge, the general public is not opposed to a reduction; but some people fear that injustice may be done to public servants who are within a few years of retirement. I am certain that the Government does not intend to treat any public servants unjustly, and that if any instance of injustice is brought to its notice it will be dealt with. I urge Ministers to ensure, that public servants who have nearly reached retiring age shall not be dismissed from their employment because the strength of the Public Service is heing reduced. The reduction should be effected now, when public servants who are dismissed can obtain other employment. We should not wait until there is a recession and jobs are difficult to get. Eecently the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) issued a challenge to the Opposition to cite instances of public servants who had been dismissed and who had been unable to find other jobs, but that challenge has not been accepted. The Leader of the Opposition, in the course of his speech on the budget, said that other members of the party would amplify some of his statements, but they have not yet done so. It has been stated that the increases of pensions rates are not large enough. They are substantial. Having regard to the benefits that age and invalid pensioners are enjoying to-day, the increases are much greater than those that were made by previous governments. Although some honourable members opposite talked about the relation of pensions to the basic wage, they made no reference to the fact that pensioners now enjoy many privileges that they did not enjoy previously.",44,Budget 1951 52

Those institutions tried for some time to secure the abolition of the tax npon Braille watches, talking books and things of that kind. This Government has acceded to their requests. I believe that the case for exemption was not presented properly in the past, because no government would willingly impose a tax upon articles used by blind people. It has been said that the incidence of sales tax is causing the cost of living to increase, but an examination of the schedules reveals that practically no necessary article is subject to the tax.

179,Mr Gordon Anderson (Kingsford,"the statements that were made by the speakers who preceded them. The Australian people, in common with people all over the world, are not sure of just where they are going. Civilization to-day is at the crossroads. While we are fiddling, as Nero fiddled in Borne many years ago, our civilization is burning because we are not prepared to give to it the attention that it deserves. The members of this Parliament should endeavour to l if t this debate to a much higher level. Throughout the world the ordinary men and women are losing confidence in their leaders, and have every reason for doing so. In consequence, they are changing their forms of government. The reaction of the average Australian, when called upon to support a budget such as that presented by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) is to ask himself how sincere are this Government and Parliament. If he has listened to the broadcast of the proceedings to-day, I shudder to think what his verdict will be. We have had the spectacle of memhers of the Government claiming, and endeavouring to support the claim by means of figures, that in a time of buoyant revenue expenditure should be reduced, and that a time of depression is the appropriate time to increase expenditure in order to strengthen the morale of the people and the economic stability of the country. Some honourable members are sufficiently advanced in^years to remember that earlier in our history private enterprise failed the nation. At that time, decent Australians, through no fault of their own, could not find employment. The political predecessors of this Government were in control of this Parliament. Men and women were allowed to starve. Yet, the workers of to-day are being asked by this Government to regard it as.being sincere when it suggests that in times of depression governments should use national credit to expand the economy. A statement has been circulating recently whicli draws a comparison between the income tax payable now and that payable during World War II . The income figure cited is £500, on which income tax of £39 is now payable. During the war it was £136. What the statement does not point out, and what any one who understands figures will appreciate, is that £500 to-day has only the same value as £250 had during World War II . The basic wage at that time was less than £5 a week, on which sum the worker paid income tax of approximately £36. I suggest that this wonderful statement is, therefore, merely evidence of the antiworking class, nature of this Government. It is obviously a rich man's Government. Government supporters interjecting, preciate the interjections that have been made. WhilstI have not been a member of this Parliament for very long, I have dealt with many of the people whom honourable members opposite represent, and I know that as soon as one touches upon something which interferes with their profits or the profits of the banking institutions, those honourable members try to howl one down, not only by means of .direct interjections and statements in newspapers, but also by means of broadcasts from the radio stations which those whom they represent control. Many young honourable members opposite have not been out in industry and know nothing of the men who work in transport undertakings, in factories and in workshops but they do their job in this Parliament as paid representatives of big commercial enterprises. It was of some small comfort to me when the honorahle member for Gwydir( Mr Treloar) asked that sympathy be shown to those old members of the Public Service who have given a lifetime of service to the people of this country, and that they be not cast aside. Some honourable members opposite, however, who have become representatives during recent years, never fail to miss an opportunity to decry the Public Service. For many years I was an employee of the New South Wales Department of Railways and I also spent a considerable number of years in the Commonwealth Public Service. I ask any Minister to tell me how far he would go if it were not for the well-informed and experienced public servants who supply to him information concerning everything with which he deals. Many members of the Government are not prepared to admit that the Public Service is worth anything at all. They forget that in years gone by",46,Budget 1951 52
180,Mr Gordon Anderson,"I apmany public servants sacrificed a great deal during the depression when the ground was cut from under their feet. They stuck to the Service because it was their career, and they hoped that they would be dealt with decently by the people of Australia. Accordingly they declined offers of higher positions. I remind honourable members opposite that in order to become a puhlic servant it is necessary to attain a certain educational and intelMay of this year the basic wage had risen lectual standard. Having seen and heard the conduct of some honourable members opposite during this debate, I am confident that many of them could not attain rhat standard. I suggest that they are envious of the public servants and demonstrate their vindictiveness when r.hey speak of sacking 10.000 of them. What a fine administrative stroke is the dismissal of those 10,000 public servants! With a budget which provides for the expenditure of almost £1,000,000,000, the Government has decided that £5,000,000 diall be saved by the dismissal of 10,000 employees. I contend that that decision is a reflection upon the intelligence and the administrative ability of the Government. A great deal is heard in this Parliament concerning the failure of the various State transport systems, but not so much was heard of that matter during World War II . At that time, the equipment of State undertakings such as railways, water, sewerage and drainage, and main roads was co-opted by the Australian Government for defence purposes. Not only in Australia was such equipment used on important works, such as the building of a road from north to south of the continent, but it was also successfully used on large construction works throughout the Pacific area. The State governments thus helped to defend the property of those who had investments in this country. To-day, those people feel safe. Regardless of the war talk indulged in by members of the Government, I suggest that they appreciate that no nation could land in Austral a a : sufficiently large number of. troops to cause great damage to us at the moment. For that reason they begin to knock down the undertakings which served them well in previous years. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. Mr Gordon Anderson. figures relating to the hasic wage as far back as 1907, which prove my contention that the workers are to be more heavily taxed than they were in the war years. I shall not go as far back as that date however. In May, 1943, the basic wage in New South Wales was £4 16s. A man who earned that amount of money then paid £36 14s. in tax annually. By to £8 16s. a week. Under the latest tax schedule a man who earns that amount will have to pay £33 in direct tax in addition to the increased amounts that he will have to pay in indirect taxes. The incidence of indirect taxation is such that it falls most heavily on the family man who has to spend about 99 per cent, of his earnings on foodstuffs, clothing, rent and other articles that are subject to sales tax and excise. Several speakers on the Government side have referred to the transport position, particularly in States in which Labour governments are in office. During the war State utilities, particularly railways, were used to a great degree by the Australian Government for the purposes of war. Because of that use the rolling stock and other equipment of the various railways systems of the Commouwealth deteriorated. It could not be replaced during the war and now the burden of replacing it has been foisted on the States. I do not suggest that the rolling-stock should not have been used for defence purposes during the war, but cognizance should be taken of these facts when criticism is levelled at the transportauthorities of the States. We hear a lot ibout how badly the State departments of \ransport do their job. I shall not admit that any private transport undertaking is doing its job any better than the State transport authorities are doing theirs. I know that a harbour ferry company in Sydney, which had been making huge profits for a large number of years, had to get out of business because of the increasing difliculties associated with transport undertakings nowadays. It handed the baby over to the New South Wales Government. That has always been the case so far as transport is concerned. Many years ago I was employed in a railways branch, the main purpose of",47,Budget 1951 52
181,Mr Gordon Anderson,"I havewhich was accounting and collating statistical information. In order to offset criticism of the New South ""Wales railways such as we have heard in this chamber to-day, we had occasion to discover why our critics could cite the great profits made by private railway systems in Canada and the United States of America. Investigation proved that, whilst these private companies were making profits, in that their working expenses were less than their revemies, much of the revenues came, not from their transport activities, hut from assets that hacl been given to them by governments in the past in order to encourage them to build railways out .through great unexploited territories. The companies later made huge profits from the sale of timber and mineral rights on those properties and also from the sale of portions of the properties. They were thus able to increase their revenues and to show profits that were gained quite apart from their transport activities. We also found that American ancl Canadian governments of the past had involved themselves for many years ahead in huge mail contracts which were given to private railway companies to make their initial expenditure outlay of capital a more attractive investment. There is, therefore, a marked difference between the private railway system of North America and the State-owned systems of Australia. Before Australian railways were built large tracts of land in the Commonwealth had been given by the British Government to certain individuals as grants. Later on with the development of railway transport money had to be borrowed to buy land for the railway systems to pass over. As a result land which had been cheap increased in value overnight and the owners received large amounts of unearned increment. That is one of the reasons why to-day the State-owned railways of Australia cannot show the same bright financial results as privately owned railways elsewhere can show. I have been associated with railways during my whole working life and I have found that they are staffed by decent Australians who are ready to sacrifice a great deal for this country. But all that those decent men get, from young fellows who have been elected to sit in this chamber and who have neither the ability nor the intelligence to run a railway system is criticism of a kind that I should like to throw back in the teeth of those who voiced it. I should not like to see what would happen to the railways if they had control of them. A Government supporter who represents a Western Australian electorate said to-day that myxomatosis was killing off rabbits in such numbers that dingoes and foxes could find no native food in the bush and were being forced to come into the town areas in his electorate where they ate poultry and domestic refuse. I think that some dingoes have penetrated into Canberra, to judge from the howls and yowls that I have heard and also from the lack of intelligence of many of the remarks that I have noted. This afternoon we had an outrageous attack by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) on the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), who was not in the chamber at the time. That attack was not confined to the Leader of the Opposition, but was extended to cover his family, including his brother, his nephew, and others. The evidence that was produced about the alleged association of the brother of the Leader of the Opposition with Communists and Communist-controlled organizations could only have come from the brain of a man whose intellect is so warped by totalitarianism that he knows no better than to make such an attack. That honourable member applied insulting adjectives to the Leader of the Opposition, who has played his part in our judiciary and in the political world, and has also represented Australia internationally for a. number of years ar the United Nations. I do not think that we should have to suffer such insults hurled by men who were unknown until they were accidentally elected to this Parliament two years ago. It seems remarkable to me that older men on the front Government benches, and members ancl ex-members of the Cabinet, some of whom have been honoured with titles from the King, should listen without protest to one of their younger colleagues insulting a man of such acknowledged reputation as the Leader of the Opposition. The CHAIEMAN -Order! The honourable member must refer to other members of the eommittee as honourable members. they still are honourable men, but their behaviour does not suggest it. This talk about communism just rolls off me. I have spent a good deal of my life fighting communism in my own State, as any one who knows anything about me is well aware. I congratulate the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) on his maiden speech. It was a very fine effort, and my only objection to it is that it followed closely the old conservative pattern. For instance, he asked what hardship would be inflicted by shifting a man from one job to another. Perhaps it would not matter much to a professional man or business man, but it could mean a great deal to a public servant who had spent many years equipping himself for a particular job in the Service. The transferring of that man to another job, perhaps in another town or State, would mean loss of promotion for him, and separation for him and for his wife and family from the friends and associations they had formed. It might also mean giving up a home from which he was reluctant to part. Thus, it can he a real hardship to a working man, even though he be a mere public servant, to force him to change jobs, and it. cannot be justified merely because the Government wishes to save a paltry £5,000,000 on a £1,000,000,000 budget. When a man asks what hardship can it inflict on a worker to have to give up his job he reveals his outlook and background. The asking of such a question indicates all too clearly I'benefit, which has not increased by Id. what the workers could expect if some honourable members opposite were in complete control of the economy of the country. The working man is entitled to consideration, but he has received very little from the framers of the budget, as is shown by just one item, the licence-fee on radios. Hitherto, the licence-fee was £1 for the first radio receiving set, and 10s. for every additional set owned by a householder. The extra 10s. did not worry the average working man, who was lucky if he could afford one set. Now, the fee for a single receiving set has been increased to £2, and no extra fee is charged for additional sets. I suppose -most Government supporters have a big receiving set in the home, a set in the oar, and if there is a family, a couple of mantel models as well, yet the total licence-fee payable by them is £2, the same as the worker pays. That provision is an example of class bias. The honourable member for Lyne( Mr Eggins) was at least honest. I give him credit for honesty when he told us that in his opinion currency inflation was the result of the 40-hour week. That is the opinion to which we wish to pin the Government. We know that the Government is opposed to the 40-hour week. During the last sessional period, the Government brought in three bills, the purpose of which was to weaken the trade unions so that the workers would not be in a position to resist an attack on their working conditions. I thank the honourable member for Lyne for being honest enough to tell us what is in the mind of the Government. The honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) said that he did not like inflation, but that, after all, immigration was a form of inflation, and that we had to put up with the inconvenience of inflation in order to get immigrants. Well, why not put up with a little more inflation so that the workers may get a fair deal? If inflation may he accepted as an unavoidable result of immigration, it may also be accepted as an unavoidable condition of improving the lot of the worker. The Government should consider increasing the unemployment and sickness since it was first instituted. UntilI entered tliis Parliament I had been associated with the administration of the unemployment and sickness benefit in a large district, and I know that the most deserving people sometimes have to accept sickness benefit. Of course, in these times of full employment, there is little call upon the unemployment benefit fund. The law provides that a man who qualifies for sickness benefit may receive 25s. a week. If he is married he may receive an additional £1 a week in respect of his wife, and 5s. for the first child, making a total of £2 10s.",48,Budget 1951 52

It serves no purpose to offer a series of contradictory propositions as a criticism of the Government's proposals. The Leader of the Opposition opposed a decrease in departmental expenditure and apparently, from his remarks, he wishes that expenditure to be increased. He wants no increase in taxation. He wants no increase in State works. He wants no increase in the interest rate on public loans.

He could have said that the interest rate should be increased to the extent necessary to attract had to deal. But if, as the Government has £200,000,000 or £300,000,000 more loan money which would have obviated the necessity for any increase of taxation and have given the States and the Government all the loan money that they legitimately needed for essential purposes.

The Government would not have accepted that proposition, but it would have been tenable. All those suggestions would have represented a constructive and critical approach to this budget, but the right honourable member did not make any of them. He only presented a series of contradictory propositions. A budget is a reflection of all of a country's problems expressed in financial terms. Any honourable member could solve a few of those problems if he had only a few to solve. He could solve the pensions problem, the Northern Territory problem, or perhaps a half dozen other problems if they were the only ones with which lie to do, he had to solve a hundred problems at the same time and find the necessary money he would be subject to a test of statesmanship. If that is the test of statesmanship on the part of the Government, the test of statesmanship on the part of the Leader of the Opposition is to demonstrate how much better the joh might be done.

It is true that the price of wool did fall for a short period during the opening sales but it rose again and has since continued to rise. It is also true that after a magnificent succession of wonderful harvests the production of wheat and sugar dropped slightly, but the drop will not be anything approaching what the right honourable gentleman would have wished to support his argument. Bargain sales in a few city stores probably led him to believe that merchants and the big stores were throwing their merchandise out in the belief that the purchasing power of the people would diminish overnight. There was also a temporary fall in share quotations on the stock exchange but prices revived almost immediately after the budget was presented. These matters must hav6 occupied the right honourable gentleman's mind to make him saj' the rather dreadful things he said in the course of his speech, unless, of course, they were said solely for political propaganda purposes. In ease any person may believe his statement that this budget is a blueprint for a. depression let me canvass briefly the factors that militate .against its truth. I do not believe that many persons, outside my mythical individual, would absorb such propaganda. What are the factors that militate against the truth of the right honourable gentleman's statement? The first is the enormous increase in the incomes of individuals throughout Australia which, in 1950-51, amounted to £S00,000,000 more than in the preceding year. increase in the incomes of individuals is still working through the Australian economy and has by no means yet worked itself out. That factor alone operates against the likelihood of a recession of even a moderate kind. The next factor is the volume of defence expenditure which is very considerable and is constantly increasing and is likely still further to increase in the years immediately ahead. Thirdly, despite appreciable cuts in loan raisings, the Commonwealth and the States have in hand enor.mous works programmes which [ believe are larger now than ever before in our history. Fourthly, rearmament programmes are proceeding at a terrific pace in friendly overseas countries, particularly in the Mother Country and the United States of America, and they will carry with them equivalent demands for raw materials and foodstuffs for as far ahead as any one can see. Lastly, there is the constant and large annual increase of the Australian population which results in a continual increase in the demand for goods and services. I do not think that the right honourable gentleman seriously believes that the Australian people will agree with him that the budget is a blueprint for a depression. Mir. Curtin -The people believed him on the 22nd September when they voted on the referendum proposals. is born every minute. When this budget is considered without political prejudice Australians with their cold common sense will concede that it demonstrates the belief of the Government that there is no prospect of a financial or economic depression. I do not think that I need do otherwise than give the Leader of the Opposition credit for sharing that belief. Australia, in common with other democratic countries, is experiencing an inflationary trend which gives pause to every thoughtful Australian apart from its effect upon his pocket and upon his well-being. The budget is one of the many instruments that the Governinent is employing to counter the evil of inflation. In those days the main accent of the Government's activities is on measures to counter inflation. In the democracies inflation is not onlj' anti-social in its effects That enormous but is also a weapon of war on tbe side of international communism. It is the worse enemy of defence preparations. Accordinglj', every individual in the community, irrespective of his political party affiliations, should endeavour to combat it. What weapons have we to employ, and how are we using them to cope with inflation? First, we have selective credit restriction, through the banking system, which has the twofold purpose of halting inflation and diverting men, money and materials from non-essential to essentia] industries. Secondly, we have adopted selective curtailment of capital issues for the same purpose. selective curtailment of credit?",52,Budget 1951 52

' I do not criticize -the last Lahour Government, because it was not oblivious to the needs of other countries generous than is this Government. is so. This amount of about £10,000,000, which it it proposed to give to the countries of South and South-East Asia, is a unique item in any Australian budget. The total sum is made up as follows:Economic development under the Colombo plan, £8,750,000. Eelief on the technical side of the plan, at least £200,000. United Nations technical assistance £50,000. United Nations children's relief £250,000. International relief for Korea £500,000. Palestine relief £156,000. Those sums total £9,906,000, which is to be applied largely to the countries immediately to the north and north-west of Australia. That is, to countries that have an immediate geographical, and so political, and so defence, relationship with Australia to-day, and will have those relationships with us in the future. They are countries in which the people have very low standards of living. Unless these low standards are raised, they will tend to foster subversion and communism. The Government is doing its best to combat the tendency to subversive action by raising the standards of living among the people of South and South-East Asia. The United States has given the world a great lead in this regard. Other countries, such as Canada, are making great efforts in the field of international relief. The percentage of bhe national income that the United States, Canada, Australia, France and others are devoting to international relief can be calculated. The United States is devoting about 2£ per cent, of its national income to relief, both civil and defence. That is a total that we, with our small resources, cannot hope to equal. [15] However, within the limits of our wealth we are doing quite well for our friends -to the north. I have not time to describe in detail how our money is to be allocated to different countries, or to particular activities, other than to say that we are putting into operation the various parts of the Colombo plan, both economic and technical, with all the vigour of which we are capable. I seek new formis of initiative, and I invite the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) to -tell me either in public or in private any directions of which he is aware in which we can exercise further initiative and help our friends of South and South-East Asia towards mutually beneficial ends. On some other occasion I shall take an opportunity to describe in detail what we have been doing in the past. The Colomlbo plan has been in existence for only three or four months; nevertheless, we have anticipated the coimlmencement of the plan and have already made relatively large gifts of wheat, flour, equipment and technical assistance to all the countries that are parties to the plan and to some other countries which have not formally joined it, but which I hope will later be able to join. I speak of Indonesia, Indo China, Thailand and other countries to our immediate north. They are all nations that mean something to us because of our geographical propinquity. Minister's time has expired. [8.49] -The very curious speech just mlade by'the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), in which he has succeeded in voicing a number of criticisms of his own Government's budget by placing them in the form of an imaginary speech from the Opposition side of the chamber, makes it proper to examine sorrie of the defences that the Government has put forward of its budget proposals. To the question: ""What crime have the people committed that they must be punished so heavily in this budget? the Government answers that it must take the money from the people because the people cannot be trusted with it.

201,Mr Allan Fraser (Eden,"Monaro)leaders were begging tbe people to trust them. They asked the people to trust them, as the servants of the people, to carry out the people's wishes, to reduce taxes, lower prices, and abolish controls. How swiftly the mask is dropped once its purpose is served and power and the treasury bench have beeu gained.' Now the Government turns on the people and says, "" We are not your servants; we are your masters. You gave us your trust, but we shall not trust you. We shall break every pledge that we made to you. We shall raise taxes, not reduce them; we shall increase prices, not lower them; we shall not abolish controls, we shall intensify them"". The statement has been published that the Government are drawing some small comfort from the fact that letters of protest against this budget from their constituents are not so numerous as might have been expected, but is that not really a sign which a conscientious member of the Parliament should view with some concern? enough to an honorahle member in whom they have confidence, but when they lose confidence in an honourable meinber, they do not write to him because they consider that it would be a waste of time to do so. Regardless of the merits or demerits of this budget, it is such a glaring breach of solemn pledges made to the people only a few weeks ago, that it has undermined popular confidence in statements of public men ancl by so doing, it has played right into the hands of those wretched forces that would destroy our British parliamentary system, a prospect which, to some Government'supporters, I believe, is not entirely displeasing. They are fascist in tendency and sympathy, and have no real desire to see our British parliamentary system maintained. As leader of the Australian Labour surely have warded off the mounting party, and as Prime Minister, the inflation last year and would have late Mr Chifley set himself against saved us from our present troubles, making glittering promises to the yet the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) people which could not be honoured. last year produced a budget exactly That may have been a substantial factor the opposite of this one.

Out of evil cometh good, and if there be any value in the melancholy events in which the Government has been concerned, it may be that the electors have become tired of being fooled and rightly suspicious of the showy cheapjacks and plausible tricksters of the political trade. That will be shown at the next election. The CHAIEMAN -Order! Is the honourable member making imputations against the Government? making imputations at all. In the meanback-benchers time, the task of the Labour party, while rightly assailing this unjust budget, is to avoid pretending to the people that benefits can be provided for them without payment; that taxes can be substantially reduced while expenditure is substantially increased; or that there is any road to national prosperity except the path of People will write quickly hard work and united effort. Any government that had to face the dreadful economic mess into which this country has been permitted to drift in the last two years, would have had to introduce an unpopular budget at this stage-bu t not this budget. The very defences of this budget which the Government now puts forward constitute a most damning indictment of the Government's own record. The Government declares that budgeting for a surplus of £100,000,000 or £200,000,000 is essential to counter inflation. If that be true now, it was also true last year when the inflationary storm was mounting, and surely that was the time to counter it, before its full injury could be wreaked on the community. If surplus budgeting now can defeat the full fury of inflation, it would more",55,Budget 1951 52
202,Mr Alla N Feaseb,"I am nottime. Instead, lie deliberately budgeted, not for a surplus at all, but for a deficit of more than £90,000,000 which he made up by grabbing from a few thousand wool growers a levy which represented, at the best, taxes that they were not due to pay until this year. From the general community he took £90,000,000 less than he spent, and, on his own argument to-day, that deficit budget of 1950-51 must have been the most powerful single factor in intensifying the inflationary storm from which vve are now suffering. Buti f last year's budget he inexcusable in the light of the economic doctrines advanced by the Treasurer on this occasion, how much less excuse can be found for the policy on which the Government fought the election as recently as April of this year when the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), with the support of the Treasurer and of all his Ministers, declared that the issues were exactly the same as they had been in 1949-reduce d taxes, lower prices, and the abolition of controls? The Bourbon kings are credited with haviug learned nothing and forgotten nothing. Ministers of this Government differ from the Bourbons in that if they learned anything, at least they acknowledged. But they could not repeat were determined to keep it secret until after the election; but they did agree in accepting the dictum of Madame Pompadour to Louis XV., quoted by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Commonwealth has so used overriding Calwell) last week, ""Afte r us, the deluge "". The leaders of this Government may escape the deluge, as, indeed, I believe they will, to the sanctuary of the High Court bench and the security of ambassadorial positions overseas, but for the rank and file of their deluded parliamentary followers their awaits only the wrath to come. Another defence of this budget is that the heavy tax exactions which it proposes are needed for arms, and to prepare this country for entry into another world war by 1953. According to the Sunday Herald, Ministers are counting on an outbreak of war before the next election to divert the people's attention from the injustices of this budget. If that be correct, it is a dreadful attitude indeed. Whatever Ministers may want, the people of Australia want peace, and they want their Government to pursue the path of peace and friendship with all other peoples of the earth. They know the lesson of history that the piling of armaments inevitably produces the very war which it is supposed to avert. The strength and security of Australia cannot repose in guns, tanks, aircraft and bombs. The future of Australia must repose in its families, in its children, in the growth of its population, in the development of its resources, and in its industry and transport systems. This budget, which purports to be for defence, strikes hard at every one of those things. It discourages the family, it makes harder the task of rearing children, it slows down development of resources, it will destroy a number of industries, and it neglects the maintenance of our transport system which has so deteriorated as to represent our gravest weakness in defence to-day. Our roads and our railways are the foundations on which our whole defence system must rest. Yet they were never in so parlous a condition as they are at present. In the recent war the railways performed a magnificent service for Australia, which has since been everywhere that service if they were called upon to do so to-day. priorities that the railways are short of steel, cement, bricks and rolling-stock. The condition of railway tracks has become so bad that it is stated on expert authority to be already unsafe in some sections. For instance, whereas 40 men should be employed on maintenance and bridge repair work between Canberra and Cooma only ten men are employed on that section, whilst at times the number has fallen as low as eight. Even on the Commonwealth's own line, the small section between Canberra and Queanbeyan, the condition of the track is well below accepted standards. The roads of Australia are in an even worse condition. They could not stand up to the requirements of defence in war. The surface is worn away, and patching and grading cannot replace it. An example which could be multiplied many times is the",56,Budget 1951 52

That is a recognized alternative route to a main defence highway, hut it is now entirely incapable of carrying heavy traffic. These are defence tasks to which the Commonwealth should he giving first priority. Otherwise, much else that is being done is in vain. The Commonwealth should be co-operating with the States in a giant attack on the problems of our transport system. By doing so it would promote the peaceful development of Australia, and at the same time place the nation in a state of readiness to meet a possible invasion. Another defence of this budget that Government members have advanced frequently in this debate is that an immense surplus must be accumulated by levying taxes on the people in order to finance State public works programmes to the degree that the loan market will fail to supply the year's programme of £225,000,000. I shall deal with that argument. there is very little chance of investors subscribing that amount to Commonwealth loans during the present year. But why should this be so? In previous years the people of Australia, over and over again, filled the security loans in response to government appeals. There has heen no failure so far on the part of the Australian people in this respect. There is not a town hall, or the tiniest our. would not ameliorate the income means back shire office, which does not proudly display the pennons awarded in recognition of unfailing loan achievements. This is the first government since the beginning of the recent war that has been obliged to admit that it cannot persuade the pepple to fill its loan quotas. That is an indictment not of the people who have never failed in this task before, hut of a government that has so destroyed public confidence and enjoys so little public support, that even at a time of bounding surplus purchasing power, to use the Treasurer's own words, it cannot carry out a loan programme. The causes of the Government's failure are not far to seek. It has destroyed confidence by breaking its pledges to the people. It has permitted inflation to develop until the people have lost faith in the future value Mr l.llan Fraser. of their savings in government bonds. It has juggled interest rates in such a way as to cause heavy loss to all those who even in the last year or so continued loyally to support its loans. And it has failed to amend the social services means test even in terms of present money purchasing values, and so has dealt a most deadly penalizing blow at all who would practise care and thrift and save for their retirement. The so-called liberalizing of the property means test in this budget is entirely illusory. It merely extends the upward limit to accord with the new money terms in which the age pension is expressed. The pension at £3 wil! purchase no more than it did at £2 10s. twelve months ago, and, similarly, the upward property limit of £1,000 will enable a pensioner to hold property of no more value to him than £750 did previously. But while this nominal readjustment is made at the top of the means test scale no readjustment at all It nuust be accepted that is made at the bottom. The pensioner still loses exactly as much pension hecause he possesses, say, £150 as he did when £150 was worth twice what it is worth to-day. Similarly, with respect to the permissible income test, the Government has utterly failed the pensioner, and has betrayed every trust that was placed in its promises to ameliorate the means test. Eveni f .the Government test at least it had an elementary duty to re-express the permissible income figures in terms of present-day purchasing power. On whatever other ground the Government may be defended, the fact that it has not performed even this act of common justice for people who have provided a few pounds towards the cost of their own maintenance in retirement is an eternal reproach to the Government. During the terms of office of the Curtin and Chifley Governments, the Australian Labour party progressively increased the permissible income of a single pensioner from 12s. 6d. a week to £1 a week, and later, to 30s. a week. That was a real increase that was made at a time when there was some stability in money values. But far from continuing the process of increase with the ultimate objective of abolishing the means test, the present Government, at a time when prices have continued to increase during the last two years, has allowed the permissible income to remain at 30s. although 30s. will now buy far less than it did then. The result is that the Government has undone what 1 the Labour Government did towards abolishing the means test, and the test to-day, in terms of money values, is more rigid and harsh than it has been at any time since the pension system was established. Is it any wonder that people are not prepared to save towards their old age? Is it any wonder that they are no longer willing to invest their savings in Commonwealth bonds? In showing itself to be the enemy of thrift the Government is injuring the nation. However, the defence that the Governsurplus should be applied. As the Leader ment puts forward that it is correctly of the Opposition has pointed out, this using the budget as an instrument of does not necessarily follow automatically. economic policy to draw off surplus purThe Treasurer may have adopted a chasing power is the most interesting good theory, hut to base it merely on defence of all.

For example, the Treasurer declares in his speech that it is a vital corollary of credit expansion and deficit budgeting in a financial depression that, in a period of boom, or inflation, the reverse measures of credit restriction and budgeting for a surplus should be applied! I am most interested to learn that the right honourable gentleman accepts that economic theory which was put forward by the Labour party fbr so many years. Now in retrospect, he accepts it as having been the correct measure in a financial depression. But he says that the vital corollary of it is that in a period of boom, or inflation, the reverse measures of credit restriction and budgeting for a glad to doso.

There is no difficulty at all in ascertaining tion he should draw off the surplus spendwho has too mjuch money to-day. Yet the Treasurer is not drawing it away from those persons. Instead, he is drawing it away from., or rather is gouging it out of, every one else. This budget certainly follows the injunctionTo him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be taken away, even that which he hath. The cruellest feature of inflation, as we all have learned in the past two years, is that while it enriches a section, it impoverishes most people. It increases inequalities in the distribution of wealth. It tends to make the rich richer, and the poor poorer. As the value of the £1 has declined, so all those who have to live on a fixed number of pounds have become progressively worse off. This budget makes their plight still worse. In this number are included all those persons on fixed salaries and incomes, the great mass of salary and. wage earners, and pensioners, whose rates are subject to some adjustment but only after prices have already risen. At the other end of the scale, inflation in Australia has meant new wealth and greater wealth-in some instances colossal wealth-to a section of people. The section adversely affected by the budget includes the man in receipt of a small income, who is desperate at the progressive shrinking of his purchasing power,-the housewife, who is at her wit's end to huy food and clothing for her children, and the pensioner, who is already suffering real physical hardship. The other section includes those who benefit from such matters as record company profits, soaring dividends, repeated bonus issues, brazen profiteering, black marketing, huge bets on the racecourse, £5,000 paid for a yearling, monev poured out in night club celebrations, frocks at 150 guineas each, and shoes at 25 guineas a pair. The average Australian families, which constitute the great majority of the people, are entirely separated from that world. They know it only from the advertisements, the stories and the Mr Allan Fraser. pictures in the Sunday papers. It is the hard pressed family that the Treasurer should protect and assist whilst from those who have gained immense wealth by inflaing power. Yet not one proposal in this budget is aimed specifically at that section. Indeed, every measure which arises from it is aimed directly at the average family. That the Government should wish to protect the wealthy. interests which it so faithfully represents is natural enough. But by what strange and inverted logic does it reach the conclusions that are embodied in its new tax proposals? I summarize them, as follows:-(1 ) That every one, rich and poor alike, can afford exactly the same percentage income tax increase; (2) that special taxes should be aimed at the family by heavy sales tax imposts even on toys and ice-cream and the sweets that children huy; (3) that the mother must be punished by new and heavy imposts if she dares endeavour to obtain a refrigerator or a washing machine, or any of the labour-saving devices that can lighten her work in rearing a family; (4) that excess purchasing power is drawn off fairly if an extra £10 a year is taken by excise from the worker on the beer and tobacco, which are his modest pleasures, and exactly the same amount a year in excise from the man who has 100 times that worker's income; (5) that it is proper to impose new heavy taxes on the beers consumed at the corner pub, yet to exempt the champagne and the sparkling wine of the night club celebration from any new tax at all. orable-member's time has expired. common with other members of tbe Opposition, the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) has almost persuaded me that this is a purely Labour-socialist budget. Many factors tend to support such a suggestion. When the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) presented the budget to this chamber, Opposition memhers were given a great lead in the attack upon the Government by certain sections of the press, and I think that many members of the public were awaiting with a certain gloating anticipation the devastating onslaught",59,Budget 1951 52

208,Mr Freeth (Forrest) [9.19],"I nthat would be unleashed upon us. But the Labour party has launched a rather confused and disordered kind of attack. In _ one breath, honourable gentlemen opposite praise the Treasurer for having budgeted for a surplus, as a Labour government would have done had it been in office, and, in the next breath they suggest that there are many ways in which the budget could be improved, such as by expending more money here and economizing there. This idea is supported by a study of United Kingdom budgets of the last few years. As honorahle members know, the Labour socialists in Great Britain use their budgets for two purposes apart from the primary purpose of providing hard cash for the ordinary busiuess of government. They use their budgets, first, for a social purpose. Over a period of years they have deliberately set out to destroy accumulated fortunes, to break up large estates, and to redistribute the wealth of the community. They use them, secondly, for the purpose of achieving some sort of economic stability. In Australia, when we find that our Government produces exactly the same sort of budget as has been produced in the United Kingdom, there is some danger of confusing the two objectives. When the honourable member for Eden-Monaro says that this Government taxes only the common family man and pays no attention to the rich and the enormously high prices that are paid for certain classes of goods, he seems to overlook completely such articles as furs and jewellery, which are subject to sales tax at the rate of 66§ per cent. That is one of the indirect taxes that the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) has attacked so vigorously, and it is applied to such goods according to a steeply graduated scale. By levying such severe taxes on luxury goods, is this Government following in the footsteps of the' Lahour socialists in the United Kingdom, who even now are on the hustings with their rallying-cry of ""Soak the rich""? I believe that many people in Australia are ready to attack the Government on account of this budget, not hecause it is a Liberal budget, but because it discloses certain tendencies that are reflected in Labour socialist budgets. For that reason, it is important to emphasize the value of the budget as a means of achieving economic stability. When one studies the speeches of Sir Stafford Cripps on the budgets that he has introduced in the United Kingdom Parliament, one might well imagine the same words being uttered by the Australian Treasurer. For example, in his budget speech for 1949-50, Sir Stafford Cripps saidLast year it was onr avowed objective to counter any existing inflationary pressure as to which there was no doubt, and bring about a comfortable and more excessive degree of disinflation. ThisI think we have succeeded in doing largely as a result of the considerable budget surplus which was planned last year and has been realized in the last three months . . . The main object of the budget surplus last year was to raise enough revenue to cover not only Government current expenditure but also that part of theinvestment programme which could not be safely left to be financed by private savings. Au exactly parallel situation has arisen in Australia. Honourable members opposite have attacked the Government for having budgeted for a surplus. That has been the consistent aim of the Lahour Government in the United Kingdom in recent years as the evidence clearly shows. In 1947-48, the United Kingdom Treasury achieved a budget surplus of £636,000,000. In 1948-49, the surplus was £684,000,000, in 1949-50 it was £518,000,000, and in 1950-51 it was £441,000,000. The budget for the current financial year, with a new Treasurer in office, provides for a surplus of a mere £224,000,000. Those figures represent a total surplus, deliberately planned over a period of years, amounting to £2,504,000,000. Honourable members opposite apparently do not believe us, and therefore I refer them to the views on budget surpluses that have been expressed by Sir Stafford Cripps. either. that. I do not think that the English people will believe him any longer. This is what he saidSome restatement of our general economic policy as affecting the budget is therefore necessary especially this year when we have recently passed through a general election. It is our unquestionable duty to avoid the twin evils of inflation and deflation. This we can only do by maintaining a balance between",60,Budget 1951 52
209,Mr Mullens,"We do not believe him,",61,Budget 1951 52
210,Mr Feeeth,"I am pleased to hear the amount of goods and services the nation seeks to buy and the amount which can be produced wben the labour force is at present f u l l y employed. Excessive demand produces inflation, and inadequate demand results in deflation. The fiscal policy of the Government is tlie most important single instrument for maintaining that balance. On the one hand Government spending swells tlie total of national expenditure, both directly through current purchases of goods and services, and indirectly through social security payments and the like by adding to the incomes and spending power of private individuals'. On the other hand taxation by drawing off part of the incomes of persons and business firms reduces their spending power and therefore the total of private expenditure. The difference between Government revenue and expenditure-i.e. , tlie budget surplus or deficitmembers are fully aware, Labour had a gives an indication of the direction in which fiscal policy is influencing the level of total demand. The problem may alternatively be looked at from a more technical standpoint-that of investment and savings. If total demand is not to be excessive then not only must Government expenditure be covered by revenue, but also the nation must be willing to hold back from spending on consumption an amount equal to that which it proposes to spend as investment. In other words, spending on capital account must be balanced by savings on income account. If the voluntary savings of individuals and firms are insufficient, then the Government must itself make up the deficiency in the nation's savings by accumulating a budget surplus, which in effect lielps to pay for capital not have dared to budget for a surplus development. Clearly since saving is the opposite of spendenvisaging a surplus last year.' In any ing to say that a budget surplus is necessary to remedy a deficiency in saving is simply to restate the earlier proposition that a surplus is necessary to curb excessive spending. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) apparently believes that this Government has budgeted for an excessive surplus. Using his imagination to the fullest degree-and, after listening to his speeches in the recent referendum campaign, we must agree that he has a very fertile managed to calculate by some means that we might have a budget surplus -of between £300,000,000 and £350,000,000 tiiis year. That was a most interesting calculation because, not very long afterwards, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, told the committee with an air of great assurance that the Government's anticipated surplus would vanish by next June. Honourable Mr Freeth. members opposite, had they been in office at this time, would have introduced exactly the same kind of budget as the Treasurer has introduced. Therefore, they experience difficulty in finding a precise and detailed method of criticizing the Government's plans. I agreed with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro on one matter that he raised, and that was about the only common ground that I could find. The honourable member declared that a budget such as the one that we are now considering should have been introduced last year, when the inflationary pressure was about as severe as it is now. As honourable numerical majority in the Senate at the time. It would have used every possible means to embarrass this Government, to the point of rejecting a budget, if its members thought that they would have the slightest chance of achieving electoral success. Had we introduced a budget of this kind, and had the present Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members opposite used their imagination to the same degree as they did recently, it is quite possible that Labour would have been returned to oflice. Had that happened, Labour would this year after objecting to a budget event, we can agree that it would have been quite impossible for either political party to budget for a surplus last year. Although the premises of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro were sound, he must not lose sight of the political difficulties that were present on that occasion. I have stated that this budget has many ingredients of a socialist budget. I and vivid imagination-he would hate to think that people who have previously supported this Government would prefer to support an outright Labour socialist in future, simply because they objected, as ultra conservatives, to the socialist ingredients of this budget. That would be tantamount to expressing a preference for a habitual drunkard against a teetotaller who consumed half a bottle of whisky in the belief that it was good medicine. I do not believe that many people, while protesting at tha present policy of the Government, -would adopt that line of reasoning. The Labour party has challenged us to face the people on this budget. One would have thought that if honourable members opposite were prepared to face the electors on this subject, they would prepare some general line of policy, some pleasant -alternative that would be attractive to the people of this country. Let us consider their alternatives, as we have heard them so far. First, they want higher pensions. That is an amazing proposition by a party which, when in oflice, increased pensions on five consecutive occasions by only 6d.; a party which has as its record a refusal to grant child endowment for the first child, yet when this Government was endeavouring to carry out its promise in relation to child endowment had the blatant hide to advocate, from the Opposition side of the chamber, an increase of the proposed endowment of the first child under the age of sixteen years from 5s. to 10s. a week; a party which as recently as last April, promised 10s. a week increase to pensioners, yet now contends that they should be given more. ber for Watson( Mr Curtin) is again indulging in bellowing. sioners get more? orable member for Watson is trying to impress his constituents as the-great intertioned in the budget is a necessity. No jector. He has been compared by the honourable member for Henty( Mr that there is a relative basis for all those Gullett) to a fly in amber. Not to be too hard on him, I shall merely quote the biblical paragraphEven a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is than a laundry in which to put it. If counted wise. We have heard from honourable memhers opposite, and particularly from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro recently, about the effect of incentives as a stimulus to production, and of the things which socialists have in the past neglected. Their attacks on this budget are based on those factors. I emphasize that this budget has some ingredients of a Labour-socialist budget. However, I do not think it can be truly said that it is in all details a socialist budget. It has endeavoured to spread inevitable increases of government costs and the inevitable need to find further money, equitably over the whole community, not by a "" soak the rich "" policy. The approval of such a policy by the Opposition is very difficult to understand, because if ten men gang up on an ordinary individual in our land and say, "" We are taking your money"", they will find themselves subsequently in a court of justice, and receive a gaol sentence. If they gang up on him through the ballot-box, and vote to take his money for no precise reason, other than that they should have it, that is apparently a democratic process. We have adopted a policy of taxing sections of the community that can bestafford to finance the increased expenditure with which the Government is faced, and the sections of the community that are the least useful and which are contributing most to our present distorted economic position. The highest sales tax increases will be on furs and jewellery, goods which are relatively less essential, and on agricultural incomes in excess of £4,000 a year. I scarcely think that the Oppositionwill be loud in its protest at that. Smaller inereases will be imposed in respect of things that are relatively less necessary in one's life. Even beer and tobacco are relatively less necessary than bread, jam and butter. I join issue with the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua), who contends that nothing is a luxury, but that every commodity mendoubt the honourable member would agree things. Even a refrigerator is hardly as necessary as a roof over one's head. A washing machine is hardly more essential honourable members opposite were to abandon all this talk about so-called luxuries, and so-called essential goods, and get down to a real comparison between what is more necessary and what is less necessary, they would have a better understanding of the purposes of this budget. The honourable member for Fremantle attacked the budget on the basis that it",61,Budget 1951 52

214,Mr Feeeth,"I think that the honincreases taxes most unfairly and that it -will put up prices. He contended that it is an inflationary budget. He reminds me of a man who picks up a stick from the ground, bends it, and proceeds to demonstrate to his audience that the stick is bent. Did anybody imagine that increases of sales tax upon refrigerators, furs and jewellery would not make the prices of those things higher? The precise purpose of the increase is to cause the prices to rise. If the prices rise, a consumer resistance will occur which will discourage the production of those things. Then, we hope-and we can only hope, because there is no certainty in these mattersthat man-power and capital that is now being devoted to the production of refrigerators, furs and jewellery will be diverted to the production of basic and more essential things. The honourable member for Eremantle, in his self-satisfied way, overlooked the possibility that this new approach to the matter may tend to change demands. We heard some very interesting mathematics from the honourable member for Anderson), who apparently believes that the advantage in respect of years that he has over some honourable members on this side of the chamber invests him with a special mathematical authority. He advanced a peculiar proposition. He said that a man with an' income of £500 a year now corresponded to a man who had an income of £250 a year during the war years. I do not think that we can argue about that. Then he said that a man with an income of £250 a year during the war years who paid £36 a year in tax was better off than a man who has an income of £500 a year now and pays £38 a year in tax. If the honourable gentleman reduces an income of £500 a year at the present time to the corresponding income during the war years, why does he not do the same in relation to the taxes paid and reduce the £38 to £18 or £19? Surely that would be sound mathematics. It was a most remarkable proposition which, at first sight, seemed to have some attraction but which, upon examination, was found to be completely false. pretation. Mr Freeth. maticians would support my view. If I ""nave one fault to find with the budget, it is that one statement by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) revealed a dangerous socialist tendency. The right honourable gentleman said that the proceeds of the Joint Organization wool scheme would be paid back to the wool-growers over a period of several years, because it would be in their own interests to do so. I agree that it may he in the interests of Australia to pay that money back over a number of years, but it is dangerous for a federal Treasurer to follow the line of reasoning that it will be in the interests of the wool-growers to do so. It is wrong to adopt the attitude that that money belongs to the Government and that it will be given back to the farmers only as a generous gesture. It is the farmers' money. If the only factor to be considered is the farmers' welfare, the matter should be left to their individual choice. Each farmer should he asked whether he wants his share of the proceeds of the Joint Organization wool scheme now, or whether he prefers to Kingsford-Smith( Mr Gordon have it paid back to him individually over a number of years. If the Government believes that the requirements of the country make it dangerous to pay all of the money back at once, it should say so. In .my opinion, either the money should be paid hack to the farmers or they should be paid interest upon it at the rate applicable to government loans. If it be withheld from them, they will be making a contribution to the amount of money that is available for investment in this country. Therefore, they should be paid interest upon it. Apart from that matter, I do not think the budget can be attacked. It is designed to achieve an economic purpose. When we get down to pure economics, we find that Labour governments and Liberal governments are compelled to adopt the same measures. I do not know whether honourable members opposite suggest that public works programmes should be curtailed. I have not heard them suggest that yet. I do not know whether they want taxes to be increased in order to pay the increased pensions that they have suggested should be paid. I have not heard them make that suggestion yet. If the Government pays out larger sums, it must",63,Budget 1951 52

In the old days the classic was ""From Log Cabin to White House"". To-day, if a man wants to he put on a pedestal and to be spoken of in terms of adulation, it is necessary for him to make a quick progress from water joey to millionaire and to disregard in the process the intrinsic welfare of the community. If there are two things that come closest to the heart of this community they are the housing problem and the need to maintain family life. Do not forget that the activities of the Victorian Housing Commission, guaranteed and financed by this Government, have been circumscribed because of the reduction of the housing loan to Victoria from £16,000,000 to £9,000,000. That reduction is indefensible and shameful. measure? Is that something that will make for peace, serenity, harmony and pfosperity in this community? Does it not strike at the very vitals on which our civilization depends? That is one item, at any rate, in this attempted restriction which is indefensible by the most stony-hearted honourable member who ever had a callous disregard for the feelings of others. While I am on my feet, I wish to advance a plea to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) on behalf of Victoria, a garden State whose submissions to the Loan Council embodied public works programmes to the tune of £76,000,000, an amount that was reduced, in the atmosphere that then prevailed and of which this budget is symptomatic, to £56,000,000, contractual arrangements for the expenditure abroad of £47,000,000 of which had already been made, leaving only £9,000,000 for works and labour on the site. Hence the dismissals of staff from Victorian public works programmes! Hence the frustration of the Kiewa power project and the stultification of Yallourn! Hence the setback to everything progressive in the State of Viotoria. Does the Government defend that? Have those projects no relation to defence? Is the rural development of Victoria so unimportant that the activities at Kiewa and Yallourn must stop? Where do thG members of the Australian Country party stand on this matter? What do they think of the crimp that has been put in the operations of the State Electricity Commission, which has projects for the supply of power and light for country districts? All these must stop under the stress and the tightening of the belt that is to come. Operation Phoenix! The Victorian development was the brainchild of the Minister for the Interior as a State Minister. A stroke of genius! I . admire it. A beautiful thing! Now the question is, is the phoenix going to arise from its ashes or will it he submerged for ever? The honourable gentleman is credited with having led a palace revolt. Will he now stand up for his own offspring? No parent wantonly and callously disregards ill-treatment of his child. An amount of £9,500,000 was to be exIs that a counter-inflationary pended on rolling-stock for the Victorian railways.

But the snail has lost its momentum. One thousand railway workers were to come to Australia, every worker with a home on his back. The Minister will have to put salt on the tail of that snail. Surely he will not permit the present drift to continue! He was always a democratic and progressive Minister in Victoria. He should turn on these reactionaries and rend them asunder! Lead this revolt! Why should you stand for it, Mr Minister? I apply one touchstone, which is the only one that ultimately has to be applied to all such things. What is the yardstick by which we judge our foreign policy and hy which we measure the extraordinary contributionsI say it correctly and justly-mad e by the Leader of the Lahour party to world recovery generally in South-East Asia and elsewhere?

Applying that touchstone, this budget fails. It fails to protect the common man. rate of direct taxation, those whom the Government could afford to attack by a graduated scale. It offends all ideas of decency by taxing, in a magnificent and stupendous way, in the field of indirect taxation, an action which will add to the cost of living and impose a harsh burden on tliose in the community who are least able to bear it. It puts a premium on selfishness and rottenness, which are the characteristics of those who wish to defend the citadel of their pelf and their gain. It protects the exploiter and the profiteer. It is the first instalment of something that will he disastrous in its im pact on Australia. It will make cynics of our people and cause them to be fearful of the future. Above all, it will engender absolute distrust of the Government. During this debate I have heard from the Opposition benches statements thac are farther from the truth than were any other statements that I have heard for a long time. I propose to deal with a few of them before turning to the budget itself. The honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mullens) said that the housing loan for Victoria has been cut from £16,000,000 to £9,000,000. At the same time we heard in an undertone from the Pollard), ""What about war service land settlement ?"" Let us look at the loan programme. Statement No. 5 on page 12 of the printed statements that accompanied the budget speech of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) shows that last year the actual expenditure on advances to the States for housing was £21,640.000, and the estimated expenditure for this year is £26,547,000-a n increase of £4,907,000. Actual expenditure last year on war service land settlement was £3,861,577. Estimated expenditure for that purpose this year is £4,125,000.

Therefore, the States themselves must It protects, by means of a flat accept a large share of the responsibility for the decision to reduce loan raisings. It is a pity that the minutes of Loan Council meetings are not available to honourable memhers so that they could read for themselves just what happens at the meetings.

228,Mr Hamilton,"The State Pregrowers ? so much from the Opposition lately about the poor little wool-growers. They found that they were backing the wrong horse when they opposed last year the Government's legislation in respect of the incomes of wool-growers. Their old colleague from Queensland let the cat out of the bag. The honorahle member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) said that there should be a home-consumption price for wool, whereupon the honourable member for Eden-Monaro made one of the best Country party speeches I have ever heard. Speaking on the budget to-night, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said that public loans were not being filled because the people lacked confidence in the Government. The honourable member for Gellibrand pointed out that the stock exchange served as a financial barometer, and it is clear that a great deal of money is being invested in industry at the present time because investors are confident that this Government will make no stupid moves in the direction of socialization such as the Labour Government made. We have heard during this debate some outspoken remarks on the recent referendum campaign. The honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin) said that the Government's proposals for the alteration of the Constitution were undemocratic. I seem to remember that during the campaign itself those proposals were described as the "" negation of democracy "". If the proposals for the banning of the Communist party were the negation of democracy during the referendum campaign, surely they must also have been undemocratic when the Communist Party Dissolution Bill was before the Parliament. We remember that, when the motion for the second reading of that bill was put in the House of Bepresentatives, the silence of the Opposition was staggering. The bill was rejected in the Senate, and in due course it came back to this chamber, where it was again passed. When it was returned to the Senate, the Australian Labour party federal executive directed Labour senators that they must withdraw their opposition to it. What sort of people are they to represent the workers when they were prepared to abandon their democratic principles at the dictation of a few outsiders? Honourable members opposite should not boast about their democratic outlook when Australian troops fighting in Korea voted by a two to one majority in favour of "" Yes"" on the referendum proposal. I would hang my head in shame if I had voted to protect Communists in this country while our men are suffering wounds and death in the battle against communism in Korea. Honourable members opposite show, by their actions, that they are prepared to give protection to Communists in Australia tvho would smash this country. I support the budget as a courageous attempt to halt inflation. It will not harm working men, unless a small increase of the excise duty upon beer and tobacco will harm them. I like both of those commodities, but I have never found them essential, and neither does any other sensible Australian. The honourable member for Kingston said that the Government was placing a tax on knives, forks and spoons. I invite him to read the sales tax schedule, in which is set forth a list of goods upon which the rate of tax is 66f per cent., and I direct his attention to the words, "" but not including knives, forks, spoons and other cutlery"". The honourable member's statement was made with the deliberate purpose of deceiving listeners to these proceedings into the belief that the Government was unfairly taxing ordinary men and women. There is no tax on goods in the basic wage regimen, except beer and tobacco. Sales tax increases are directed against those who can best afford to pay them. Those who buy the taxed articles must expect to pay for them, and the effect of the tax will be to divert labour and materials from the manufacture of non-essential articles into other and more useful channels. of articles more necessary to the economic welfare of the country. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) was heard in silence, as is the custom, when he made his maiden speech. It was a good speech except for some inaccuracies, and I do not blame him for them,",68,Budget 1951 52

I never said anything against the late Leader of the Opposition when he was alive and I do not intend to say it now. The honourable member for Macquarie criticized the Governnient for allegedly having failed to make sufficient money available to local authorities for road construction and maintenance. He endeavoured to create the impression that the Government had done nothing in that respect. When a deputation waited on the late Leader of the Opposition on the 6th August, 1948, he saidThe petrol tax is not imposed solely for this purpose and although for many years substantial roads grants have been made to tlie States the major portion of this tax has been required to meet the expenditure of the Commonwealth for general purposes and in particular, the heavy commitments for war and post-war purposes. The tax is primarily a revenue impost, in common with those imposed on many other items, such as beer, tobacco and matches. About 90 per cent, of the petrol consumed in Australia for civil purposes is used for commercial and industrial purposes. To a great extent the cost is passed on to the general community in transportation aud delivery charges. Since the greater portion of the tax is not finally borne by during the last few weeks of a scarcity the users of petrol but by the general community, it is inappropriate to contend that the whole of the proceeds should be used for road purposes. The Government has made a greater their States. I wonder how many honorcontribution for road purposes than was able members of the Opposition f u l l y made by any previous government. The honourable member for Macquarie also said that there is a difference of opinion between the Treasurer and the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in respect of the appreciation of the Australian £1. On the 6th October, 1950, the Prime Minister in a speech to the nation said without squivooation decided that the exchange rate should not be altered. It has been said by honourable members of the Opposition that the Government has proposed the imposition of higher taxation in order to condition the people for war. If those honourable memhers believe that to be so, how do they explain the fact that the Labour Government has proposed Ifr. Jlamilto-n. an amount of £4,500,000,000 during the next three years? Honourable members opposite do not state that Mr Attlee, Mr Morrison and Mr Gaitskell are warmongers. I agree that the Governnient has proposed to increase taxation by a very minor amount for the purpose of improving Australia's defence preparedness. Any government that failed to take such precautions would he recreant to its trust. Nobody w ill deny that there is the danger of war and that the only way to prevent it is to strengthen our forces as quickly as possible. If we can do that, in concert w i th the other democratic nations, there w ill be no war for some years to come. An honourable member of the Opposition suggested that the Government should obtain another and a larger dollar loan. It was not until the present Government came to power that Australia obtained a dollar loan, and it has been of very great assistance. If it could be in creased, that would be so much the better. The honourable member for Kingston said that the Government proposed to rob the kiddies of their icecream and toys. I have heard honourable members of the Opposition from New South Wales and Queensland complain of butter in their States and of a repudiation of promises by the Government. Apparently they have not examined the real causes of the scarcity of butter in realize how much m i l k is used in the manufacture of ice-cream and chocolate. If they were to ask confectionery manufacturers, they would learn that the bulk of the ice-cream manufactured is sold to delicatessens in the cities and is consumed by adults. The sooner the Government can encourage the flow of milk into the manufacture of butter, cheese that the Government had and processed milk, the sooner shall we cease to hear complaints from honorahle members from New South Wales and Queensland who have asked honourable members from Western Australia to bring them a few pounds of butter from that State.

It has been proposed that the impost on such a taxpayer shall be reduced to £43 7s. 6d.

When the Treasurer introduced the budget the Sydney Morning Herald described it in large headlines as "" a panic budget"". What does that great organ of the press care about the plight of the ordinary man in the street? What do the wealthy and influential owners of that journal, the Fairfax family, care about the rights and sufferings of the common man? repeatedly stated that press statements are inaccurate and cannot he relied on. The pages of Hansard disclose that year after year, when in office and out of office, the Labour party has consistently told us that we cannot believe what we read in the press, yet honourable members opposite have based their attack on this budget upon what they have read in the Sydney Morning Herald. If that journal had distribution of available newsprint other newspapers would have obtained a greater share upon which to print accurate items of news. Notwithstanding that the Sydney Morning Herald insisted on the maintenance of its quota of newsprint and increased the price of its publication and the cost of advertising, it claims that it is "" going broke "" : I should not base m y arguments upon statements that are published in that journal. I observe that the Treasurer (Sii Arthur Fadden) is present in the chamber. I am glad of that because I wish to make some observations honourable' member's time has expired. [10.38] I had hoped that when the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) addressed the committee I should hear a representative of a Western Australian constituency explain how this budget will assist the people. But I was sorely disappointed. We have repeatedly heard of the wonderful state of affairs that exists in Western Australia and I had looked to the honorahle member to give us a glimmering of hope that as a result of this budget some of the good things that are said to be enjoyed by the residents of that State miglit be made available to Australians generally. Yet all we got from the honourable member was an expression of the wish that the Government would hasten the importation to Australia of Japanese toys. That wish brands the honourable member as one who is prepared to sell out to the cheapest bidder, even though he is an Asiatic and a former enemy. I do not propose to use my time in dealing with the illogical meanderings of the honourable member, Opposition members have who wasted 30 minutes in an endeavour to show what beneficial results will flow from this budget. My opposition to the budget is not based on idle chatter or on newspaper reports; it falls under five specific headings. First, the plan envisaged in the budget, instead of dampening the inflationary spiral will accelerate it and intensify our present economic conditions. Secondly, the plan will destroy incentive to produce at a agreed to a more equitable time when increased production is so urgently needed in this country. Thirdly, it will impose unnecessary hardship upon the people at a time when they should be encouraged. Fourthly, it will leave the road and rail transport system of",71,Budget 1951 52

Fifthly, it will hamper the States in their attempts to improve production and it leaves unanswered the question of how their reduced public works programmes are to be financed. I shall deal now with the first point. The honourable 'member for Canning need not have launched his bitter attack only upon the Sydney Morning Herald, because every section of the Sydney press followed the lead of that newspaper in setting forth the detrimental effect that this budget will have upon the basic wage. Moreover, no honourable member on the Government side can say that sales tax does not have inflationary effects in all directions. An increase of sales tax may be likened to a stone being thrown into a pond. It sets up a. wave of increased costs in all directions. The sales tax will ultimately increase the basic wage which in turn will accelerate the inflationary spiral. The honourable member for Canning lost sight of the fact that as from next Monday the price of shoes will be increased in accordance with the new tax. Shoes are included in the basic wage regimen and, therefore, the increase of sales tax will directly raise the basic wage. Again, the wearer of a new suit,, for which, perhaps, he has not yet paid, will have to provide an extra guinea when he does pay for it. That is another direct consequence of the increased sales tax. These effects were made public by every section of the press on the day after the budget was introduced. Consider now the radio industry. to the public. That has been caused by That industry has asked why it has been the impractical way in which the Gosingled out for heavy taxation. It would vernment is approaching the problem be an understatement to say that the of inflation in general and of importing radio industry is extremely disappointed goods in particular. because the Government has seen fit to demote its products in the essentiality scale by imposing on them a rate of Government had decided not to maintain tax that is applicable to mouth organs the price subsidy policy. I have seen and jews' harps. The radio industry says quite a lot of government somersaulting that surely it is unnecessary for such an on different matters but never so much organization to remind this Government as has heen indulged in by this Governthat Australia cannot fight a war with ment about price subsidies. Let us conmusical instruments, whereas it cannot sider what was said by the Treasurer fight a war, or even prepare for defence, without extensively availing itself of the products of this industry. The Government should remember that the radio industry, which produced radio sets for the working man's home, also produces highly technical equipment for the defence services. This budget is so unbalanced that it causes one to wonder who drew up the sales tax programme. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has said much about importing goods for the purpose of combating inflation. But the Government has dealt with this matter as it deals with all matters, from the wrong end. For instance, this morning on the Sydney waterfront, because of the import policy of the Government, 32 ships were lying idle. Their idleness was due directly to lack of wharf space, yet it is certain that some honourable member on the Government side will claim that it was the fault of the McGirr Government. leave the Communists out of this matter because, as honorahle members on both sides of the chamber have so frequently stressed, if they continue to sow the wind as they are doing, in the end they are sure to reap the whirl-wind. The 32 ships that I mentioned were brought here at the instigation of the Government, but there were no wharf facilities for them. Not only are those ships being delayed through the action of the Government, but, in addition, with each hour of delay the transport costs on the goods that they are carrying are piling up and that, in turn, will increase their price I was astounded to learn that this",72,Budget 1951 52

249,Mr E. James Harrison,"I shallwhen he was speaking in the 1948-49 budget debate. He then saidIn view of the increased eost of living, and the trend towards inflation which is due to the Government's policy, its decision to withdraw subsidies is unwise and unwarranted. Yet every day since the Parliament resumed its sittings we have heard attack after attack on the McGirr Government of New South ""Wales because of its refusal to lend itself to a furtlier increase of the basic wage and a consequent further undermining of the economic structure of Australia by agreeing to the price of butter being raised. No grocery item causes the basic wage to rise more quickly than does butter. In the light of those facts, why should this Government alter the price subsidy policy? The plan laid down by the Government if carried out will completely nullify its efforts to combat inflation. honourable member believe that industry should receive for its product a price based on the cost of production? Harrison does not take much notice of another. Dealing now with my second point, I divide producers into three groups: first, the average wage-earner, who is the productive unit; secondly, the business man who runs his company or firm in a small way; and thirdly, the pensioners. I shall now analyse those divisions. The honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) spoke unconvincingly in defence of the proposed increase of income tax by 10 per cent. Percentages do not mean much; what really counts is the actual physical payments that workers will be called upon to make. The truth is that under the budget proposals, a basic wage earner in receipt of £501 a yearI noticed that the honourable member for Canning mentioned a figure £2 a week below the basic wage-will be called upon to contribute £39 9s. a year in income tax, although in the gravest war years the highest annual payment that a basic wage earner had to make was £37. Should an average basic wage earner work one day a week overtime, his tax liability under the proposed rates will increase by £20 a year. I cannot think of a better way to destroy incentive. I come now to the second group, the businessmen. It may be unusual for an honourable member on this side of tlie chamber to say something on behalf of . companies, but I should like to educate Government supporters. The selection of £5,000 as the commencing point for the staggering new scale of taxes will do nothing more than play right into the hands of black marketeers and backyard sweatshops. Small companies, which are doing magnificent work to-day, will be deprived completely of their incentive and initia-. tive. They will be caught in both ways. Investors in small companies invest for profit and insist on getting something for their money. In that way, production is stimulated. Investment in large companies is made largely for a secured income and does not give incentive to produce. I refer, for instance, to the holding the by Mr Resch of 640,000 £1 shares in Tooth& Company Limited. The budget proposals will rob hundreds of small companies which have been established since the war of their incentive to expand production. I come now to the third group that 1 mentioned, namely the pensioners. 1 never thought that I should be a member of a parliament which, at a time when increased production was so vital to the nation, failed to allow pensioners to earn the equivalent of the basic wage without suffering a reduction of their pension. No mention is made in the budget of any proposal to increase the permissible income limit which was fixed by the Chifley Government in 1948 at £78 a year when the basic wage was £5 16s. a week, and a married couple in receipt of a combined pension of £4 5s. a week could earn an additional £78 a year, bringing their total weekly payment to £7 5s. To-day the basic wage is almost double what it was in 1948, yet the permissible income has not «been increased. This failure on the part of the Government to give old people some incentive to work shows ih its true light the hypocritical talk of honorahle members opposite about the desirability of increasing production. The claim by Government supporters that loafing is the cause of most of our",73,Budget 1951 52
250,Mr Ekic J. Harrison,Does not,74,Budget 1951 52
251,Mr E. James Harrison,"On eeconomic troubles is deplorable. ""We are told constantly that overtime could be substantially reduced if workers did not loaf during the day; but, in my opinion, the way to increase production is to give to the people of this country more confidence in the future. Unless the workers are given a stake in the country production will fall still further. For instance, a happier community could be produced if the Government were to do something tangible to improve the housebuilding programme. A contented home life is basic to the true welfare of any people,, but the housing of many workers in this country to-day is of such a deplorable standard that the breadwinner does not care very much whether he is able to get to his home after his ordinary working day, or has to work overtime. Many men work overtime because they have notliing to go home to. They have no real farnily life and, therefore, no real incentive to better themselves. I had hoped that the budget would contain some concrete proposals to speed up the building of houses, but what do we find? We find that less money than ever will be available for this urgent work. Building societies are unable to mieet the demands that are being made upon them for finance. Honourable members opposite will ask, "" What is the use of money when materials are scarce ? "" My answer to that is that unless the workers are given an opportunity to secure adequate housing for themselves and their families, they will not be interested in producing greater quantities of materials. The Government should cease talking drivel about loafers causing our economic troubles and should endeavour to give to the workers of this country the incentive and the opportunity to make something more of their lives. Money at a low rate of interest should he made available for home-building purposes. It is of no use fqr the Government to say that money cannot be provided for this purpose. Every one knows that workers' homes are a gilt-edged security. Treasury bills could be issued at an interest rate .as low as 1 per cent. Such a policy would be much more sensible than the stupid proposal to tax engagement rings and many of the articles that a newly married -couple require in a home. Because of the Government's negative attitude towards the housing programme, it does not deserve any greater production than it is getting at present from the Australian worker. My fourth objection to the budget is that it makes no provision to restore road and rail transport services to a normal standard of efficiency. This failure is aggravated at a time when the restoration of efficient transport systems is essential to proper defence preparations. The Government has failed so miserably in this respect that I am amazed that members of the Australian Country party are prepared to sit back and accept its inaction without protest. We cannot adequately prepare our defences without first providing an efficient road and rail transport system. Hitler taught the world that no government could make an effective war effort unless it had a first-class road system, and the Americans established the importance of an efficient rail transport system for the same purpose. A survey that was conducted recently in New South Wales for the purpose of assessing the corrective measures and the work that would be involved in order to provide for the adequate development of the main roads system in that State disclosed that an additional revenue of £29,000,000 would be required for that purpose. That survey also showed that the greater part of that work would need to he done in country areas. Such work must be governed by the finance available. The Department of Main Boads in New South Wales is expending money at a rate slightly greater than that at which revenue is made availahle to it for that purpose. The balance in the main roads fund of the County of Cumberland was reduced by almost £200,000 during 1950-51, and at the 30th June last it represented a little more than the normal expenditure for a period of four weeks. That is no more than a working balance, and, if costs continued to increase, it will become less. The cash balance in the Country Main Boads Fund at the 30th June last was approximately £424,000, or about three weeks' normal expenditure. That balance included an amount of £300,000 which was provided from Consolidated Revenue during 1950-51 to enable the Department of Main Roads to avoid the necessity of retrenching staff and disbanding country road organizations. Members of this Government talk about retrenching public servants, yet the Eailways Department of New South Wales expended last year the sum of £3,000,000 in respect of overtime. It is sheer stupidity for the Government to talk about defence preparations unless it takes steps to restore our road and rail transport systems to a basis of normal efficiency. My fifth objection to the budget is that it does not give adequate help to the States to enable them to encourage production. After all, the responsibility falls upon the States to provide efficient rail transport for the conveyance of essential commodities such as coal and primary products. Unless the States receive a fairer deal from this Government, our transport systems will become chaotic. The Prime Minister has said that sales tax will yield a revenue of £60,000,000 during the current financial year and that the difference between the estimated cost of public works and loan raisings will be £75,000,000. At the same time, the Government proposes to meet the cost of defence preparations from Consolidated Eevenue. The Government cannot have it both ways. The financing of public works from collections of sales tax will not affect the diversion of man-power and materials to essential undertakings. essential that the Government shall achieve that approach this problem and should realize that it can do so only by instituting a system of straight-out control of materials for essential production, both civilian and governmental. All taxes that affect producers, including wage-earners, rural producers and companies in the lower ranges of income, must be reduced as an incentive to them to increase production. No penal taxation should be imposed on earnings derived from overtime work. Government should remove the sales tax from every item the cost of which is reflected in the basic wage. It should return to the States sufficient revenue to enable them to plan their economy according to their respective needs and circumstances. It should Mr Bf. James Harrison. regard home-building for the workers as a gilt-edged investment and should finance home-building by the use of treasury-bills through co-operative homebuilding societies or government sponsored societies at nominal rates of interest. Next, the Government should make available to the States all the revenue that it derives from the petrol tax in order to enable them to restore Australia's transport systems as a whole to a normal standard of efficiency. Finally-and I believe that it will be obliged to follow this course within the next two years-it should assume complete control of prices. For those reasons, I submit that the budget must be redrafted if it is to be made really worthwhile. Progress reported. WAR NEUROSIS. proposedThat the House do now adjourn. I take this opportunity to direct the attention of the Government to the inhuman treatment that has been meted out to an ex-serviceman and his widowed mother. Although eleven months have elapsed However, it is since I first endeavoured to have this matter rectified, I have not made any objective. It should progress. The ex-serviceman to whom 1 realistically refer was a war neurosis case. As a lad he committed an act for which he was arrested. The circumstances of the case are set out in the following extract which I quote from the Newcastle Sun of the 24th November, 1950:A 32-year-old returned soldier, who told a doctor he heard voices telling him to knock people down, was found unfit to plead to a charge in Newcastle Quarter Sessions to-day.

253,Mr Griffiths (Shortland) [11.7],"Mr W. G. Cannington, solicitor, said that he had been present this week at Dr. I . Morgan's interview with Woods, when Woods said that he heard voices, without anybody being present, which told him to knock people down. Woods will be kept in strict custody in a State penitentiary until the provisions of the Lunacy Act are implemented. W h en I took u p t h is matter, I w r o t e to Mr Carswell, a d e p u t y commissioner for r e p a t r i a t i o n , and p o in t ed out t h is soldier's disability. On the 7 th December, I communicated w it h Mr Carswell, as f o l l o w s : I am writing direct to you to make representations on behalf of Edgar Winston Woods, aged 32 years, Shamrock Street, Hexham, and would ask you to treat this matter as one of urgency because of this man's mental and physical condition. I might say, Sir, that it would appear to me that this case warrants special consideration for an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding it . Mr Woods had five years military service. He spent two and a half years in the Islands and served at Milne Bay and a number of other places. He was discharged from the Army medically unfit and was suffering from war neurosis. .Although Mr Woods has been declared a 100 per cent, disability case, he is only in receipt of 27s. (id. pension per week. He has not worked since he was discharged from the Army, and has spent more than two years in the Morisset Asylum. I understand his mother, whom he had been supporting prior to the war and to whom he'made an allotment during the war, has not received anything since his discharge. I feel this should also be investigated. I pointed out t h a t he h a d in j u r e d a m a n , and t h a t the doctors h a d c e r t if i ed t h a t he was u n f it to w o r k , and u n f it to plead in the c o u r t. Carswel l of those facts on the 7 t h December last, t h is l a d was l e f t r o t t in g for months in L o n g B a y gaol. The court did n ot deal w it h his case because an in t e r p r e t a t i o n of the N e w South WalesL u n a c y Act was awaited. On the 1 5 t h December, I received a r e p l y from Mr Carswel l w h i c h statedWith reference to your communication dated 7th December, 1.950, relating to the war pension payable to the abovenamed ex-soldier, I wish to advise that his War Pension was reduced to 50% rate, as from 14th A p r i l, 1949, following a medical examination and information tliat he was engaged in poultry farming and had lost no time from work during the previous twelve months. 2. Your representations are being treated as an application for increased rate of pension on the member's behalf and it has heen ascertained that he is u l present confined to the Long Bay Gaol. The Governor of the Gaol has been requested to arrange for a medical examination and report by the Gaol Medical Officer. On receipt of this report the case w ill be submitted to the Repatriation Board for consideration and I shall advise you of the decision. 3. It is also advised that a claim for War Pension has not been lodged by the mother of the member and, in view of your representations, the necessary forms are being forwarded to her for completion to enable her to make a claim.

He was kep t r o t t in g in L o n g B a y gaol wifch murderers, plunderers and other c r i m in a l s . On the 16th M a r c h I received another letter, w h i o h statedWith reference to your communication dated Oth March, 1951, I desire to append a copy of my letter to you dated 17th January, 1951: "" Further to your communication dated 7th December, 1950, and my reply of 15th December, 1950, I wish to advise that the War Pension payable to tlie abovenamed ex-soldier has now been increased to the Temporary Totally Incapacitated rate of £14 per fortnight as from 21st November, 1950. Pension payments w ill be paid to his War Pension Trust Account. 2. The Officer-in-charge of the Newcastle Office of this Department has been requested to interview the ex-soldier's mother concerning her financial circumstances and on receipt of his report, consideration will be given to tlie payment of an allowance from the ex-soldier's War AlthoughI informed Mr Pension TrustF u n d "" . 2. Adverting to paragraph 2 of the appended letter, it is advised that Mrs. AlmaH . Woods, the mother of the abovenamed, was interviewed by the Officer-in-charge of the Newcastle Office and it was ascertained that she wished to be granted a War Pension and not an Allowance from the ex-soldier's War Pension Trust Fund. 3. In my letter of 15th December, 1950, yon were advised that the necessary forms had been forwarded to the mother for completion, but these forme were not retrrned. A communication was addressed to her on 14th March. 1951, requesting her to advise as to whether fhe intended to proceed with her claim for a War Pension. The mother, w h o was a w i d o w , and dependent on her son, l i v ed in an o r d in a r y little home somewhere about Hexham Swamp. The department proposed to grant her a pension from the War Pensions Trust Eund. I wrote again to Mr of Hexham is aware that the people who Carswell on the 20th March, and pointed out to him the urgency of the matter, as follows:Following my letter to you of the 7th December, 1050, when I first made my representations on behalf of this soldier and his mother, you wrote to Mrs. Woods on the 15th December, CX.0OS45: EJE.DW, requesting her to f ill in and return certain papers to you. Mrs Woods failed to complete and return these papers due to a number of Teasons, namely, her son's trouble and a daughter becoming ill and who dies. Also the fact that Mr Kitching had asked her to call and see him, which she did made Mrs. Woods think that her visit to Mr Kitching was for the same reason as were the papers she received from you. However, I have had the papers completed and now enclose themalong with this letter. On the 20th June, I received another letter from the Deputy Commissioner, which readW i th reference to your personal representations on behalf of Mrs. A. H . Woods and further to my letter of 2.4.51, it is now desired to inform you that the investigation in this cose is still incomplete. This is due to the fact that Mrs. Woods was, on 5.4.51, requested to forward to this office her marriage certificate and certain other documents, but no reply was received to my request and a suitable reminder was forwarded to her on 1(5.5.51. I understand that Mrs. Woods was unable to find her marriage certificate) which had been lost infloodssome time earlier. The letter continuesYour representations of 20.3.51 are noted inasmuch that you stress a note of urgency in this case but no further action can be taken by the Department nnless and u n t i l such time as Mrs. Woods supplies the information as requested from her on 5.4.51. Mrs . Woodsd u l y for w a r d e d t h a t in for m a t i o n , and on the 1 0 t h J u l y I received another c o m m u n i c a t i o n from the E e p a t r i a t i o n D e p a r t m e n t , as f o l l o w s : W it h reference to your personal representations on behalf of Mrs. AlmaH . Woods and further to my letter of the l s t June, 1951, it is desired to inform you that the investigation in this case has been completed. Approval was given on 9.7.1951 for Mrs. Woods to receive a war pension at the rate of £1 19s. 3d. per fortnight with effect as from 8.12.1950. The pension accordance with Mrs. Woods' financial circumstances as recently disclosed, ilfr. Griffiths. I emphasize that the family is destitute. It is living under awful conditions. Any honourable member who has a knowledge live there have no financial means. On the lst July, Mrs. Woods wrote to me, as follows:I hereby wish to lodge a complaint against the Bepatriation Commission regarding their attitude and treatment of my ex-soldier son (Pte. Woods, Edgar Winston, NX135847) now being a patient of the Parramatta Mental Home. I would like to have his case reviewed, and his removal to the Yarralla, or some sucb hospital where he could receive treatment under the repatriation scheme. I also wish to point out that his condition has deteriorated under the present treatment hc has been receiving, and his case needs immediate attention. I then wrote to the Minister for Eepatriation, and pointed out to him the circumstances of the case. On the 4th October, he wrote to me as follows:As promised, I have made inquiries following your personal representations on behalf of Mrs. AlmaH . Woods, of 7 Shamrock-street,. Hexham, N.S.W., whose son, Edgar Winston Woods, is an in-patient of Parramatta Mental Hospital. I note that on 10th July, 1951, the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation, Sydney, advised you that war pension had been granted toMrs. Woods at the rate of £1 19s. 3d. per fortnight, in respect of her son's incapacity. Mr Woods' nervous condition has beeni accepted as due to war service, and the Deputy Commissioner, Sydney, has assured trusteeship of his war pension in accordance with the relevant provision of the Repatriation Act. Tlie ex-servicemen's war pension has been paid at Temporarily Totally Incapacitated rate(£14 per fortnight ) since 21st November, 1950, and ray Department has accepted responsibility for Mr Woods' maintenance at Pavramattft Mental Hospital. [Extension of time granted.] It h a n k honourable members for t h e i r indulgence. The M in is t e r ' s r e p l y to m e continuedI am advised that the matter of Mr Woods' treatment is beyond the control of my Department at present. The ex-serviceman is being detained tinder the provisions of the legislation of N.S.W., and the Repatriation Commission has no jurisdiction over his person. If Mr Woods were discharged from State Government care and were f it to be released payable was assessed in from certification under the Lunacy Laws of the State, my Department"" could undertake treatment. If the State authorities were willing, Mr Woods could, although certified, be managed at the Repatriation Cottages, Callan Park Mental Hospital. The Minister has admitted that if the Government of New South Wales were prepared to release Woods to the care of the repatriation authorities, they could treat him. I contend that it is the sented :responsibility of this Government, or of the Eepatriation Department, to ensure that a man who has given some of the hest years of his life in the service of his country shall not he treated any longer in the way in which Woods has been treated. It will he a positive shame, and a disgrace to our system of society, if such treatment is permitted to continue. Yet many months have elapsed, and no finality has been reached. I ask the Minister in charge of the House to -call for the relevant papers, and to order a complete examination of the circumstances in the interests of not only the son but also the mother. I omitted to inform the House previously that the brother of this man even bought poultry in order to establish the family on a small farm at Hexham in the hope that his brother would recover there from the neurotic condition from which he was suffering. Because of that action, the department reduced the pension in the first place on the ground that the mother's financial position did not warrant her receiving a greater pension than £1 19s. 3d. a fortnight. I appeal to the Government to take this matter up and do something to help the young man, who has done such a good job for the nation, and also his mother. the Army) [11.20] -As the Minister representing the Minister for Eepatriation (Senator Cooper) in this House, I sball be pleased to bring to the notice of my colleague the case that the honorahle member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) has stated.

Isi t a fact that hostels in provincial areas are urgently required to assist in overcoming the labour shortage, particularly in primary industries? able member's questions are as follows:1. Prior to the recent meeting of the Loan Council, approval had been given for the cou struction of a hostel for British migrants in Toowoomba using prefabricated houses. As a result of the Loan Council meeting, it became necessary for the Commonwealth, along with thc States, to review works programmes and on the Commonwealth side a number of hostel projects, including that at Toowoomba, have liad to be deferred. It is, however, proposed to reconsider the Toowoomba project when the 1952-53 works programme is being constructed. 2. While hostels in provincial areas are required, wit h varying degrees of urgency, to assist in meeting labour shortages, the reduced programme for hostels in the current financial year has left l it t l e scope, after providing for the completion of works already partly constructed, for new works. In considering how to apply the balance of funds available for new works, it has been necessary, having regard to the basic needs of our economy, and the demands of defence preparation, to concentrate on accommodation for workers to produce coal, steel, agricultural machinery . and fertilizers.

Isi t a fact that,, by the agreement, paywent of certain -wage increases was made retrospective to the 29th December, 1940, and that employees, such as supervising technicians, senior technicians, technicians and technicians' Assistants, become lawfully due to them! 3. If so, will the amounts due to all the employees governed by the agreement be paid in fullf honourable member's questions are as follows:'You will, no donbt, recall placing a question on notice in the House on tie 13th July regarding the present position in connection with the payment of certain salary increases which have recently been accorded to members of the technical staff employed in the Postal Department. I am informed that the new salaries arose oiit of an agreement reached between the Public Service Board, the department and the unions -concerned. The terms of the agreement are, of course, being strictly observed by thc department and the higher rates are being paid in full, with retrospective effect from the 29th December, 1949. Inquiries disclose that, at this stage, payment of the increased salaries has been completed in all States with the exception of New South Wales, where payments are to commence on the 26th July, 1951. It is intended to make payments initially to some 500 -employees and an approximately similar number will receive the new rates on succeeding pay days. Under this arrangement, it is expected that payments will be completed in New South Wales within the next three or four pay periods. I am advised that, in addition to introducing new salary rates, retrospective adjustments are also to be effected in the rates of allowance payable to officers occupying positions above their normal classification. Moreover, it appears that variations are to be made in the way of increasing past payments such as those for overtime, Sunday, holiday and shift duty. In some of the States, it has been found practicable to make arrangements which will permit of higher duties allowance and extraneous payments being fully adjusted on next pay day or the pay day immediately following. While, due to the greater number of officers involved, it will not be possible to complete payments in the larger States over the same period, special steps have been taken in an' endeavour to bring adjustments to finality within an additional one or two pay periods. As you may .perhaps be aware, the salaries of most, postal employees, in common with the salaries of other Commonwealth Public Service employees, have beeu subject to frequent variation in recent months. Consequently, the salary staff of the personnel and . accounts branches of the department have been working under extremely heavy pressure for some considerable time. Every effort is being made, however, to dispose of the adjustments work as expeditiously as possible and you may be assured that members of the technical staff will receive their increased payments at the -earliest practicable date.",80,Postal Department
