The first problem is defining goodwill. Act. The second problem is: How does the Government arrive at this magical figure of 20 per cent? I am reluctant to continue to pursue these Why do we not have a 50 per cent exemption technical aspects of the legislation as obviously for goodwill? It simply does not make sense but they require very detailed consideration. The fact is that this highlights the lack of time given if the track record of the Democrats is anything to go by, anything involving them does not seem not just to members of this place but also, outside this chamber, to accountants, tax agents, to make to much sense at the best of time. The lawyers and small business people to understand Democrats have supported the fringe benefits properly the legislation. It was introduced into tax. The Opposition is committed to repealing the fringe benefits tax. The Democrats supthe Parliament by the Treasurer late on Thursported the capital gains tax. The Opposition is day of last week. It is complex, detailed legislation which was introduced together with five committed to repealing the capital gains tax. Let all listening to this debate understand that the other pieces of legislation, all of which had to be carefully considered. We find, going through Opposition unreservedly commits itself to reit, that we simply have not had time to consider pealing these two iniquitous taxes. The Demothe interrelationship of these specific provisions crats simply have no credibility whatsoever, if with existing provisions under the whole welter they had any to start with. of the Income Tax Assessment Act. There are so many important technical questions to be posed in relation to this taxation. Let Let us have a look at the legislation as it us look at proposed new section 160M, subapplies to a trust. It is clearly wrong, because section (8) of the legislation.

One has to ask the obtaining the necessary information and making question why an increase of wealth due to skill valid analyses to arrive at the correct figures.

If taxes were reduced, a lot of welfare reason. problems would evaporate. I suggest that the It might also be interesting to note· some of honourable member think about that, and exerthe comments of the Minister for Primary Incise his mind as to how to reduce the cost of dustry ( Mr Kerin) when he was questioned about government and reduce taxes, because that would both capital gains taxes and death duties whilst do an awful lot to solve some of the welfare in Horsham just prior to the last election. It is problems that are so enormous in this country amazing how the Minister for Primary Industry today. can say one thing just before an election and In opposing this capital gains tax I will highafter that election remain remarkably silent on light a number of reasons for so doing. First, I the same issue. It is something that I guess we point out its complexity. I think that this is an have got used to with this government. As many extremely complex bit of legislation. It consists speakers on this side of the chamber have alof over 100 pages, and is something that 95 per ready reminded us, it was only back in 1983 cent of Australians would probably find exwhen the Prime Minister made that wonderful tremely difficult to understand, if they could statement'Let us put it in a way that not even understand it at all. It is also extremely complex our opponents can misunderstand; there will be for those people trying to comply with it. It is no capital gains tax'. We are now in 1986 and all very well to say that this tax must be introthat announcement in relation to a capital gains duced, but, because it is as complex as it is, tax was made less than three years ago. Thereinevitably people will make mistakes and will fore, had the first Hawke Government run its have extreme difficulty in trying to comply with normal term it would have broken its promise it. Also, it will divert a lot of productive rein relation to that matter in its first term. I do sources to people trying to understand what is not think that Government members can say going on and trying to keep the sorts of records that this is a new parliament and that, therefore, necessary to comply with this legislation. what was said in 1983 does not matter. The other reason I believe this tax is plain The Minister for Primary Industry, when asked stupid is that it will be extremely costly to whether he would oppose a capital gains tax, an administer. It will cost the Taxation Office, and assets tax and death duties, if such issues arose therefore the Government, an awful lot of money in Cabinet, was reported as saying that he would to administer. And what for? In the first year it oppose such measures in the strongest terms, is expected to net $5m in a Budget that this that he had seen the effect of probate, that it year will probably exceed $70 billion. Some tax! split a farm and made it less viable, and that so, I think that honourable members will find, if too, would a capital gains tax. I suggest that the they look further, that not only will the revenue honourable member for La Trobe should take gained be small but also, I suggest, the Governon board some of those words, because, when ment will lose out in the long run because it will the Minister for Primary Industry was saying discourage investment and risk taking. that, it was not some cheap election gimmick; It is also a highly discriminatory tax, as the he was speaking from experience and saying Minister for Primary Industry knows. I am what he believed. The honourable member for pleased to see that he has come into the chamLa Trobe overlooked the fact, when talking about ber. He knows what it can do to a family farm reintroduction of death duties, capital taxes and or to a capital intensive industry. Obviously it is wealth taxes, that Australia already has a wealth highly discriminatory against industries that are tax. Anybody who owns a bit of land pays rates capital intensive. Farming is a classic example of on it on an annual basis, and those rates are that. I would have thought that, if the Minister nothing more than a wealth tax. is to represent primary producers, as he is supon capital and something that the honourable made in Horsham in 1984. member for La Trobe ought to take into account I think that another point about this matter is when talking of new capital taxes. He talks of that it is quite obvious that the Government will welfare problems.
