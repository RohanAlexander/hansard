Among them is Jann McFarlane, the former member for Stirling, who was a good friend to many people on both sides of the House; Michelle O’Byrne, the former member for Bass; Sid Sidebottom, the former member for Braddon; Christian Zahra, the former member for McMillan; Con Sciacca, the former member for Bowman; Sharryn Jackson, the former member for Hasluck; David Cox, the former member for Kingston; and Martyn Evans, the former member for Bonython. As I said, they were good friends, good colleagues and good members, and they will be sorely missed. The new members who have come in on the government side in those seats have very big shoes to fill. I hope that they do the best they can, and as well as their predecessors did, for their constituencies. I welcome all new members to this place, particularly those on our side who defeated incumbent members of the government. They include Julie Owens, the new member for Parramatta; Sharon Bird, the new member for Cunningham; Justine Elliot, the new member for Richmond; Kate Ellis, the new member for Adelaide; and the one fellow who defeated an incumbent member-Steve Georganas, the new member for Hindmarsh. They have proven to be very good colleagues and very good members in their first few months as members of parliament. I am sure that they will continue to serve their constituencies well, build up the margins in their own seats and be re-elected, hopefully with the election of a Labor government, in 2007. I am pleased, honoured and privileged to be re-elected with an increased majority in the electorate of Charlton. I thank the electors of Charlton for their support for Labor and for our vision of opportunity for all Australians. I also give thanks for the great support from people over the course of the campaign. I thank all my friends and supporters in the Charlton electorate and members of the Labor Party. Of course, there are too many to name here, but I will name my campaign team. The team, which was led by Phil Cooke, included Sam Bride, Peter Dodd-who is a former member of this place-Peter Eckermann, Marjorie Gissane-Clark, Bernard Griffin, Terri and Barry Johnston, David Kay, Leigh Martin, Katherine McCarthy, Jack Milroy, Nicholas Mowbray and Bill Royan. I thank them all. We all know that we would MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Workplace Relations Community And Gives Job Opportunities To Amendment Fair Dismissal Many People Who Would Otherwise Not Have Reform Bill 2004 The Chance Of Getting A Job The New Jobs
187,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 10.05 A.m.,"not be here if it were not for the whole team who are behind us and support us throughout the parliamentary term, and particularly during an election campaign when a lot of the hard yakka is done. Our supporters are on the ground doing the letter-boxing, handing out the how-tovote cards, coming with us to street stalls and doing whatever is asked of them so that they can help contribute to a possible election of a Labor government. I would also like to thank my staff-Joshua Brown, Halina Paczynski, Karen Jurd, Charmaine Burnett, Bobby Bozinovski. Three of those staffers were here for an election for the first time, so they really knew what hit them. They enjoyed it. They put in a huge effort, as all our staff always do, and I thank them for that. Around this place we hear a lot of discussion about our families and the knocks that they take because of our life here and the time that we have to spend away from them. I would like to thank my family: my husband, Reg, my daughter, Naomi, my son, Robert, and my mum and dad. I would also like to express my thanks to Steve Dempsey and his hard working team at the Charlton divisional office of the AEC, which includes divisional assistant Loreto Small, the divisional clerk Belinda Bennett as well as the rest of the team: Micheal Cuneen, Belinda Barnes, Roslyn Ford, Judy Cawley, Peter Orre, Robyn Turner and Graeme Turnball. Stephen and his staff were diligent, impartial and a model of committed public service. The result in Charlton demonstrates the electorate’s continued support of me as its elected representative and of the general policies and core philosophy of the Australian Labor Party. I thank them all for being a part of that over the last three years. I am very proud to have been part of Labor’s campaign and I will continue to pursue the issues that I believe are important to our community. While I was pleased with our local result, the national result and the re-election of John Howard as Prime Minister have left me and many other Australians devastated and with a sense of deep disappointment and despair. With the unfortunate situation of the government having control of the Senate, it is inevitable that the government will sell the rest of Telstra, ramp up the attacks on workers and all but obliterate unions and implement draconian terrorism laws. Labor’s term in opposition must be dedicated to being effective in applying pressure on the government and to promoting the Australian Labor Party as the only party committed to access for all to social justice, equity, tolerance and humanitarianism. I look forward to the opportunity to continue working with and for the people of Charlton. There are also local issues that I will continue to pursue. One of these-members would have heard me speak about this yesterday-concerns the Lake Macquarie Integrated Transport System. I will continue to pursue this issue in the parliament, both with government members and with our shadow ministers, as I have done in the past. This is a proposal for a major infrastructure development in my electorate. The Lake Macquarie council identified an urgent need for the development of a transport hub in Glendale, known as the Lake Macquarie Integrated Transport System. The project is a major infrastructure development for the Hunter region and will generate job growth, improve access to public transport and provide environmental benefits for Lake Macquarie. Ms Hall-It is something you have worked very hard for. MAIN COMMITTEE years in excess of 1,000 new employment positions have been created in Lake Macquarie, most within the Cardiff industrial park. It is proposed that the estate be expanded and further developed. The industrial area houses major transport and manufacturing firms which provide employment and major export revenue for Australia. However, businesses are hindered by inefficient road links to the F3 freeway, and Lake Macquarie council’s proposed transport strategy should alleviate this problem. Since before my election in 1998 I have continued to lobby the Commonwealth to participate in a whole-of-government approach to the centre. My approaches have been repeatedly refused by various coalition government members. There has been ongoing consultation and discussion concerning transport infrastructure in the Hunter region, and there will continue to be so over the years. I encourage the Commonwealth to become a part of those discussions. I also put our shadow minister for regional development and roads, Kelvin Thomson, on notice that I will continue to knock on his door and hound him, as I hounded his predecessors, on the virtues-economic and social-of providing Commonwealth support for this major project. Another important local issue-not unrelated to, and geographically close to, Glendale-is the future remediation and future use of the closed Pasminco smelter site at Cockle Creek. Members would be aware that the Cockle Creek smelter in my electorate closed in September 2003, leaving hundreds of workers without a job and leaving a huge site contaminated by lead from over a century of smelting. The position currently is that a $6 million demolition plan has been submitted to Lake Macquarie City Council. The former lead and zinc smelter was a key part of life in Boolaroo, and it will now be levelled to the concrete slabs below the landmark buildings on the site. The site itself is close to the Cardiff industrial area and it has been earmarked for light industrial use. If the plan goes ahead for industry to be constructed on this site, the aim is to create an extra 7,200 jobs in the area by the year 2020, taking the employment in that whole region to 21,000. Just recently, there has been a debate about the heritage value of the site. People might remember, when the BHP plant closed, the discussion about various heritage aspects being kept on the site to maintain its significance to the industry in our region over the last century. It has been publicised that the buildings at the Pasminco smelter would be removed piece by piece to minimise lead dust pollution. However, the old lab has been identified as having significant heritage value and there needs to be some discussion about how the heritage items are going to be preserved. The Newcastle Industrial Heritage Association president, Victor Cattaneo, who is also a good friend of mine, said his association has worked with Pasminco to assess heritage issues on the site and has already identified several hundred important relics that should be preserved. We are not saying that they need to be preserved on the site to stop any further use of the site; they just need to be preserved. I encourage all parties in these discussions to work together to pursue positive outcomes for employment, the environment and our heritage in this area. In our region, a skills shortage is another stark challenge we face. As with the Pasminco site, if there is going to be a light industrial area we need to have the qualified tradespeople with the appropriate skills to be able to fill the over 7,000 jobs that are going to be created. We do not believe that some technical schools scattered around the country are going to do it. MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Governor General S Speech
188,Ms Hoare,"In conjunction with my colleague the member for Shortland. In the past 10We already have the infrastructure in place with the TAFE system, and that is what we need to invest Commonwealth funding into, and also into more vocational training in high schools. The vacancies for skilled tradespeople have increased by over 50 per cent over the last three years. These figures reveal a large increase in demand for skilled workers in key areas, including the metal trades, automotive, electrical and construction industries, and particularly in the Newcastle-Lake Macquarie region. This increase in skilled vacancies is clear evidence that the Howard government has been dragging its feet while a severe skills shortage has developed on its watch. The Howard government’s belated and half-hearted response to Australia’s skills crisis is a handful of technical colleges that will not be fully in place for other four years and will do nothing to help Australian businesses that are crying out for more skilled workers now. Instead of wasting millions of dollars in duplicating the TAFE system, the government should act to address the urgent skills shortages now, fund our TAFEs properly and get more young people into apprenticeships in areas of skills shortage. Australian businesses cannot afford to wait another four years; they need skilled workers now. In our region, we have many good business, union and community leaders proactively seeking innovative methods of attracting young people into trades. For too long, if young people were to leave school in year 10 or complete year 12 but not go on to university, they were encouraged into the so-called ‘sexy’ trades and traineeships in the hospitality and IT industries. We are not saying that we should not be encouraging that, but we should also be encouraging young people to go into the metal, electrical and carpentry trades. I, for one, know that I will be encouraging one of my children into that area if he so wishes because I know that he would have a good, strong career ahead of him, particularly in our region. It is only the first week of parliament for 2005, and the third week of the parliament’s sittings since the 2004 election, and we have already seen two broken promises from this government. The first is what I believe ensured that the Howard government was re-elected-the promise that there would be no interest rate rises. The Reserve Bank has forecast that at the next round there will be an interest rate rise of about a quarter of one per cent. We all know and see around us young couples who are starting out and starting a family. They might earn $100,000 or $150,000 a year between them and they have gone out and mortgaged themselves to the eyeballs. They have bought $500,000, $600,000 or $800,000 houses. We see it in the cities all around us and in my region of Lake Macquarie. What this means is that a half, a quarter or a one per cent rise in interest rates could push these families to the wall. It could mean that they have to sell their dream homes and move into smaller homes. The promise that interest rates would not rise was the reason that these families voted for the conservative government, and now they are going to see that promise being broken as interest rates will rise. The second promise that we have already seen broken is the $830 million election promise to force pharmaceutical companies to cut drug prices. There are indications that the government is going to water down that promise. We are yet to see the outcome of those deliberations, but we know that that will be another broken promise. I want to congratulate Margaret Scott of Coal Point, one of my constituents in Lake Macquarie who was an Australia Day award winner, on receiving an OAM. She is very well known in our region, and my colleague the member for Shortland would know her through her interest in the health and aged services in our area. Margaret was recognised for her conMAIN COMMITTEE tribution to nursing in the general health and aged care sectors over many, many years. Margaret has been involved in various consultations I have had with various shadow ministers on ways to address the health system, in particular the problems with the ageing population. I know she was very proud and chuffed, although she thought, ‘I’ve only been doing my job.’ But she has really given a lot. I know her parents, Ruby and Ted Miller. Ruby is a very good friend of mine. I see her down at the gym every now and then. She was so proud and very chuffed, and Margaret’s award is also a tribute to the upbringing, the close family unit and the support that she has had. In conclusion, I wish good luck to all the school students for the next 12 months. To those who are starting school for the first time in kindergarten or year 1, as it is called in some states-it is called kindergarten in New South Wales-and to those who have progressed from year 6 and starting high school, going from being the eldest kids in the school to being the youngest ones, it is sometimes a traumatic time but it is also a very exciting and challenging time. I also wish good luck to those students who left school last year and are embarking on the next stage of their lives, whether it be a career, university or travelling for 12 months, as many young people do before they go to university. For the years ahead Kim Beazley will be our leader, and we have a forward-thinking, forward-looking team. We are on a mission: to win government at the 2007 election. We have a promise to keep to those people who have voted for Labor over and over again, to our constituents who have increased their support for us, and that is to deliver a Labor government in 2007. In the meantime, as we have seen in the last couple of days in particular, we will continue to hold the government accountable for the decisions and funding announcements that are made, and to question the accountability and transparency of various government programs. (Time expired) (10.25 a.m.)-At 8.53 p.m. on 31 August 1993 I rose for the first time in this place to speak as the federal member for Sturt. At the age of 26, I was the youngest member of the House of Representatives. At that time there were almost 90,000 long-term unemployed young people, we had the most highly taxed wine industry in the world and we had a situation where the sales tax system was impeding our exports. In the 1993 budget, we saw significant sales tax and petrol excise increases, making life more and more difficult for the average Australian. In 1993, 43,000 young people were denied a place at university and 100,000 failed to get a place in TAFE. The Australian Labor Party had a taxation system that disproportionately affected lower income earners, and they increased HECS payments and accelerated the repayment schedule on students. In 1993 one in six people were looking for work. There were five bankruptcies every day in South Australia. Between 450,000 and 500,000 children were living in poverty, 1.85 million were living in relative poverty and 1.1 million were living in absolute poverty. In 1993 I said that there were three important aims of government: to create an environment where equality of opportunity can truly exist, to alleviate hardship and to alleviate all forms of human poverty. The federal coalition government has helped to move Australian society a long way towards these goals. Unemployment rates are at their lowest since the Fraser government was in power in 1976. The Howard government has created almost 1.5 million jobs since it came into power in MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Governor General S Speech
189,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing)1996. The youth unemployment rate has been cut by almost 40 per cent, and apprenticeships have increased more than threefold so that now over 416,000 people are involved in the New Apprenticeships scheme. Real wages have risen by 13½ per cent since 1996, compared with a measly 2½ per cent increase over the 13 years of Labor rule. Coupled with higher retention rates at high school, there has been an increase in higher education funding of almost $1 billion over 1995 levels and there will be an additional 34,000 HECS places in higher education by 2008. Small business has been helped and will continue to be helped by the coalition government. There are 1.2 million small businesses in Australia employing 3.3 million Australians. Small business provides 80 per cent of the job growth in this country. As such, the simplified taxation system has been extended to small businesses that account on an accruals basis. Now as many as 750,000 small businesses report their business activity statement and lodge their GST payment only once a year. Most importantly, the coalition government will try to encourage the enterprise culture of Australia by introducing an entrepreneurs tax discount of 25 per cent to eligible small businesses, delivering savings of more than $900 million over the next four years. It is only through support like this that we can advance the Australian ethos of ambition, hard work and calculated risk-taking. I have been privileged to serve the residents of Sturt in this House for nearly 12 years. In every campaign I learn a little bit more about what is important to the people of Sturt. My fourth campaign as the federal member for Sturt was as busy and productive as every other campaign that I have been involved in. Throughout the election cycle, I hold local community meetings based on the old-style town hall meetings. They provide my constituents with an opportunity to meet and discuss issues of importance to them and the community in a relaxed and friendly environment. During the campaign, I have an intense program of local community meetings which are a positive experience as I learn more about what is important to my constituents, and they have the opportunity to hear about federal government programs and receive answers to any queries that they may have. In the lead-up to this election I developed a 10-point plan for my electorate. Each point is an issue that is of great importance to my constituents. For the recent election I focused on working with local councils to fence all playgrounds, working with the state government to create an underpass from Kensington Road to Wakefield Street at the Britannia roundabout, promoting apprenticeships and exploring the establishment of a technical high school in our area, working with local councils and the state government to establish an appropriate urban planning regime for our area, persisting with the campaign to save the Murray-Darling Basin, ensuring the eastern and north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide are well served by modern Internet access, providing for our older Australians through the development of more aged care facilities in Sturt, ensuring the gains made by self-funded retirees in the last eight years are protected and extended, and continuing to fight to preserve our local heritage. During my local community meetings I highlighted four points of this plan. These were the fencing of playgrounds in particular local council areas, the proposed upgrade of the Britannia roundabout on the eastern outskirts of the Adelaide CBD, the re-establishment of technical colleges and the plight of the River Murray. These were all issues that clearly resonated with my constituents. As the father of three children under the age of 4½, I have noticed the lack of fencing around playgrounds in my local council area. In discussions with my friends and with MAIN COMMITTEE other locals in the community, it has become quite apparent that this was something that was of common concern amongst the families of my electorate. I have become aware, like many other parents, that I would rather take my children by car to a playground in the neighbouring suburbs or into the parklands of the Adelaide CBD where playgrounds are fenced rather than take them to the unfenced areas of the eastern suburbs. The additional security offered by these fences makes them a more attractive option for many parents and grandparents. I must say that on the many visits my wife, children and I make to playgrounds in the CBD, North Adelaide and Unley, it is noticeable how many friends from the eastern suburbs are present as well, avoiding the playgrounds of the eastern suburbs. Fences are an excellent safety addition to playgrounds for several reasons. While every parent and grandparent knows the importance of watching their children, they are also aware that when you are trying to look after several children it is very easy for one of them to escape your attention. While there has been a lowering of speed limits on local roads, many of the playgrounds in my electorate are on major roads that have much higher traffic flows and higher speed limits. It is a sad indictment on our society today that parents and grandparents are often keenly aware of who is around a playground and are particularly alert to those who may not belong. A fenced playground means that you know exactly who is there, and a person not in the company of a child raises immediate wariness. Some councils have sadly now gone to the extent of requiring adults to be in the company of a child if they enter a fenced playground. SoI will be working closely with local councils in my electorate to ensure that we are providing the best protection possible for children. Even though the Britannia roundabout, which is at the intersection of Kensington Road, Dequetteville Terrace, Fullarton Road and Wakefield Road, is on the outskirts of my electorate, it is a major intersection and feeds directly into the Sturt area. The South Australian state Labor government recently announced that traffic lights are the best solution for the intersection. I find this a miserable response for the eastern and north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. The Rann government in 2004 announced a $43 million investment in road upgrades in the north-western suburbs of Adelaide, part of an overall $300 million investment aimed primarily at the Port Adelaide region. Yet the Premier manages to find only $8 million of funds to upgrade a major bottleneck in and out of the eastern suburbs in my electorate. It is estimated that 10,000 drivers a day avoid the Britannia roundabout. The toll that this takes on the back streets and other major roads in my area is immeasurable. The state Labor government has released a short-term solution, one that will not allow the intersection to grow and develop, and has not been well received by the very people it will affect most. The Britannia intersection concept status report that was released in November 2003 by the South Australian state government said: In October 2000, an underpass scheme was developed to overcome the existing operating deficiencies, but due to the high cost of this option its further consideration has been deferred to a long term possibility. It goes on to suggest: This report outlines the state is to provide a lower cost and interim upgrade of the intersection, which would provide a significant difference to the performance of the location for at least the next ten years. The state government has accepted that the traffic-light solution is a short-term one. The thought that the South Australian government would upgrade the intersection in 10 years time, MAIN COMMITTEE as the report suggests, after $8 million has been spent, is laughable. The concept report has already been released for over one year and the initial report that considered an underpass is now more than four years old. With the actual construction of an interim solution as suggested to take some time, it will be getting close to 10 years before the current plans are even completed. Are the constituents of the eastern and north-eastern suburbs really to believe that construction will then begin again on a final long-term solution? The interim program of the state government for traffic lights at the Britannia roundabout must be stopped-and I intend to campaign against it with the support, I hope, of the majority of my electorate-in favour of a long-term solution, an underpass from Kensington Road to Wakefield Street, in order to avoid accidents and damage and the fear that people in the eastern and north-eastern suburbs have of using that busy intersection. I intend to approach the federal government to try to secure additional funds for this intersection to allow a more feasible, forward looking solution. I also raise the coalition government’s reintroduction of technical colleges into the education system. As we face a shortage of skilled tradespeople due partly to low unemployment, the announcement of the re-establishment of a technical college network, directly funded by the federal government and run by local communities, was warmly received in my electorate, particularly by my constituents who may remember the previous incarnation of the system in South Australia. The new technical colleges will be open to students from years 11 and 12 and they will offer students a valuable combination of technical skills as well as the traditional curriculum of English, science and mathematics. Although each school may specialise in a particular trade, each one will offer at least four different trades from commercial cookery, vehicle trades such as mechanics and repair work, engineering, electrical trades and construction. The inclusion of the traditional year 12 curriculum is important as it does not limit or disqualify technical school students from applying for university. The technical colleges will be a collaboration of local businesses, TAFE colleges and universities, both government and non-government local schools, and local training enterprises. Establishment of the colleges will be by tender process, with funding coming directly from the federal government to be managed by the school itself. The principal of the school will have the ability to employ teaching staff on a performance basis and will be able to choose from people with real life and up-to-date technical experience. Seventy per cent of Australian school leavers do not go directly to university from high school. There has been a remarkable absence of support for those who do not wish to go to higher education institutions. Youth allowance and Austudy for the over 25-year-olds will be extended from 1 July this year to include new apprentices. This is expected to help up to 93,000 new apprentices by 2008 and 2009. The River Murray is an integral part of South Australia. We have the Murray mouth, many of its beautiful wetlands along its course and some of the most stunning scenery, and in Adelaide we rely on this vital lifeline for 40 per cent of our drinking water. This is recognised by many South Australians but can, sadly, be underestimated by the eastern states. At several of my local community meetings the River Murray dominated questions that I took from the audience. There is keen recognition of the problem, and the National Water Initiative is a step in the right direction. Signed in June last year at the Council of Australian Governments, the NWI finally begins to deliver promises and commitments necessary to restore the once MAIN COMMITTEE mighty river to even a fraction of its former glory. We now have a framework in place to allow proper regulation of water usage and allocation and to deliver to water consumers and those investing in the water industry the confidence to plan for the future. At the same time the restoration of six key environmental points along the river will be delivered-the first step in a long process. The Living Murray Scientific Reference Panel reported in 2003 that even 350 gigalitres of additional water flow would benefit the Murray-Darling Basin. Of course the Howard federal government was able to far surpass that with an initial commitment of an additional 500 gigalitres at a cost of $500 million. This is on top of the $3 billion Natural Heritage Trust and the $1.5 billion National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. But these are only the first steps in the right direction. The Murray-Darling Basin must continue to be monitored, and a plan must continue to be developed. The Murray is vital not just to Adelaide and South Australia; it is the lifeblood for so many industries in rural Australiasuch as wine, citrus, beef and lamb-and for the towns that support those industries. Since the election, I have been fortunate to have been appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott. He has given me a number of portfolio areas, including the Therapeutic Goods Administration, mental health and suicide prevention, asthma, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, food safety and policy, gene technology regulation, blood and organ donation, nuclear safety, autism and the assessment of chemicals and their safety. Drugs, alcohol and tobacco are great problems facing our society today. While great inroads have been made into these areas there is still a long way to go. The awareness of mental health is slowly increasing, but it is still greatly misunderstood in our community. The problems facing society in these fields are not going to fix themselves and nor are they are going to be fixed by the federal government alone or by any one part of the community. The work we need to undertake must be a coordinated effort-a cooperation between federal and state governments, associated stakeholders in the health industry and the community itself, particularly parents and individuals. I look forward to representing the minister and the government in these areas. I would like to comment on some aspects of the mental health debate that we have been having in recent days. The case of Cornelia Rau has highlighted a very important deficiency in mental health services in this country. It has certainly come as a shock to me and, I think, a shock to many Australians that mental health services in New South Wales could have been so poor as to allow Cornelia Rau to have left the institution in which she was recovering without any attempt having been made to find out where she was and what she was doing. It highlights a very important point. When the deinstitutionalisation of mental health services occurred across this country in the early nineties, it was something we all welcomed-we still welcome it today. For those suffering from mental illness, there is today a greater understanding that this is an illness that can be fixed, monitored and looked after. They are welcomed into our community-and so they should be. In fact, mental health, depression and many other aspects of this issue affect almost every Australian family. When deinstitutionalisation occurred, the states did not put the same amount of money into support for the mentally ill at the community level as they had put into institutions. They used deinstitutionalisation as an opportunity to save money in the health area-and we are bearing the consequences of that today. If the Cornelia Rau incident tells us nothing else, it tells us MAIN COMMITTEE that the states stand condemned for their lack of financial support for mental health services in this country over the last 10 years. It is little known that the Commonwealth accounts for 55 per cent of all mental health spending in this country, yet we do not have constitutional responsibility for mental health in this country. We are doing it because it needs to be done; it is important and we want to help and work with the states. But the states need to pull their weight as well. In the last round of Commonwealth health funding, the Commonwealth increased its spending on mental health by 128 per cent; the states increased their spending by 40 per cent. Yet the states have primary responsibility for mental health services in this country. SoI call on the states to lift their game in the area of mental health-to use the unfortunate incident surrounding Cornelia Rau as a springboard for the improvement of mental health services for those around the country who are in need of them. They will get the support of the Commonwealth government if they do so, but they must take responsibility for those areas of state services that are their responsibility and not the Commonwealth’s. I look forward to representing the people of Sturt in this House for the next three years. to the Governor General’s speech, is the first debate following the return of the government after an election. It is somewhat strange standing here in February after the October election, which was quite some time ago. But, as with other speakers, I intend to speak in the addressin-reply debate, as I would have had it occurred before the parliament rose at Christmas. At the outset I want to acknowledge and thank the people of Brisbane for the great honour they have once again given me in voting for me to represent them in our national parliament. I particularly want to thank the band of hard working people who were part of my campaign team, without whom it would not have been possible for me to be in the parliament. I also want to place on the record the support my family have provided me, not just in the election campaign but also for an extended period of time. Those of us who have families, partners and loved ones know how much they are required to sacrifice in order for us to do the work we do in this place. It is seldom recognised. Indeed, from time to time, people in the media enjoy taking pot shots at those things, and the sacrifices our families make in these circumstances are quite substantial. That was driven home to me over the Christmas vacation-so soon after the election which for all of us was a time of increased activity above what is normally a busy schedule anyway-when, as I was leaving for the office in the morning, my 10-year-old son wanted to know whether I was going to Canberra again. When I said that I was not he told his mother he was very happy. He also made the comment, after I was returned to the frontbench, that he was ‘happy and sad for Dad’ that I was back on the frontbench. It was a reminder that we are all mortal and that we all have personal lives. The things we sacrifice as members we sacrifice willingly in a sense and we receive rewards from our motivation and desire. Our families do not always share that same depth of motivation and desire but they have to make similar sacrifices. SoI want to take this opportunity to place on the record my very deep appreciation for the sacrifices my family have made. Once again, I thank the people of Brisbane who on the last six occasions have placed their trust and faith in me to represent them in this parliament. MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Governor General S Speech
190,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (10.45 A.m.),"The debate we are having now, the address-in-replyThe first thing we do after returning from an election is swear an oath of allegiance or make an affirmation of office. While I have made this comment on previous occasions, I think it needs to be made again. When I tell people in my electorate, particularly at citizenship ceremonies where oaths and affirmations are made, that as a member of parliament I am not required to make a similar oath or affirmation, that I am not required to pledge myself to the people of Australia, our laws and democratic principles but that I am obliged to give an oath or affirmation pledging myself to Queen Elisabeth II, her heirs and successors, my constituents are quite surprised. They are taken aback that that is the pledge that the members they elect to their national parliament are required to make. It is time to for us to look at changing that. When changing the oath or affirmation for people to become Australian citizens was first raised as an issue a decade ago, there was some controversy about that. I do not know anybody who believes that the oath or affirmation that people give today to become Australian citizens is anything but appropriate and uplifting. I do not know anybody who thinks that they should, as they once were, be required to pledge themselves and their loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors. People today who go to those services will hear new Australians say: From this time forwardeither under God or not, depending upon whether it is an affirmation or an oathI pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect and whose laws I will uphold and obey. I think that is a very fine set of words, and all of us who attend citizenship ceremonies know that they embody the sentiment of new Australians and their families and friends who are present. It is about time we in this parliament made an oath or affirmation in similar terms to similar principles. The sooner we have a serious debate in this parliament about changing our members oath and affirmation of office the better. I encourage members on both sides, in a non-partisan way, to encourage debate with their colleagues so that we can adopt an oath or affirmation for members of this parliament that represents the will, the wishes and the desires of the Australian people and takes us into the 21st century, rather than lingering in the 19th. I also want to comment on the process of parliamentary elections. A number of statesindeed most states in Australia-now have four-year terms. Many countries have national parliaments elected for four years. Indeed, some have parliaments elected for five years. Our national parliament is elected for three years, involving six-year terms for senators, usually with half coming up for election every three years. It is time both sides of politics recognised publicly what we all say privately, which is that a three-year variable term is simply inadequate for the proper management of the nation. There is no enterprise in this country that would endeavour to operate its affairs on the basis of rolling three-year changes in direction. In fact, they are not three-year terms; they are usually a few months short of three years. If you take out the caretaker period of government before the election and you then take out another couple of months after the election for the transition process, even if the same party is re-elected-there is always a process of reconsideration of positions and the like-you are looking at an effective period of about 2½ years out of every three-year block in which the proper management of the nation is being run as it should be. There will always be a transition period in a democratic environment, but it is MAIN COMMITTEE about time we moved to four-year fixed terms. We could pick a day-the first Saturday of December or the first Saturday of March; frankly, I do not care which day of the year it isand say that every four years that is the day on which our national parliament will be elected. There is always a question raised in this debate about Senate elections. If we kept the existing formula, it would mean senators being elected for eight years, or the whole Senate being elected every four years. Both of those options have drawbacks-and I acknowledge thatbut neither of those drawbacks, in my view, is as big an impediment to the proper law-making and functioning of the Australian parliament as the problem we presently confront with three year terms which, in practice, end up being 2½-year terms. We should be, again on a bipartisan basis, promoting a debate in this parliament about fixed four-year terms. I think that an eight-year term in the Senate is too long. It creates some concerns for me in terms of the basic principles of accountability. I understand the concerns about an entire Senate being elected in one hit, rather than half, at successive elections, but unless we as members of parliament encourage a debate on these matters we are never going to overcome the problems. There is no way that we will address the needs of our nation in a rapidly changing world in the 21st century if we condemn future governments to these cycles of 2½-year terms of office. The sooner we raise a serious debate about that, the better I think Australia will be. The other broad issue I want to raise in this debate relates to a republic. It is an issue that bubbles along every now and then and, since the referendum, it has been in the background. During the referendum the people of Brisbane voted quite overwhelmingly in favour of the question. The one question, though, that the Australian people have never been offered the opportunity to vote on is the simple question: do you believe Australia should be a constitutional monarchy or a constitutional republic? It is a simple question and the government has run away from allowing the people of Australia to have that simple choice. I have no doubt in my mind that, if a plebiscite was held where that was the question before the Australian people, a substantial majority-an overwhelming majority-of Australians would say they believe this country should be a constitutional republic and not a monarchy. We should give the Australian people that simple choice. There is nothing to be afraid of in allowing the Australian people a vote in these matters. Let the Australian people decide that threshold question-no games of constitutional conventions, no games of parliamentary committees and none of the political shenanigans that from time to time we see from all sides of politics in other debates. Let us allow the Australian people a clear, simple choice: do they think we should be a republic or a monarchy? Once that question is settled, then we can move on to resolve other matters in the debate. I want to turn now to some aspects of the last election campaign and the way in which some things have unfolded. I have noted over the course of the last few years-and we have even seen it from government members in the debate in this chamber today-a focus of Liberal-National Party members not on anything to do with their responsibilities here in Canberra or matters that the federal government is responsible for but on campaigning on state and local government issues. Earlier in this debate the member for Sturt spent a good deal of time talking about road issues in which the Commonwealth has no involvement. That might be a keen thing to campaign on locally-but all of us know what the game is. As an organised activity, the Liberal Party have encouraged their members and candidates to avoid talking about the things for which John Howard and this government are responsible. They have encourMAIN COMMITTEE aged their people to talk about local police stations, local roads and local hospitals-anything that is the responsibility of state or local governments-but to steer clear of the things that they are actually responsible for here in Canberra. That three-card trick has worked to a greater or lesser degree in different parts of the country. The problem that the Liberal and National parties have is that this three-card trick has a shelf life. It is a game you can play for a while, but not forever. They played this game over the last 12 months or so to a greater or lesser extent, depending on who was doing it and where they were; but, frankly, the jig is up. There are a number of people in the press gallery and in the public who are, increasingly, understanding the duplicity of the Liberal-National Party campaigning in these matters. I am more concerned, though, with what I see as an undermining of Australian society and ethics. We now have a situation where the government’s efforts to carve off minority groups, to victimise minority groups and to set the majority against the minority has reached a point where it undermines the fabric of our society. This sinister game was played in 2001 when people on the Tampa were set upon and victimised. I well recall that the member for Moreton, who is now the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, said during the debate on the Tampa that there was not one refugee on the Tampa. His exact words were that they were all ‘occasional tourists’. There was an effort to demonise people because they were different. The same thing has happened in the past to others who might appear different to the mainstream. Whether that difference is ethnic background, skin colour, religious background or because they are in minority organisations, that willingness to persecute and set apart minority groups for political gain has been an effective ploy in the short term but a terribly destructive vehicle in the long term. This issue should transcend grubby party politics, but this game has been played by this government and this Prime Minister in two successive elections and I think it is time that some of the people in the government who know this game is being played and understand the consequences of it rise above it. Politics in Australia has become an auction for votes. People are encouraged not to look at the national good or the situation of the next-door neighbour or the person down the street who is less well off. People are encouraged to say and think, ‘How much will you give me for my vote?’ There has always been an element of that in politics-it used to be described as appealing to the hip-pocket nerve; it is not a new invention-but we now have a situation where it is being cultivated in an uncritical manner. The Prime Minister handed out $6 billion at an election campaign launch-$6 billion was promised in an afternoon! That is a pretty substantial lolly to put in front of the public. It will be interesting to see how much of that lolly ends up being delivered at the end of the day. That situation stands in stark contrast to what we all say are the high ideals of public office. When he wants to, the Prime Minister can, with some enthusiasm and apparent integrity, talk about the importance of public life, but when he gets down to the nitty-gritty of politics he is in the gutter playing the divisive card and trying to auction off people’s votes. I wonder what would have happened in 2004 if someone had stood up and made the comment that John F. Kennedy made in his inauguration speech, which is often referred to. He said, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.’ I suspect that if one of the major political leaders had said that in the context of the 2004 election they would have been laughed out of the room and ridiculed by most of the political commentators. But there is a MAIN COMMITTEE real loss of public identity and public well-being in that process. In our national parliament we should not be concerned just with the grubby chase for votes; we should be concerned for the national good. We, as decent human beings in a civilised society, should be concerned for those people in less well-off positions than us. Most of the things that I, as a member of parliament, vote for in these areas disadvantage me personally, but I happen to think they are good public policy. I happen to think those are the right things to do for my electors in Brisbane. I happened to think they are the right things to do for our nation in the long run. If we cannot raise these things for serious consideration in an address-in-reply speech, I am not sure where we can. It is time that people started to take stock of the impact of the political games that have been foisted upon the public, particularly in the last decade or so. We are undermining an important characteristic of Australian society-a decent, caring characteristic which was part of what Australians prided themselves on. What about the national good? What about our neighbours? What about those who are less well off? Let us strive for the higher ideals. There were a number of issues in the last election that were important in the electorate of Brisbane. None was more important than health: the provision of quality health care, the access to bulk-billing, and Medicare. As I have for the last few years, I will continue to fight very hard to ensure that the people of Brisbane are able to maintain access to those services. I also have a very strong commitment to access to quality education for all Australians. That is becoming much more difficult as a result of this government’s policies. Under this government, schools are now funded in a discriminatory manner that ensures that need no longer counts. Those with the greatest wealth receive the greatest increases. Those in greatest need are left to run chook raffles and chocolate wheels. There is a fundamental injustice in the way in which this government has administered education funding and it needs to be addressed. The way in which access to tertiary education is now structured provides a significant benefit to those who are already wealthy. If you can afford to pay up front, not only do you receive a substantial financial benefit-the discount has just been reduced to 15 per cent-but a lower academic record is required for you to get into a course than the record required of HECS students who cannot pay full fees up front. If you can pay up front you can get into a law degree at the University of Queensland with a rating that is two points lower than someone entering as a HECS student. So if you have the money to pay up front this government lets you do a course that you could not do if you did not have the $150,000 in the bank needed to pay for that upfront fee. That discriminates against people with ability in favour of people who are wealthy. That is un-Australian; that is indecent. It is one of the outcomes of this government’s higher education funding. The environment is an important issue in the electorate of Brisbane and throughout the country but time will not allow me to go into that issue today. I have no doubt that over the course of this parliament we will have ample opportunity to pursue it. Once again I thank the people of Brisbane, my family and my campaign team, and I look forward to serving them well over the course of the next three years. in this debate, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the address-in-reply, the first debate of a new parliament that comes after the election. All of us who are here are reminded in the first debate of just what an honour and a privilege it is to be here in this representative house of the MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Governor General S Speech
191,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (11.05 A.m.),"Like a lot of members who are speakingAustralian people. We represent the combined majority will of the electors, the voters, in our respective electorates and do so to the best of our ability irrespective of the different philosophies and beliefs that we might have in this place. I say to those new members who have given their first speeches-one is here today and all the others have already spoken in the debate: congratulations on your election. No-one gets to the House of Representatives without huge effort, and I acknowledge that, and nobody comes here, in my view, without wanting to do good things for their electorate and the Australian people. I also pay tribute to the friends and supporters in the electorate of Casey who made my election possible in 2004 and earlier in 2001. The process of election in a democracy is an ongoing thing in many ways, but none of us could do it on our own; we all recognise that. I firmly believe that people who take part in the political process, whether they are members of my party, the Liberal Party or the National Party or-dare I even say it-the Australian Labor Party, do the country a great service because without political involvement in democracy, without that sort of effort that goes in, we would not have the sorts of results that we have. The process of election in a free and democratic country like Australia is a wonderful thing, but because it is so peaceful and happens without rancour every three or four years we are inclined sometimes to take it a bit for granted. We are inclined to forget that the very rights, liberties and freedoms that allow democratic elections are the norm. We should never forget, and now in the first debate of the new parliament is a good time not to forget, just how in the sweep of world history what a young thing democracy still is and in global terms what a rare thing democracy is even today. Certainly democracy has spread far and wide since its inception, but the number of people who still live in countries and continents where there are not the freedoms we take for granted is still vast and quite extensive. I and many of us-including, I know, my colleague the member for Blair, who is next to me-were all reminded of this by the recent elections in Iraq, which came just a few days after Australia Day and in which we saw people prepared to vote despite the danger, the carnage and the threats and awful pledges of terrorists who said they would, and did, maim or murder people who wanted to go and freely exercise their new found right to vote. We saw Iraqis, who for 50 years had no light of freedom or democracy whatsoever, stampede to ballot boxes. The best part about it was we saw them stampede in numbers that both sceptics and optimists never predicted. The people who voted on that day in Iraq, particularly around Baghdad-and we all saw it in the news footage-summed up the importance and the privilege of the right to vote better than any of us could. We saw candidates in numbers nobody predicted. From the situation in Iraq a few short years ago-no democracy, with Saddam Hussein in control-now to have an election is in itself a miracle but to have 228 parties and 19,000 candidates, brave people, who were prepared to put their names forward, with 5,000 or more polling stations and a very high voter turnout-at the very least 60 per cent ranging to 80 per cent in some areas-said it all. One man said, ‘We’re defeating the terrorists as we come here. We want to be and live like all people, like all human beings.’ A Kurdish woman said, ‘This is the happiest day my life.’ One man said, ‘This is our badge of pride.’ Another said, ‘FirstI was nervous because security is not stable, but we came anyway to put our votes in boxes. These elections represent the people and decide our fate.’ Another said, ‘Voting is a very good feeling. We want sovereignty and we want to get rid of injustice.’ The stories and anecdotes on our television screens and in MAIN COMMITTEE our newspapers also said it all: the sign on the wall in Baghdad, ‘Don’t live in fear’; a woman in the Kurdish region of Iraq, 94 years of age, demanding to vote and being wheeled in a wheelbarrow by her family-absolutely amazing stories that tell so much about the vibrancy and the insatiable appetite of people for freedom. A few days before those elections, on Australia Day, all of us in this House were reminded of our rich democratic history. You cannot go to an Australia Day service and not think of the wonderful, rich and robust democratic history here in Australia. Like all of us in this place, I attended a number of citizenship ceremonies, Rotary functions, cricket matches and community events. At one of them in Ringwood, radio host John Faine spoke very eloquently about democracy. He made an important point: that not only does Australia have a rich democratic history but we are probably the most democratic nation on earth in terms of our conduct. It is probably the defining feature of Australia. He gave the example, from his line of work as a radio commentator, about how, as much as we take it for granted, he can speak to the Prime Minister, to the Leader of the Opposition, to ministers and shadow ministers, and about how he can quiz them, ask them anything or have an argument with them, and then open the discussion up to talkback where people from any suburb in Australia can ring in and say exactly what is on their mind in a frank Australian way and everyone else can hear the question and answer. To us it is not a big thing. It is part of our Australian democracy. John Faine made the important point that in the United States no President has ever done that and probably never will. In the United Kingdom, no British Prime Minister has done that, but that accessibility is part and parcel of the Australian democracy and makes our country so wonderfully democratic. I believe our democracy is very strong-it is the envy of the world. One of the reasons for that is that we have always been prepared to look at whether we are doing things as well as we possibly can. Should we change things to update and nurture our democracy to keep it strong into the future? One area where I believe we should have a discussion is the question of whether we should move to a voluntary voting system some time in the future. I raise this but emphasise, as has the Prime Minister and as have other senior ministers, that the government will not in this parliamentary term change our voting system. There will not be any change for the next election and that is right and proper. We did not promise to change our voting system and we will not be doing so in this parliament. In fact, we do not even have a policy to change it. But this does provide a wonderful opportunity to discuss now and in the future the merits of voluntary voting in a way where people do not move to their usual burrows or fear a hasty decision. The knowledge that there is not going to be a change before the next electionMs Burke-We can go down the US model. That’d be so good, wouldn’t it! otherwise of the proposition. As I said, perhaps with the exception of the member for Chisholm, the rest of us could have a calm and considered debate. It is certainly possible for 149 of us, but we have always known it is perhaps not possible for the member for Chisholm. In that light, I would say that I personally favour a shift to voluntary voting. I think the right to vote is a precious right. My view is that, on a philosophical and a practical level, voluntary voting would be better, and I have always thought that. I think that the right to vote is very precious, and it is somewhat contradictory to force someone to exercise their vote MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Governor General S Speech
192,Mr Anthony Smith,"would mean we could have that discussion about the merits oragainst their will. That is somewhat against the underlying democratic spirit and the foundation of voting itself. To my way of thinking, a voluntary vote exercised is a truer and more pure reflection of the vibrancy of democracy. That is my point of view. I accept there are other points of view, and I do respect those, but I think that a voluntary system some time in the future would mean that not only would we know that we are here with the support of the majority of our electorate but we would be here with the support of the majority of our electorate who freely wished to go along and vote. Having said that, I do not think for one minute that the number of people who actually would not vote in Australia would be all that high-I really do not. But forcing these people to attend a polling booth and cast a vote against their will is somewhat contradictory to the intent of our democratic system. Those who favour the status quo-those who do not want to ever change-do so on the basis of a number of claims, and I would like to briefly address some of those and perhaps counter them and add to the debate so they can be considered in the future. Firstly, normally the most hysterical claim that is made up front-and we have heard it in here today-is that a shift to voluntary voting would mean we would become just like America or there would be this enormous collapse in interest in democracy. Ms Burke-No, I said by the American system. There is a difference that I think the people should know. that there would be a reduction in interest in democracy in Australia; I think that that very assumption does the Australian people an incredible disservice. Far from it: I actually think there would be an increase in interest in democracy. The focus would shift from the burden of voting for some to whether or not people voted. I think in that classic Australian way there would be a discussion about not just whom people were voting for, which is the sole discussion at the moment, but whether or not they were voting, and the overwhelming character of the Australian people would be, ‘Yeah, you should be in it. Of course you should vote. Of course you should exercise your will.’ And that is what would happen. With respect to the criticisms about declines in the number of people voting in jurisdictions like the US, they should be discussed. But I think what we have to realise is that the US have a system that is not like ours and if we shifted to a voluntary system we would not, and should not, replicate some of the things in the US that result in low voter turnout. There are a number of reasons why the US have a low voter turnout, but one of them is that they have their elections on a Tuesday-and it is not just one election. They have it in the middle of the working week, but they have a series of elections for everything from dog catcher to police chief. The other reason is that voter registration is really quite complicated. You have to register ahead of time, and that means there is a situation where some people wish to vote at the last minute and if they have not registered it is not possible for them to do so. None of that need apply in Australia in any way, shape or form. For a start, our elections are on a Saturday and always would be. That is an important point in considering that. The other point is that the registration process which operates in the US is obviously voluntary as well. Critically, if we move to a voluntary voting system, we would not have to move to a system of voluntary voter enrolment. You could maintain a compulsory voter enrolment which would mean that people would continue by law to be on the electoral roll but it would be voluntary to turn up and vote. I think that would be a necessity. It would mean that people MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Governor General S Speech
193,Mr Anthony Smith,"If we shifted to voluntary voting, I do not for one minute thinkwould not face a situation where, weeks or months before the start of an election campaign, they decided they were not interested and were not going to vote but through the campaign there was a policy event or they became interested and wanted to vote but could not because they had not enrolled. This is not just a hybrid invention; this is precisely the situation that operates in New Zealand. I think New Zealand is a very important comparison. It is a country most like Australia. They have a fine democratic history. We disagree with them on cricket-that is true-but they have for many years had compulsory enrolment and voluntary voting. So, rather than panic in a knee-jerk way and say, ‘If we move to voluntary voting, it’d be just like America, it’d be like the US system, it’d be terrible,’ why not look at the system that is most like Australia? What has happened to their voter turnout? It has remained high all the way through. It is in the high 80s as a percentage every election. Another critical example is Holland, which has shifted in the last 30 years or so from a compulsory system to a voluntary system. Again, its voter turnout has remained very high indeed. These things should be considered-but, as I have said, not in this term of parliament. But we should have a discussion about it. We should not be fearful of having a discussion about moving to a voluntary voting system, something that I think would improve our democracy. One of the misconceptions I have discovered in discussing this with colleagues and debating it in public forums is that proponents of the status quo-those who support compulsory voting-do so with the assumption that we have always had that system in Australia. That is not the case. We have had it for the vast majority of Federation but, for the first 25 years, we had a voluntary voting system. Compulsory voting started in Queensland in about 1915, and it was not until the 1925 election that we shifted to a compulsory system. As we look at these issues in the broad sweep of our democratic traditions, we should do so in the vein that Australia has always been not only a country with a great and rich democratic tradition. We did not just follow the world in electoral reforms; we led it. We led the world in universal and free voting, we led the world in the right to vote for women and we led the world with the introduction of the secret ballot. That tells us that our founding fathers of Federation and, indeed, the representatives of preFederation-because some of these reforms happened at the colonial level-were not fearful of change, discussion or argument about how to improve and nurture our democracy. My view is that we should not be either. We should be able to have a discussion outside the heat of politics, without the false motives that so often happen in these debates, and we should do so over a considerable period of time. And we should do so with the aim of making sure our democracy is the best it can be. It should be a comprehensive sort of debate in this parliament and in the public. When you look back at the debate of 1924 and earlier in the Hansard and read the history of it-and there is some quite good history, written largely by Labor historians, actually-what strikes you about the debate is just how short and insubstantial it was. There were only a few speakers on each side and it went through on the voices. In that light, we should consider it again and do so in a bipartisan way. I think it is something that would be good for our democracy here in Australia in the years ahead. centrate on two issues: the injustices that are perpetrated against our Indigenous peoples, in particular relationship to people within my own electorate in the prison population, and some MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Governor General S Speech
194,Mr Andren (Calare) (11.25 A.m.),"In this address-in-reply debate I would like to conserious concerns that I have about the growing democratic deficit in this country. First of all, I would like to thank all of those people who gave me so much support leading up to and during the recent election. Thanks to my loyal supporter base who again provided volunteers for each of the 93 booths and pre-polling, to my staff and to my boys, Greg and Josh, and my partner, Valerie. The staff has been magnificent. Tim Mahony, my senior adviser and campaign manager; Dianne Abbott, my office manager and superefficient organiser; Helen Bergen, researcher extraordinaire; Eileen Webb, a caring and careful electorate assistant; Brian Hustwayte, my loyal Lithgow assistant; Christian Tancred and all of those helpers and volunteers, especially Chris Tillott and Frances and Tom Hetherington-a huge thanks to them all. The government has predictably claimed a strong mandate given the swing towards it in the lower House and a Senate majority that has caused a great deal of concern in the electorate. Not because it is the coalition with the majority-far from it-but because most people believe it is unhealthy that any governing party in this day and age should enjoy a majority in both houses. The post-June Senate control by the government is an example, I believe, of just how out of touch with modern democratic models such as New Zealand and most European countries is our parliamentary system. A dominant two-party system that can swing, as we have seen, to a one-party government is, I believe, a dangerous anachronism in any modern democracy. The weakness of the opposition support has obviously helped to deliver that outcome. At no time during the campaign or the period leading up to it did I sense that the opposition had won the hearts and minds of the wider electorate. I believe the opposition seriously needs to examine just what it stands for. Those who were looking for a stronger stance from Labor on issues such as the US free trade deal saw nothing apart from some tinkering around pharmaceuticals. Let me tell you there is real, warranted and genuine concern right across the rural sector about the ramifications of that deal. The perception that there will be an inevitable watering down of quarantine barriers to infection and disease is but one of those concerns. The export of manufacturing jobs and the uneven competition field between the two economies is of major concern to farmers and manufacturing workers alike, notwithstanding talk of some cuts in US farm subsidies to help offset a record budget deficit. I point to the likely scaling down of Electrolux in Orange, in my own electorate, as an example of seeking to provide a more competitive outcome but one that does not include the crucial factor of an Australian work force. Most Australians I talk with, including the so called ‘aspirationals’, believe in having government involvement in their lives whether it is in the provision of social infrastructure such as hospitals, schools and social services or of concrete infrastructure such as rail, road and our telecommunications networks-and that includes continued public ownership of Telstra. The nebulous term ‘up to scratch’ has been seized on by this government to justify full privatisation-a sale that has less than 10 per cent support, according to reasonable surveys that have been done in the bush, not only because of continuing gaps and black spots in the phone and Internet system that cannot and will not be papered over by the rhetoric of government or Telstra management. I say ‘not only’ because most rural Australians have drawn a line in the sand and do not accept full privatisation of Telstra under any circumstances. The New South Wales Farmers Association has strongly joined that fight today, saying, ‘No sale until rural services are on par with metropolitan.’ That is many years down the track. This sale will be MAIN COMMITTEE the ultimate test of The Nationals’ credibility, but I and most rural Australians sadly expect to see it fail that test miserably. After all, it was The Nationals’ own Senator Ron Boswell who invented the meaningless phrase ‘up to scratch’. Let me now move to Indigenous affairs. The events at Palm Island and Redfern last year display a failure of policy and a clear sign that Aboriginal Australians have had enough. In the wake of the Palm Island death in custody and violent reaction from the islanders, the Queensland Premier called for more leadership in the Aboriginal community. He bemoaned the lack of leadership from elders. I suggest that the Premier visit the articles of the past few days in the Australian which clearly spell out the highly suspicious circumstances in which Cameron Doomagee died and the ongoing concerns of the Palm Island community that justice will not be done. Notwithstanding that an inquest is about to get under way-and I certainly do not question its objectivity-there is a perception of injustice, especially with the police who were involved being able to decline answering questions on the grounds that it may incriminate them. Is it any wonder that there is a well-tested belief among the Aboriginal community of there being a white justice and a blackfella justice-a justice which locked up rioters after the Doomagee death but, as far as I can ascertain, did not suspend the officer in question. With Aboriginals having a life expectancy of less than 55 years, compared to 74 years for non-Aboriginal Australians, it is not hard to see where the elders are: they are dead or dying. One of those arrested in the wake of the demonstrations was aged 54-one of the island’s elders, no doubt, but one driven to desperate acts by anger at what had allegedly occurred to Cameron Doomagee. While we are rightly concerned at the economic plight of our East Timor neighbours and the continuing incarceration of refugees, especially children, and the mentally ill-finally headlined, as it has been, by the Cornelia Rau tragedy-we have taken our eye off the Aboriginal crisis. Our only Aboriginal senator, Aden Ridgeway-sadly, soon to depart the Senate-told his fellow senators late last year that Australians do not seem to care about Aboriginal deaths in custody. Our Indigenous Australians are 15 times more likely to be jailed than non-Aboriginals. We can debate the rate of deaths in custody compared with 10 or 15 years ago, but they still occur at an alarming rate. Yet commentators like Peter Walsh have the gall and insensitivity to suggest that, on issues like mandatory sentencing and Aboriginal reconciliation, the opposition has been hijacked by well-heeled, vain, self-indulgent ideologues. He could well have included those true liberals, independents, social democrats and church leaders who still care. He obviously does not care. The real problem is the vanity and self-indulgence of those who see Aboriginal injustice as some sort of mild irritation. Walsh’s position is as soulless as the dry, economic rationalist ideology he advocates, whereby, in classic Thatcher-speak, there is no such thing as society, just individuals creating wealth that will trickle down to benefit even the Koori communities. We are all ‘masters of our own destiny’ rubbish. Let me a paint a picture from my own electorate. Many in the local Koori community have no idea what future support process will be put in place in the wake of the demise of ATSICnot that ATSIC offered the degree of support needed in the Bathurst-Orange area when help was needed. We have a facility that could and should be utilised for the benefit of the whole community, providing health services and TAFE programs as well as the successful child-care centre already operating on the site. But Towri finds itself in limbo as the government tries to MAIN COMMITTEE determine who owns what, with the prospect of protracted court challenges to the dismantling of ATSIC, the nominal owners of the Towri property. Yet the Towri child-care centre is being forced to pick up the court costs for unfair dismissal cases that have nothing to do with the centre itself but are a hangover from earlier decisions made by an administrator. It is a mess that is not of the making of the current Towri board. Up the road, in Bathurst, the Children of Prisoners Support Group is struggling to provide any sort of service for the 60 per cent of Bathurst jail population who are Aboriginal-I repeat, that is 60 per cent. A people who represent two per cent of our total population have an average 25 per cent representation in our jails and 60 per cent in Bathurst jail. The prisoner support group runs children’s activities, video link-ups between inmates and loved ones, a transport service with volunteer drivers, advocacy services and school holiday activities. The Aboriginal prisoner component was formerly funded by ATSIC-funding which has now ended. One other service it provides is the Rediscovering Families program that helps children of prisoners and their families as they prepare for the return of a released inmate to the homesurely a vital program to make some inroads into the tragically high recidivism rate of Aboriginal prisoners. While the state corrective services and community services departments provide some administrative assistance, this has been reduced in recent times. If this is an example of mainstreaming of Indigenous services, state or federal, then God help the Aboriginal community I talk about. These programs will face a funding crisis by the end of March. The children of prisoners program, now called SHINE for Kids, has just missed out on a grant under the Commonwealth early intervention Invest to Grow program of the federal Department of Family and Community Services. I really wonder what more worthy projects than this received assistance. And while we are talking about projects winding up at the end of March, the government currently has before it a submission from the Lyndon detoxification unit at Bloomfield Hospital in Orange which, because of a row between state and federal departments, looks like not receiving its recurrent funding by March-and it is going to lock up its services if that is the case. They have got clients that they are trying to organise from the courts. The local magistrate Jan Stevenson, I understand, spoke out in sheer frustration at this prospect in Orange the other day. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, has received submissions from me and from interested parties, and I had a brief discussion with him yesterday. In the climate we now have, with the revelation of the treatment-or the lack of treatment, if you like-of people with severe mental disability, surely to heavens we can do better. More evidence is pointing to the fact that we have severe schizophrenia and other mental conditions caused by the super marijuana that is now available-the damage it does, as one doctor described to me, is ‘cooking the brains’ of those who are using the stuff. This unit is all part of the detox program, and the federal government, as I understand it, is insisting on more emphasis on alcohol in a program that is already funded to the tune of several million dollars. The Lyndon House program was one of the benchmark and guideline programs that the government funded under its Tough on Drugs policy. An outstanding program, Lyndon House in Canowindra grew out of grassroots support. The patrons were Jack Gibson, who lost a son to drugs, and Dawn Fraser. They have been in there right along supporting Lyndon House, out of MAIN COMMITTEE which grew this detox unit. It is getting to the point of desperation as to whether there is going to be any recurrent funding for what by any standards has proven to be an outstanding service. I want to mention briefly the issue of the Tasmanian old-growth forests in relation to Gunns’ SLAPP writ process. I am really concerned about this development in Australian corporate behaviour whereby the SLAPP writ is being used in this fashion. Until recent times it was used extensively in America to prevent proper public participation in legitimate protest and activity. This most cynical of moves is designed to tie up, as I see it, people who have a legitimate argument about the process that the Tasmanian and federal governments are going through with regard to the Tarkine, the Styx and the Eastern and Western Tiers. I have seen these in the last six to 12 months and was mind-boggled by the absolute integrity and overwhelming beauty of those particular areas. It is a resource of absolutely amazing potential. I urge all Australians who should be interested in this issue to contact Dr Johannes Bauer at Orange university, the newly-converted campus of Charles Sturt University, and let him explain the program that he has taken to China to convert their old-growth logging programs into old growth ecotourism, and the tens of thousands of visitors it is receiving and the thousands of jobs it has created. As I understand it, the argument over the Tasmanian issue that was so muddied during the last few days of the campaign was over about 580 jobs directly involved in old-growth logging. For what? To chip the stuff and send it for processing into toilet paper and serviettes in Asia. Massive trees, almost as big as this room, are being used for that purpose. I ask: what are we doing in this generation when we have so much value in the inherent integrity of the forest itself to offer that to future generations as the sort of environment that once was? It defies belief that, for short-term political gain, it can be used to protect so few jobs when so many potential jobs are there for the making. It is such a blinkered approach and such a cynical profit-driven approach for so little gain that people shake their heads, as I do, in trying to understand just how we can do that. cares to listen. I will tell that to the occupier of the chair of a few moments ago, Dick Adams. If over a period of time and not just over two weeks we argue the logic of what we are doing, I think the public will understand that we have an asset; we do not have to mine it. We have an asset that we can exploit for the benefit of not only Tasmanians, my friend, or Australians, but for the entire world. Mr Cameron Thompson-You should learn more on your topic, mate. on this subject. I did not just fly in there and out.

199,Mr Andren,"the phone number, the fax and the address-where you can have a discuscase China, that respects the need to protect its old-growth forests, not for chipping but for ecotourism. I said at the beginning that I have grave concerns about the direction of our democracy and that some simple reforms to our voting system could ensure a fairer outcome. I would urge people interested in studying this subject in a little more detail to visit the ANU Democratic Audit of Australia web site where there are some fantastic papers written from all directions on our democracy, the recent Senate outcome, and whether we should be looking at proportional voting above the line as a means of more fairly allowing people to distribute their preferences and to know where their preference are going-so that outcomes where a party with two per cent of the primary vote delivers members to the parliament do not occur. It does not matter whether it is in Victoria or Queensland. I want to finish with a tribute to a young man by the name of Kurt Fearnley, who comes from Carcoar in my electorate and is one of the most outstanding paralympians Australia has ever produced. I want to paint a little picture of Kurt’s reception when he got back to Carcoar last year, after he had travelled back from the games and done a lot of other engagements. Kurt won two gold and a silver medal at those Olympics. The story of his marathon win is a story that we have probably heard and would take another 20 minutes to tell. His tyre flattened about six kilometres out, but he pushed on and won in record time. He entered the stadium and was there for five minutes before the second person turned up. For sheer guts and determination, the story of his win is worthy of publication around the world. When he came back to Carcoar he spoke to all those kids, family members and community members who met him. He told them with no fanfare about how the day before he had met Sophie Delezio, the toddler who received burns to 85 per cent of her body when a car smashed into the Manly Roundhouse Child Care Centre in December. He said they were obviously two like souls in terms of their disability. He gave her the silver medal because she was so brightened by holding it in her hand. He did not necessarily want anybody to know about it, but I wish to pay tribute to a great champion and a champion person. (Time expired) speak in the address-in-reply debate. I was very honoured to be re-elected as the member for Canning on 9 October; it is an honour I will carry for the rest of my life. You do not do it on your own, and I would like to pay tribute to the people who assisted me during the campaign. There were many, particularly my staff, members of the Liberal Party and many supporters whom I have thanked privately. I would like to make a few points on the election in Canning in Western Australia and on the election generally. I am very proud to have been re-elected and I am also proud to have taken the seat from a margin of 0.4 per cent to one that is now 9.6 per cent on the Mackerras pendulum. I feel that many of the issues I pursued, which I will address later in my speech, assisted my constituents to believe that I was working and fighting for them, and as a result they put their faith in me for a second time. I would also like to pay tribute to some of the candidates, for example, the Labor candidate Kay Hallahan. I found her to be a very decent person to deal with-we have met since-and we had a very good relationship, and that is the way to run a campaign. I also had a good relationship with the previous member, Jane Gerick, who tragically passed away. I spoke on her condolence motion in the House and I would like to again pay tribute to Jane. She would have been a far tougher candidate, we all know. In the mix was a candidate for the Labor Party, MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Governor General S Speech
200,Mr Randall (Canning) (11.45 A.m.),"It is my privilege to be here this morning toCimlie Bowden. We know that Cimlie crashed and burnt. I will not dwell too much on that but she had a lot of interesting things to say about her colleagues in the Labor Party on the way out. As a result, it was an interesting election from the opposition’s point of view. I would also like to mention Joe Dacheff, who was the One Nation candidate in this election and in the election before. Joe is a very decent man and a highly principled person, and I acknowledged that in a letter to him. The interesting thing about this result was that the second highest vote, apart from the Labor Party’s and mine, was the informal vote, which was 5.71 per cent, closely followed by that of the Greens, which was 5.05 per cent to a rusted-on candidate, Margo Beilby. I would also like to pay tribute to Vivian Hill of the Christian Democrats. He is a very decent person. I see that he is running for the east metropolitan ticket in the Western Australian state election for the Christian Democrats. Their vote was only just behind the One Nation vote. Interestingly, the One Nation vote in Canning has fallen from 13 per cent to 7½ per cent and, in this election, to 2.73 per cent. It is gradually evaporating, and I think colleagues in this coming state election will see some interesting results from that. The One Nation vote is going through the floor because people are realising that their policies do not suit Australia. Even though some of them have merit, they are pretty well gone. They have been taken over by such parties as the Christian Democrats. I would like to mention the Family First candidate, Bev Custers. It is the first time that party have stood and they had a respectable vote. Margaret Dodd also stood as a candidate. Tragically her daughter went missing, and Mrs Dodd is still distraught about that. Finally, there was Tony Bennell from the Australian Democrats who demonstrates what has happened to the Democrats. Their vote collapsed totally, down to 1.16 per cent. As a result, I am very pleased to say that I received a primary vote of 39,000-plus, which was 52.74 per cent, or a swing of 10.9 per cent. The Labor Party had a negative swing of 5.4 per cent and received a primary vote of 24,000, or 32 per cent, of the votes. Obviously I was very happy to compare 52 per cent with 32 per cent. As I said, there was a swing of over 10 per cent. On a two-party preferred basis, we just missed out on a 10 per cent swing, with 59.54 per cent to the Labor Party’s 40.46 per cent. I point this out because I am very proud of the result. It was the highest swing of any party vote in Australia. The only higher swing was that of the Independent candidate, Tony Windsor, in the electorate of New England. I will not be taking this for granted. I will be working hard throughout the electorate because we know that, as much as people can give you their support, they can take it away from you just as easily. Even though there was a two per cent swing to the government in the national vote, in Western Australia for example it was almost four per cent; yet we achieved 9.2 per cent. The fact is that we won the seats of Hasluck and Stirling and, without a dysfunctional campaign in the seat of Swan, we may well have won that, but for 109 votes. Had we realised the strength of feeling in Western Australia and the low primary vote of the Labor Party we might have put some more resources into the seat of Cowan and won that. However, the Labor Party snuck over the line by 1,000-plus votes. It is all a good story because the public of Western Australia and, thankfully, the electors of Canning, had realised what we were doing on their behalf. I fought hard on many issues on behalf of my electors. When I spoke in this place on 29 NovemberI commenced my address with these words: I grieve for the Australian taxpayer. MAIN COMMITTEE I then proceeded to detail the plight of a large group of Australian taxpayers who have been singled out by the ATO for horrific treatment. Once again, I am compelled to speak of taxpayers in employee benefits arrangements and similar tax disputes because the issue has not gone away and will not go away until a fair and equitable solution has been made. In December the Treasurer, Peter Costello, released a report compiled by Treasury after a review of the selfassessment system. This is a summary of that report. The report has identified significant serious flaws in the self-assessment process and recommended the introduction of legislation to protect taxpayers from wrongful administration by the ATO. Both government and the ATO have accepted Treasury’s recommendations. Most importantly, Treasury has found that in circumstances identical to those applicable to these EBA arrangements, the imposition of penalties and interest is improper and must not be allowed in future. You cannot reach a more decisive conclusion than that. This is not the view of me, Don Randall, or accountants or lawyers in private practice, or even the Inspector-General of Taxation. This is the department that is the custodian of the nation’s finances, the body that oversees the tax office. Not only that, the review was commissioned by the Treasurer himself. You cannot find stronger evidence that something smelly and bad needed to be cleaned up. In reality, what has changed for the affected taxpayers? Absolutely nothing. The legislation gives effect to the Treasury’s recommendations and will exclude the very people whose plight precipitated the dispute in the first place. What are we telling these taxpayers? ‘Yes, you’re right; you shouldn’t be treated that way. Yes, we’re going to prohibit’-not request-‘the ATO from doing it again, but we are not going to stop them from abusing and penalising you, so bad luck.’ We cannot right a wrong by preventing it in the future whilst casting off the casualties of the past. I for one cannot stand silent while these people are abused and penalised. In my previous speech to this HouseI gave notice of a private member’s bill that would address these inequalities. I am pleased that the Treasury’s initial recommendations reflect the substance of the provisions I proposed in November. But a private member’s bill may still be necessary if the remedying legislation proposed by the government excludes those who are and who have been in dispute with the ATO since it commenced its global campaign of reassessments in mid-1998-almost seven years ago. Let me reiterate the low watermark of this mess. The Commonwealth Ombudsman found the ATO breached a taxpayers’ charter with mass-marketed investors. The ATO’s use of multiple assessments has forced many of these businesses into a position where they are in breach of the Corporations Act by continuing to trade. The inspector-general told the Assistant Treasurer, in a letter dated 5 August 2004, the commissioner’s response to his GIC review was contrary to his findings. Now Treasury has found that the ATO’s approach to these disputes was so irretrievably flawed it should be outlawed by legislation. A report card like this for any other entity would see heads roll, but the ATO is an arrogant and protected species. My colleagues and I are continually told that there is a settlement offer available from the ATO and these matters are under control. That is far from the truth. The ATO offer of a 70 per cent cap and a possible remission of interest and penalties is a Clayton’s offer without real substance. It is no offer at all because no-one will qualify. In fact I have MAIN COMMITTEE here a copy of a letter of rejection from the ATO to one applicant for remission. The letter is from the ATO’s Assistant Commissioner Gary Marizza: Your submission has been considered, however your reasons do not demonstrate sufficient special circumstances to warrant a further remission of interest. This is what was expected and why the ATO’s offer is disingenuous and pretence. The ATO continues to placate parliament by making false promises. It must not be allowed to continue this misleading behaviour. The second letter I have is of more serious concern. It confirms that the ATO is making covert deals while taking an inflexible stance with the majority of taxpayers. This letter shows that the commissioner is prepared to settle with one EBA taxpayer on the basis of nil penalties and with a reduction in GIC to 4.72 per cent. I am assured that there is absolutely no difference between this taxpayer and every other EBA. If the commissioner can remove the penalties and remit interest to 4.72 per cent for one taxpayer, he must do it for the rest. I seek leave to table these two letters. Leave granted. created with these disputes and continues to create with its Clayton’s solutions. Parliament can no longer rely on the assurances given by the commissioner and his staff; it must take action now to bring this matter to an end. I call on all members to request that the government resolve the ATO’s maladministration revealed by the Treasury reports by ensuring that the protection afforded by the proposed new legislation applies to all those groups of taxpayers who have been in dispute since 1 July 1998. This matter obviously causes some grief with many people represented by my colleagues in this place. If it comes to a dispute where I have to stand up for my constituents or I have to toe the line with my colleagues, the constituent wins every time. That is one of the reasons why I have a margin of 9.6 per cent in my electorate. We tend to forget how we get here and who we actually represent. At the end of the day this issue will not go away; it has to be addressed and I intend to pursue it as long as I am here-and I hope that will be for a little while longer. The other issue I wish to address in the time remaining to me is the Mandurah bypass, which I believe is another reason why I had a strong result in my electorate. This government made a commitment to fund $170 million of the cost of the Mandurah bypass. The federal Labor Party, in opposition, promised to provide $170 million of matching funding. However, at the eleventh hour of that campaign Mr Latham, the former Leader of the Labor Party, withdrew $20 million of that money-its razor gang cost-cutting to pay for its measures. The Labor Party is not serious about building the bypass. The bypass has been an issue for years. I am pleased to say that as a result of my representations and those of other members eventually the state Labor government committed to building the bypass by 2007, but I assert in the House today that this is not true. It is not true for several reasons. One is that the cost of the Mandurah to Perth railway-which I support, although it is on the wrong route; it is on a route which is taking fewer passengers-has blown out from $900 million to $1.5 billion. I suspect it will be $2 billion by the time it is built. This pales into insignificance when you consider the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line, which cost less than that, and the $2 billion MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Governor General S Speech
201,Mr Randall,"These matters starkly illustrate the extent of the debacle the ATO hascanal proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, which goes over 3,000 kilometres to deliver water from the Kimberleys to Perth. The problem with the blow-out of the Mandurah railway is that road funding in Western Australia in general, and specifically for this project, will be delayed. As a result, the commencement date of 2006, in my opinion, is a furphy. The member for Mandurah in the state parliament, Mr David Templeman, has told constituents of mine-and I have said this previously in this House-that the Mandurah bypass will not be built for 10 years, or at least until 2010. If the people of Mandurah and the people of the Peel region, and Western Australia in general, knew that this was the real intention of the Labor Party, they would be horrified. They have been given a false promise for electoral purposes. The benefits to the Peel region, to Western Australia in general and to the whole infrastructure of the south-west of Western Australia rely on this Mandurah bypass. Colin Barnett has said, as opposition leader, that should he be elected on 26 February this year, he will begin construction of that road forthwith. They are the alternatives. I support my state candidates in the state election who are urging this project to be gotten on with. That includes Murray Cowper in Murray, Ashley King in Mandurah and Kim Hames in the seat of Dawesville. They are all taking a strong stance on getting this highway built. As a result, I will be raising this issue again-asking the state government to get on with building this very important piece of infrastructure, for which the federal government has put its money on the table. It has showed its real intentions. Not only have we had the Prime Minister visit the road, but also we have had the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, visit it. We have had the former roads minister, Ian Campbell, visit this highly significant piece of infrastructure for Western Australia. That is how important they think it is. The Mandurah bypass issue needs to be addressed. It needs to be built. The Labor Party need to be serious about it. They are not serious about it. They are trying to put it on the backburner. It is a disingenuous promise that the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning in Western Australia and the state Labor members and candidates are making about this road, and I intend to highlight this even further. However, I can say that throughout my first term as the member for CanningI have been very proud of the results that we have delivered. We have seen no challenging of the moneys delivered in the Regional Partnerships program to Canning. For example, we committed $250,000 to the building of a significant war memorial in Mandurah. The Labor Party members were sniffing around about that grant. It is very interesting that they should be contacting the Mandurah City Council about the Regional Partnerships grant for the war memorial. It was not until the Mandurah City Council told them that the then member for Brand-now the Leader of the Opposition, and still the member for Brand, although he wants to go and live in Sydney-also committed his party, without any formal application, to $250,000 for the war memorial in Mandurah. That is why the Labor Party has gone cold on trying to look further into the Regional Partnerships grant for a war memorial in Mandurah. It is because the member for Brand committed to it verbally at a function that we were at. In addition to that, I am very pleased to have delivered significant funding for the rail heritage museum in Pinjarra and for many other projects which were sorely needed but ignored by past members for the electorate of Canning. I am very pleased to have been able to repreMAIN COMMITTEE sent these people in the House. I will do my best to continue to represent them in the strongest and most effective way. (Time expired) Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.05 p.m.)-I am very grateful to be making this speech today on the address in reply as the re-elected representative for Chisholm. I would like to claim my own little honour as now being the longest-serving Labor member for the seat of Chisholm. That is something I am very proud of. I would like to start my remarks, though, by acknowledging the enormous sadness in my community in the wake of the horrific tsunami. My electorate is home to more than 2,500 people born in Malaysia, more than 2,000 people born in Sri Lanka, more than 1,700 people born in India and more than 1,700 people born in Indonesia. So it is home to many grief-stricken people, many people who have lost loved ones in this freak occurrence, many people whose families or friends are now without homes and a source of income, many people whose childhood homelands have been devastated. We can only be thankful that we have not seen the predicted massive outbreak of diseases such as cholera, typhoid, malaria and dengue fever. While nothing can take away the awful grief felt by many of my constituents, I hope they can take some comfort from the outpouring of empathy from their fellow Australians. We do have an arm around their shoulder in their sorrow. However, I would also like to put on record concerns raised by numerous constituents, particularly those within the Tamil community. They are very concerned about the iniquitous allocation of aid within Sri Lanka. They feel that some areas where the Tamil community is strong and in the majority have been overlooked and, indeed, that aid has not been delivered there on the basis of political manoeuvring. I have raised these concerns with various people and I trust that these issues are being investigated. Sadly, many things that are said are true and untrue, depending on what side you are on in the Sri Lankan debate. I have had members of the Singhalese community ring me concerned about Tamils actually cutting off aid routes. I hope that some sense can prevail in this war torn area. Maybe for once they can get back to the table, take the lead from where the Norwegians had left them in their debate about resolving this long-running dispute and actually use this terrible time to resolve some other conflicts. Turning back to the recent election, which now does not seem that recent, I would like to thank the people of Chisholm for the confidence that they have yet again shown in me. When I made my first speech in this House all those division bells ago, I said it was my objective to make my accessibility to Chisholm residents and their views the hallmark of my parliamentary service. I have taken this promise seriously and I have had a policy of an open door to constituents and community groups. On numerous occasions my electorate staff have complained that I have made the door to my electorate office a bit too open, but I figure that what I have been elected to do is represent the people in our community. I think that to do that properly you have got to do it warts and all and open the door and meet with anybody. When my constituents had a debate about whether it is Ms Burke, Miss Burke or Mrs BurkeI said, ‘It’s really easy: it’s just Anna.’ I like that. I like the fact that most people in Chisholm know me as ‘Anna’. I like the fact that I can demystify the role of a parliamentarian and the role of parliament. After all, we are all just people. I have found that people really appreciate this. When we can break down barriers, we can have an honest two-way conversation. Mind you, I am getting a little bit tired of, ‘Anna, we think you’re doing a great job but we have always MAIN COMMITTEE voted Liberal.’ I wish I could move on from that on some occasions, but I am a dyed in the wool Labor voter, so sometimes I can actually respect that partisan view from people. I would like to thank the people of Chisholm for treating the government’s scare campaign with the disdain it deserved. IfI agree with anything in the Governor General’s speech-and there was not much in that speech to draw comfort from-it is that the character of the Australian people should be viewed with fundamental optimism. Certainly the people of Chisholm give me great cause to be hopeful for our country’s future. When the government shamefully demonised people that were desperately seeking a safer life for themselves and their children at the 2001 election, the people of Chisholm recorded their anger at the ballot box, swinging against the government. When the government attempted to mislead on interest rates at this election, the people of Chisholm reacted with indifference. Chisholm is an area where the median monthly house repayment, based on the 2001 census, was $1,044-well above the Australian median of $870. So it is an area where, if you have a home loan, you are paying a lot for it. The people of Chisholm kept stopping me in the street to talk about their fears that young people were being forced out of universities. As my electorate is home to two of Australia’s largest universities-the Melbourne campus of Deakin and Monash-this is a very big issue. A lot of people in my electorate attend those universities. The people of Chisholm also stopped me to discuss the difficulties they were having finding an available nursing home place for an elderly parent or relative; to ask why, if they were working hard, they were not entitled to a tax cut like their bosses; or to tell me how their adult children could not afford to enter the housing market, for what is forgotten in all the government’s puff about interest rates is that most young people today will never be able to afford their own home. The great Australian dream of owning your own home is actually blocked off from numerous young people-and these are young people who are working, who have degrees, who have incomes. But, because of housing prices and because of the steep curve to actually get into the market nowadays, it is virtually impossible for them to break in. Most of us are paying on average 30 to 50 per cent of our take-home pay on our mortgage. That is a massive amount of your take-home pay that is going towards servicing that massive amount of debt, and that is before you even whack in what you are paying on your credit cards. I cannot even really remember people raising interest rates with me. What people said about the government’s campaign was, ‘Well, that’s all well and good, but we’re paying so much more for our homes nowadays it’s irrelevant.’ It did not matter. If you do the stats, you are actually paying more now than you were under the 17 or 18 per cent interest rates. makes it a hell of a lot more difficult to have a home and to pay for it. It is all well and good to say, ‘I’ve got this great asset that’s a home, but I’m not going to sell it to realise that asset.’ That is what you have got to know. ‘Oh, I’ve got this great asset’-so what? When are you going to sell it? How would you buy another one? Are you going to downsize and rent? It is a ludicrous argument. Mr Ciobo interjectingMAIN COMMITTEE",151,Governor General S Speech

205,Ms Burke,"It is not equity. People do not see it that way. Few peopleterest rates, the people of Chisholm did not listen to the debate and they were not fooled by the silliness of it. What concerned the people of Chisholm goes to the heart and soul of being a modern Australian. The people of Chisholm do not want to live in a dog-eat-dog world. They want a society where children have a right to a good education-no matter the finances of their family. They want a universal health care system where no-one goes without care because they cannot afford it. They want our elderly to be treated with care, whether they live at home or need nursing home accommodation. They want protection for workers against avaricious corporations or bosses. They want the gap between the rich and the poor to shrivel and not continue to expand. What they want is a fair go for all. This sentiment is not radical; it is something that the Australian country and ethos was built on. It is rooted in our country’s history. Even well-known dissident John Pilger has recently acknowledged that the story we tell about Australia being an egalitarian society is partly true: Long before most of the world, Australia had a minimum wage, a 35-hour working week, child benefits and the vote for women. The secret ballot was invented in Australia. By the 1960s, Australians could boast the most equitable spread of personal income in the world. But, after eight years under this government, our sense of egalitarianism and our sense of community is disappearing. We are encouraged to develop the selfish side of our nature, to ask: ‘What’s in it for me?’ John Howard makes $6 billion worth of promises in one afternoon, in one hour of that speech. Money was thrown left, right and centre, but where is the commitment to providing a basic level of health and education? Where is the funding for more aged care beds? Where are more child-care places? Nowhere to be seen. In all the government’s vote-buying largesse, disadvantaged people were ignored. They will be getting no assistance under this government to help them rise out of their circumstances. In my relatively affluent community more than 2,500 children are growing up in jobless families-and this is in a time when we have record low unemployment. That is more than 10 per cent of the total number of children in my electorate. It is a hidden statistic. If you listen to this government crowing over the unemployment rate, you would not even think this group existed. When the St Vincent de Paul Society held a ‘Vote 1. No More Poverty’ public forum during the election campaign, my Liberal opponent did not even deign to turn up. Doesn’t that speak volumes about his party and his government’s commitment to alleviating poverty? Middle-income families in my electorate are also finding it harder and harder to keep their heads above water. Consumer price index figures released in January found that education costs in the year to December 2004 increased by 7.7 per cent, which is three times the rate of inflation. A study by the Australian Scholarships Group released last month found that the cost of all levels of education is placing huge financial pressure on Australian families. Australian families are now paying, on average, $37,000 for their child to attend a government school, and $110,000 to attend an independent school. On top of that, parents pay about $56,000 to send a child to university for a three-year degree. The cost of educating a child has become like a second mortgage. It is a very scary statistic, and something we should be very, very concerned about. Many of the income earners in these families earn less than $52,000 and were left empty handed while their high-income counterparts received a tax cut. It is not an insignificant slice MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Governor General S Speech
206,Ms Burke,"I actually understand this argument a lot better than you do. Regarding inof our population. About 75 per cent of workers in Chisholm earn less than $52,000 a year. On top of this injustice many of these families have been slugged with a family tax benefit debt. There are about 7,800 recipients of family tax benefit part A in Chisholm. Of these, only 315 would be getting their correct fortnightly entitlement on time. New figures show that only one in 25 Australian families are getting their correct fortnightly payments on time. The average overpayment has risen from $860 to $1,026; yet this government stands by its flawed system, continuing time and time again to saddle these families with inequitable debt when they can least afford it. Get the system right and stop penalising these families. Many local parents are also facing an uphill battle to find a child-care place. More than 400 children are on waiting lists for child-care places in the city of Whitehorse in my electorate. The Victorian government believes that 8,000 Victorian children will miss out on a long day care place this year, and 5,000 will miss out on family day care places this year. According to a report in the Herald Sun newspaper on 22 January 2004, fees in council, community and private child-care centres increased by at least 20 per cent in 2004. I can tell you from personal experience that child-care fees are an absolute killer. Despite the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Kay Patterson, being forced to concede that ‘there may be pockets where demand for care exceeds supply’ this government has no solution and presented no solution at the last election. It does not want to deal with it; it does not want to help these parents. A Labor government would have contributed up to $500,000 in a capital grant to build or renovate a community based child-care centre in my electorate, creating new long day care places-something that is vitally needed. It is no use giving a rebate on child care if you cannot get a place to use that rebate. This government has also tried to push the crisis in aged care under the carpet. Chisholm is home to some wonderful aged care facilities, but there is a desperate shortage of aged care beds. As at June 2003, the southern metropolitan area of Melbourne had a shortage of 1,603 beds. The member for Moncrieff can shake his head all he likes, but maybe he does not have constituents coming to him week after week asking, ‘Where is a bed?’ Currently, one of my own staff members is out there desperately trying to find a place for her father-and there is not one. There were 1,434 phantom beds, which are the beds that have been promised by the government but which do not actually exist. They are there on paper but they still have not been built. It is appalling. We also have a scarcity of in-home services. Regardless of what the minister got up on her feet and said yesterday in question time, I say go and talk to your constituents. They are not getting the care they need in the home. It is promised. People make all these self-sacrifices to keep their aged and frail family members at home and then find that the services are not available. They are on very long waiting lists just to get help to feed, bath and look after their elderly people at home. Many of these people are living on their own without any other support services. They want to stay in their homes, but it is virtually impossible without that support. Many people are on waiting lists to receive care and there is no solution in sight for this. The government did not really promise anything at all during the election campaign. One of the greatest fallacies of the past election was the government’s portrayal of itself as the champion of Medicare. To steal a phrase from the Treasurer, ‘Don’t listen to what they say; look at what they do.’ During the last term of government, the rate of bulk-billing fell by eight per cent in Chisholm to sit at about 72 per cent. At the same time, the up-front cost of MAIN COMMITTEE seeing a local GP went up by $2.80 to an average of $15.70 per visit. Sadly with the election of the government I know that we will continue even further down this user-pays path. No wonder Minister Abbott has been keeping the bulk-billing figures for individual electorates under lock and key. I notice that they are going to come out on Friday afternoontomorrow-after months and months of hiding them. It will be fascinating to see how they are going. There is no happiness in being proved right when your worse fears have come true. Figures released last Friday by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee confirmed what I and my Labor colleagues have been saying loudly and clearly throughout the campaign. The AVCC data revealed a five per cent drop in applications across Australia for 2005 university courses. That is a decline of 12,123 applicants. In my electorate, both Monash and Deakin universities have raised fees by 25 per cent this year. Monash’s decision, for example, means that the HECS paid for an arts or science degree has risen from $3,854 to $4,818 per year and for a law or medicine degree it has shot up from $6,427 to $8,033 per year. It is a staggering amount. Young people have voted with their feet to avoid the government’s 25 per cent fee hikes and the country will be that much poorer for it. Even worse, some Victorians who are willing to pay high HECS fees are being denied a university place in their own state because the government has allocated their places to another state. About 2,400 Commonwealth government funded university places have been moved away from Victoria to fill the holes in other states. Speaking of education and training, my electorate is home to one of the best recognised TAFEs-the Box Hill Institute. At a time of immense skills shortages Box Hill definitely fights above its weight in providing trained workers to eager employers. Nearly 33,000 people are educated at Box Hill Institute every year. Eighty-eight per cent of Box Hill Institute graduates gain employment within 12 months. With that kind of record it has got me why the government wants to go off and establish a handful of new technical colleges across the country. Could it be that it is just an exercise in getting headlines for appearing to respond to our country’s massive skills shortages-shortages which will grow to more than 1,300 skilled workers over the next five years? These new technical colleges will not even open until next year and will not be fully functional until 2008. Instead of wasting millions of dollars in duplicating the existing TAFEs, would it not be smarter to use the funds to create 45,000 new TAFEs places immediately? Give the money to the TAFEs that are there and are working now. Why duplicate them? It is just ridiculous. Given all the issues that I have just touched on, what reason can there be to be optimistic about our future? Again, I return to the people of Chisholm who did vote for a change in government, who backed greater investment in health and education-a needs based approach to schools funding-who implored me to speak out against a war fought on dubious grounds and who continue to lobby me to call the government to account for the cruel and careless treatment of asylum seekers. I am heartened by the Labor members in Chisholm. I am heartened by the voters of Chisholm. I want to thank the local ALP branch members who gave up not days or weeks but months-because we are on a continuous campaign footing in Chisholm given my margin. Yet again they came out with flying colours. On the day that the election was called, one group of supporters was holding a fundraiser while another group was racing around putting MAIN COMMITTEE up garden signs. We definitely won the garden sign war. I owe a huge debt of thanks to Peter Chandler for everything he did but particularly his garden sign commitment. I owe a huge debt of thanks to Kathleen Brasher, who definitely knew what to do. She even turned up one day with a massive basket of fruit when my staff were looking even more run down than they usually do. I want to thank the President of my FEA, Sebastian Zwalf, for all the work that he did on the ground, particularly turning out young people in massive numbers when we needed them. I would also like to thank my fantastic staff, particularly Ainslie Gowan who worked seven days a week night and day during the campaign. It was a huge learning curve. Thank you to Janet Chiron, to Jason Lebisch, to Abi Henderson and to Louise Roche. To Michelle McDonald who decided in the middle of the campaign to go to Paris, I think we can say thank you but it was a bit rich. To the many others who were also there, the usual stalwarts, to all my local state colleagues, to Bob, Ann, Maxine and their staff-thank you so much. But most of all, as always, I want to thank my great family. It hurt a little during the campaign when Madeleine said to me, ‘I wish they’d vote for someone else’s mummy and then you wouldn’t be so busy.’ But I did like her remark at the end of the election. She said, ‘Now that you’ve won the election, Mummy, what have you won?’ Sometimes I come up here and I am not 100 per cent sure. I want to thank Madeleine, Steve and John and my extended family, as always, for the terrific support they give me. a few general issues. I know I will be interrupted, but there will be more to come if I get the opportunity. On a very sober note, during the break there was a very tragic event in my electorate, so it is appropriate today that I speak a little about the natural disaster relief arrangements and the magnificent effort that has gone in to assist people. In keeping with what I regard as the magnificent speech from the Governor General summing up Australia’s position, I have witnessed in recent weeks some of the magnificent attributes of Australians as they help people in significant need after the great tragedy of the lower Eyre Peninsula fires in which nine people lost their lives. For the young families involved, the loss of the lives of the children is particularly difficult to accept. I would like to speak about the national disaster arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states which have been evolving over many decades. I acknowledge the great reaction from the state government, from the Premier, who was there the next day, and from the Prime Minister’s office. They really were magnificent. It is a great attribute of Australians that when the chips are down you can count on them, whatever their background or beliefs, to be there to help and assist wherever they can. It was simply magnificent. The national disaster relief arrangements are put in place when personal hardships are involved. Most members are probably not familiar with the document that sets out the arrangements, but when you dust it off and have a look at it you see that the immediate emergency response is the responsibility of the states and that the Commonwealth is there to pick up approximately 50 per cent of the cost, particularly for personal hardship. In the case of lower Eyre, I believe there will be a need for a whole range of support for a long period, including psychological counselling. There has been an incredible response at a community level, right across my electorate and right across South Australia-at cricket matches, by local publicans and in individual houseMAIN COMMITTEE",155,Governor General S Speech
207,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (12.25 P.m.),"In the address-in-reply debate today I will speak onholds, with truckloads of household goods and clothing and $20,000 fundraisers organised at the drop of a hat-and at a local government level by Mayor Joy Baluch of Port Augusta. There have been incredible responses from a whole range of people. I put on the public record the great appreciation I have as an individual and as a federal member because the Eyre Peninsula is my regional home. Lower Eyre is a large area and I live up to 150 kilometres away from the directly affected areas, but I just want to take this opportunity to say in the addressin-reply debate that it was so wonderfully dealt with by a whole range of people. CanI in the 30 seconds that I have left lead into what I hope will be a second opportunity to talk in the address-in-reply and talk about the great national issue of education and regional education specifically. I think there is much left to be done in this area. As a regional federal member, I will pursue access to university education with great vigour. I put the parliament on notice that we have much that remains to be done. I seek leave to continue my remarks when the debate is resumed. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Yesterday marked the 15th anniversary of the day FW de Clerk delivered the news to Nelson that he would soon be a free man after 27 years in prison. He was released two days later, on 11 February 1990. As we all appreciate, history will record the courage and leadership shown by Nelson Mandela over an extended period. He endured almost three decades in South Africa’s harshest prisons as a consequence of speaking up for what he believed in. He stood up for human rights and resisted the harsh and unjust apartheid policies of the ruling forces in his homeland. His commitment to the people of his homeland is demonstrated by a moving statement that he made from the dock during his trial in 1964 for treason and sabotage. I refer to that speech wherein he said: I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. It is well known that after his release from prison he did not go on in a hateful manner. He actually showed his strength as a world leader. He resumed the campaign for democracy and to free his homeland from unjust policies and practices. In 1991 Mandela was elected president of the African National Congress. In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, jointly with FW de Clerk. He accepted the award on behalf of all South Africans who had suffered in the pursuit of democracy for their homeland. In 1994 the world was delighted when he was inaugurated as the first democratically elected president of South Africa, a position he held with great dignity until 1999 when he retired from public MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Governor General S Speech

209,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (12.30 P.m.),"I rise today to speak in commemoralife. Despite his retirement, Nelson Mandela has continued to work as a campaigner for democracy and human rights. That takes me to a speech he recently made about poverty in London’s Trafalgar Square on the eve of the G7 meeting. In that London speech, as part of the Make Poverty History campaign, Nelson raised three challenges for the world leaders of more advanced economic countries: he challenged them to campaign to ensure trade justice, end the debt crisis for the world’s poorest countries and deliver more and better aid. Mandela is a man of few words, but he continues to be a powerful leader in the pursuit of fairness and justice across the world. In his words: Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life. He concluded the London speech by saying that we as an international community should: Make Poverty History in 2005. Make History in 2005. Then we can all stand with our heads held high. Nelson Mandela also said in Trafalgar Square: Massive poverty and obscene inequality are such terrible scourges of our times-times in which the world boasts breathtaking advances in science, technology, industry and wealth accumulation-that they have to rank alongside slavery and apartheid as social evils. He then went on to say: The Global Campaign for Action Against Poverty can take its place as a public movement alongside the movement to abolish slavery and the international solidarity against apartheid. I will end with this quote: I say to all those leaders: do not look the other way; do not hesitate. Recognise that the world is hungry for action, not words. Act with courage and vision. I challenge the Prime Minister of Australia to take up Nelson Mandela’s challenge, to forget the fact that he opposed the use of sanctions to act to free Mandela and to take up the challenge. (Time expired) Moncrieff Electorate tary session for 2005, I am very pleased to reflect on some of the achievements the Howard government has delivered in my electorate of Moncrieff and for the people of the Gold Coast. I raise this to highlight the contrast between the federal government’s commitment to infrastructure and capacity building in our nation, particularly in the city of the Gold Coast, and the way in which the Beattie state Labor government continues to shirk its responsibilities, deny opportunities for future growth and ensure that the Gold Coast will struggle with infrastructure bottlenecks. In my electorate the Howard government was widely regarded and applauded for delivering at the last election. I know that the people of Moncrieff and the people of the Gold Coast not only rewarded me and the Howard government but also they recognised that there was a mutual benefit as a consequence of the re-election of the Howard government. Obviously, from my perspective, I was very pleased to receive such strong support from my electorate. Likewise, I am very pleased at the fact that the Howard government delivered some $27 million for the CRC for Sustainable Tourism and record funding-over $700 million-under the MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment
210,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (12.35 P.m.),"In this, the first sitting week of the first parliamentourism white paper. In these two instances alone, the Gold Coast, having some 37 per cent of its local economy dependent on tourism, has seen record visitor numbers over the past several months. For the film and TV industry we went to the election with a significant new policy which saw the extension of the film tax offset to TV production-another shot in the arm for local Gold Coasters and for the hundreds of people that are employed in the film and television industry. We also saw a record number of new university places and two new medical schools established on the Gold Coast. The new Griffith University medical school, for which I campaigned very strongly, takes its first class of new students this year. I am delighted that we were able to get that off the ground in less than two years. In addition, we see the new Australian technical colleges, one of which has been slated to be constructed on the Gold Coast. This comes as a consequence of the demand for trade places and the demand for specialist skills. This is a consequence of 14 years of significant economic growth within Australia, thanks primarily to the good governance and economic management of the Howard government. Compare these examples of a government that delivers to a local region with the neglect of the Beattie state Labor government for the people of Moncrieff, the people of the Gold Coast-the fastest growing city in Australia. Despite the fact that the Beattie Labor government is receiving record GST funds and is in a better situation in terms of its budget surplus than it has been for years, it continues to ensure that it is Brisbane based, Brisbane-centric and Brisbane focused. I am most concerned that the Beattie Labor government continues to deny the Gold Coast the opportunity to ensure that there is an expansion of the M1, to ensure that from Nerang to the New South Wales border there will be four lanes of the M1 for each direction of travel. The Beattie Labor government has turned its back on this project. I am disappointed that the Beattie Labor government refuses to ensure that there are adequate arterial roads on the Gold Coast and that roads like the Nerang and Broadbeach roads continue to become congested and clogged. I am concerned that the Beattie Labor government is not doing anything to ensure that the rail link is constructed more quickly between Nerang and Robina and then beyond Robina to interconnect with the New South Wales rail network. I am concerned that under the Beattie Labor government the Tugun bypass has been held up for years and years and, as a consequence, is preventing the rapid expansion of the Gold Coast airport, which is such a crucial piece of economic infrastructure for the Gold Coast. On all these levels, it is very clear that the Beattie Labor government is simply not pulling its weight when it comes to infrastructure development on the Gold Coast. I highlight again that the state Labor members have turned their backs on their constituents when it comes to important Gold Coast events, such as the Prime Minister’s Cup, which attract tourists to the Gold Coast. The state Labor members continue to refuse to do any active lobbying to ensure such a significant event remains on the Gold Coast. On every front, despite record GST revenue and a record budget surplus for the Beattie Labor government, they simply are not doing enough to invest in infrastructure and it stands in stark contrast to the Howard government. (Time expired) Throsby Electorate: Telecommunications Services Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (12.40 p.m.)-Telstra’s interim profit today amounted to over $2.3 billion and is potentially one of the last profit statements we might receive before the MAIN COMMITTEE privatisation of Telstra should the government gets its way. Interestingly enough today’s profit is a further nine per cent increase on the last announcement. There is no doubt that consumers and small businesses have underwritten this record profit by paying through the nose for Telstra services such as line rentals, which have risen astronomically from $11.65 in 2000 to around $29 a month in 2004. It is no wonder that many constituents tell me that owning a home phone is indeed becoming a luxury item, particularly for those on pensions and fixed incomes. TodayI want to assert again that Telstra services are not up to scratch and specifically to outline some concerns I have about the delays in the roll-out of broadband provision in a number of suburbs in my electorate. Not long ago I undertook a survey of constituents, asking them to tell me where they believed Telstra was not performing up to standard. While I have great respect for the Illawarra Telstra Country Wide team, I fear that their plans are constrained by Telstra, whose main object in life seems to be to accumulate massive profits in the lead-up to potential privatisation. This is occurring quite deliberately at the expense of maintenance of the infrastructure and the roll-out of broadband, as I will outline. Following the survey I had negotiations with Telstra management locally and advised my constituents in my electorate leaflet that areas like Horsley, Albion Park and Shell Cove were deemed to be priority areas for the roll-out of broadband. These suburbs are attracting a good deal of new migration from Sydney. Young professional couples and working couples are moving into these new suburbs where homes are affordable, and they rightly expect that Telstra will provide them with up-to-date telecommunication facilities. I am particularly concerned that, despite the assurances I was given, there continues to be a lack of progress in the delivery of broadband, in two suburbs in particular-Shell Cove and Flinders. This is causing great inconvenience to many of my constituents. Let me read an email that is typical of many I receive. It says: I AM DISGUSTED!! After being told that I cannot get ADSL broadband in a brand new development, I reluctantly agreed to ISDN. TodayI received a second set of instructions including a second CD on how to be a customer of ISDN. What a waste of money!!!!!!! Surely this money could be better spent on enabling me to become an ASDL customer!!!!!! My wife is a public servant who due to changes in work must work from home to provide articles to the newspaper including numerous graphic images as well as other duties that require the sending of email images that require long delays on snail email. Yet we live in a brand new suburb touted as the way of the future. We cannot get up to the minute broadband!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And Telstra wastes money providing us with two copies of every bit of information we need for a substandard service. Would this money not be better spent on updating modern telephone lines to enable fast broadband services? I was advised that Shell Cove was identified as a priority for ADSL enablement back in March 2004. I was told of plans for a remote MDF facility to provide ADSL to that area. In September 2004, Telstra advised me the completion of the facility would be around Easter MAIN COMMITTEE 2005, yet in January this year I was advised that the tender for the building of the facility would not be announced for another six weeks and that construction would take 26 weeks. In addition to the delays at Shell Cove, which had been identified as a priority, Telstra continue to let down the residents of the whole suburb of Flinders, who still have no ADSL services. While they have developed a project worth something in the order of $390,000 to rectify the situation, financial approval is yet to be received. I have written to the minister for communications, making her aware of these problems and urging her to take the necessary steps to ensure approval for the roll-out of broadband in Flinders and a speeding up of delivery of services in Shell Cove. A visit to the Illawarra by the minister would surely convince her that services are not up to scratch and that there is just no case for the selling off of Telstra. Education: Teachers Deputy Speaker Causley, no single career is more vital to the future of Australia than teaching. As role models, teachers shape the lives and the productivity of our nation, so we simply cannot afford what we have seen in the last generation: an aptitude decline in the quality of those who consider teaching as a profession. It is a tragedy that many skilled teachers seek less challenging environments at the expense of the high-needs schools in disadvantaged areas where they are most needed. It defies belief that such a vital profession is one of the last remaining that lacks financial incentives for their best performers, those teachers proven to achieve results. Only financial incentives for teachers based on student gains against national benchmarks can offer the solution to the three problems I have just listed. Far from picking on teachers, this is about knowing what is going on in our schools. It is about identifying and rewarding good teachers, and of course providing that drive to improve. Extensive American research has shown entrance scores for student teachers have declined over a generation. Obviously, better paying professional opportunities for women have arisen in the last generation but, more importantly, unionised flat salary scales have effectively tied teacher pay to experience rather than performance. Meanwhile it is society that pays the price, and we do not quite know how needy children in tough schools are performing when there is often teaching by inexperienced new graduates. Of course at the other end the truly good teachers are being sucked out of the state system and into other often less challenging environments in the private sector. Likewise, for the sake of our weaker teachers and those they teach, we have to be prepared to intervene before it is too late for our struggling pupils. The problem is that no-one knows who is doing what to whom and, worse still, we have not begun to look. Like the rest of society in the 21st century, teachers have every reason to expect pay to be linked to performance and productivity. At a state level we do not really know how education systems are performing. Already we have some benchmarks performed at year 3 reading. The findings are alarming: Victorian year 3 students are 20 per cent more likely than their New South Wales counterparts to fail those simple nationwide benchmarks. What is more disturbing is that Queensland and South Australian students are 33 per cent more likely to fail the same benchmark reading test at a similar age. I am sure analysing individual schools and teachers would also find similar variations, variations that in medicine or health we would find appalling and alarming. They would spark outrage. The plan by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, to report to parents in plain English is a start, but if those findings are not benchmarked you are simply reMAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment
211,Mr Laming (Bowman) (12.45 P.m.),"After parenting, as I am sure you would agree, Mrporting junk in plain English. All of this does need to be benchmarked because, after all, one day children will all face a cold, hard figure-a cold, hard number or score-to gain entry into very sought after courses, so we should not pretend until it is too late for anyone to do anything about it that numbers do not count. The solution is to take those two-yearly benchmarking tests that we are doing now, make them end of year and do them annually. Let parents know annually those performances and, most importantly of all, reward teachers for the value that they add above benchmark scores. If they improve students relative to a benchmark, they are rewarded. The gains are going to be greatest in those disadvantaged schools, and that will be a further incentive to address that skew that drives the best teachers in many cases to less challenging environments as they gain seniority in the profession. Before anyone convinces you that this is completely unworkable, keep in mind that state education departments are already collecting this very information. Since 2001, right up to 2004, every single student has been scored along with a teacher identifier to which the score is linked. It is not a hard thing to do but, beholden to the unions, state education departments are simply too timid to use that information in any meaningful way. Teachers want to know what works. They need to know how students perform at different levels of ability. Consider three teachers: one may be exceptionally skilled at advancing gifted students, another may be fantastic and may shine with those that are disadvantaged or delayed, and the third may be having difficulty and not achieving advances in class mean or at any level. Teachers need to know that; parents need to know that. At the moment that information is lost from a report card. It may be known by the principal vaguely but, most importantly, parents are left completely in the dark. Only when skilled and motivated teachers can be attracted to areas where they can have the greatest gains will the profession begin to advance and the needs of students be addressed. Denying good teachers incentive payments means talent goes unrecognised and children pay the price. The trade union’s stranglehold on teaching and wages is to blame because it sees students as simply being there for its members and not the other way round. (Time expired) Indian Ocean Tsunami was a reminder to us all of the power of our natural environment. The aftermath has also been a reminder of the extent of human compassion and generosity. That generosity is all the more appreciated when it comes from areas such as my electorate of Fowler. With one of the lowest household income levels in the country, the people of Fowler have shown that they deeply care for the fate of their fellow human beings. When I returned to work in my electorate office in Cabramatta on 4 January, I was met by leaders of the Vietnamese elderly group who asked me to pass on their donation of more than $800 for relief agencies. As a group whose passage to Australia was made in small boats, they are well aware of the perils of the sea. They also witnessed great hardship in their personal lives before coming to Australia, so their compassion and generosity is all the more appreciated. TodayI would like to extend my thanks, and the thanks of the people that I represent, to Mr Bao and Mr Sang and all the members of the Vietnamese elderly for their donations. A little later that day I received a call from Mr Matt Smolcich of the Cardinal Stepinac Village aged care facility in St Johns Park, also in my electorate. Each year the residents of the village conduct an Australia Day charity drive. Last year the village raised funds for the MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Adjournment
212,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (12.50 P.m.),"The tragedy of the Asian tsunami on 26 DecemberWestmead Children’s Hospital and the year before, as I informed the House at the time, Cardinal Stepinac Village raised over $20,000 for the Canberra bushfire appeal. Matt told me that this year the appeal would go to Care Australia and Caritas to help with their relief work for the victims of the tsunami. The coordinators-including Mrs Kardum, Boris Lauric, Anita Tomasovich and Milan Bogovic-pulled out all stops in their appeal. The appeal collected donations at the Saint Nikola Tavelic church next to the village and over Croatian language radio and received an overwhelming response. The Cardinal Stepinac Village raised donations totalling $136,430. This was a remarkable achievement on the part of the organisers and residents of Cardinal Stepinac Village. Again the people who have personally experienced great hardship and suffering in their earlier lives appreciate the suffering of others, and this has led them to give generously. Similar compassion and generosity was evident in the Western Sydney Chinese community. I have a very large community of Chinese within my electorate. Its tsunami relief appeal raised more $336,000 for Red Cross relief work. The Western Sydney Chinese committee, in my electorate again, includes groups such as the Indochina elderly association, the Australian Chinese Buddhist Society and the Timor-Chinese Association. Another Western Sydney group which has answered the call to assist those in need is the Italian Affair Committee. Over the past 18 years the committee has raised over $15 million for various local and overseas causes. On this occasion the Italian Affair Committee held a benefit night which was attended not only by me but also by the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, and the new federal opposition leader, Kim Beazley. Organisers Roy Spagnolo and Pat Sergi put in a huge effort in arranging the night, which resulted in the committee raising over $800,000-a magnificent achievement. The money raised will go to Rotary for rebuilding works and to Father Riley’s Youth Off the Streets organisation to provide assistance and accommodation to some of the many children orphaned by the tsunami tragedy. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you have been keeping a tally of the donations you will realise that they total well over $1 million from people in Western Sydney in the electorates of Fowler and Werriwa. Many of these people live in the Fowler electorate that I am proud to represent in this parliament. I express my thanks to all of those who made donations, large and small, to these appeals and the many other appeals that showed our compassion and generosity as a community and as a nation. Foreign Affairs: Thailand people of Thailand for the great loss and the sadness they have suffered as a result of the Boxing Day tsunami. I also congratulate the Thai government and the Thai people on the professional, compassionate and effective way they have gone about dealing with this terrible disaster. I have had the good fortune over recent years to work closely with the Thai government and the Thai business community while assisting with investment and trade opportunities being undertaken by a range of Australian companies in Thailand. The Thai people have a rich culture. They are a very friendly, optimistic, energetic, enterprising and resilient people. This resilience and enterprise has been on display in the way they have dealt with the recent major crises, such as the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s and the devastation of the tsunami. MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Adjournment
213,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (12.55 P.m.),"TodayI wish to extend my sincere sympathies to theAs at 8 February, the death toll from the tsunami in Thailand stood at 5,400 people, with a further 3,000 missing. The worse affected areas are the Phang Na, Ranong, Trang, Phuket and Krabi provinces. These areas are also the key tourist areas in Thailand. At least 2,400 fishing boats have been destroyed, along with 6,000 houses, 50 schools and 19 government buildings, and 54,000 farm animals were killed. As with the Australian government, the response of the Thai government was immediate and comprehensive. Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra led the grieving, the contact with victims and the recovery steps. He declined offers of international aid, other than technical assistance, such as victim identification, indicating that Thailand was in a position to take full responsibility itself for the recovery measures. To this end the Thai government has approved 28 billion baht, or over $US700 million, in assistance to the Thai people. This response reflects the growing and impressive performance of the Thai economy, with growth rates at over six per cent and poverty levels now under 10 per cent. I think their economic performance in the region, among Asian countries, is second only behind China. Thailand has been a strong friend in the region and is an increasingly important partner. The growth rate of trade, both to and from Thailand and Australia, has been at an average annual rate of around 15 per cent for each year since 1985-86, with total trade in 2003 at over $7 billion. The free trade agreement signed last year between our two countries was the first free trade agreement Thailand had signed with a developed country and will turbocharge the trading relationship between our two countries and enhance our cultural links, which are growing by the day. Finally, I would like to congratulate Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra on his stunning electoral victory last weekend. Prime Minister Thaksin is the first Thai Prime Minister to finish a full four-year term but also the first Thai Prime Minister to win a second successive term, and his victory is testament to his outstanding economic leadership of Thailand. In doing so, the Thai Rak Thai party, led by Prime Minister Thaksin, increased its majority by nearly 100 seats, to 399 of the 500 seats in the parliament. In achieving this outstanding victory, 33 million voters, or 76 per cent of all eligible voters, turned out. This is up from 69.9 per cent in 2001, when the Thai Rak Thai party first won office. I would suggest that democracy is alive and well in Thailand, and it is a great thing to see. I commend the Thai people and the Thai government on their magnificent response to the tsunami and on their general progress-both economically and in other ways-and as a member of parliament I look forward to helping to build on the strong relationship between our two countries. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE Health: Medical Practitioners (Question No. 34) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 16 November 2004: (1) What proportion of medical practitioners in Australia are (a) general practitioners, and (b) specialists. (2) In respect of the incurred but not reported liability for United Medical Protection, what proportion of the liability is attributable to specialists. (3) In respect of the sum of the levies being paid by all medical practitioners, what proportion is being paid by (a) general practitioners, and (b) specialists. (1) (a) and (b) According to the report Australian Medical Labour Force 2001, by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), there were 53,384 registered medical practitioners in Australia in 2001 (latest available data on all registered medical practitioners). Of this number, 92% were classified as clinicians while the other 8% were administrators, teachers, researchers, etc. The report states that, of the total number of clinicians, 44% were classified as general practitioners and 35% were specialists. The remainder were registered medical practitioners working in hospitals who were not specialists, or registered medical practitioners undergoing vocational training to become medical specialists. General practitioners thus made up 56% of the combined pool of general practitioners and specialists. (2) The estimate of United Medical Protection’s (UMP) incurred but not reported liability provided to the Government are not broken down between specialists and others. The liability is estimated collectively rather than separately for different categories of doctor. (3) (a) and (b) Based on information provided by the Health Insurance Commission, of the proportion of medical practitioners paying a levy, the proportion of levies paid in respect of the first contribution year by general practitioners is 58% and the proportion paid by specialists is 42%. This proportion is likely to change when the moratorium on higher contributions ceases. Throsby Electorate: Bulk-Billing (Question No. 77) Ms George asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 16 November 2004: (1) What is the breakdown of the proportion of total unreferred GP attendances bulk-billed for the electoral division of Throsby for the quarter ending 30 September 2004, or the most recent available quarter. (2) What is the breakdown of the number of total unreferred GP attendances bulk-billed for the electoral division of Throsby for the quarter ending 30 September 2004, or the most recent available quarter. (3) What is the breakdown for the average patient contribution per service (patient billed services only) for total unreferred GP attendances for the electoral division of Throsby for the quarter ending 30 September 2004, or the most recent available quarter.",165,Adjournment
214,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) What is the breakdown for the number of services for total unreferred GP attendances for the electoral division of Throsby for the quarter ending 30 September 2004, or the most recent available quarter. Medicare statistics by electorate are no longer produced on a quarterly basis. Statistics by electorate are available on a calendar year basis. (1) The proportion of total unreferred GP attendances bulk billed for the electoral division of Throsby in 2003 was 94.2%. (2) The number of total unreferred GP attendances bulk billed for the electoral division of Throsby in 2003 was 746,117. (3) The average patient contribution per patient billed service for unreferred GP attendances in the electoral division of Throsby in 2003 was $12.49. (4) The number of unreferred GP attendances for the electoral division of Throsby in 2003 was 792,359. Environment: National Heritage Trust (Question No. 188) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in writing, on 29 November 2004: (1) What sum has been allocated from the National Heritage Trust to all projects to date. (2) What sum has been allocated from the National Heritage Trust to projects within the electoral division of Deakin and what are the details of the projects. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) From the commencement of the Natural Heritage Trust to 6 December 2004, $2.1 billion has been allocated to projects across Australia. (2) As of 6 December 2004 the sum allocated from the Natural Heritage Trust to projects wholly within the Electorate of Deakin was $16,400. (Further detail on these projects is contained in Attachment A). Regional information for projects supported under the Natural Heritage Trust extension (‘NHT2’) is not available for individual electorates as the boundaries for Natural Resource Management (NRM) regions are not fully congruent with electorate boundaries.

The Table also includes details of these commencements as proportions of the total number of commencements. No direct comparisons can be made between commencements after 30 June 2003, when the Active Participation Model (APM) commenced, and those in previous years.

Numbers for Intensive Support in 2003 are from 1 July 2003 when the APM commenced. Numbers for 2004 are to 26 November 2004. Job seekers eligible for Job Search Support Only and job seekers whose periods of unemployment were unknown have been excluded from the calculation of percentages. (5) In view of the 12 month duration of Intensive Assistance it is not practical to report on the numbers of job seekers who participated on multiple occasions in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. From1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the APM. This new approach sees job seekers assisted by a single Job Network member for the full duration of their unemployment, allowing the service provider to develop a detailed understanding of each job seeker’s needs. (6) Data on the type of employment (e.g. full-time, part-time) gained by Job Network participants is gathered through the Post Programme Monitoring (PPM) survey. The PPM survey measures job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance.

Health: Medicare Safety Net (Question No. 240) Mr Beazley asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 1 December 2004: (1) Are the costs of medical procedures associated with an IVF program currently included in an individual’s Medicare Safety Net entitlement; if so (a) what has been the cost to date, and (b) what is the estimated cost for this financial year. (2) What proportion of births in Australia result from IVF processes. (1) Yes– for out patient services. (a) For the period 12 March 2004 to 30 November 2004, $18,405,791 was spent under the Medicare safety net on IVF out patient services. (b) The estimated cost to the safety net on IVF out patient services in the financial year 2004-05 is $36,000,000. The 2004-05 estimate takes into account the billing practices of IVF providers and the number of registrations for the safety net. Service utilisation is approximately 8,000 to 9,000 IVF out patient services billed to Medicare per month, with December being typically slightly higher, offset by slightly lower than average utilisation in January. Based on these utilisation rates it is expected that safety net expenditure for IVF services will be about $3.2 million per month. It should be noted that for the early part of the 200405 financial year (July and August 2004) registration for the safety net was still occurring, thus expenditure in these months was less than the average of $3.2 million. (2) Population estimates suggest that babies born following assisted reproductive technology including IVF constitute about 2% of all births in Australia (Source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Perinatal Statistics Unit). Treasury: Legal Services (Question No. 264) Ms Roxon asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 2 December 2004: (1) What sum did the Minister’s department spend during 2003-2004 on outsourced (a) barristers, and (b) solicitors (including private firms, the Australian Government Solicitor and any others). (2) What sum did the Minister’s department spend on internal legal services. (3) What is the projected expenditure on legal services for 2004-2005 for the Minister’s department. (1) Department of the Treasury spent $1,549,000 on outsourced barristers and solicitors during 200304. Barristers are engaged through the Australian Government Solicitor and/or private firms – as a result, these costs are included in the expenditure relating to solicitors.

In question on notice 3185, which was asked by the honourable member on 1 March 2004, I advised that the amount spent on outsourced legal services provided by solicitors for 2002–03 was $7,109,283.57 (GST inclusive). I wish to correct that answer as follows. I am now advised that the total expenditure on solicitors in 2002–03 was $5,165,370.03 (GST inclusive). The original figure wrongly included expenditure of $1,943,913.54 on barristers. (2) The Attorney-General’s Department does not have a separate legal services branch as such. Within the Department there are units that provide both internal and external services, principally the Office of International Law, the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing, and the Counsel assisting the Solicitor-General. Legal services are provided at no cost to the areas of the Department receiving the services. There is no billing arrangement for internal legal services and separate records are not kept about this expenditure. These expenses are treated as part of the aggregate of staffing costs for the Department. An estimate of the cost of internal legal services has been derived from an assessment of the number of staff involved in providing internal legal services and the proportion of their time involved in providing those services. The staff of the Office of International Law devoted to providing internal legal services are the full time equivalent of 0.5 of an APS3, 1.0 Legal Officer, 1.0 Senior Legal Officer, 1.0 Principal Legal Officer and 0.5 of an SES Officer. The staff of the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing devoted to providing internal legal services are the full time equivalent of 0.2 of a Legal Officer, 1.0 Senior Legal Officer, 0.3 of a Principal Legal Officer and 0.1 of an SES Officer. 0.5 full time equivalent of the Counsel assisting the Solicitor-General (a Principal Legal Officer) is devoted to providing legal services to the Department. The cost of internal legal services was then estimated based on salary levels for these positions and increased by a factor reflecting typical staffing and other overheads within the Department. By this method, it is estimated that approximately $900,000.00 was spent on internal legal services by the Department in 2003–04.",174,Questions In Writing
221,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:In addition, the costs of the office of the Solicitor-General (including salary) are met by the Department. (3) The projected expenditure by the Attorney-General’s Department on outsourced legal services for 2004–05 is approximately $6.2 million (including disbursements). The Department expects expenditure on internal legal services for 2004–05 to be approximately $950,000.00. This is calculated on the same basis for 2003-04 and an estimate of approximately unchanged provision of services and staffing commitment, but takes into account anticipated salary increases. In addition, the Department will continue to meet the costs of the office of the Solicitor-General (including salary). National Water Commission (Question No. 284) Mr Albanese asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in writing, on 2 December 2004: (1) What will be the functions of the National Water Commission. (2) What types of environmental improvements will be achieved through Fund investments, for example, will the Fund be used to improve the quality and quantity of environmental flows in stressed systems; if so, how. (3) Will investments in environmental improvements made under the Fund relate to resource condition targets and management action priorities developed through the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT)/National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) natural resource management planning process; if so, what process will be followed to ensure consistency with the regional Natural Resource Management (NRM) process. (4) Will measurable environmental quality outcomes and improvements be specified for projects supported under the Australian Water Fund; if so, how will those outcomes be determined and what monitoring and reporting requirements will be established to determine whether or not these outcomes are achieved. (5) In respect of water reuse, recycling and efficiency projects supported under the Fund, will the Government determine the subsequent water savings as allocations of water available for use by agricultural users, urban users and the environment; if so, how; if not, will the Government be funding water use efficiency solely as a private benefit outcome. (6) Prior to making investments, will the Government undertake a strategic assessment of the national level opportunities to maximise environmental improvements out of Fund expenditures. (7) Does the Government’s policy ‘Securing Australia’s Water Future’, which noted that the Fund will help assist projects that improve river flows, mean that the Fund will support projects specifically designed to improve river flows; if so, can the Minister explain (a) how the Fund will do this while the listed projects focus on maximising water reuse for agricultural production or future urban development, and (b) how improved environmental flows will be determined and protected through the Fund. (8) Is the Government committed to funding projects listed in its election commitment, ‘Securing Australia’s Water Fund’; if so, what are the anticipated financial demands on the Fund to support projects listed in this election commitment. (9) Is the National Water Initiative intended to support price signals for water that encourage water trading and water use efficiency, especially in agriculture where the greatest volume savings can be achieved; if so, why does the Government subsidise private benefit through the Fund. (10) Will a proportion of the Fund be dedicated to purchasing water through trading instruments established under the National Water Initiative; if so, what sum or what proportion. (11) How will the Fund be targeted at achieving the ecological outcomes and objectives of the Living Murray Initiative. (12) What criteria will be applied to selecting projects under the Fund. (13) How will the Commission assess the economic and environmental benefits of any project and the cost-effectiveness of the environmental improvements generated through projects. (14) Does the Government’s policy ‘Securing Australia’s Water Future’, which noted that competitive bidding will be the primary mechanism for allocating grants, mean that listed projects, such as Waterproofing Adelaide and South East Queensland recycling program, will be subject to competitive bidding and therefore may not be supported. (15) Has the Government been approached for funding from proponents of any of the projects listed in ‘Securing Australia’s Water Future’; if so, (a) which projects, and (b) have any commitments been made to funding these projects; if so, what are the total annual commitments made for these projects against the Fund. (16) Of the $200 million allocated to the National Water Standards component, what sum is allocated for (a) water accounting, (b) groundwater assessment, (c) working with local communities, and (d) water efficiency labeling for each financial year of the Fund. (17) Under the water accounting component, will funds be spent on characterising ecosystem processes as a basis for developing sustainable flow levels and flow regimes for rivers; if not, how will sustainable flow levels be set. (18) What is the relationship between projects funded under the Water Wise Communities program and project priorities identified under regional NRM planning. (19) What criteria will be used to assess the competitiveness and cost-effectiveness of projects funded under the Water Wise Communities program. (20) How is the term ‘cost-effective’ defined in the context of the Government’s policy ‘Water Wise Communities’ which noted that local stormwater harvesting and channel care activities are to be cost effective, for example, does it relate to the cost-effectiveness of stormwater harvesting for water supply, and, compared to other available sources such as wastewater reuse, how will the Government determine ‘cost-effectiveness’ for the purpose of assessing the relative merits of project proposals and how will the Government account for the impact on freshwater environmental flows affected by stormwater harvesting (eg dams). (21) What is meant by ‘river care’ on page 3 of the ‘Water Wise Communities’ document and what are typical projects the Government would fund as ‘river care’ projects. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The National Water Commission will have two key responsibilities: promoting the objectives and outcomes of the National Water Initiative (NWI) Intergovernmental Agreement; and advising on financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth under components of the Australian Water Fund. (2) The Australian Water Fund represents a major investment by the Commonwealth in water infrastructure, improved knowledge and water management, and better practices in the stewardship of Australia’s scarce water resources. Investment under the Australian Water Fund will be made on the basis that it is consistent with, and helps achieve, the objectives, outcomes and actions of the NWI. The aim of the NWI is to improve investor confidence and economic efficiency while protecting resource condition and environmental assets.",175,Questions In Writing
222,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following an(3) Investment under the Australian Water Fund will be made on the basis that it is consistent with and helps to achieve the objectives, outcomes and actions of the NWI.

(3) The numbers of Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients placed into jobs through assistance from Job Network providers in the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, in (i) Australia and (ii) the Inner City/Eastern Suburbs ESA, are shown in Table 2.

Numbers for 2004 are to 3 December 2004. Total Job Placements include those that may become long term job outcomes at a later stage. (4) The number of long term unemployed jobseekers who commenced in Intensive Assistance in the Inner City/Eastern Suburbs ESA in the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 are shown in Table 3. The Table also includes details of these commencements as proportions of the total number of commencements. No direct comparisons can be made between commencements after 30 June 2003, when the Active Participation Model (APM) commenced, and those in previous years. Under the APM, job seekers are assisted by a single Job Network member throughout their term of unemployment. Under previous arrangements, job seekers entered Intensive Assistance for a duration of 12 months. Table 3-Intensive Assistance Commencements for the Long Term Unemployed Inner City/Eastern Suburbs ESA Year Long Term Unemployed Commencements Proportion of Total Commencements Intensive Assistance 2000 2,912 59.2% 2001 1,947 46.9% 2002 1,931 46.7% 2003 538 48.4% Intensive Support Under the Active Participation Model 2003 2,321 50.0% 2004 (to 26 Nov 2004) 1,639 29.5% Note: Long term unemployed jobseekers are those registered as unemployed for 12 months or more. Numbers for Intensive Assistance in 2003 are to 13 June 2003 when jobseekers ceased commencing Intensive Assistance prior to the introduction of the Active Participation Model (APM) on 1 July 2003. Numbers for Intensive Support in 2003 are from 1 July 2003 when the APM commenced. Numbers for 2004 are to 26 November 2004. Job seekers eligible for Job Search Support Only and job seekers whose periods of unemployment were unknown have been excluded from the calculation of percentages. (5) In view of the 12 month duration of Intensive Assistance it is not practical to report on the numbers of job seekers who participated on multiple occasions in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. From1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the APM. This new approach sees job seekers assisted by a single Job Network member for the full duration of their unemployment, allowing the service provider to develop a detailed understanding of each job seeker’s needs. (6) Data on the type of employment (e.g. full-time, part-time) gained by Job Network participants is gathered through the Post Programme Monitoring (PPM) survey. The PPM survey measures job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance. PPM estimates for Intensive Assistance for the Inner City/Eastern Suburbs ESA in the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 are shown in Table 4. Table4 includes (a) the total in Employment and (b) the proportions in (i) full time, (ii) part time and (iii) casual employment. The data for 2003-04 in Table4 is for Intensive Support Job Search Training outcomes for the financial year.

Casual employment includes employment on a temporary, seasonal or casual basis as reported by respondents to the PPM survey. (7) Community Work Coordinators (CWCs) are contracted to provide Work for the Dole services on an ESA basis. The CWCs providing services in the Inner City/Eastern Suburbs ESA and the office locations are shown in Table 5.

Employment is not a stated objective of the programme, however, the valuable work experience gained through the programme combined with the continued support of the Job Network, supports the objectives of the APM. The PPM survey measures job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance. Outcomes estimates for Work for the Dole are shown in Table6 for (a) the total proportion in employment and (b) the proportion in (i) full-time, (ii) part-time and (iii) casual employment following their placement. Table6 shows the post programme status of clients who undertook Work for the Dole in the Inner City/Eastern Suburbs ESA.

In 2000 there were insufficient numbers of survey respondents in the Inner City/Eastern Suburbs ESA to provide statistically reliable outcome estimates for Work for the Dole. Defence: Courts Martial (Question No. 368) Mr Melham asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 8 December 2004: For each financial year since 1996-1997 and for each armed service in the Australian Defence Force, how many (a) General Courts Martial, and (b) Restricted Courts Martial were convened under section 119 of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Statistics covering the operation of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, for each calendar year, are included in the Judge Advocate General’s Annual Report. Defence: Visiting Warships (Question No. 380) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 9 December 2004: (1) Which Australian ports are currently approved to receive visits by nuclear powered warships. (2) What criteria are applied in determining whether a port is suitable to receive visits by nuclear powered warships. (3) When was the suitability of each port to receive such visits last assessed and which organisations were involved in each assessment. (4) When is the suitability of each port to receive such visits scheduled to be re-validated. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Australian ports that are approved to receive visits by nuclear powered ships include: Commonwealth Territory New South Wales– Jervis Bay; Brisbane; Gladstone; Darwin; Fremantle; HMAS Stirling; Albany; Melbourne; and Hobart. (2) The criteria applied in determining whether a port is suitable to receive visits by nuclear powered warships are: Visits by nuclear-powered warships to Australian ports are accepted only to berths and anchorages that have been assessed against radiological criteria and approved by the Visiting Ships Panel (Nuclear) (VSP(N)). The basis of the assessment is an estimation of the individual and collective radiation doses to the public in the event of a Reference Accident to the reactor plant on the visiting ship, and a comparison of these with radiation dose criteria. The number of potential radiation-induced cancer fatalities is provided, based on risk factors consistent with those recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. The Reference Accident is defined as a failure of the primary coolant circuit of one of the reactors resulting in a loss of coolant and melt down of the fuel in the reactor core, and the release of volatile and gaseous fission products to the reactor containment. These fission products would then be available to leak to the atmosphere and be distributed according to the prevailing weather. In the assessment, the dispersion of released fission products in the atmosphere downwind of the accident has been estimated using a standard, conservative meteorological model and the radiation doses to individuals and to the total population possibly exposed have been calculated. (3) The suitability of each port to receive such visits was last assessed as follows: Darwin 23 to 24 March 2003; Fremantle27 to 28 March 2003; HMAS Stirling 27 to 28 March 2003; Hobart 23 to 24 October 2003; Gladstone 26 to 27 July 2004; Brisbane 28 to 29 July 2004; and Melbourne 28 to 29 October 2004 Both Albany (Western Australia) and Jervis Bay are validated for nuclear-powered warships to come to anchor, and conduct emergency transfers and medical evacuations. The VSP(N) Working Group visited Jervis Bay in February 2004 and will complete a revalidation once the new Safety Plan is completed in early 2005. The following organisations provide representatives to the VSP(N), which conduct the assessments: Department of Defence: Commander Australian Navy Systems Command, National Port Services (Deputy Master Attendant(Secretary)), International Policy Division, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Surgeon General Australian Defence Force, and Headquarters Australian Defence Force Operations (Maritime Operations); Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation; Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency; Department of the Environment and Heritage; Department of Health and Aged Care; Attorney-General’s Department; and Emergency Management Australia. (4) The suitability of each port to receive such visits is scheduled to be re-validated as follows: Jervis Bay Early 2005; Albany March/April 2005; Darwin March 2005; Fremantle March 2005; HMAS Stirling March 2005; Hobart October 2005; Gladstone July 2006; Brisbane July 2006; and Melbourne October 2006. Banks Electorate: Job Network Providers (Question No. 382) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 9 December 2004: (1) How many Job Network providers are currently operating in the electoral division of Banks and what are their names and addresses. (2) How many job seekers are currently registered with (a) each Job Network provider, and (b) each office of each provider operating in the electoral division of Banks. (3) For the year (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, (d) 2003, and (e) 2004, in (i) Australia, and (ii) the electoral division of Banks, how many Newstart or Youth Allowance recipients were placed into jobs through assistance from Job Network providers. (4) For the year (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, (d) 2003, and (e) 2004, how many long-term unemployed people (i) in total, and (ii) as a proportion of all unemployed people, participated in intensive assistance programs in the electoral division of Banks. (5) For the year (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, (d) 2003, and (e) 2004, how many of the people who have participated in intensive assistance in the electoral division of Banks have participated on (i) one occasion, (ii) two occasions, (iii) three occasions, and (iv) more than three occasions. (6) For the year (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, (d) 2003, and (e) 2004, how many job seekers who participated in intensive assistance in the electoral division of Banks found employment and what proportion found (i) full-time, (ii) part-time and (iii) casual employment. (7) How many Work for the Dole providers are currently operating in the electoral division of Banks, what are their names and addresses and what programs do they offer. (8) For the year (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, (d) 2003, and (e) 2004, how many people who participated in a Work for the Dole program in the electoral division of Banks found employment. (9) For the year (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, (d) 2003, and (e) 2004, what proportion of people who participated in a Work for the Dole program in the electoral division of Banks found (i) full-time, (ii) part-time, and (iii) casual employment following their placement. (10) For the year (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, (d) 2003, and (e) 2004, how many people who participated in a Work for the Dole program in the electoral division of Banks were in (i) full-time, (ii) part-time, (iii) casual employment three months after completing their placement. (1) and (2) Job Network is administered on the basis of 19 Labour Market Regions and 137 Employment Services Areas (ESAs), the boundaries of which do not align with those of federal electorates. Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes and Centrelink offices, or the satisfaction of friends and others. Job seekers residing in one electorate or ESA may elect to be assisted through Job Network sites located in adjoining electorates or ESAs. For illustration, job seekers residing in the electorate of Banks may be assisted through Job Network sites located in the electorate of Barton. The Canterbury/Bankstown and St George/Sutherland ESAs are most closely aligned with the electorate of Banks and, therefore, answers are provided with reference to these ESAs. There are currently 15 employment services providers operating in the Canterbury/Bankstown ESA and 18 in the St George/Sutherland ESA. The names and office locations of all Job Network members and Job Placement Only organisations currently operating in these ESAs are shown in Table 1.

Numbers for Intensive Assistance in 2003 are to 13 June 2003 when jobseekers ceased commencing Intensive Assistance prior to the introduction of the Active Participation Model (APM) on 1 July 2003. Numbers for Intensive Support in 2003 are from 1 July 2003 when the APM commenced. Numbers for 2004 are to 26 November 2004. Job seekers eligible for Job Search Support Only and job seekers whose periods of unemployment were unknown have been excluded from the calculation of percentages. (5) In view of the 12 month duration of Intensive Assistance it is not practical to report on the numbers of job seekers who participated on multiple occasions in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. From1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the APM. This new approach sees job seekers assisted by a single Job Network member for the full duration of their unemployment, allowing the service provider to develop a detailed understanding of each job seeker’s needs. (6) Data on the type of employment (e.g. full-time, part-time) gained by Job Network participants is gathered through the Post Programme Monitoring (PPM) survey. The PPM survey measures job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance. PPM estimates for Intensive Assistance for the Canterbury/Bankstown and St George/Sutherland ESAs in the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 are shown in Table 4. Table4 includes (a) the total in Employment and (b) the proportions in (i) full time, (ii) part time and (iii) casual employment. The data for 2003-04 in Table4 is for Intensive Support Job Search Training outcomes for the financial year.

Employment is not a stated objective of the programme, however, the valuable work experience gained through the programme combined with the continued support of the Job Network, supports the objectives of the APM. The PPM survey measures job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance. Outcomes estimates for Work for the Dole are shown in Table6 for (a) the total proportion in employment and (b) the proportion in (i) full-time, (ii) part-time and (iii) casual employment following their placement.

Xstrata Alloys: Vanadium Mine (Question No. 406) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 9 December 2004: Has he acquainted himself with the unanimous report of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly expressing concern at the arrangements by Xstrata Alloys for the decommissioning and dismantling of its vanadium mine and plant at Windimurra in Western Australia; if so, will he, in considering the national interest test on a potential takeover of WMC Resources by Xstrata, have regard for Xstrata’s ability to manipulate local resources development to suit its overall results worldwide against Australia’s best interests. I am aware of the report to which the question refers. A copy has been obtained by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). All foreign investment proposals that are subject to the operation of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the FATA) are examined carefully to determine whether they raise any national interest concerns. Under the FATA, I have the power to reject or approve a proposal subject to conditions, if I consider it raises issues contrary to the national interest. The FIRB provides me with advice on foreign investment proposals. All relevant information regarding a particular proposal which may bear upon the national interest test will be taken into account by the FIRB in providing advice to me. It is usual practice for the FIRB to undertake appropriate consultations, including with relevant state governments, in relation to proposals, and consideration is also given to any public submissions it receives. Details of cases considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board are confidential between the Board and the parties concerned. No details are provided to third parties, and confidentiality requirements are strictly observed. This practice will be followed for any application in relation to WMC Resources and Xstrata.",203,Padstow Child Care Centre 21 Cahors Rd Padstow 2211 Nsw Questions In Writing
