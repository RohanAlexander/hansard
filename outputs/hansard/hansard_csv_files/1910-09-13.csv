10,Mr Fenton,"In the report of a.and Katoomba is mere child's play compared with the country lying between Canberra and Jervis Bay. The ravines that would have to be .crossed have many a time prevented the embarkation of capital in private enterprises in lhat part of the State in that district, when they want to take ^ their wool to a port, never go to Jervis Bay. Their port is Batemon's Bay, and that is the natural outlet of the Federal territory. As those are the opinions of a politician who knows nearly every inch of New South Wales, will* the Minister of Home Affairs cause a survey to be made by an independent engineer of the country between, the proposed Federal Territory and Jervis Bay, to ascertain what the facts really are? tion of the question I have had the matter looked into, and have received the followMr Marshall is investigating the route between Bungendore and city site in order to ascertain whether a ruling gradient of i in 75 can be obtained; the object of the survey is to determine whether the connection should be made .with Bungendore or Queanbeyan. towns the gradients on Goulburn-Cooma line are severer in 40 for miles, with little prospect of improvement without re-locating the line; hence all traffic from Sydney would be delayed by passing over"" these steep gradients if the junction be made at Queanbeyan, while if practicable to connect at Bungendore the distance to Sydney would be probably reduced, and a portion of the line to Jervis Bay established. Whether the route is practicable or possesses any distinct advantage will be known in about a fortnight's time, when a report will be furnished. the reply which the Minister of Home Affairs has just given to the question put to him by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I wish to know whether, when he next brings a red herring into the House, he will take care to have it better cooked. ter of Home Affairs state whether there is not -in his Department a report showing that there are no engineering difficulties in the way of the construction .of this railway -that already a deviation has been discovered which obviates all the difficulties to which allusion has been made ? know whether there is such a document in the Department, but if there is I shall have it here to-morrow. ter of Home Affairs place himself in communication with the Public Works Department of New South Wales with a view to obtaining reports of rough surveys that were made, twenty years ago, in response to the offer of a bonus by the Department, and which showed an excellent grade from the railway line with which the Capital site will be joined to the coast ? the matter looked into to-morrow. tion put by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether he is aware that Sir Joseph Carruthers does not now speak as a representative man in New South Wales, and that being an owner of property in the Monaro district, he is naturally biased in favour of that territory? Minister of Home Affairs whether it is not a 'fact that Mr Scrivener some time ago travelled from the Federal Capital site to Jervis Bay, and reported that there was a direct route for a railway to the coast involving no serious engineering difficulties? Between these that I have just read was prepared by Mr Scrivener. I shall, however, look into the matter mentioned by the honourable member. Home Affairs, when looking into this matter, inquire whether a railway with a reasonable grade from the Capital site to the coast would need to go 40 miles west of Jervis Bay before it got into the hills ? cause inquiry to be made. that water would have to be pumped to an altitude of 800 feet in order to supply the Federal Capital at Yass-Canberra, and since there is no edifice of the height in Australia, the Eiffel Tower in Europe alone approaching it, will the Minister of Home Affairs take into consideration the desirableness of erecting in Sydney or Melbourne a monument 800 feet high, in order that the people of Australia may gain some conception of the height to which water would have to be pumped to supply the wants of the future Capital? my honourable friend that from a point further up the Cotter than that which he has in mind we could supply the Capital by W ill the Minismeans of a gravitation scheme. Modern engineering has settled all these questions, and as the water supply of the great cities of the world is now obtained by pumping, I fail to see why we should not adopt the same system at Yass-Canberra.",14,Federal Capital Issue Of Proclamation Railwa Y To Jervis Bay Water Supply

The honourable member for Swan twitted me last Friday with having been for many years .a member of the New South Wales Parliament without doing anything to remedy this state of affairs; but one of my first acts was to secure the appointment of a Select Committee, which made a recommendation to the Legislative Assembly on Mr Chanter. which the title to the land was validated, "" and the selector's family kept in possession. The then! Premier, a man who had a heart as big as his bodyI refer to the late Sir George Dibbs-di d not think This family setit too much trouble to go into the district, some hundreds of miles from Sydney, to ascertain the facts. Let me quote another instance of the way in which land was taken possession of in New South Wales; I refer to what is known as the Bickford case. In that case a free selector was driving his stock to market along a road the plans, but had never been proclaimed, and had been leased to a large squatter.. selector for trespass, and the case, went from one Court to another, until the selector was ruined, and lost his property. That happened although free selection before survey was permitted, and notwithstanding the fact that the road had been surveyed and was marked on the plan. I have mentioned that the only day on which applications for selection could be received was Thursday, but it often happened, when an application was made, that those in possession would put a notice on the land applied for, saying that they wanted it for an "" LLP . , "" or intended improvement purchase, or "" V.L.O's.,"" or volunteer land orders, were brought into use. The family could not have At one time every volunteer was given the right to take up 40 acres of land in any part of the State. These rights or orders were purchased by the land grabbers, and used to prevent selection. Another thing done to prevent the selector from proceeding with .his application was to get the Minister to proclaim the land which had been applied for as a water or a forest reAlthough the serve. There are hundreds of water reserves in New South Wales where water has never been conserved, and hundreds of forest reserves where trees are never likely to grow unless planted. Thus, with the help of Governments ruled and dominated checked. We are told that we should go and do as the pioneers did. The men of to-day have as much grit and determination as those who preceded them, but they have not the same opportunity for getting land. However, the Legislature was gradually liberalized. Radicals like myself were elected, although it took' all our patriotism and courage to get into Parliament, and to keep there. I have stated that while land might be applied for on a Thursday, it might be bought at auction on the following Wednesday at the upset price of £ 1 an acre, which, of course, would prevent its selection. In 1882 or 1883 an Act was passed preventing the Government from selling more than a certain area of land every year. when the late Sir Joseph Abbott, who was afterwards Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, was Minister of Lands, the large country estates were each divided into two portions, one known as the "" leasehold "" portion, of which the occupier was granted a lease for a period of ten years, and the other known as the "" resumed area,"" which was available for selection, but it was found, when the division came to be made, that the resumed areas were often spotted all over with little freeholds made by virtue of "" I.I.P.'s,"" ""V.L.O.'s,"" and auction sales. Sometimes a selector was almost completely surrounded by freehold land. quently it became necessary to pass an Act permitting the owner of freeholds in the resumed areas to exchange them for similar areas in the leasehold areas. It was thought that when the ten-years period came to an end, the. land under lease would become available for selection, as the resumed areas were, but since then many of the leases have been extended, some of them for as long as forty-two years. ter says that it is not intended to tax leased land. from alienated land because it must, by effluxion of time, come back to the people. Honourable members opposite have spoken of much of this land as very poor, but in the Riverina between 8,000,000. and 9,000,000 acres have been alienated. Were the land useless and unfertile, there would not have been the greed to accumulate large estates by means of the devilish system to which I have referred. Much of that land was taken up for speculative purposes,, and its value has'been increased by public expenditure by 400 per cent. I want to see our land settled on and devoted to the purposes of production, so that our people may rear sturdy boys and girls. I do not wish to see it merely trafficked in as it has been in the past. I was surprised to read a few clays since the following statement by the Premier of New South Wales rer garding the land questionThe trouble had been rapidly growing, and they were face to face with two problems. On the one hand there was no encouragement for the development of the country areas, because land for agricultural purposes was not available, and, on the other hand, there were many instances of large tracts of land either hemming in large towns and preventing their expansion, or, if not, the surrounding lands were held for pastoral purposes when they were suitable for agriculture, and there was no machinery for Then, bringing them on to markets, and no stimulant for putting agricultural land to its best use. Mr G. B. EDWARDS The argument there was that railways should be built, not that the value of the land should be reduced. ported in the Narrandera newspaper of the 6th inst. Mr Wade was pointing out that development and expansion were being arrested by the hemming in of towns by large estates, and that rich agricultural land was being used for pastoral purposes. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -He mentioned, too, that land was not being used to the Consefull pending the construction of proper means of transit. speaking at Narrandera, from which town there has been a railway to Sydney for many years. Between Narrandera and Junee are large tracts of country, which, twelve or thirteen years ago were held in freehold or under lease by large landholders, who did nothing to improve them. No attempt was made by the large landholders to deal with these vast areas; but, as the result of an influx of Liberals and Labour men into Parliament, the reserves were gradually taken from the control of these men, and we now have smiling homesteads and hundreds of farms where formerly only a wilderness existed. All the towns in the neighbourhood, as the Premier of New South Wales has admitted, have consequently increased in prosperity. There are many other towns the progress of which has been arrested owing to their being hemmed in by large estates, and among these are Deniliquin, Hay, and Jerilderie. According to the newspapers, one of the gentlemen who recently waited on the Prime Minister in regard to this Bill said that a number of properties in the Riverina district had been offered for sale, and that, since they had not been sold, the only inference that could be drawn was that there was no demand for the land. But is it not a farce to offer a man having only a few pounds, but plenty of pluck and determination, an area of 200,000 or 300,000 acres of land, which would cost him, perhaps, ,£500,000, when he desires",17,Fisher

In many cases a selector obtained ,a holding at £ 1 an acre, and improved it to the extent of another £ 1 an acre, but was so harassed by law suits and in other ways that he was glad to sell out to the neighbouring squatter for ios., or even js. 6d. an acre.

It is the """"'hold-back policy "" to which I object. I object to a man holding land simply for speculative purposes. In the Riverina district we have land capable of yielding a net annual return of from £ 2 to £ 3 an acre, yet we are told that it is giving a return of only that it is not being put to its best use. It is devoted to grazing, instead of to agriculture. man without money be able to acquire land as the result of the passing of this Bill?

Such subdivisions will be the incient to enable them to pay the survey fees and the deposit required to be lodged with an application for a piece of land. I have known those men, on obtaining a block, to battle on, year after year, improving their land, and in the off season making a few pounds by working for others. Give men of that class an opportunity to buy land in small areas and they will quickly make homes for themselves where now but a wilderness prevails. have to pay for the land. How is a man without money to do that ? money for defence as well as for other purposes; and for the better defence of the country, we wish to settle more people on the land.

The reason is broken up as the result of this measure, but the prices will still remain to be paid. a man has only sufficient to provide for the purchase of 100 acres, what is the use of offering him 50,000 ?

Of late years, the average has been over 20, and in many cases 40, bushels have been obtained. Of coursei we may get bad seasons again, but we shall also get good ones, and the class of men I should like to see on the land would, like they did in Egypt, make provision in the good years for the bad years. Round about Deniliquin, Moama, and Mathoura, 640 acres are sufficient, without irrigation, to give a man, not a living, but a competency, if he uses the land for wheat growing, and the other profitable uses to which he could put it. The State is spending much public money annually on agricultural colleges and experimental farms, but of what use are the latter when placed on large estates whose owners do not regard agriculture as sufficiently aristocratic for them? Further, millions of pounds of public money have been spent on irrigation, the water being taken, not through Crown lands, but through large private estates, whose owners will eventually sell at £ 1 0 , £ 1 5 , and' ,£20 an acre to men who should have been able to buy land for £ 2 or ^ 3 an acre. I have said that land is worth only what it will produce. If those who are on it will not put it to its full use, it is our duty, by taxation, or in some other way, to prevent them -from continuing in occupation. Leader of the Opposition says that the Bill is unconstitutional, but I think I have heard him express a different opinion. I do not put my views on a question like this against those of legal members, but, to my mind, it is clear that we have an absolute right to impose direct taxation. The next argument brought against the measure is that a land tax would not bring the best land into use. Would it not bring into use the lands of the western part of Victoria, which are worth .£100 an acre? Would the holders of those lands continue to graze sheep on them if they had to pay a tax? Would they not rather put them to the fullest use? As to the arid lands, is is not a fact that in the western parts of the Riverina there is very little freehold land, most of the country being held tinder lease for very long terms? A son of the ChafFor nearly forty years fey Brothers, who demonstrated what could be done with irrigation at Mildura and Renmark, has a station on the Darling, which he has developed in such a way as to make many of those leaseholders sorry that they cannot convert their leases into freeholds. It has been drummed into our ears that the tax will ruin thousands. I have already complained of my' exclusion from the deputation which waited on the Prime Minister. oversight. the members of that deputation to name a holder of freehold estate in the Riverina who will be ruined by the proposed tax. None of them will be ruined. I say that advisedly, having a practical knowledge of the circumstances of the whole district. The aggregation of large properties, in the Riverina is still going on, the desire for accumulation being a weakness'of human nature. When a man is poor and single, he desires to get enough to give him selfrespect, and to make him respect others. Having got so much, the Divine prompting to marry and beget urges him to make provision for the responsibilities of marriage. That he does. Then he says to himself, '.' I have vigour, health, and youth now, but the day will come when I shall be feeble, and unable to continue turning the wheel. I must make provision for old age."" Having provided for the old age of himself and his wife, he says, "" I must give my children a start in life."" All these aims are legitimate; but, unforThe tunately, the greed for accumulation never ceases. When -a man has done what I have described-and up to that point his efforts have been laudable-the State sliould intervene and say, "" You have done enough "" ; because all accumulation beyond what he has deprives some one else of opportunities. I believe that the Bill will be a means to a most beneficent end. We .have no desire to do injustice; but, if there must be suffering, it is better that the few should suffer tlian that the whole body politic should be in a state of serfdom. Let us make it possible for our people to acquire land, and by putting their shoulders to the wheel, and their hands to the plough, to build up an Australia which, if ever the enemy's flag should threaten, will be strong enough and patriotic enough to defend itself.

[106] the Minister of External Affairs the other Then day said that the occupation of the Northern Territory was one thing they had in view as an immigration problem.

The only chance we have of peopling the far north is to induce the much traduced squatter to go there. already what is worth having there. he is rolling rich with it. Personally, 1 have not heard of many big fortunes being niade there; but, if the squatters are making money, why do they not put more labour on the land, and reap more wealth. The answer is obvious; it is that their difficulties are too great in the way of transport, supplies, and so forth. In other words, the squatter has to await the oncoming of all those facilities which spell civilization, before the land up there can be put to profitable occupation. This tax, unnecessarily and unjustly, penalizes the men who are away far back in Australia; it seems, as it were, to shift the centre"" of gravity of land taxation to the margin of subsistence where values taper off into nothingness in the far interior. In my opinion, the .proposal is a travesty on a proper, well-adjusted, and equitably-apportioned land tax. What community created values are there in the far back codhtry of Australia? Yet it is proposed to tax lands there just as if they possessed all the advantages of communal existence in our urban and city areas. knows that practically the whole of the land out back is leasehold.

He is evidently talking about his own district, and the trouble is that in discussing this question we cannot get honourable members to look beyond their own electorates.

I use the quotation in order to show what is in the minds of honourable members opposite when they make proposals of this kind. The quotation 1 make is from the Worker, which reported the proceedings of the Conference. Mr Holman, the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in New South Wales, was declaiming at that Conference against the course which the Commonwealth Government proposed to take, and we must remember always that, until the late election, the Labour party in New South Wales were diametrically opposed to the Commonwealth taxing the lands, or interfering in any way any further with industrial questions. quite wrong in regard to the land. wrong in saying that Mr Holman denounced any proposal by the Federal Parliament to tax the land? member to speak of the Labour party. of the bulk of the Labour party. bers of the Labour party of that opinion. honourable member is wrong, as I shall show ; but, in the meantime, I wish to quote the Attorney-General, who, in replying to Mr Holman, said :Tlie policy of the Labour party was lo raise taxation in a direct way. They believed in no Customs-house taxation at all, whether they were Protectionists or Free-traders, but in taxation on the unimproved value of land. Mr Holman said in the State Parliament that he questioned the right of the Federal Parliament lo tax land values at all. If there was anything they should go to the country upon it was taxation upon the unimproved value of land-Ih e bursting up of big estates and direct taxation. Not only should the Federal Parliament tax land, but the State House also should do it. said exactly the opposite-that there was to be no State progressive, land tax if the Federal Parliament imposed a land tax. the honourable member will admit that I have a right to look beyond the platform to the ultimate intentions of honourable members. No one knows better than the honourable member that the platform is only for one election-that it will be altered beI am fore the next election-and , therefore, the views of the leaders of the party are very useful, as indicating the ultimate trend of proposals for this kind of taxation. honourable member for West Sydney thinks the trend is. quoted is a statement by the Attorney General at a Labour Conference; and I should not have used the quotation, but for the statement made a number of times by the Prime Minister, that there was no intention, in proposing this tax, that it should be a bursting-up tax; but that, on the contrary, it is proposed in order to raise revenue for defence and other legitimate governmental purposes. up. dentally,"" of course; but we heard nothing of the "" incidental"" bursting up at the elections when the purpose was quite clearly stated by the Prime Minister, and also by the Attorney-General.

What did the Prime Minister say then? There was a big Labour rally in Moorestreet, Sydney, shortly before election dayGood speeches were made from the Labour Doint of view, and they were reported at length in the daily press, which Labour members jeer at, but which treats therrv as well as it treats us. There were three meetings held on the same day, and the Labour champions addressed all of them. The present Prime Minister, speaking at: Annandale, saidUnless the Australian Parliament undertook the duty of making available the land whichwas suitable for agricultural development, uncloubtedly we would meet another financial' crisis within a few years.

I'm not going to quarrel with the State over the question of precedence. I don't care whether they burst up land monopoly, or we do it. But what I'm anxious and determined to the last gasp to do is to see that land monopoly is burst up. Then, speaking at Surry Hills, he saidI f the Labour party is returned, we shall endeavour to slay that hydra-headed beast-lan d monopoly.

Senator Stewart says that he would tax estates worth less than £ 5 , 0 0 0 . that all the State Labour platforms, except that of New Soudi AVales, provide for the taxing of estates of a less value than £ 5 , 0 0 0 . orable member for Corangamite, the object Honourable members do not do themselves credit in trying to suggest that their proposals do not tend in the direction of the taxing of land by the Shire Councils, and the State and Commonwealth Parliaments, with a view of taking its value away. Already the taxation amounts to 8d. or ad. in the shilling-6d . here, and 2d. by the shires. You have two-thirds of the value already. If it were provided in the Constitution that no State should impose a land tax above the limitations which we have fixed, the provision would not be more effective than our tax. No one would contend that any State Parliament would put on a land tax in addition to ours for any purpose whatever. I fancy that the High Court will have something to say about this aspect of the matter. The Attorney-General says that this country is more lightly far as direct taxation is concerned, than any other in the world. He says that 1-1450th of the population of Australia owns threeeighths of its land. The honourable member for Corangamite, too, quoted figures to show how great is the land monopoly. Speaking of the objective of the proposed tax, he said that men ought not to_ be pushed out into the arid districts. If it is not desired to bring about the closer settlement of the land in the arid districts, why is that land to be taxed? The honourable member said that we should settle the land near the cities, which has a good rainfall, and is in touch with railways. Every man is to be given a comfortable holding. it? can be given it fairly. honourable member's remarks furnish a reason for not imposing a tax such as has been proposed. According to Mr Knibbs, the total area of Australia is 2,974,581 square miles, of which 1,086,337 square miles have a rainfall of less than 10 inches, and 1.041,815 square miles a rainfall of less than 20 inches, so that in all nearly three-fourths of the lands of Australia have a rainfall of less than 20 inches, and do not come within the description of the honourable member for Corangamite as "" land near to cities, with a good rainfall, and in touch with railways."" ancl will not be affected by the B ill. that point presently. According to the honis to tax the 846,000 square miles which have a rainfall of more than 20 inches. If that be so, tliere should be some differentiation to make the tax equitable and useful. The Attorney-General says also that so far the resumption of land has failed, and that out of 1,400,000 acres which have been repurchased, 900,000 acres have not been put under crop. He did not tell us all the circumstances of t h j case. Had he done so, he would have quoted Mr Knibbs' statement on the same page that "" t h e persistent decline of wheat during the quinquennium has been practically counterbalanced by the increase of the area devoted to hay."" Mr Knibbs shows on the next page that the number of dairy cows has increased from 1,499,804 to 1,839,348. Does the Attorney-General suppose that Parliament can say whether taxed, so lancl shall be used for wheat-growing or for dairying ? Are not the occupiers of the land most competent to say how it shall be used ? The increase of dairy herds and of the area under hay shows that the policy he spoke of has not been a failure, but the reverse. With regard to his statement that Australia is the most lightly-taxed country in the world, so far as direct taxation is concerned, let me show that he manipulated the figures to support that conclusion. He says that in the United Kingdom the taxation amounts to £ 4 8s. 3d. per head, of which £ 1 7s. 1 i d . is indirect taxation, ancl £ 1 7s. i o d . direct taxation, making £ 2 15s. 9d., and £ 1 12s. 6d. local taxation. In Australia he says that the indirect taxation is £ 2 ios. 8d. per head, and the But the direct taxation 16s. per head; but he should have said that the latter is 16s. sd. He spoke of . the local taxation as 14s. per head, and the proposed land tax as being equal to 5s. per head, making in all £ 4 6s. 5d., or is. iod. per head less than is paid in the United Kingdom.

No one can complain of this Government that they did not tell the country plainly that they were going to try to burst up land monopoly by adopting a land policy as far as they could do so within the Constitution, but why did they not tell the country that they were going to impose a tax up to one-half of the unimproved value of land ?

It never came out of his notes, and the people were led to believe that the maximum tax would be one of 4d. in the £ 1 . A man who plays that sort of game on the public of Australia is very like the man who plays a game of cards with the joker up his sleeve. I do not know exactly what that means, but I understand that it is very reprehensible, and I cannot denounce in language too strong the action of the Prime Minister in telling the people that the tax to be imposed would be 33 per cent, lower than the tax he has ultimately proposed.

For instance, the Attorney-General was at great pains to prove that this tax was not going to break down land values, and the Prime Minister quoted figures to show that such taxation had not 'had that effect in New Zealand. The honourable, member for Hunter on the other hand, hopes that this tax will break down values, and enable the people to get cheap land. The honourable member for Riverina also says that he believes in his heart that it will bring down the values of the land. -say inflated values, if honourable members please.

I asked the honourable gentleman the other day what he meant when he said that the Government were going to take steps to throw open the lands of Australia, and he replied that they proposed the imposition of a graduated land tax and the acquisition by the Commonwealth and consequent lease of land now withheld from settlement in the Northern Territory. The Government are going to try to settle men up there. To begin with, they cannot induce them to go there. If they do, they will not stop. No man would be so foolish as to tackle the Northern Territory problem unless he had plenty of capital at his back and unless there was plenty of land available, and it was made worth his while to pioneer the tropics as men have pioneered other parts of Australia. all enterprise? wealth, according to the honourable gentleman, because it means penalizing wealth. point. t> be drawn from the honourable member's statement. orable member must not make his own preI f it is a good mises, and then draw his own deductions.

This tax will fail in its purpose, and do a great deal of damage, and, in my opinion, very little good, for the simple reason that, when it is passed, we shall still be absolutely dependent on the policies of the States before there can be any practical effect. This is the clumsiest, most roundabout, and most difficult way of reaching the desired goal of peopling Australia. The other day the honourable member for Batman compared this taxation to the dog tax, and said that the latter is intended to put dogs down. Of course, it is just as I supposed-thi s tax is intended in the same way to put: down the land-owner.

Of course, this is Would the honourable member what we hear in Parliament, but not what we hear on the platform.

The honourable gentleman now says that this is not a taxto put down land-holders-h e leaves that to the honourable member for Batman, whocompares them to dogs, whicli have to be put down by a tax. It is quite true that,, from many quarters, everything has been converging on a land tax. If we require a system of defence, a land tax must pay for it ; if we have to preserve the property of the rich, they must pay their own insurance; if we wish to have a system of old-age and invalid pensions, the land must: pay. All roads, it seems to me, lead to a land tax, just as in the old days all roadsled to Rome. Every one is prepared for a land tax, but every one is not prepared for taxation in one fell swoop, which, without compensation of any kind, takes half the land values from the large holders in Australia.

353,Mr Chanter,"Fo r the improvement oftaxation. I know that a land-taxer, and a single-taxer at that, has said that if we intend to impose land taxation, the highest amount to which we should go is 4d., so as ito leave the shires a reserve of 4d., and .the State Parliaments a reserve of 4d. also. He complains that the Government .propose to impose taxation in such a way as to rule out the other two bodies, and to remove any basis for further land taxation by the State Parliaments. unuch consolation in giving the three parties Teferred to the right to tax up to 4d. -merely of power and reserves of taxation. It would mean that the tax proposed under this measure would have to be .2d. less than it is. This taxation must have a paralyzing effect upon State Parliaments and municipal authorities. Can honourable members opposite tell ane by what rule of equity or justice they propose to put a tax on some city properties equivalent to ios. in the £ 1 in-come tax, while they propose that other -city properties shall go absolutely free? 'difficult question to answer. ment propose to tax income derived from site values at a rate equivalent to an in-come tax of ios. in the £ 1 . is so. I should like to hear the honourable gentleman controvert the statement. His contradiction does not do so. I am assuming that the owners of these city properties .are getting the usual 5 per cent, return, -which is the basis of all municipal calculations for taxation purposes. .are not based on 5 per cent. They run to -8, 9, and lo per cent., and companies frequently declare dividends of 12 per cent. .about city sites, which for municipal purposes are supposed to have a rental value -of 5 per cent., and, on an average, we ""know they do not return more. If they -did, the municipalities would be working on a false basis. man means ios. in the £ 1 of rent, not of income. thing in the cities. I am assuming that the city sites give a return of 5 per cent., and the tax proposed by the Government in such cases is equivalent to an income tax of ios. in the £ 1 on the people who have invested their money in these sites. I have yet to learn on what basis of equity such a tax can be justified. single-tax belief. orable member contend that it is consistent with the doctrines of the single taxer to tax be one property and not another? we tax the sources of accumulated wealth. about that in a moment. I mention a concrete case. A city land-owner has a block of land of £10,000 in value; he is waiting for an increment in its value, and is doing nothing with it. He is taxed under the Government proposal to the extent of £ 2 0 6s. 8d. per annum. Another man in the city has £20,000 worth of land values in different parts of the city. We will say he is a speculative builder, or something of that kind. The case is one which was put the other day in Sydney, and I know the facts stated are correct. The second landowner has his land in ten blocks, worth £2,000 each, and on every one of them he has erected a house, utilizing the land to its utmost. Does the honourable member for Macquarie think that this man would pay a tax equal to twice the amount of the tax paid by the first land-owner referred to? Nothing of the kind, because he has ten blocks, all of which are put to their fullest use, the Government propose to tax him, not twice £ 2 0 , but four and a half times £20 . For using his land, this man will be taxed to the amount of £ 9 3 , whilst the man who allows his land to lie idle will be taxed to the extent of £ 2 0 6s. 8d. This proposal is, therefore, not so much a tax upon idle lands, nor is it a tax to force them into use. So far as regards the aggregation clauses of this Bill, it is a tax on the use of land to its fullest extent. Take another case, in which a man has land of the unimproved value of £1.0,000 in Sydney, and has a shop upon it. He decides that he will obtain a block of the like value in Melbourne, and open a shop there. Immediately his tax in Sydney is doubled.. and he has to pay £ 9 3 in respect of the two blocks. Tf he halves the total tax, he has to pay £ 4 6 ios. on the block of the unimproved value of £10.000 in Melbourne; while the man alongside him in",40,Moloney Immigrants Men Rode 70 Miles On Motor Cycles To At

What is the reason for a great deal of land aggregation in the country? There are many cases in which land has been aggregated for the sole object of making the whole estate pay. Originally the estate was an unpayable proposition, and the owner obtained another block which would help him and enable him. on thc whole, to obtain a -fair return. Immediately that is done, the aggregation clauses of this Bill operate, ancl the owner is penalized for the mere aggregation, without respect to the particular value of the allotments that are aggregated. Then, again, the Government are taxing the small man as well as the large* the honourable member an instance. This Bill says, that if a man has land of die unimproved value of £3,000 in a land company, which, in the aggregate, has land of the unimproved value of £300.000-that is to say, if he is one of 100 persons holding land of a total unimproved value of £300,000-h e has to pay on that £3,000 about £ 6 7 a year. the sort. He pavs once. and I point out that he pays about £ 6 7 a year. Let the honourable member stop his bluff; I know what I am talking about.

They are penalizing the socializing of all land holdings by private individuals. bad lot. through is that the Government are not taxing the monopolistic possession of land. They are taxing the use of land in particular ways. If a man has land of the unimproved value of £3,000, and is working it on the individualistic system, he hasThat is one anomaly nothing to pay. If he has land of that value, and begins to work it in association with others, the Government at once come down on him. I want to know by what rule of equity a man is let off in the one case, and in the other is taxed to the extent of £ 6 7 per annum. All these are anomalies that seem to make the Bill unfair, and the Government will have tocorrect them, either in this or some other legislation. Their iniquity is apparent whet* we examine them in only a cursory way. I wish to say nothing more about the mortgagor. It seems to me that he is to be wiped out, unless the bank will voluntarily step in and save him. The banks are not likely to be guilty of any such benevolentaction; but there is the position. A bank a: present is in association with an owner to the extent of one-half, and, in some cases, may be, to the extent of two-thirds, ot the total value of the land, and yet it is to be let off; while the whole burdenis to be thrown on the mortgagor, who is struggling with a heavy overdraft. Is that intended ? Cannot the Attorney-GeneraV frame a more equitable provision? every case, except where the mortgagee is inpossession. nothing for the mortgagor to do but to walk out of his holding and leave it to the banks.

The honourable member for Bendigo told us that he was afraid that Labour legislation trended toward nationalization, and I was, therefore, interested to come across a pamphlet written by him some time ago/ in which he deals with this subject. the Federal Convention elections. since. tions like those I am about to make cannot be made too often. Hansard is a fine tellThere are, however, tale, and very interesting to the electors, though not pleasing to those honourable members who change their views often. In a preface to a book which he wrote, the honourable member saidFrom the sentence which follows the reader will see what the present writer's views are. His views are theseThe wholesale alienation of thc public lands and their stealthy but rapid absorption into large estates is a crime and a calamity which can only be averted by the steady, intelligent, and irresistible opposition of the people of Victoria to a policy at once demoralizing and destructive. The honourable member corroborates what has been said by the honourable member for Riverina regarding the jobbery which was practised in the past in the alienation of Crown landsThe reckoning day of Victoria has arrived. The land laws of the past have been examined, and reason enlightened by a sad experience has found them wanting. A careful study of the history of Victoria leads me to the conclusion that the unfavorable results which all deplore, and the transparent vices which all detest, are inherently associated with the principle of absolute sale on which all those laws were based. I do not know that any honourable member on this side favours land nationalization, but the honourable member for Bendigo certainly does soI t has been found that dummyism was less rampant, and speculative selection less resorted to, the more the control of the State over its land was increased, and the longer the period of probation was extended. Much more then would those evils have been mitigated ancl destroyed had the State retained an inalienable control over the land that belonged to it. The honourable member was totally and absolutely opposed to the alienation of Crown lands. to prevent it, but failed. in the pre-Fusion days, I suppose. Virtually, the free selectors and those squatters who availed themselves of free selection, through the agency of dummies, haTve been buying the land for nothing. The allotments which, under the Act of 1862, were paid for in instalments of 2S. 6d. per acre per annum were worth that much in rent for all time, and now, more extravagant still, a selector is permitted . to acquire his absolute freehold in twenty years by paying is. per acre per annum. Even this sacrifice would hardly be begrudged, if the persons intended to be benefited were not guilty of wholesale embezzlement of the estates entrusted to them.",45,Point Vor Investors

The next honourable member on the other side who spoke on the question was tlie honourable member for Grampians, and he developed so much heat in what he had to say that I was afraid we were going to have a bush fire. He appealed to us to think of the poor mananother evidence. of U riah Heep on die Opposition side. The honourable member said that there are millions of acres out back, and that the young fellows in this country must do as their forefathers did and undertake the pioneering work. I believe he mentioned that the out back to which he referred was in Western Australia, which was scarcely a becoming sentiment for a Victorian member. Personally, I believe that the pioneering work will have to be done by our young men, and tliey will have to go out back; but they should not be expected to do that until the lands adjacent to our seaports and railways are put to their proper use. When that is done it will be time enough to talk of sending our young men out to pioneer the uncivilized parts of the country. I come now to the honourable member for Parramatta, who occupies a more unenviable position in regard to this subject than any other member of the House. I have here the opinions he expressed on this question in days gone by. I am sorry that he is not at present in the Chamber, but I scarcely expected tiiat he would remain to hear his past called up before him. He spoke to-day about the robbery that will take place if this system is brought into operation, but he was possessed of very little sympathy in days gone by for the men who he says will to-day be robbed by the operation of this tax. Here are some of the sentiments to which he gave expression. In speaking in the New South Wales Parliament, on the income tax, he objected to it because, he saidIt does not touch the man who holds hundreds and thousands of acres of land which are lying idle, and from which he derives no income. The Colonial Treasurer the other night professed that an income tax would be derived from these unremunerative lands. How he proposes to obtain it I am at a loss to understand. value of £165,000 the income derived was That seems to me the veriest piece of political jargon that I have heard coming from a person in the exalted position of Colonial Treasurer. The income tax will tax incomes from land, but only to the extent to which that land is used ancl put into occupation. That is not what we want. I failed to follow the honourable member in what he had to say to-night. He expressed himself in favour of every kind of land tax that could be suggested. The only system of land. taxation to which he is opposed would appear to be tlie system proposed by the Labour party. But. according to the opinions to which he has given expression in the past, if this measure emanated from the other side it would have his whole-hearted support. The honourable gentleman went very much further than I , or, I hope, any honourable member on this side, would dare to think or dream of going. This quotation reveals the real inner thoughts of the man. He saidI do not believe in paying for land at all. I believe in taxing it, and if we tax it to its f u l l unimproved value we shall have no need to sell it ; indeed, no one will buy it. When a man wants a bit of land in this colonyNew South Wales, I suppose he meanthe has to go hundreds of miles back into the bush behind his strong neighbour who has picked out the eyes of the country. We ought to tax the strong neighbour for every ounce of privilege which he possesses over the man who proposes to go into the bush. The honourable gentleman said a great deal more to the same effect, but I have quoted sufficient to show his real views on the subject of land value taxation. The honourable member for Pawkner also had something to say on this question. It is interesting to know that he is the gentleman who introduced to the Prime Minister the deputation that dealt with the Riverina land. I have heard no justification from the other side of the figures quoted by the deputationists. Really it was an insult to tlie intelligence of the people that men should deputationize the Prime Minister upon such a paltry pretext when they could not make out a better case. If no better arguments against the proposed system of taxation can be advanced than those which were used by the deputation to which I refer, it must be admitted that the opponents of this measure are in a very bad way. not arguments. so. This deputation told the Prime Ministei that from an estate of the unimproved o m v £ >35 ° P annum. z er An estate of that unimproved value would have a capital value of about £247,500, and the income of £2,350 per annum would work cut at something less than 1 per cent.

It is about the best argument that could be advanced in support of the imposition of such a tax as this, for it shows that great areas are practically put to no use. The honourable member for Fawkner and the honourable member for Lang, as well as the honourable member for Parramatta, who has just resumed his seat, told us that the closer settlement policies of the different States had worked admirably; that they had done all that was required of tliem, and that, consequently, there was no necessity for Commonwealth interference. In view of that statement, it is interesting to .observe how the closer settlement policy of New South Wales has worked out. Mr age, 98 persons to the square mile. On Wade, speaking to the electors of New South Wales during the present State .electoral campaign, has said that seventeen estates have been resumed by the Government for closer settlemerlt, that 151 estates have been privately subdivided as a result of his closer settlement policy, and that during the life of the Carruthers and Wade Governments, 11,052 separate and bond -fide farmers have been provided with homes. transfers during Mr Wade's term of office than there have been new settlers on the land. going to mention that facta fact to which Mr Wade has made no reference. Honourable members opposite who have quoted his words as to closer settlement in New South Wales have not told us what is going on in other directions there. According to the New South Wales Year-Book, during the last four years the effective farming population of New South Wales has increased by 2,791 holdings; while there has been an increase of 789 in the number of holdings of from 1,000 acres to 3,000 acres in extent, and an increase of 182 in the number of holdings over 3,000 acres in extent. That, then, has been the net result of the resumption by the Government of seventeen estates, at a cost of nearly £2,000,000, the the private subdivision of 151 estates ancl the setting apart of 11,052 separate holdings under the Crown Lands Act. It proves conclusively that as fast as the lands have been thrown open in one direction in New South Wales they have been swallowed up in another. On the testimony of the Year-Book of New South Wales, therefore, the Wade Government's closer-settlement policy has broken down just as badly as has the closer settlement policy of other States. With one or two exceptions, every member of the Opposition has, at some time or other, committed himself to the very principles that we are now advocating, yet to-day they see no virtue in them. I believe that if this measure had been brought down by the other side it would have received the whole-hearted support bf many who now think it their duty to condemn it. I wish now to compare the monopoly of lands in this country with that of lands in other parts of the world. In England and Wales to-day there are 498 persons to the square mile, and on the Continent of Europe there are, on the averthe other hand, in Victoria we have only 14 persons, in New South Wales under 5, Queensland and South Australia under 1, Tasmania under 7, and in Western Australia under 2 persons to the square mile. Any one who takes even a passing interest in what is going on in this country must be forced to the conclusion that land monopoly is being carried on to an insidious extent.

We have the further alarming fact that in Victoria 116 individuals or companies own 5,280,000 acres, or about one-fourth of the total alienated lands of the State. There are forty-five estates each having a capital value of over £100,000, and some of these comprise as much as 80,000 acres each. We have in the two shires of Hampden and Mortlake, comprising an area of about 1,100,000 acres, 800,000 acres, or nearly three-fourths of the total, held by less than twenty families. matter of fact, over one-half of the total area in occupation is held in areas in excess of 1,000 acres, whilst in New South Wales over one-half of the total area in occupation is held in estates of over 5,000 acres each. On every hand we find ourselves face to face with the insidious results of land monopoly. What has been its effect upon the farmers, in whom the Opposition claim to have a special interest, and upon whom they shed their crocodile-like tears? During the twenty years prior to 1908, over 4,000,000 additional acres came into occupation, yet the number of farm ht>I dings in occupation decreased to the extent of over 6,000. Have the Opposition any explanation for that state of affairs? Surely, with the additional occupation of land to that extent, we should naturally expect to have more farm holdings. Again, let me point out how population has been affected by .land monopoly. According to the last two census that have been taken, during the fifteen years prior to 1909 Victoria lost 150,520 of her adult population. With about two exceptions, the electorate which I represent has a larger proportion of farmers than has any other constituency in Victoria, and its position, so far as loss of population is concerned, may be taken as fairly representative of many other constituencies in the Commonwealth. offers a good example of the effect which this absorption of small holdings by the large land-owner has had in driving out the population. In 1908 there was a population of about 70,000 in Indi, and, according to the census returns for 1901, there was then a population of 61,000. In the intervening seven years the excess of births over deaths amounted to 15,000, yet the population increased by only 9,000. In other words, 6,000 residents of that electorate have had to go elsewhere to obtain a living. prove that Victoria will lose a member, Mr Parker Maloney. while Queensland will probably gain one. It is not very consoling to Victorian representatives to know that their State has suffered more than any otber by the gradual absorption of* small holdings and land monopoly generally, and, further, that their State is the only one that has not established an unimproved land tax in some shape or form. New Zealand has had such a tax in operation for nearly a quarter of a century; and if the system is going to prove so disastrous as we are led to believe by honourable members opposite, how In Victoria, as a is it that for the last-twenty-five years the young men have been continuously leaving Victoria where there is no land tax, and going to. other States and the Dominion where the system has long been in operation ? them in Victoria. the second member of the Opposition who has supplied what is really the only answer to this interesting question. The facts prove that wherever a tax on unimproved land values has been tried it has resulted in greater facilities for going on the land. The honourable member for Parramatta and others have on many occasions twitted the Labour party with being opposed to immigration; but that is a charge which I take every opportunity to emphatically deny. We are not, and never have been, opposed to immigration; all we contend is that it is idle to bring people here until lands are available for genuine settlement. What is the use of inviting immigrants here to simply swell the ranks of the unemployed ? My own belief is that the proposed land tax will prove the means of providing land for immigrants. It is particularly desirable that there should be such a land tax when we are considering the defence proposals, because defence, like It immigration, is practically impossible unless the lands are unlocked, so that Australia may become the home of a large white population. I did not desire to give a silent vote on this great measure, because it deals with the question on which I laid the utmost emphasis when on the hustings. I made no secret about the matter, but propounded the policy of an unimproved land tax to die best of my ability; and the fact that the great majority of my constituents are genuine settlers, who are putting the land to its best use, and that they sent me The next census will, I think, here, is overwhelming proof that the farmers of the country are too intelligent to",49,Point Vor Investors

But our land, when we took it up, was land in the back country. be in the hands of men who will make homes on it, and not speculate with it. ber says that the young men of to-day have not as good opportunities to acquire land as their forefathers had; but, as a matter of fact, there are millions of acres as good as that to which I refer, and as near to civilization as it was. I do not suppose there is any hope of defeating this Bill, but I trust that the Government and their supporters will be prepared to do what is just in the matter so far as its provisions will permit. The proposed tax is to be levied ostensibly on the unimproved value of land, and in clause 3 that is defined in this way"" Unimproved value"" in relation to land through which shire tramways have been run. means the capital sum which the fee simple of We have a number of such tramways mainthe land might be expected to realize if offered tained in Queensland by the local authorifor sale on such reasonable terms and condities, and the ratepayers are taxed to make tions as a bond fide seller would require, assuming that the actual improvements thereon good any deficiency in their working.

The residents of the district under such a system take all the risk of railway construction, and though under that system the unearned increment is added to the cost of their holdings, the Federal Government propose in this measure to tax it for Commonwealth purposes. If the unearned increment is paid for, as it very often is under this system in Queensland, by the owners of the land, it should be regarded as an improvement. I make that suggestion for the careful consideration of the Attorney-General. left to tax then. Those people would escape the tax altogether. ber forgets that the Bill imposes very heavy taxation upon the capital value.

490,Mr Sinclair,"The honourable memsee this system encouraged in every possible way. happen for any country is that men should unite in a common cause to manage their own business, and so assist themselves and each other. I am afraid that this Bill will have the result of penalizing, co-operative companies, because, after taxing the property of a co-operative company on the higher scale, a shareholder's interest in the company is added to the value of his holding for purposes of assessment. I do not know what object the Government .can have in thus proposing to impose double taxation upon persons interested in co-operative companies. Mutual life assurance societies are to be exempt, and why not mutual manufacturing and producing companies? gestion. jmember doubts the accuracy of my statement, I advise him to read the Bill. orable member's proposal to exempt mutual manufacturing companies. that if a man holds shares in a company, and the value of the company's property is fully taxed, he should not have his interest in the company added, for purposes of taxation, to the value of his own property. forgets that the principle of the measure is subdivision. reason, for the proposal. With respect to clause 51, dealing with the remedy against other persons where the taxpayer makes default, I think it will, in many instances, result in considerable hardship, and the penalties provided in the measure for offences are very severe. It has been contended that one of the main objects of the Bill is to tax unearned increments, but in the effort to do so many hardships will be ""inflicted upon men who have put their money into land which has not 'been improved in value. I gave one instance from the Port Augusta country, but many similar instances might be quoted. In many cases people who have invested their money in properties paid as much, and more, for them originally than they are worth today. No doubt in every one of the States there are in the agricultural districts estates of 25,000 acres, which were purchased at £ 1 an acre from the Crown, and are now worth £100,000. ment amounts to £ 3 per acre, or something like 300 per cent, but in the pastoral disOne of the best things that can tricts there are many estates of 100,000 acres, each of which has cost the owner £100,000. Yet under this Bill the owner will be taxed at the same rate, though one had paid £100,000 for his property and the other only £25,000 for his. I admit that it is right that the State should derive some benefit from the unearned increment, but it is not fair to tax it up to the extent of confiscation. Now, as to the cry for land, let us see how far it is genuine. We have heard a great deal about land hunger, but I venture to say that if residential conditions were imposed in connection with the choice bits of land in Victoria which are quoted from time to time, there would be fewer applications for them when they are thrown open for selection. Any. man will be glad to invest his money in land if he thinks he can make money out of it, and that is a reason why the various Governments of the States give preference to those who will reside upon their holdings and make tlie most profitable use of them. I find from the report of the Queensland Under Secretary for Lands, for 1909, that in that State during the year reported upon, 1,619,800 acres were resumed from pastoral holdings, and made available for selection. In case some of our honourable friends opposite may be on the look-out for some place to settle upon, I shall give them tlie particulars furnished in the report to which I have referredNotice of resumption from pastoral holdings for settlement purposes was given during 1909 as follows :Burke District6 holdings, .301 7-16U1S square miles. Burnett District5 holdings, 219^ square miles. Darling Downs District1 holding, 18$ square miles. Gregory North Dislrictr holding, 280 square miles.

496,Mr Sinclair,"That must be themuch to decimate the country of settlers PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT who are useful, if for no other purpose, in keeping back the spread of that pest. In order to cope with the spread of prickly pear, land has been offered for selection journed. free of cost, together with a bonus for clearing it of that pest, and under those terms 82,000 acres of prickly-pear infested and prickly-pear frontage selections have been taken up. There are millions of acres journed. available for settlement in Queensland, and hundreds of thousands of acres may be obtained at peppercorn prices. Some of the very best land in Queensland may be acquired free of charge, and a bonus will lie paid for working it. If people are too poor to take up land under those conditions, I am very much afraid that they will not be able tp take it up under any which could be devised. Anything that will hinder the settlement of this land will do an injustice to the great State of Queensland, which 1 am sure the Prime Minister, as one of its representatives, does not desire to hurt in any way. I should like him to bear in mind the large area on which the Government are spending enormous sums of money, with a view to keeping back the two pests to which I have referred. It is estimated that the cost of eradicating the prickly pear will amount to .£2,445,022, and if land so infested is put out of occupation the pear will scon take complete possession of it. Some 60,000 acres of land have been repurchased by the State, and there are 3,000,000 acres of timber reserves. In passing, I am sorry to say that, notwithstanding the extent of those reserves, we are importing every year timber to the value of £2,000,000. On referring to the leaflets issued by the Queensland Government, we see under what conditions these lands may be acquired.
