We have strikes, and some of them are serious-mor e particularly transport strikes, the effects of which are far-reaching, because they extend considerably beyond the persons immediately involved in the dispute. countries have their strikjes and lookouts, too, and it is unfair to represent Australia as being particularly and specially afflicted by strikes. time the damage done by strikes is very serious indeed, and it is most important in the interests of the community as a whole bhat everything possible should bfi done to diminish them, and that all agencies working in that direction should be kept alive. tirely have been remarkably few interstate strikes since its establishment. The extent of the work of the court may be well judged by its operations in the year 1925. Men of the actual work of the court I shall read from a summary recently prepared by the PresidentOn 1st February, 1925. the Court had on its list 70 matters r-equiring attention. Between 1st February, 1925, and 18th February, 1925, 218 other matters have been lodged. The Court has dealt with 250 matters during the year, leaving only 38 matters on the list, all except two of recent date. Of tbe matters settled, 52 wpre brought before Hie Court either by plaint or order of reference. The rest were applications to vary appeals undor section 17 of tbe Aet, applications for interpretation, appeals from decisions of boards of reference, applications for cancellation of registrations, and applications under section 56 of tlie Act. There have been 41 compulsory conferences held during the year. There have been 42 agreement settling disputes filed in the Court tinder section 24 during the year. The Court has, nn occasions, settled industrial disputes, not interstate, by special request. Boards of references appointed under awards of the Court have dealt with 277 matters during the year. The number of employees affected, by the awards of the court amounts to 330,000. I soy, therefore, that it is out of all question to consider seriously the suggestion that this industrial machinery should be scrapped, and all the court's awards, the result of 20 years' work, set aside, interstate industrial disputes being left for the future to the adjudication of some at present non-existent body. It must be Mr Latham. remembered that no single State is able to deal effectively with an interstate dispute, even when the dispute is made interstate merely by the service of a printed claim. If we 'wish to secure industrial But other peace through the medium of the law, there must be some means of dealing with these disputes on a federal basis. Therefore the Government is of opinion that it A t the same is necessary to continue the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and to make certain improvements to it . The bill does not provide for anything like a complete treatment of the subject. I wish to make it perfectly plain at the outset that The court will not eni t is designed to deal only with the period prevent strikes, but tlhere intervening between the 30th June and the time when the proposed constitutional amendments have been voted on by the people. The Government is of opinion that our present constitutional powers To give honourable members an are not sufficient to enable it to deal satisfactorily with the industrial situation, and it does not propose to introduce an elaborate and carefully worked out scheme for the settlement of disputes upon the basis of our present limited powers. If our powers are extended it w ill become possible to introduce an improved scheme providing for a common rule, and for other means of settling industrial disputes than those provided under the Arbitratio n Act. I do not wish to be misunderstood on this point. If the proposed constitutional amendments are approved by the people it w ill not be necessary for parties to bring themselves to the stage of a formal dispute, for it will be possible to establish authorities which w ill have power to regulate terms and conditions of industrial employment, irrespective of the existence of a dispute. It will also be possible to preserve the existing A r b i tration Court, to extend and improve its powers, and tp add other means of determining industrial conditions. This measure is not a f u l l treatment of the subject, and it does not pretend to-be such, in the circumstances, there would be no object in the Government seeking to walk delicately between the various decisions of the High Courti n order to see how far it might go under its existing power. The proper thing to do is to face the whole problem, and to ask the people for whatever additional powers are necessary to enable it to deal effectively with industrial matters. powers and u n t i l, at least, there is power to give effect to a common rule in our system of industrial regulation, we shall be working under the gravest difficulties both practical and theoretical.

I have already mentioned that the term, of office of the present occupants bench expires on the 30th June next. The subjects w i th which the bill deals may it confers judicial power upon the A r b i tration Court; secondly, it gives a life tenure of office and pensions to the judges; and, thirdly, it provides means for obtaining general decisions which would apply to any of the awardsof the court, and would be followed by the judges on all matters such as those affecting the basic wage or the standard hours of industry. It further provides for the continuance of part-heard matters which are now before the President and Deputy Presidents. of those subjects separately. As to the question of judicial power, it may be convenient for honourable members if I explain the difficulty that has to be faced under the present legislation. members are quite familiar with the facts, but others may not understand the position clearly. judicial power affects the authority of the Arbitration Court to enforce its awards. which, of course, this Parliament is absolutely bound, the powers of the Commonwealth three headings, namely: -Legislative, [89] which are vested in the Parliament; Until we have those executive, which are vested in the Governor General acting on the advice of the Executive Council; and judicial . Section 71 of the Constitution provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the H i g h Court and in such other Federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in It is, as I such other courts as it invests with Federal jurisdiction. "" O t h e r courts"" means State courts which this Parliament may invest w it h Federal jurisdiction. SectionI f the amend72 of the Constitution provides that ihe justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by Parliament shall If , unforbe appointed by the Governor-Generali n Council, and shall not be removed except by the Governor-Generali n Council, on an address from both Houses of the There are cerParliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the ground of misbehaviour or incapacity. The meaning of section 72 has been considered by the H i g h Courti n a case that of the Arbitration Court is generally referred to a3 Alexander's Case, which honourable members w ill find reported in 25 C.L.R., page 434. It was be stated as follows:-First, held in that case that sub-section 2 of section 72 provided that federal judges must have a l if e tenure of office. The position is, therefore, that the judicia l power of the Commonwealth can only be exercised by courts the judges of which are appointed for l if e . We are bound by that interpretation. the Constitution in that respect? that may be considered when the whole I propose to deal with each question of constitutional amendment arises, but at present we are bound by the decision that the judicial power of the Commonwealth cannot be exercised by any person who is holding office for a limited term.

Under the Constitution, as I have said, it is impossible to confer judicial power upon any judge whose appointment is for a limited period. the chief judge is £3,000 per annum, and that for a judge £2,500 per annum. Those are moderate salaries, having regard to the important nature of the work that will have to be performed. The act at present provides that the President of the court must be a H i g h Court judge. That will be altered by the new section 13, substituted by clause 6. It is proposed that the judges shall be entitled, after fifteen years' service, to retire upon a pension. The same proposal is made also in relation to the H i gh Court judges in another bill which, by leave of the House, I shall introduce to-day, and I shall reserve my general remarks on the subject of judicial pensions until I speak on that bill. pension scheme which is embodied in this proposal, and follows precisely the existing provisions w it h relation to the Supreme Court judges of New South Wales, is, in the first place, to attract good men and to save them when appointed from financial anxiety. able members must know that, with human nature as we find it , pensions are necessary to preserve the efficiency of a tribunal that has a life tenure. In saying that I do not in any way reflect upon the present occupants of any bench. Besides, all other Commonwealth servants are given pensions.

Clause7 confers upon the Government power to utilize the special knowledge of a judge where it is thought proper to do so. Clause8 furnishes a means for obtaining a determination from the f u l l bench of the Arbitration Court upon the questions of standard hours and basic wage.

Buti t must be remembered that that court The object of the can deal only with particular disputes.

First let me say a few words as to the basis proposed, and I shall then submit the considerations upon which I rely for the justification of this measure. The basis proposed is the same as that which has already been put before the House this morning in connection with the A r b i tration B ill , which obtains in New South Wales at the present time. b ill proposes that pension is payable only to a judge who has served for fifteen years, or retires on permanent disability or infirmity after five years' service. That is to say, a justice of the H i g h Court must in every case have given five years' service before he w ill be entitled to any pension. tiring age for judges of the High Court? explained in dealing with the last b ill, it is impossible to fix a retiring age. able gentleman submit a provision that in certain circumstances a judge would not be entitled to receive a pension if he did not retire? to propose such a provision as that. The bill proposes that if , after five years' serAt vice, a judge retires on permanent disability or infirmity, he will be entitled to a pension equal to one-fifth of his'salary. In the case of a member of the H i g h Court bench that would be £ 6 0 0 . In the case of a judge of the Arbitration Courti t would be £500 . Theni t is proposed that the pension shall increase year after year according to the length of service unti l after fifteen years' service it reaches in the case of a judge of the Arbitration Court other than the chief judge, the amount of £1,250 per annum, and in the case of a justice of the H i g h Court, or of the Chief Judge, £1,500 per annum. The basis, as I have said, is the same as in the case of justices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In Victoria pensions are provided for Supreme Court judges and County Court judges. In Western Australia and Tasmania, also, pensions are provided for judges. They are not provided for judges in Queensland or South Australia. There Canada, and New Zealand, and, in several cases, upon a more generous scale than is provided in this b ill . I hope this measure will commend itself to honourable members_ on both sides. It is generally conceded inj, this Parliament that pensions are desirable. All permanent public servants of the Commonwealth are entitled to pensions, with the exception of their Honours the justices of the H i g h Court. The Publio Service pensions scheme was introduced a long time The after the establishment of the Service. The general principle of providing pensions for public officers is now admitted as desirable. It should be quite clearly understood by the House that this proposal is not brought forward on the suggestion, direct or indirect, of their Honours the justices of the H i gh Court. They have made no request for pensions. The measure is brought forward by the Government upon the advice more particularly of myself as a just and proper As I have already provision to make. It is strange that the justices of the H i gh Court should be the only public servants of the Commonwealth for whom pensions are not provided. It is strange that they should be the last of our public servants for whom such provision is proposed; they should have been the first.",25,Second Reading

There is a general consideration to which I particularly invite the attention of honourable members, and it is one of the principal reasons for the introduction of this measure.

Now, the Treasurer says the hill does not give an option of market values. But what is the meaning of those words? The Treasurer has not read his own bill, judging by his contradiction of my statement -One would have imagined that maximum that matter in my reply. new assessment is given between the existing assessments and the market values. Under the old arrangement the option was between existing assessments and the new schedule of maximums and minimums, which have no relation whatever to market values. That is the first thing to which I wish to draw attention. Now take two provisions of the bill-paragraph s 3 and 3A-and contrast them. Paragraph 3 refers to the old assessments, and its effect is that if a taxpayer has failed to elect a value within the minimum and maximum limits laid down in the new schedule, the old assessment, based on standard values-that is, the old schedule -stands . Paragraph 3A refers to the new assessments, and it provides that if a taxpayer fails to elect a value within the limits prescribed in the new schedule, market values shall apply. That is clearly and definitely stated. why this discrimination between the old assessment and the new assessment under the ""War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act? They cover exactly the same period of. years. Persons who are assessed in a certain year under the old assessment should have the same option as those who come under the new assessment for that period. has said that the same provisions apply; but I say that they do not. Let me give honourable members a contrast between the two schedules. The schedule fixing certain values for sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs in each State was declared to be invalid because it differentiates between State and State. I shall take the lowest values given in a State and the highest for the minimum and maximum under the old standard valuation, and I shall then take the maximum' and minimum under the new schedule without relation to States. I ask honourable members to remember that the Treasurer said in this House on the 6th October, 1924, that the values in the old schedule were fair. Probably they were. Though they were invalid, they were fair ; but in order to make them valid the Treasurer brought in a new schedule giving maximum and minimum values. and minimum values, based on what the Treasurer described as a fair standard of value, would have been adopted, but, strange to say, the values have been reduced beyond recognition. The minimum value prescribed for sheep was 5s. under the old schedule, and 2s. 6d. under the new. The minimum value for cattle was 35s. under the old schedule, and 10s. under the new. The minimum value for horses was £4 under the old schedule, and 15s. under the new. The minimum value for pigs was 15s. under the old schedule, and 5s. under the new. Let me turn now to the maximum values. The maximum value for sheep was 12s. 6d. under the old schedule, and 10s. under the new. The maximum value for cattle was £6 under the old schedule, and £5 under the new. The maximum value for horses was £20 under the old schedule, and £3 under the new. The maximum value for pigs was 50s. under the old schedule, and 20s. under the new schedule. I contend that, under the old schedule, the values But were fair, and that it was not necessary to make such reductions in order to make the valuations valid. The new schedule was framed only to get away from the discrimination between State and State. for those values? The Treasurer by the Taxation Department. After the Cameron judgment the Income Tax Assessment (Live Stock) Bill of 1924 was introduced, and under that the option was given of existing assessments or market values. That was the alteration made imder that act. It was done because it was believed that the values were fair, although invalid.

As a matter of fact, the option of market values was not given under the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act. In introducing this bill the Treasurer said it was practically impossible in 1924 to ascertain the market value of live stock carried by many pastoralists during the pre-war years, and he further explained that The Treasurer, when speakmarket values did not apply to the 1924 War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act. Yet what he described as being impossible-the option of market values -wa s provided for in the Income Tax Assessment (Live Stock) Act passed the week previously. If it was impossible to give the option of market values under the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act of 1924 how was it possible to give that option under the Income Tax Assessment Act that was passed during the previous week? The War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act applies to excess income. The valuation of stock for assessment purposes should be the same The Treasurer in both cases.

That excuse of the Treasurer is not at all sound. option under the Income Tax (Live Stock) Assessment Act. It is strange that although the Treasurer said that it was practically impossible in 1924 for taxpayers to give the market value of the live stock they carried in pre-war years fits tax purposes. to the Treasurer, I think that that is a quibble. There is nothing that renders the ascertaining of the value of live stock more difficult for income tax purposes than it would be for war-time profits tax purposes. The value of the stock is the same, whether you are submitting it for income tax purposes or for super-income tax purposes. D r .

It will show the serious position in which this Parliament is being Taxpayers were given an placed. It is provided in the bill that, if a taxpayer already assessed fails to elect a new basis of valuation for the purposes of this measure, the old assessment must stand. Where w ill thatvlead us? The old assessments were based on the valuation of live stock by what was called the departmental standard values. Definite but differing figures are set down in that schedule as the value of stock in the various States of Australia. Wheni t was put to the H i g h Court, in the Cameron case, that prescribing different values for the different States set up distinctions as between State and State, and so was unconstitutional, the H i g h Court ruled that the assessments based on that method of valuation were invalid. But. notwithstanding that the existing assessments have been declared invalid by the H i g h Court, the Treasurer is now asking Parliament to say that if the taxpayer does, not choose another basis of assessment, the assessment based on the values set down in the schedule of the old act must stand. the persons concerned w ill escape taxation altogether. dogmatic on this highly technical legal I shall explain why question, but I submit that failure on the part of the taxpayer to elect a new basis My point is that, if of valuation cannot make the old invalid assessment valid. That is common sense. If you cannot make the old assessment valid, and the taxpayer neglects to choose a new method of assessment, you w ill not be able to collect the tax. The Commonwealth has lost a large sum of money because of faults in drafting legislation of this character. We have totally lost the It is still practically amount of the assessment in Cameron's case.

120,Mr Scullin,"I do not desire to bedue to this and other causes. In the three years 1921-2 to 1924-5, the total amount of war-time profits tax collected was £2,925,957, £1,315,096, or nearly half of the total amount collected. That is an altogether unsatisfactory was not due solely to the Cameron judgment, but also to legislation that was weak from other legal standpoints. the administration of this act has been found by the taxpayers, and tbey have escaped meeting their obligations. Some of the refunds may have been due to the fact that the assessments were not correct or not j u s t; but the fact that nearly half the amount collected has been refunded shows that there is something, seriously wrong w it h the administration. In the financial year 1924-5,. the total amount of war-time profits tax collected was £249,959, and the refunds amounted to £336,048. Actually £87,000 more was refunded than was collected. There has been a considerable amount of money rc-. funded as the result of the amendment to the act in 1924, but I venture to say that if the same basis of valuing stock had been possible under the War-time Profits TaxA c t as under the Income Tax Assessment Live Stock Act, what was lost in refunds under the one would have been regained by taxation under the other. balanced the other. I dare say that the argument w ill be put up that it does not matter for the purposes of war-time profits taxation what basis of valuation is adopted, because the tax has to be paid on profits derived from salea. If we were dealing with a continuing tax, or with a man who was in business in pre-war days and was carrying on the same business right through, the method of valuation might not matter very much; but the fact is that we are dealing w it h taxpayers who keep chopping and changing. If there were only one basis of valuation for income tax and war-time profits tax purposes, we should get over the difficulty. In dealing w it h a new business, the method of valuation is most important. Let me suggest two illustrations to honourable members, one of which works out against the taxpayer and the other against the department. Let us assume that two men have a number of sheep. One pastoralist, let us say, purchased at 30s. per head. Assuming that all of the sheep are in hand at the acand the refunds were counting period, he could only take them into account for valuation purposes at 10s. per head, although he paid 30s. per state of affairs. It head for them. During the last year in. which this tax was operative he sold them, at 35s. per head. Loop-hole after loop-hole in amount paid for the stock can be taken into account and charged up against h i m . ber is wrong in thinking that the actual price can be taken into account. Under the Income Tax Live Stock Assessment Act, and under the new assessment for war-time profits tax purposes, the taxpayer would have the option of taking this schedule of prices or the market value into consideration. he is entitled to put into account the prices he paid. could not do that under the War-time Profits Tax Act of 1924. after buying the stock at 30s. he sent in a return valuing them at 10s., he would show a profit of 20s. One would have get at is that, if he buys for 30s., and at the end of the accounting period values the stock at 10s., according to this arbitrary maximum, and then sells for 35s., he will be deemed to have made a gross profit of 250 per cent., whereas the fact of the matter would be that he. had only made a profit of about 16 per cent. Taking into account his costs, his profit might be reduced to 10 per cent., and he would not be properly taxable under the War-time Profits Tax Act, and if he were assessed under it he would be unjustly assessed. Now let us take the case of the other man, who at the accounting period has stock in hand worth 30s., but who can take them into account at not more than the maximum of 10s. per head, and perhaps at as little as 2s. 6d. per head. The value of stock at the end of a period, as compared w i th its value at the beginning of a period, very often accounts for a large part of a man's income during a",31,Earle Page I Gave The Tax

126,Mr Scullin',"What I am t r y in g toyear. If he takes the minimum valueand he has the choice between the minimum and the maximum-h e can show an actual loss. By this method the Department in one case may lose money and the taxpayer in another case may be overtaxed. A system like that is not sound. I admit that it will balance itself if the tax continues from year to year, but it will not balance itself with the wartime profits tax. Consider, for example, the case of a man who has entered into business during the last year of the tax. The valuable increases in his stock are in hand at the end of the year, and he takes them into account at the end of the accounting period for the last year of this tax. He returns them at the low valuations allowed under the schedule, and in that way shows no profit, because his stock would cost more to produce than the value he would show for it. If the tax continued in the next year the matter would be adjusted, because he would have to pay taxation on the profits of his sales. It may still be said that we would tax him under the provisions of the Income Tax Act. That, however, is not so, because he is allowed, for income tax purposes, to adopt a different system of valuation. He can take one value of his stock for one tax, and another value for another tax. On a given date, a man may value sheep for income tax purposes at 12s. 6d. a head, and for war-time profits tax purposes at 2s. 6d. a head. Those values would be for the same sheep at the same time. He could value cattle at £6 for income tax purposes, and 10s. for war-time profits tax purposes; horses at £20 for income tax purposes, and as low as 15s. for war-time profits tax purposes; and pigs at 50s. for income tax purposes, and 5s. for war-time profits tax purposes. Is it not an absurd law that makes that possible? Surely live stock cannot have one value under one act and another value under another act. I say now, what I said in 1924-that whatever basis is adopted for valuing live stock, or any other stock, the same basis should be adopted for both acts. basis. argument would not arise. That, however, is another question. There is something to be said both for and against a cash basis. In the case of the income tax the object is to ascertain and tax the income or gain during the year for which the tax is being collected. That frequently cannot be done on the cash basis. When the original War-time Profits Tax Act was passed the basis for valuing stock was exactly the same as that employed for income tax assessments; there was no variation until the 1924 amendment. The time has arrived when this House ought to alter a law which, in some cases, is unjust to the taxpayer and in other cases is unjust to the Department. Section 10 of the War-time Profits Tax Act of 191718 laid it down that war-time profits shall be determined on the same principle as they are determined for income taxation. Why has that sound principle been departed from, especially as we were assured, when the amendment was made in 1924, that it was not being departed from? On that occasion the Treasurer repeatedly said that the basis that was applied to income taxation would be applied also to war-time profits taxation; but when we see the tax in operation we find that a differentiation is made. Let me return to the legal point I was discussing. As honourable members know, the Government lost revenue on the decision in the Cameron Case. We were unable to collect on that assessment, because, when the High' Court declared that it was an invalid assessment, there remained no assessment at all. The bill says that where a taxpayer fails to elect a value as laid down in the schedule, the existing assessment shall be deemed to be correct and valid. But how can this bill declare to be valid what the High Court in the Cameron Case declared to be unconstitutional 1 If the Cameron assessment had been declared invalid owing to some legislative defect, we should have power to make it valid; but as it was invalid because it was opposed to the Constitution, no legislation of this Parliament can make it valid. The mere inclusion in the bill of the provision that the existing assessments shall be deemed to be correct and valid will not make them valid. Suppose a man fails to elect within the period of seven months any of the values set down in the schedule because, as he says, none of them is correct. He may contend that his stock is worth 20s., while the maximum value allowed is 10s. The department would then deem that the existing assessment",32,Earle Page I Gave The Tax
127,Mr Peowse,It should be on a cash,33,Earle Page I Gave The Tax
128,Mr Scullin,"On a cash basis thisshould stand, and the man -would sit back and say, "" I refuse to pay."" The department would take him to the court, and his lawyers would simply quote the Cameron judgment. I venture the opinion, although it is not considered wise to prophesy, that the court would uphold the decision in the former case. ""We should then be required to deal with further amending legislation, and in the meantime a large amount of money would be lost to the Government. That is a serious position, which ought to be considered by the legal advisers of the Government. If we cannot tell a man that he must take standard values fixing a certain price in each Statef or sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs, we cannot say to him, "" We wil l make you take those values if , under certain circumstances, you fai l to elect other values."" W h a t we cannot do directly we certainly cannot do indirectly.

That makes the position clearer as far as income taxation is concerned.

Under the old schedule a man in , say, New South Wales, had to return his sheep at a valuation of 10s., irrespective of their market value. In Victoria he would have to return them at 12s. 6d., in Queensland at 9s., and in South Australia at 10s. Because of that differentiation between the States, the High Court said the act was unconstitutional. The law was then amended, and the man was told that he could choose the former values, and that if he did choose them choose ?

Government has been so lavish with refunds to other people, I can see no reason why refunds should not be made to men who Parliament intended should be exempt from the tax. As a matter of fact, this bill is retrospective in dealing with the other anomaly, as it provides a refund to all soldiers who paid war-time profits tax on that portion of their income which would have been exempt from the tax if they had paid income tax .and had not gone to the Front. The Government has refunded nearly half the total amount of the war-time profit tax collected, and we might do this tardy act of justice to people whom it was intended to exem.pt.

I have shown the huge amount that has been paid in refunds, as the result, in some cases, of very bad administration, and in either cases, of very faulty legislation. complaint is that little or no notice is taken of these things when the attention oi' the Government is drawn to them. Our taxation measures are f u l l of anomalies. We are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds every year because of the loopholes in those measures. There should be a complete revision of our taxation legislation. We should obtain the considered opinion of experts in the matter, and the considered opinion of honourable members on both sides, before bills dealing w i th the subject are passed.

' [90] NEW GUINEA BILL. ister) [ 2 . 5 7 ] I move That the bill be now read a second time. I do. When the This measure does not contain any new principles. The New Guinea Act of 1920 was passed by Parliament to make provision for the acceptance of the Mandatef r o m the League of Nations over the Territory of New Guinea, and also for the efficient government of the Territory. For the better working of the measure, it has been found that certain amendments are necessary, and this bill has been introduced to make them. Section9 of the act of 1920 empowers the Governor General to appoint a person to act as Administrator when the Administrator is absent from the T e r r it o r y ; it makes no provision to permit of the Administrator retaining his powers when absent from the Territory. He makes visits occasionally to Melbourne to consult the Minister upon official business; but while I do absent from the Territory, he can take no action in his capacity as AdministraI have endeavoured to tor. It has been found desirable that he should be in a position to do so, and the amendment of the existing act proposed by clause 2 w ill enable, the Administrator to retain the powers of his office whilst absent from the Territory. Section 14 of My the New Guinea Act of 1920 provides that the Governor General may make ordinances having the force of law in the Territory. To facilitate the administration of the laws of the Territory, and to overcome legal difficulties which' are likely to arise by virtue of the laws of the Territory having force only w it h in its limits, it is considered desirable that the act should be amended to enable the Governor General to make ordinances having the force of law both in , and in relation to, the Territoiy . No specific cases have yet arisen in connection with which this difficulty has been present; but such cases might at any time arise in connection with the administration of such an ordinance as the Lands Registration Ordinance of the Territory, which allows persons outside the Territory to take certain action.

It is proposed to amend the acts relating to those Territories to enable ordinances made thereunder to apply in and in relation to the Territories. Section 14 of the existing act provides that ordinances made by the Governor General shall be laid before both Houses of-Parliament within fourteen days of the making thereof; or, if Parliament is not then provided that, in addition to complying sitting, within fourteen days of the next meeting of Parliament. In some cases, considerable difficulty has been experienced in complying with the requirements of this section, as it is not always possible to obtain printed copies of the documents within the time specified. It is desired that the period should be extended from 14 to 30 days, so as to give ample time for the consideration of proposed ordinances by honourable members. I recommend the bill to the favorable consideration of the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. (ADMINISTRATION) BILL . ter) [8.2] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of the bill is to amend the Crown Lands Ordinance 1924-1925 so as to provide for the granting of freehold in respect of-(a ) Town lauds; (Z>) Agricultural lands; (c) Garden lands; and (d) Tropical lands. In a country like the Northern Territory it is difficult enough to induce people to settle and engage in production without the handicap of the leasehold system. The first difficulty encountered by a selector who takes up leasehold land is his inability to get assistance from any financial institu-. tion. In that respect the settler in the Northern Territory is under disabilities not imposed upon his neighbours in Western Australia and Queensland. land assumes a bigger financial burden. where land has little more than a nominal value, but his equity in a block is some security upon which he can borrow. The provisions of the amending ordinance may be summarized as follow:The holder of any existing town lease, or of a town lease that may hereafter be granted, may, at any time, apply for a grant in fee simple of the lands included in the lease, and the grant may be made, with the conditions of the lease, the lessee has securely fenced the land; erected on the land a residence of the value of at least £50 within the first twelve months of the lease; resided on the land continuously for twelve months immediately prior to the application; and paid the purchase money and all moneys due in respect of the land. The purchase price fixed by the Land Board shall not in any case be less than £5. Agricultural lands consist of any lands within an area declared to be an agricultural area for the purposes of the proposed ordinance.

Since 1922, however, the act has been a dead letter, principally because the police authorities in some States have not been devoting so much time as formerly to the work. The Government has now given further consideration to the matter, and it has decided that as aliens who enter the country are obliged to register with the Migration Department, there is, in present circumstances, no need for them to register with the police departments.

The Government has decided that it would not be advisable to incur any heavy expense in keeping a check on the aliens here. For that reason it is proposed to suspend the operations of the act.
