Navigation Ball has inquired into their effect. day, the view of the Government is that either course would involve great delay. The Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill will consume a considerable .amount of time in hearing evidence, and considering the various matters referred to them. The Navigation Bill itself contains about 430 clauses, and involves some large and intricate commercial questions, so that we do not expect that the work of the Commission will be completed in less than six or seven months at the earliest. will obtain the report of the Commission in time to have the Navigation Bill dealt with next session. it would be pretty late in the session before the Bill could be passed. After the Commission has reported, the Ministry must consider its report, to see how far its recommendations can be adopted. Then the Minister charged with the preparation of the Navigation Bill will require a month or Attorney-General, a new measure for the consideration of the Cabinet. Then again, finally agreed upon by the Government through Parliament. Beyond all those delays there is that referred to by the right honourable member for East Sydney, arising out of the possible reservation of the measure by the Imperial authorities. Now whatever necessity there may be in the view of the Imperial authorities to reserve the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, owing to the inclusion of these clauses, will apply with tenfold force to the Navigation Bill, impinging as it will upon the Merchant Shipping Act and the movements of various sections of the British mercantile marine at so many ports. Therefore, it is probable that theNavigation Bill will be reserved for a much longer period than will the Arbitration Bill, even if these clauses are included. were not included, we should have only one have considered the suggestion Bill reserved instead of two. pedite matters so far as these particular clauses are concerned. made in the Bill for dealing with the case of the local seamen without touching navigation clauses at all? insert any navigation clauses in this Bill. matters relating to navigation ? opinion with regard to that.

The next deduction I draw is that if it is proper to provide, in reference to a twopenny-halfpenny dependency like Papua, that any Ordinance that may prejudice shipping interests in any part, not all parts, of the King's dominions, should be reserved for the pleasure of the Governor General, and that it cannot be assented to by the local Lieutenant-Governor, it is inevitable that legislation such as that before us which affects the vast shipping interests of the whole Empire, must be reserved for the Royal Assent. The Government lay down the principle in connection with this miniature dependency, that any law which may prejudice the shipping of, say, Thursday Island, should be reserved for the assent of the Governor General before it can become law. of tons of shipping-the shipping trade of the British Empire-and with the contracts upon which the whole of that trade is based, and surely a Bill' of this kind is of sufficient importance to reserve for the pleasure of the superior authorities.

If my honourable friend were sitting on this side of the Chamber he would not see the slightest difference, except in favour of the view I take. If in connection with an insignificant spot like that to which ships make the rarest visitations, where a three-masted ship is not seen from one end of the year to the other-if in that remote and savage spot it is necessary that the powers of the Commonwealth should be conserved by the reservation of the right to deal with shipping, how proper must be the attitude of any authority here which applies the same principle to a measure of this kind. that the Bil l must be reserved? question it? myself. fatal admissions ever made by a Minister. tically laid down in the conferences which were held that all Bills relating to shipping must be reserved for the Royal Assent. more than candid in making that statement. As a man with some experience of public affairs I merely wish to express my profound astonishment at it. If these provisions are not inserted in the Bill, does the Minister expect it to be reserved ? if these clauses are not inserted in the measure, it will not be reserved for the Royal Assent, but that if they are it will be. these provisions, it will be valueless so far as the seamen are concerned. ment presently.

If the Minister admits that, the exercise of the very commonest ability would suggest a very simple way of dealing with this matter without incurring any such risk. What possible difficulty is there in the way of the Ministry incorporating these clauses in a short measure which shall be complementary to this Bill? We should then get the whole of the Arbitration Bill extended immediately to every class save the seamen, and the question in regard to reservation for the Royal Assent need affect only one clause contained in a separate measure. the difference between managing public affairs, which puts a torpedo in a Bill that we are anxious to pass in order that it may explode, and that method which puts it in another measure, so that if it does explode it will not .destroy the Bill which is of pressing importance, passes my comprehension. purposes. monwealth. I never feel more at ease with my own conscience than when I take a broad view of matters of this character without any reference to political parties. That is what I am endeavouring to do at the present time. I am attempting to state my own opinion without reference to any proposal affecting my own interests or the interests of honourable members. I have not endeavoured to "" jump "" upon the Ministry in connection with this matter. On the contrary, I ask them in the friendliest way to take my suggestion into their serious consideration. I have never attempted to drive them in the slightest degree. I am merely pointing out that the Minister of External Affairs has made an admission which places the Government in a most ridiculous position before the friends of this B ill ' throughout Australia. we have provisions, the insertion of which will admittedly result in the "" hanging up ""* of the measure. Those provisions can be inserted in another Bill, and this measure need not be "" hung u p "" for a single moment. While the Bill complementary to this one might be reserved, the machinery con-, nected with this great reform could be brought into operation without a day's delay. Surely we do not need to be members of a particular party to realize the common sense of adopting that course. I feel convinced that the more Ministers study this matter, the more they will see that they are drifting into a false.position from the want of a certain amount of business aptitude. The admission made by the Minister of External Affairs., is absolutely fatal to these clauses from my point of view. Is there anybody in this Chamber, who-afte r the admission of the honourable gentleman that if these clauses are not inserted in the B ill it can be immediately assented to-wil l say that the course proposed by the Government can commend itself to any reasonable man?

I do not wish Minister cannot appreciate the honourable members to express an opinion that method of upon their merits have done so. honourable member. I do not at present intend to discuss these controversial matters in any way. The admission of the Minister that the insertion of these clauses in the Bill will cause it to be ""hung up"" for an indefinite period, whereas, if they be not inserted, it will not be "" hung up "" for a single moment, is surely a substantial reason why this measure should not contain such provisions. If it is a matter of great urgency that they should be passed concurrently with the Bill, surely, during the period that the discussion of this measure will occupy in the Senate, which will require to consider it just as carefully as we have done, there will be ample time in which to pass a short Bill containing these controversial provisions, which if inserted in this measure will destroy its efficiency,' and may possibly prevent it becoming law: I have put before the Committee, upon a former occasion, the substance of what I am now saying. The strength of my objection lies in the danger which exists that this B ill may be reserved for the Royal Assent. That' is the pith of my objection.' Here Having. arrived at that conclusion, I think that no friend of the Bill can support the Ministry in the course which they propose to_ follow. I have no desire to complicate this issue by introducing ofher matters.

115,Mr Hughes,"That is about the onlybe of no value to the seamen. Seamen engaged in the Australian coasting trade naturally compete with those employed by shipping companies that would come under these clauses, and it would be in the last degree unfair to place the ship-owners of Australia at a disadvantage as compared with those of other countries. No court would ever dream of making an award of so one-sided a character. Therefore, one of two things would happen-eithe r the court would make no award, because it would hesitate to inflict an injustice upon the ship-owners of the Commonwealth, or, if it did, it might crush them out of existthe House were not in favour of the.inserence. I should be quite ready to hear the arguments of those who favour the putting of these clauses into a separate B ill, prothe suggestion of the right honourable memvided they would support them if dealt with in that way. But it is, to say the least, dealt with in a separate measure; but I somewhat curious that we should be told by honourable members, who have expressed bitter opposition to these provisions, that we ought to embody them in a separate measure. If that course were adopted they would be able to renew this debate, to cover once more the ground that had already been well traversed, and then to reject our proposals. Would that advance the cause which the Government have at heart ? Would such a line of action be of any advantage to the seamen? I wish now to deal with a few of the arguments that have been brought forward against the merits of these clauses. AfterI have discussed them, the Government will be very pleased to hear anything that may be said about the advantages of dealing with the clauses in another Way. If they were inserted in the Navigation B ill they would not come into operation for at least eighteen months from the present time. That measure is now before the Royal Commission, which cannot possibly conclude its labours and submit a report to the Parliament in time to be of any service during the present session. It would thus be impossible for us to deal with the Bill before next session; and such a measure would take at least four or five months to pass both Houses. It would then have to be reserved for the Royal Assent; and assuming that that assent were given within three or four months of the passing of the Bill there would be a delay of at least eighteen months from the present time before these provisions became law. During all that time the seamen would receive no benefit whatever. If these clauses were embodied in a separate measure the same argument would not, of course, apply. position would be different if we received an assurance that honourable members merely opposed these clauses because of the proposal to embody them in the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill, and would supporl them if they were placed in a separate measure. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat is opposed to these provisions, not because they possess, in his view, any inherent defect, but because it is proposed to embody them in this B ill , instead of in a separate measure. We can understand and approve of that attitude. It would be a wholly different matter if tion of these provisions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, but would adopt ber for East Sydney that they should be repeat that to insert them in the Navigation Bill would be to postpone their becoming law for at least eighteen months. I do not know that there would be any lengthy delav if they were embodied in a short Bill, but personally I see no reason why the Government proposal should not be adopted. I have no reason to believe that this Bill is urgently required for any other purpose than to settle a possible dispute in the maritime trade, and the seamen, perhaps, are the most likely body to be early involved in some trouble.' I would remind honourable members that the last great maritime dispute did not arise from any difficulty in which the seamen were directly affected, but that a sympathetic strike was really the cause of the trouble. A difficulty in regard to any of the branches of the maritime trade might readily extend to all of them. Let me now say a word or two on some of the objections that have been urged against the Government proposals. In dealing with them a day or two ago, the honourable and learned member for Parkes adopted a completely opposite attitude from that assumed by the right honourable member for East Sydney. He urged that the provisions to which the right honourable member now takes exception as being alien to the Bill, were the primary clauses of the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill ; that they were drafted by the right honourable member for Adelaide, and would properly belong to it. It is a very obvious fact that if they are alien to the, measure they can hardly be considered to be primary clauses. If ""they have nothing to do with, it they cannot be The regarded as properly belonging to it. It has been said that these clauses constitute an interference with the liberty of the individual, and would have a very prejudicial effect upon the producer. It has also been urged that we ought to regard the matter through Imperial spectacles. I agree with this last assertion, and I propose for a minute or two to consider.it from that aspect. The shipping trade of Great Britain is, perhaps, of all trades, the most deserving of the attention of the citizens of every British-speaking country. The British Empire to-day is dependent wholly for its continued existence upon. both its mercantile marine and its Navy. It is impossible to suppose that the Empire could cohere for any length of time if either of these forces were crippled. The pre-eminence of the mercantile marine is necessary, and the pre-eminence of the Navy is absolutely essential. The very kernel of Imperialism depends upon the command of the sea. I have before me a copy of the report of the British Steam-ship Subsidies Committee. That Committee was appointed to inquire into the increasing competition to which the mercantile marine of Great Britain is subjected by foreign countries. It took voluminous evidence, and furnished a report, which is most interesting and well worthy of our attention. Another committee on the manning of British ships sat in 1896 under the presidency of the Right Honourable A. J. Mundella, President' of the . Board of Trade. Both of those committees pointed out the alarming decrease in the number of British seamen and the causes to which this decrease might be attributed. I request those honourable members who speak about the Imperialistic views which we ought to take of these clauses, to look at those reports, to consider the position of the real bulwark of the Empire, and to see how it is crumbling to decay before our eyes. In the report on the manning of British ships, it is pointed out that 47 per cent, of the seamen employed, in the British mercantile marine are foreign, consisting either of lascars or of foreign white seamen. There are, of course, engaged in the coastal trade of Great Britain a much smaller proportion of foreign sailors; but in the ocean trade there are 47 per cent, of aliens amongst the crews of British vessels. That proportion is increasing year by year. British seamen are becoming noticeably fewer and fewer. Apparently nothing is being done to encourage English men to take to the sea. Much is said with regard to reMr Hughes. lieving the competition to which the chief British shipping companies are exposed, but nothing whatever is proposed with a view to remedy the most cruel and onesided competition to which the British seamen is subjected. I for one can derive no consolation from the fact that a ship flies the British flag whilst her crew consists principally of aliens. Men like Lord Brassey, Lord Charles. Beresford, and the members of the Navy League-wh o may be considered to be experts upon this subject, and to have the best interests of the Empire at heart-sa y unreservedly that unless something is done to encourage British seamen the mercantile marine, as a nursery for British seamen, will become extinct. We seek by these clauses to avoid the condition of things which is unhappily existing in the British mercantile marine, and we are endeavouring to buildup on the coast of Australia a mercantile marine which will be manned by Australian seamen, who may in times of difficulty and distress be of some service to the Commonwealth. tleman tell us how many seamen in Australian vessels at the present time are Australian born? tell the honourable member that no effort has ever been made in this country to encourage native-born Australians to ship aboard the mercantile marine. The first effort that I know of in that direction is now being made in New South Wale.o, where the Imperial Naval Authorities have placed the Dart at the disposal of the State Government for the purpose of training as seamen a certain proportion of the boys on the Sobraon-the reformatory ship in the harbour-whenc e they will be transferred as opportunity offers to the coastal trade of Australia. That is the first instance of which I know-ther e may be others; if there are I 'shall be glad to hear of them-of an effort to man the Australian mercantile marine with Australian-born seamen.

I take a certain amount of credit to myself for having, in conjunction with one or two other honourable members, wrecked the former Bill. I have not yet spoken upon the present Bill, and I should like to briefly If, as the result of the operation of the Bill, explain the reasons why I do not consider that it is conceived in the interests of the whole community. It appears to me that three classes of the community are interested in the measure. First of all there are the workers, who are chiefly represented under the name of unionists; secondly, the manufacturers; and thirdly the consumers, who represent the great majority of the community, and upon whom the unionists and the manufacturers are dependent. There is also a fourth class, namely the workers who do not belong to' the unions. This Bill seems to have been brought forward entirely in the interests of the unions, who, under the guise of conciliation and arbitration, are attempting to secure control over those men who do not belong to the unions, and to force them into their ranks with the object of wielding greater political power than they have been able to exercise in the past. I may be' wrong, but that is the only conclusion I can form. We all know that certain portions of the Bill, as originally introduced, have been struck out, and that the unionists will not reap so much benefit as they had hoped. A number of manufacturers are to a certain extent favorable to the measure. The support which the Bill receives from this section of the community is derived from those manufacturers who are carrying on. their businesses in or near the large centres of population, such as Melbourne or Sydney. Certain States laws are in operation which seriously affect their operations,"" and they find that manufacturers carrying on business in the smaller States are able to successfully compete with them, owing to the fact that the hours of work there are longer and the rates of pay somewhat lower. manufacturers recognise that under the provisions of this measure they will be able to impose upon manufacturers in other States the observance of the conditions as' to hours and wages with which ' they have to comply. If they succeed in this, the smaller manufacturers must give up business, or transfer their operations to the larger centres. They would not be able to compete with their bigger rivals on account of the extra cost of freight. Therefore, I can fully understand why the large manufacturers favour the Bill. The consumers and the men who do not belong to unions cannot derive any benefit from the measure, but, on the contrary, will probably be placed at a great disadvantage. wages are raised and working hours are shortened, the cost of manufacture must be added to and the prices to the consumers increased. For these reasons I have always opposed this Bill. If it becomes. law we shall have a repetition of the case of the fox and the goose in the old fable. The Labour Party represent the fox and the rest of the community the goose. The Labour Party hope to secure a far larger degree ""of political power, and if they succeed we shall, in the near future, see the goose eaten up by the fox. I now propose to deal with the proposed new clauses. We have been told that if the seamen are not brought under the operation' of the Bill they will be the only workers in the community who will derive no benefit from its provisions. Honourable members have not, however, adduced any evidence to show that the seamen are at present labouring under any great injustice, or that, owing to the unfair competition of oversea steamers with Inter-State vessels, the wages of the local seamen have been reduced. Not only should these statements be substantiated, but proof should also be afforded that no monopoly would be created if the present competition were reduced or abolished. If convincing evidence upon these points could be presented, some honourable membersI do not include myself-migh t be induced to support the Government proposals. We find that the 1,500 seamen employed on our Inter-State vessels are in receipt of higher wages than are paid to sailors in any other part of the world. Fourteen years have elapsed since the great maritime strike of 1890, and notwithstanding that the competition of oversea vessels has prevailed The Sydney and Melbourne during the whole of that period, the wages of the local seamen have not been reduced. Why then, in the name of common sense, has this bugbear about reduced wages been, so persistently obtruded upon our notice?",25,Honourable Members Hear Hear
147,Mr Cameron (Wilmot),"I have alseamen not been reduced? for a short time only, owing to the depression which prevailed throughout Australia. cently to the extent of ios. per month, or about 7 per cent. wages of our seamen are higher than those paid in any other part of the world. United States, the wages paid to seamen are much higher. wages of our seamen have not been lowered to any extent worth mentioning. No one has yet shown that these clauses will benefit the Australian seamen. they have been strongly opposed by two representatives from Western Australia, and by one honourable member from Tasmania. As a Tasmanian, but as one who has no personal interest in the matter, I am also opposed to their introduction, and for reasons which to my' mind are sufficient. We have been told by honourable members opposite that the rates which are paid to seamen employed upon ocean-going vessels do not represent a "" living ' ' wage, and that they should be brought up to the standard that obtains upon Australian vessels. Buti f these provisions be carried, and if , as a result, the wages of seamen engaged upon ocean-going vessels are raised to the Australian standard, who will pay them? I unhesitatingly affirm that they will be paid by the producers of Australia. ber does not think that the operation of this Bill must necessarily raise wages? that the honourable member would never dare to support a measure the operation of which he thought would result in a loweringof the wages of the workers of Australia. B ill we shall secure a tribunal which will decide upon the merits of each case. of members of the Labour Party is that the .operation of this Bill will result in an increase-no t in a decrease-of wages. We have been assured that the rates which are -paid to seamen upon ocean-going vessels are infamously low. Is the honourable member for Kalgoorlie desirous of seeing the wages which are now being paid to Australian sea> men reduced to the level of those which are being paid to the seamen engaged in oversea ships ? sion to be drawn from the honourable member's interjection is that he hopes to see the wages which are being paid upon ocean-going steamers increased. If they are increased to the Australian standard, who will ultimately pay them? Does any one suppose that the owners of those vessels will eventually sustain the loss ? Of course it is quite possible-as was pointed out by the honourable member for Fremantle-that .any increased wages which may be paid upon oversea vessels whilst trading on the Australian coast will be deducted 'from the amount due to their crews at the end of In fact, their voyage. AlthoughT am interested in wool, and to a smaller extent in grain, if these clauses be carried, I should not be affected in the slightest degree. They will not injure the land-owners, because there are a certain number of ships which come direct from England to particular ports, where, after discharging their cargo, they load up with wool or other freight, and return to the old country. These vessels will not come into competition with Australian boats, and therefore the class which I represent will not be compelled to pay a farthing more than they do at present. But there are an immense number of people in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, who will be grievously injured if these clauses become law. I allude specially to the producers of butter, cheese, and meat-to those who are interested in the export of perishable products. These persons must send their goods to England in' cool storage chambers. If the owners of ocean-going vessels are required to I know perfectly well pay increased wages to their seamen whilst trading upon the Australian coast they will undoubtedly charge our producers increased freights. I ask honourable members opposite whom they are desirous of benefiting? Is it the British seamen, the foreign seamen, or those coloured natives of India and elsewhere, to whom they have meted out such peculiar treatment on previous occasions? I am in possession of a few facts which have not yet been touched upon by any honourable member, and which seem to me to be worthy of very close attention. I find that there are a certain number of overseasteamers which engage in our coastal trade to a greater or less exlent, and which have been engaged in it",26,Honourable Members Hear Hear

There are also. 4,880 men employed on vessels engaged in the trade, between Great Britain and Australia which are owned by four steam-ship companies registered in Great Britain, and I believe that I am justified in saying that if we could ascertain the actual facts, we should probably find that of that number one-half were foreigners. honourable member refer?

Members of the Labour Party then declared that a subsidy for the carriage of Australian mails should not be given to The British-India vessels manned by coloured crews. They urged that we should not grant one farthing by way of subsidy to such vessels, although The E. and A. Comit was admitted that the regularity with which they were, carrying on the existing service was beneficial to Australia. Without receiving any quid -pro quo, they now ask us to pass a measure that would impose an enormous burden of taxation on our fellow citizens merely to benefit some 13,000 or r 4,000 coloured men and foreigners. Can they for one moment attempt to justify their present attitude? It seems to me that they are simply stultifying themselves. Far better would it have been if , instead of standing up as the professed champions of the 1,500 seamen engaged in the Australian coasting trade, they had agreed to the passing of a clause which would have insured the regularity of our mail services, and conferred a benefit on the community.

I have not an opportunity to check the figures as to the number of men employed on Australian vessels engaged in the coasting trade; but I think Hansard will show that it has been stated during the debate that there are between 1,500 and i,7°o persons so employed.

I believe to be the facts. Most of the Australian newspapers, even if opposed to a man, will generally endeavour to give him fair reports of his speeches. I cannot complain of the action taken by any newspaper in regard to myself during my political career; but even if I had reason to complain, I should not do so. It is idle for an honourable member to fight against a hostile newspaper, because it can write him down, and leave him without redress. He might reply in the House to. any attack made upon him,, but if the newspaper ignored that reply, it would have but little effect. But I have been led away from my line of argument. Whether the number be 1,500 or 15,000 I would remind members of the Labour 'Party that the persons whom they propose to benefit by the passing of these clauses are, for the most part, coloured seamen from beyond Australia. I know that the members of the party have reasoning powers, and, therefore, I wish to drive home the point that they are proposing to increase the wages of those men at fhe expense of their fellowT colonists. That is the point which I am anxious that they should fully consider. This is not a party question. If these clauses were defeated, the result would not be the resignation of the Ministry. I , as one of 'those who helped to place the present Government in power, may claim at any rate that they give f u l l consideration to any views that I express.

I believe any measure to be undesirable, then, regardless of the party from which it has emanated, I always vote against it. That has been my record, and in these circumstances I urge the Government to consider this question, not from any party point of view, but from the broad standpoint of whether the Bill is likely to be beneficial. The honourable member for Perth made a strong appeal on behalf of the people of Western Australia, and I sympathize with the course which he adopted. I cannot imagine that any representative of Western Australia will hesitate to f o l I merely state what low the course adopted by him. It must be evident that if these clauses be passed there will be only two courses open to the owners of the oversea steam-ships.

185,Mr Cameron,"I am always happybecause the more the competition that exists between over sea shipping companies, the more likely we are to get low freights. That fact cannot be disputed. It is intended to exclude foreign companies from participating in the Inter-State trade. But they do not participate in it at the present time. sageries Maritimes, and the Japanese vessels do not, I honestly believe, take one ounce of freight between one Australian oort and another. Therefore, what in the name of goodness is the use of telling us that the Government intend to exclude them from engaging in the coastal trade? benefit would it be to British ships which at present do not suffer from the competition of the foreign lines to give them a preference over those lines in the Inter-State trade ? There is not likely to be any competition in the future, because it must be perfectly well known to honourable members that those foreign vessels which receive subsidies from the French, German, and Japanese Governments respectively, are under special contract to complete their voyages withina given time. They have no time to enter into the Inter-State trade. They cannot run between Hobart and Perth, for instance. Consequently they are not in the slightest degree likely to enter into competition with British lines. They are not doing so now, and they will not do so in the future. Therefore, to talk of giving a preference to British companies is simply what is vulgarly called "" rot."" No preference can be given to British vessels in this respect, simply because there is no competition. But it is decidedly to our advantage to have those foreign vessels catering for the oversea trade, because the more ships there are the more the competition, and the lower the freights. There is one other aspect of the question with which I shall briefly deal. We have heard much of the competition between ships owned by local companies and those owned outside Australia. that at the present time all the steam-ships owned in Australia are practically working under arrangement, that there is a combination amongst them to keep up freight rates, and an agreement that they will not carry an ounce of cargo at"" less than those rates. ment. Furthermore, we know perfectly well that the local shipping companies are supporting these clauses^ simply because they would secure protection under them. enable them to keep up thencharges, or to raise them still higher. I will give an instance in point. There are certain companies which trade between ports in various parts of Australia antj Tasmania.' Occasionally, one of diese companies finds that business in a certain direction is very slack, and that their vessels are not The Norddeutscher-Lloyd, the Mesreturning what they consider to be enough to pay a fair dividend. They immediately commence to look for an opening. They see that there is a large amount of trade in some other direction, and they immediatelyput on vessels to compete for a portion of that trade. The company that does, I may Of what say, three-fourths of the trade between Tasmania and the mainland is the Union Company. Occasionally another company, findthat there is a large export trade between Tasmania and the mainland, has a ""cut in . "" The competing company knows perfectly well that in order to induce producers to ship with them they must offer some special inducement. The moment they determine to enter the trade, they announce that they will reduce freights by probably one-half or one-third. In that way they give producers an incentive to trade with them. The result is that for a short time there is "" cut-throat"" competition between the two companies. Then the companies say to themselves"" This is not good enough."" The company that has hitherto been doing the trade says to the competing company"" It is of no use fighting us in this way; the result will simply be that we shall lose money, and freights will come down so low that there will be no profit for anybody. Let us enter into an amicable arrangement."" They do so. They say"" Instead of k ill ing each other with competition, let us determine what is a fair thing, so that we"" can pay good wages and large dividends. It is better to have half a loaf than no bread We will raise the freights to what they were a little while ago, or perhaps a little over."" They do so. I .will igive I assert an instance in point for the benefit of those honourable members who may doubt that that is what takes place. Last year, and for years past, the Union Company of New Zealand, which is practically an Australian company, did two-thirds of the Tasmanian trade. Owing to the drought on the I will prove that statemainland, there was a large trade in produce between Devonport and Sydney, and other parts of the Commonwealth. The Patterson line of steamers entered into the business. For a time "" cut-throat"" compeThey hope that the clauses will tition went on. Then the two companies agreed to raise freights. Last year, the Melbourne Steam-ship Company saw that business was pretty brisk in Tasmania. They therefore entered into competition. They reduced the freights then ruling for produce from 9s. per ton down to 5s. Consequently they got a share of the trade. The other two companies, finding that they were not doing as well as they could wish, said"" Let us form a ' pool.' "" The three, companies thereupon entered into an arrangement by which they "" pooled "" the busilest we do anything which is likely to ness. from 5s. to'9s., and exist at that rate to the present day. There is a ring for you! There is monopoly! I say, therefore, that if we prevent the oversea ships from entering the trade, we shall be creating simply a vast monopoly. As another Instance of the manner in which the shipping ring to which I have alluded injuriously affects producers, I might mention that about two' years ago a line of small steamers, sailing from Launceston, entered the Inter-State trade, and accepted produce at lower rates than were then ruling with other companies. These vessels continued to carry cargo at lower rates than were given by the other companies, until a few months ago, when the directors of the larger companies approached the directors of the Launceston company, and guaranteeing them a certain amount of freight, whether the produce was actually carried or not, took them into the ring, with the result that the unhappy producers are now obliged to pay whatever charges the combine chooses to exact from them. Under these circumstances, I ask if it is to the best interests of Australia to prevent, competition, and thus make it impossible for our producers to obtain fair play from the steam-ship companies. I have shown, I think conclusively, that if the proposed new clauses are agreed to, and wages are increased, the result may be disastrous for our producers. There is another aspect of the question with which I should like to deal, but, as I understand that it is desired to have a division this afternoon on the question before us, I have decided not to do so. The aspect to which I allude is as to the advisability of legiswith doubt and difficulty. If we insert lating in regard to vessels coming here from abroad.

I , with four other honourable members, voted against the motion, and we are the only five men who now dare to hold up our heads in the Chamber, The House, as a whole, received an ignominious snub for its ill judged interference. It seems to me that, Freights were immediately raised make us conspicuous in the eyes of the civilized world, not for our justice, but for the reverse quality, we should consider very carefully such proposals as are now before us. I thank honourable members for the very patient manner in which they have listened to my remarks. I know they recognise that, whatever my faults may be, I am a fair fighter, and say openly what I mean. I wish to say a word or two upon my position in relation to the proposed new clauses now before the Committee, but, prior to doing so, I would take this opportunity to express my regret-and I am sure that it is shared by every member of the Committee-a t the absence from the Chamber, at this important juncture, of the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide, who has taken such a keen interest in legislation to provide for coiciliation and arbitration, and especially in all matters relating to the control of navigation. We all deplore the cause of his absence, and sincerely hope that he may shortly be restored to his usual health. When the Barton Administration gave notice of their intention to introduce legislation of the character provided for by the clauses which the Government now propose to insert in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, I gave my adherence to their proposal, and I agreed with them that the best way to accomplish what was desired would be to insert the necessary provisions in a Navigation Bill. I have since seen no reason to change that opinion. To act as suggested by the present Government would be, it seems to me, to adopt a course which is beset the proposed new clauses in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, there is, as has been pointed out by the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney, more than a possibility that the Royal Assent to the measure may be indefinitely deferred. I acknowledge the force and importance of",30,Bonython Wha T About They Will Be Injured For All Time But They

188,Sir Langdon Bonython (Barker).,"of the Minister of External Affairs, that to pass a Bill the provisions of which do not apply to seamen would be to pass one which would, be very incomplete and imperfect in its operation. But, on the other hand, it appears to me that a distinct advantage would be gained by referring the clauses under discussion to the members of the Royal Commission who are now charged with the very important duty of inquiring into and reporting upon the provisions of the Navigation Bill, and that any disadvantage resulting from the consequent delay would be more than compensated for by the information we should thus obtain. I am in entire agreement with honourable members who think that the coastal trade of Australia should be protected against outsiders who attempt to compete unfairly with local ship-owners. But the position is surrounded with many difficulties, so that it is necessary for us to proceed with extreme caution. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat was quite right when he pointed out that we should make sure that our legislation will be effective; and I think we should also take great care that it be not unfair. We cannot afford-to put before the Committee a consideration which is on a very low level indeed-to ignore the claims of the Empire of which Australia forms a part. Our position in regard to foreign vessels trading on our coasts is quite different. We have few or none of the obligations towards them which bind us in regard to English shipping. member for Wannon makes further inquiries, he will, I believe, find that British ships trading along the coasts of New Caledonia are not as unhampered as he seemed to think when he spoke the other night. ourselves on these points better than by dealing with the whole subject by means of a Navigation Bill, the provisions of which will have been fully and impartially inquired into by the members of the Royal Commission? Furthermore, we should be very careful not to pass legislation which may prejudice our producers. That aspect of the case has been elaborated very ably by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and by other honourable members, but I do not think that this Parliament is at -all likely to disregard the claims of the producers, because honourable members realize that the progress of Australia is bound up with their prosperity. We should also be careful not to prejudice the interests of outlying portions of the Commonwealth whose populations are dependent for their means of communication with Other places in Australia, and with the outside world, upon the ocean-going steamships. I believe that 'what is aimed at can be accomplished without detriment to the producer, and without injury to the shipping interests of Great Britain. But in view of all the circumstances of the case, and taking into consideration the fact that the members of the Labour Party are divided amongst themselves upon the question, I think that the need for the further consideration of the subject has been fully demonstrated. Therefore I shall vote against the inclusion of the proposed new clauses in this Bill, so that they may receive full consideration from the members of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bjll. mencing my remarks on the question before the Committee, which will be very brief, I wish to compliment the right honourable member for East Sydney upon at last having got beyond the land of promise. A few months ago he stated in this Chamber that a motion would be moved questioning the right of the Ministry to control the business of Parliament; but that motion still remains in the land of promise. The right honourable member, however, after sparring for a couple of days, has submitted an amendment, the effect of which If the honourable and learned will be to prevent the insertion of the proposed new clauses in the Bill now under discussion. We have hea'rd a most eloquent appeal on behalf of the poor working man. The right honourable gentleman implored us not fo insert any provisions in How can we satisfy this Bill which would delay the granting of the Royal Assent to it when passed. The Bill has been introduced for the prevention of strikes and industrial disputes, and it is admitted on all sides that the seamen form -one ' of the most important classes to which its provisions should apply. It is very doubtful, however, if the amendment of the right honourable member for East Sydney were carried, whether they would come under the provisions of the Bill. That doubt'exists in the minds of many legal members of the Committee. fectively brought under the Bill.if the proposed new clauses are not inserted.

Eveni f the seamen could be brought under the Bill without the insertion of the proposed new clauses, their position would not be a satisfactory one, because they would be compelled to compete with men who would not be within the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. The right honourable member for East Sydney, in effect, says, that although arbitration may be a good thing as applied to one set of men, it should not be extended to others even if proved to be in competition with them. I do not see how any such attitude can be justified. I do not pretend that some of the proposals of the Government will ' not require amendment.

I have before stated that those who go upon the land in order to produce the necessaries of life, shall always receive the utmost consideration at my hands. Let us consider, however, how the right honourable member for East Sydney proposes to protect their interests. ducers are dependent upon shipping for the conveyance of their products to the various markets in the Commonwealth and beyond it ; and yet the right honourable member for East Sydney, and those who are supporting him, propose that the men who have it in their power to. bring about another maritime strike, and to inflict disaster upon the whole of 'the communitv, shall .be deprived of the benefits of this measure. Parliament ? ing facts. . strike affect oversea ships? gauge the extent to which a maritime strike would affect all classes of shipping in our waters. The last maritime strike caused almost a complete suspension of the shipping trade of Australia. The whole community was upset, and it was impossible for our producers to rely upon having their produce conveyed to the various markets. Although honourable members say that they desire to conserve the interests of the producers, they are opposed to including in this B ill the only provisions which would effectually safeguard them. The right honourable member for East Sydney did not indicate that he would support the adoption of such provisions in connection with another Bill, even if they were withdrawn at the present time. He merely wished the Government to postpone them for the present. This proposal is in keeping with the attitude adopted by some honourable members in other places. They are content to wait until trouble arises, and then look about for, some means of escape. I commend the Government for having introduced these clauses with a view to making provision against a time of trouble. The right honourable member for East Sydney has expressed the view that the Royal Assent may be refused to the Billi f these clauses are included. The legal advisers ot the Government, however, take the contrary view, and I do not think that any serious fears need be entertained on that score. If arbitration be a good thing, its application when competition is proved, should be extended as f ar as possible, and if honourable members opposite do not believe in it they should give the Bill their straight-out opposition. MrM c LEAN (Gippsland).

Those who believe that there is some justification for the inclusion of these clauses in the Bill, or in any measure, should be the first to refer them for inquiry to the Royal Commission. It must be admitted that, up to the present time, we have not had a scintilla of information which could justify any honourable member, having due regard to his proper responsibilities as a representative of the people, in voting for the clauses. whole of the information placed before us goes to show that there is no necessity for them. might have been made prior to the last maritime strike. MrM c LEAN any similar provisions were presented for our consideration at that time. It is necesmation which I have been able to gather, I sary, before asking us to support legislation which will doubtless dislocate our communications with the markets of the world to a considerable, extent, to show some justification for it. In the first place, it should be demonstrated that there is some necessity for such enactments, and, secondly, that the course proposed to be adopted will secure rhe object in view.

MrM c LEAN I am not in favour of absolute monopoly in any case. It must be within the knowledge of every honourable member that the local shipping companies are extremely prosperous. No attempt has been made to show that, in consequence of keen competition on the part of ocean-going companies, local ship-owners are unable to pay proper wages to their employees. On the contrary, the ber know that they recently reduced the wages of their seamen?

We know as a matter of fact that oversea vessels which trade along our coast do not make large profits out of the Australian trade. Honourable members opposite have not only failed to show us that these provisions are necessary owing to the competition of ocean-going steamers; but they have failed to establish their assertion that the local shipping companies are unable to pay good wages to their employees. They have also failed to show that their own proposals would effect the object which they have in view. I cannot speak upon this matter from legal knowledge, but at least I can discuss it from the stand-point of a business man.

207,Mr Tudor,"Does the honourable memprovision which we might choose to insert in this Bill regarding the wages to be paid by them whilst their vessels were trading upon the Australian coast. Let me take the case of the British shipping companies as an example. They are doing a large trade with every part of the world. The Australian trade forms a comparatively small and insignificant portion of their business. for a moment that, in consequence of our legislation, they would raise the wages of their employees all round; because, if they raised the rate of pay in one particular portion of the service, we know that they would have to make it uniform throughout, or else the service would become disorganized. Rather than do that, it appears to me that they could evade our legislation upon this subject by a very simple means. When entering into engagements with their seamen, they could easily arrange to pay them the same rates that are paid to seamen employed in other parts of the world. that, in Australia, the law provided that seamen should be paid a much higher wage, and that, consequently, if they received this satisfactorily adjusted. higher wage when on the Australian coast, it would be necessary to make a corresponding reduction during the rest of the voyage in order to equalize the total amount payable for the round trip. ment would have to be filed with the English shipping master, and the subsequent agreement with our shipping master, so that it would be impossible to make the third agreement of which the honourable member speaks. make their own agreements. must be filed. if British or foreign companies engage in the Australian trade, they will have to pay the local rates. But when entering into engagements with their seamen, what is to prevent them from stipulating for the payment of such rates of wages when on and off the Australian coast as will equalize the amount payable for the whole trip. has not read the clauses, or he would see that that could not be done. not override Imperial law. whatever to do with the Imperial law. It is a matter of an agreement made in England. ft would be very easy for a shipping company in any part of the world to enter into an agreement which would render our laws on the subject nugatory. If they did not do so, it is quite evident that they would have to adopt the alternative of Do honourable members imagine doing no coastal trade whatever. our local shipping companies an absolute monopoly which will enable them to charge any rates they choose. nal Affairs is a 'free-trader. matter to free-trade?

The whole of our producers are largely dependent upon the facilities afforded them to sell their products in the outer markets of the world. We have a very small consuming population and a very large productive territory. It is to our interest to produce as largely as we profitably can, and to sell our surplus products in any part of the world where we can obtain a market. To do this, it is necessary that we should possess speedy and cheap means of transport with the markets of the world.

Up to the present time, however, no information has been supplied which would justify that view of the case. the evidence goes to show that they are subjected to no serious competition-that they enjoy all but a monopoly of our coasting trade, or, at any rate, as near a monopoly as it is safe or wise to give them. Their profits are quite sufficient to enable them to pay fair wages. would apply the same rule to them as to others. If there are any reasons, of which we are not now aware, which will justify the view that they are subjected to serious competition, those reasons should be ascertained by referring these clauses to the Navigation Bill Commission for inquiry and report. at present, before us, I shall oppose these clauses no matter in what Bill they may be included. I am not prepared to prejudice the interests of the rest of the community, and especially the producing interests, for the sake of the ship-owners. It is vital to our producers that they should have speedy access to the markets of the world.. Unless they can obtain that no expansion of our piimary products can take place. I am not prepared to jeopardize these large interests for the sake of a mere sentiment. Of course, it sounds very plausible to say "" It is not fair to ask our own shipowners to pay a reasonable rate of wages if they are subjected to competition with others who pay a much lower rate."" But when we come to examine that statement, we find that no serious competition exists, and that our own ship-owners are making handsome profits. to go into the Arbitration Court, and yet the honourable member would not call upon the owners of foreign steamers to comply with the same rule.

It has not been shown that the owners of the coasting vessels are asking for these provisions, and we know that the wages on Australian vessels are higher than those paid elsewhere; whilst the freights and fares that are charged by the British and foreign vessels which are said to compete for our coasting trade are nearly double those charged by the coastal vessels. Therefore, where can the competition come in? No instances have been adduced to show -that the local ship-owners have suffered any loss, or that there has been any undercutting of fares and freights.

The proposed new clauses, if wise and equitable, and not calculated to injure the producers, might very well be embodied in a separate measure, and considered by Parliament at a later stage. think that the Government, in proposing to insert in the Bill certain provisions for the regulation of navigation, are taking a course which is not justifiable. The right honourable member for East Sydney has made it very clear that he wishes to hasten, rather than to retard, the progress of this measure through Committee. So strongly did he express that view that one of his supporters said, "" Y o u 'are assisting the Government by your proposition."" The right honourable member has displayed such fairness in this matter that he gave notice of his intention to move an amendment in order to enable the Government to fully consider the question, and if they found his contentions to be sound, to withdraw their proposals, allowing the Bill to be passed in its original form. The Minister of ExternalA f fairs stated this morning that he is of opinion that the interpretation placed upon the clauses by the leader of the Opposition is the correct one, and that his view would be shared by the law advisers of the Crown in Downing-street. If the Minister is certain that the passing of the Bill will be deferred for perhaps eighteen months through the action of the law authorities in England, if the proposed clauses are inserted in it, why does he insist upon their insertion ? It is a Bill to deal with seamen. provide for compulsory conciliation and arbitration in disputes between employer and employed mainly to provide for disputes in which seamen may be concerned. contended by the highest constitutional authorities, and notably by Sir Edmund5 Y2 Barton and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, that the provisions which the Government propose to insert in this Bil l could be more adequately and effectively dealt with in a special measure. It was because those two high authorities were convinced of the soundness of that opinion that they broke with the right honourable I member for Adelaide, who was Minister of. Trade and Customs in the administration of which they were respectively Prime Minister and Attorney-General. They took that course because the question was not a matter of policy, but a constitutional question, which they dealt with in the light of a discussion which took place at a conference at which Mr Chamberlain made it clear that all proposed legislation relating to navigation must be fully considered by the Imperial authorities, in order to see that it would not injure the interests of the Empire, before the Royal Assent could be given to it. Therefore, I think that the advice of the leader of the Opposition to embody the proposed clauses in a special B ill is good advice. The Imperial authorities will then be able to consider them without reference to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which can be passed without delay. member support the special B ill to which he refers? cond reading, it can be shown to my satisfaction that it will not only benefit our seamen, but will prove of advantage to the citizens'of the Commonwealth at large, I shall be ready to support it. During this discussion, I made an interjection which brought from the honourable member for Kennedy the retort that: I have not supported the Bill. I stated on the floor of the House and elsewhere that I would support the insertion of a provision relating to railways, and I did so by voting for such a provision when it was moved. Before the present Government came into power I stated openly that even if the members of the present Opposition took office I would still vote for such a provision, and honorI t is a Bill to able members will find that when I make a declaration, either in this Chamber or to my constituents, I carry it into effect.

The Ministry are jeopardizing the Bill by endeavouring to force the Committee to agree to the navigation clauses now.

The Government, of course, may say that the insertion of the proposed new clauses was absolutelv necessary, but that they were prevented by the Committee from inserting them, and thus gain a certain amount of political kudos.

Now Fremantle occupies that proud position, and the representatives of South Australia are supporting legislation which they formerly would have opposed as being inimical to the best interests of the first port of call in Australia. The representaI f that is the tives of Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie, whose constituents do not care anything about the interests of Fremantle, are also supporting the Government proposal.

Several honourable members have stated that no evidence can be adduced in support of the view that oversea ships should be subjected to the same restrictions as our be generally known that the Peninsular and Oriental Company, the Orient Company, and passengers from Tilbury to for charge and that their vessels could, on arrival at Fremantle, discharge half their passengers, and carry other passengers from Fremantle to Sydney free of cost without incurring any actual loss 100 per cent, more than do the Inter-State companies. point out that, notwithstanding these great advantages, they charge passengers 50 per cent, more than do our Inter-State companies. They are enabled to do this because of the superior accommodation which they provide, and also because of the social attractions which are offered by the class of passengers which they carry oversea. petition ? are able to offer accommodation much superior to that afforded by our coastal boats, which are thus heavily handicapped. Therefore, I maintain that we should not penalize local ship-owners, and let the ocean steamers go scot free. If we do so, we shall add to the injustice to which they are now subjected. It is quite impossible for the local companies to compete with the oversea steamers, because of the higher wages which have to be paid to Australian seamen, and our legislation should certainly be so framed that it will tend 'to place upon an equal footing all ship-owners who trade upon our coasts. We have been charged with making Australia appear ridiculous in the eyes of the world, by means of legislation which is intended to operate in reproposals -gard to those who come from parts beyond the seas. If , however, legislation of this character is to be of any value it must be uniform in its appliI shall support the amendcation to all those who carry on our trade, and it would be unfair to impose upon Australian ship-owners or other employers conditions from which foreigners were exempt. I am speaking of British ship-owners as foreigners only in the sense that they are intruders upon the domain of our local shipping companies. It has been pointed out that if we insist on the oversea shipping companies paylocal ship-owners. It may not ing the rates of wages prevailing on the Australian coast they 'will .overcome the difficulty by paying wages on a higher the Messageries Maritimes, scale whilst the vessels are in our waters, the Norddeutscher Lloyd carry and so adjusting the balance paid to the Sydney men for service beyond our limits that in exactly the same fare that they the end they will not incur any greater from Tilbury to Fremantle. expense than at present. If that takes place we must, I suppose, submit to it ; but' that consideration should not prevent us -from doing what lies in our power to place all ship-owners upon an equal footing. I do not hold a brief for the Australian shipowners, because they are very well able to look after themselves, but in common fairness we should not add to the disadvantages I was just about to under which they already labour. The United States cannot be said to liave made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of the world, and yet it is well known that none but American-owned vessels are allowed to participate in the coastal trade of that country. That is prohibition with a vengeance, and the day may arrive when we shall have to adopt similar measures in the Commonwealth. In the meantime, we should shape our legislation so that the conditions may be made as fair as possible for all concerned. We must never forget that Australia is an island continent, and that the Commonwealth must sooner or later become a maritime power. We all live in the hope that one day we shall see an Australian Navy. In the meantime we have made the best terms we can with the mother country. We must, however, have ships of our own and a navy of our own, and become a maritime power.

Those who have travelled on the Continent or in America know that Australia is called ""The Land of the Golden Fleece,"" and that it is believed that the sea washes pearls on to our shores. The ideas which are current as to the great wealth of Australia will always cause us to loom large in the eyes of business men, who will be only too eager to meet our requirements in the way of sea transit. They will always find it worthwhile to trade with us.

That is an exceedingly serious matter. But we are sometimes called upon to play the heroic, even in' legislation, and I think it is far more honest and praiseworthy to say exactly what we mean in this Bill than to attempt to achieve our end by another means. Let us be frank and honest upon this matter-w e need not be impertinent in our dealings with the Imperial Government. I repeat that 'the mail steamers at present enjoy great advantages as compared with our coastal vessels.

I wish to know whether this statement is correct, and, if so, why the Department has differentiated between an application made in Sydney, and a similar one made on behalf of one of the suburban municipalities of Melbourne. At the request of the Northcote Council, I applied to the Postal Department for permission to use the telegraph poles in that municipality in a similar way, who had resigned his Cabinet but'the proposition' was received with such a snort of surprise that I have never since dared to gaze on a telegraph pole. It seems somewhat remarkable that a Federal Department should have intervened in this way in a dispute between a municipality and a private company, and I should, therefore, like to have an explanation. also a complaint to make in regard to the Postal Department. Those who havp occasion to send letters f i o m Sydney to Melbourne by the express which leaves on Sunday evening, find that the late fee box at the General Post. Office is kept open on Sundays, but that letters posted there are not cleared until the following day. On the other hand, letters are taken at the railway station. In these, circumstances, I : would ask the Minister whether he will take steps to temedy such a. ridiculous system, in order that the disappointment and, in some case*, loss which has occurred, may be I avoided.",46,Mcdonald Orde R I Must Ask The Hon

I had not the advantage of hearing the opening observations of the honourable member for Bouike paragraph from the Argus dealing with the Glebe case. may be briefly stated. Some time ago the Glebe Municipal Council rated the mains of the Metropolitan Gas Company, and I believe that, as the result of the refusal pf palities were treated very badly by the the company to recognise the claim, the matter was. ventilated in the Law Courts, The company' was successful in the proceedings before the Supreme Cpurt pf the State, but the municipality appealed to the High Cpurt, and their appeal was sustained. Almost immediately afterwards the Gas Company increased its lighting charges to such an extent as to more than meet. the rates that it was called upon to pay under the decision of the Court. Sydney was called upon to pay an additional j £i per lamp per annum. the municipality applied.to the Department for permission to hang kerosene lamps on telegraph poles within its boundaries. It appeared from the preliminary application that the municipality desired this privilege for an indefinite period, but I could not see my way clear to' concedethat request, more especially as the officers of the Department reported that the hanging of the lamps on the telegraph poles would materially interfere with the working of the telephone and telegraph systemOn arriving at Sydney last week I was interviewed by the Mayor of Glebe, who explained that the council merely desired permission to place the lamps on the telegraph poles, pending the completion of anangements with the Electric Lighting Company to illuminate the .municipality by electricity. He stated that at the most they should not require to use the poles in this way for more than three months, and as the electrician, Mr Nelson, was favorable, I considered that the application might well be granted. favorable to the request? Adjournment: Glebe [REPRESENTATIVES.] Lighting Case. Mr .MAHON -He was present with the deputation, and was distinctly in favour of granting the request. Another point has agreed to waive any claim that it might have in respect of injury done to its lamps by any of our workmen, and is also about to indemnify the Department against damage to the poles, break down a monopoly? notoriety. The fact thai: it was a-monopoly, and had attempted to extort what X considered to be unjust rates from the municipality, certainly influenced my decision. company. rightly in granting the request. I have only to say that, if necessary; I should be prepared to deal with any other municipality in. the same way. Mr G. B.

In the case of the Glebe municipality, however, the arrangement is purely a temporary one, and I did not consider it necessary to make any stipulation in that direction.
