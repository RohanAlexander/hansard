The Minister promised to consider the matter, and the cases that I mentioned were satisfactorily adjusted. I receivedto-day from a woman in this Territory whose husband has performed valiantly in a division in Egypt, a communication stating that she has been notified that unless she pays certain arrears of rent within fourteen days she will be evicted from her home. Will the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior stay the threatened proceedings, and see that the wives of absent soldiers receive fair treatment? matter to the notice of the Minister for the Interior, and Bee that appropriate action is taken. of the Minister for the A m y been drawn to the statement published last Sunday in a Sydney newspaper, to the effect that soldiers being invalided to Australia from Palestine, suffering from Bpondulitis, have been refused medical attention?

I am not prein respect of the proposition that medical attention be provided in respect of all men who return from the war, whether their disability be due to war service or not, because such a proposition must be subject to some time qualification, but I am prepared to approach it in a very broad and sympathetic spirit. THE WAR. the Minister for External Affairs been drawn to an article which appeared in the Sydney Sun on the 19th instant, a portion of which reads as follows:The Reverend Father Whelan, who came from Dublin, on his way .to Bathurst said: ""The Irish people were most anxious to keep right out of the war.

8,Mr Perkins,"Has the attention ofI f the Minister considers that the views reported to have been expressed by Father Whelan are vile, and repugnant to all true Britishers, including Australians, will he take steps to prevent a repetition of the like, or institute other appropriate action ? attention was drawn to the statement referred to by the honourable member. I , in turn, drew the attention of the relevant service department to it. I feel bound to say that, if the gentleman concerned, or those on whose behalf he professes to apeak, are experiencing exultation because .of the mass murder of British civilians, the desecration of national shrines, the destruction of hospitals and infirmaries, and the sinking of mercy ships, he and they are entirely out of step with their co-religionists in Australia, many of whom have already given their lives, and others their sons, in order that Britain shall administer, not receive, a licking. ter for Labour and National Service inform me as to whether or not it is. correct, as has been publicly stated, that the Government has decided to build 300 houses for occupation by munitions workers in the Maribyrnong district, the rents for which will be from 27s. 6d. to 32s. 6d. a week? If so, has his department made any investigation of the 'South Australian housing scheme? If it has not done so, will he have such an investigation made, in order that homes may be built at a cost which will permit the charging of rents that the workers are in a position to pay? a number of projects upon which the Government has decided to embark is the provision of adequate housing accommodation for munitions workers in Footscray. homes will be erected in that district, but no decision has yet been reached as to what rentals shall be charged for them. That matter will be determined on the basis of the cost of the houses, ment yet formulated any plans for the which, if present plans reach fruition, relief of the potato-growers who now will be erected under the auspices of the find themselves in a desperate plight? Housing Commission of Victoria, a body that has had considerable experience in the construction of cheap but serviceable homes. I had the privilege, when in Adelaide last week, of investigating houses that had been constructed by the Housing Trust of that State, and a further investigation of tbem will be made by officers of my department in the very near future. There are certain differences between the costs of land and materials in Victoria and the costs in South Australia; but the honourable gentleman, and other honourable members, may rest assured that the action which the Government is taking will result in the economical construction of homes that will prove both adequate and congenial, and the rents charged will not be at all disproportionate to those of private homes in the neighbourhood. for Trade and Customs whether tobacco manufacturers are responsible for the present rationing of supplies of tobacco? In view of the statement reported to have been made by the honourable gentleman, namely, that supplies of tobacco will soon be available from Rhodesia, will he state whether there is any possibility of augmentation of supplies to the public? Will he also make a clear statement of the position in relation to rationing ? manufactured tobacco is the responsibility of the manufacturers; the rationing of imports of tobacco leaf is the responsibility of the Government. The statement attributed to me that the agreement with Southern Rhodesia would result in more tobacco being made available is true to the extent that the manufacturers are prepared to purchase additional supplies of leaf in' order to supplement what is available from other sources. The matter raised In the very near future 300 in the third part of tbe honourable member'squestion will receive consideration.",12,Statement By Reverend Fathxb Whelan

If so, what action does the Government intend to take on that report? the honourable gentleman's question is receiving tbe consideration of Cabinet. AGE LIMIT FOR MEMBERS OF that it is now generally recognized that the tragedy which has befallen Europe is in some part owing to the fact that tbe administration of tbe domestic and foreign affairs of certain European countries was left in the hands of old men, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will consider the holding of a referendum in conjunction with the next general elections with tbe object of altering the Constitution to provide that the members of Parliament and federal judges shall be compulsorily retired on their reaching the age of 65 years? General( Mr Hughes) has agreed to go into conference with me on the matter. the press that the Government was setting up a committee to inquire into the production of copper sheeting at Mount Morgan. Will the Minister for Supply and Development extend the terms of reference of that committee in order to enable it to inquire into tbe whole question of the production of copper?

WOOL SUPPLIES. for Commerce tell the House what is the method of controlling the supply of greasy wool and skins to fellmongers and wool-scourers in Australia? Can the Minister give any reason why works at Liverpool are threatened to be closed, causing 60 or 70 men to be thrown out of work, because tbose works cannot obtain any supplies of greasy wool or skins? tralian manufacture is dealt witb under special terms of the agreement with the British Government, which has purchased the whole of the wool clip. Wool owned by the British Government and outside of the range of those special terms is a matter for the Central Wool Committee and the British Government. The Central Wool Committee, I know from personal investigation, has been in close consultation with the British Government in order to ensure that maximum quantities of wool are available for carbonizing and wool-scouring concerns in Australia. The result has been that in many of the establishments two or three shifts are working at a greater pace than before the war. In the last few weeks, unfortunately, there has not been wool available to the same degree as formerly, with consequent unemployment. The Central Wool Committee is ascertaining to what extent extra wool can be obtained in order to alleviate tbe position. representing the Minister for Supply and Development whether the Government has come to any decision regarding a change of policy in order to effect decentralizationof war industries?
