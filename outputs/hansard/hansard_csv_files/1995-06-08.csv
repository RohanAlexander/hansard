281,Mr Harry Woods (Page) (10.01 A.m.),"Let me first take exception to the assertion byMC 1628 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 capital. Casino, in my electorate, is widely recognised as the beef capital, and I would hope to have some support from the National Party in that respect. There are a few things certain in life and amongst those is that the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard), when he gets up and speaks, will offer no policy ideas. Another, of course, is that whenever the member for Gwydir, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, speaks on the meat industry, he invariably takes the tack of kicking the unions, of running the meat industry down and of being a prophet of doom. His evidence yesterday to show that this gloom was justified was that an Australian firm had thought about importing 15 container loads of meat. That is very flimsy evidence, because Australia is a major exporter of beef, a major player in world terms in Japan, in Korea and in the United States. It is a $5 billion industry and we do it extremely well. That is not to say, of course, that there cannot be improvements in efficiency, and one of those areas that does need attention is the industrial relations side. But this will never be achieved by simply kicking the industry, kicking the workers in the industry and telling them that they are no good. It wilLbe achieved through good, solid legislation such as this that moves things forward. This legislation represents a major step forwa,rd for the meat and livestock indu-try by providing commitment to the industry'S workplace agreements through the establishment of a meat industry council. It will give the industry a greater role in responsibility in deciding its own affairs, and that must inevitably result in greater productivity and efficiency from a less regulated environment. The meat and livestock industry is one that Australia depends on for much of its primary industry revenue. We owe it to the industry and also to all Australians to prove that we want a strong and efficient industry, an industry that can reach its potential. But at the same time we want to provide a sound framework so that we can continue in a way that will allow flexibility and reform and a firm commitment to secure more employment for future Australians. The establishment of a meat industry council is the most appropriate way to develop strategic policy and planning and to address the meat industry's costs and competitiveness issues. The Meat Industry Council will take the responsibility for strategic planning and then provide the framework for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Corporation to develop their corporate and operational plans. The Meat Industry Council will also be responsible for the funding of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Corporation through the power to recommend levy rates to industry annual general meetings. The MIC's new component will reflect the expenditure on functions that the MIC is taking over from the AMLC and the MRC. Therefore, it will not add to the total levy and charge collected. I want to stress that the new arrangements are not expected to impose any additional costs on the Commonwealth and, more importantly, any additional costs on the industry at this time. The Commonwealth will also continue to make matching payments for research and development expenditure from the meat research and development fund up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of meat and livestock, as determined by the minister. These provisions ensure that programs of the AMLC and the MRC conform with the industry's strategic goals, directed through the MIC. The legislation gives the meat industry a greater role and responsibility in deciding its own affairs and the ability to move to a less Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1629 regulated environment. Although it is transitional and eventually the three statutory industry authorities will revert to a non-statutory status, a framework will be established where the industry can operate over the longer term. It is of utmost importance to the meat and livestock industry that. a meat industry council be established as a part of the whole decentralisation process. The ultimate aim of this legislation is to improve efficiency whilst maintaining a strong body to direct and focus the industry's strategic direction through the AMLC and the MRC. It is only logical that a body which is already familiar with the problems associated with the meat industry be established so it can form realistic goals and, through an efficient and streamlined process, address problems that are inherent in the meat industry. The MIC will ensure that the industry is able to identify its problems and, consequently, provide it with the framework to enable commercial responses to be formulated to combat difficulties. Ultimately, this will take the financial responsibility offthe shoulders of the producer and take it out into the national realm. This will encourage easier access to greater competition and, inevitably, a more cost-effective industry. The meat industry is very important to my electorate of Page .. We recently celebrated Beef Week in Casino, which is in my electorate. Casino, which is recognised as the beef capital of Australia, as I said earlier, relies heavily on the beef industry. Beef Week in Casino actually goes for about 12 days. It is a nationaL promotion for the beef industry, an industry which is a major source of employment, not just in Casino but throughout the north coast. There has been a feeling of impotence within the industry because of its inability to control its own destiny and because of a perception that many issues are not addressed on a strategic and continuing policy development basis. '. The Northern Cooperative Meatworks Company is also in the electorate of Page. That company recently celebrated a centenary of productivity. It is one of the largest exporters of meat in Australia, and it is certainly the largest single employer of workers in my electorate. The formation of the Meat Industry Council will certainly benefit both the cooperative and its workers. The issue of industrial relations in this area has not been addressed as efficiently as it should have been. This legislation highlights the need for industrial relations reform in the meat industry. Improved industrial relations will increase the productivity and the efficiency of the meat processing sector, as the inquiries undertaken by the Meat Industry Commission in 1994 and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in 1992 suggested. However, a recent report commissioned by the Department of Industrial Relations found that, despite efforts by some employers and union ·officials, the majority of the meat industry work force was still distrustful of change; We must overcome the preconceived idea that industrial relations is a big stick wielded by the government to bring industry into line. The establishment of the Meat Industry Council will allow for autonomy and a state of binary opposition that will promote flexibility and cost efficiency and, whilst maintaining national unity, will provide a strategy and a framework to work in. In March 1995, a report commissioned by the Department of Industrial Relations on the progress of workplace reform in the export meat processing industry indicated that poor relationships between the parties in the meat industry are a major impediment to workplace reform. This legislation aims to overcome those shortcomings in the industry by restructuring it and giving it teeth. Importantly, the proposed MIC has the clear responsibility for MC 1630 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 formulating industry policy as well as evaluating industry programs against performance criteria. This is a crucial responsibility of the MIC if it is to work. One way in which a major improvement is suggested is through the increase in enterprise bargaining agreements. In the industrial relations report of March 1995, the finding included that progress with enterprise bargaining was limited, that the agreements had not been innovative, and that not enough had. been contributed to the lifting of productivity and efficiency. The Meat Industry Council will bring together representatives of the producers, processors and the union to formulate the best approach that will lead the meat industry into a productive and guaranteed future. An interim council has already identified industry costs as a priority issue. What we need is a framework in place that will benefit the workers of companies like the Northern Cooperative Meatworks Company and other meat works throughout Australia. We need a framework that will allow workers, employers and unions to come together to discuss how they can coristructively tackle the problems that are in the industry and in which they have a vested interest. The MIC will allow that to OCCllr. At a recent interim MIC meeting, the council has already agreed to a study being undertaken by the Meat Research Corporation on the comparative structure and performance of sectors of the industry to assist the council in formulating strategies to raise its performance. We should not underestimate the ability of the industry to manage its own affairs. Industry leaders are running a large, $5 billion plus industry and making difficult and successful commercial decisions every day. If industry is not in charge of its own"" affairs, it is legitimately able to deflect blame forbad decisions to others and thus avoid the difficult decisions. Industry has sought responsibility for its own affairs. The government is confident that industry is capable of managing its own affairs and taking the industry forward to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The deregulatory approach is staged to allow industry professionalism to develop. If this does not evolve as expected, the government will not walk away from this very important industry. Further reform options would then be considered in conjunction with industry. In the case of the ALMC, where industry funding only is involved, the MIC will examine programs which can be commercialised and develop strategic plans to pursue this. CALM and Aus-Meat programs are expected to be the first to be examined. Other programs might include market intelligence and reporting. The scope for export promotion and marketing being commercialised will also be considered by the MIC, in the context of the branding of product to minimise market failure. It may take some time for industry to commercialise marketing and promotion, given the generic nutritional and health issues involved and the activities of competitor meats. The MRC is currently examining the scope for it to commercialise R&D, drawing on overseas experience, and this will be progressed under the guidance of the new MIC. It envisages, however, matched government funding continuing. It is reasonable to look forward, with some of the GATT outcomes and some of the progress-admittedly not enough-in the meat industry. The meat industry as it is now is a powerful and strong player not only in the Australian economy but in exports overseas, and I think it is reasonable to be optimistic about a good future where there is enormous potential for our meat industry and export markets. With the people involved and the leadership given, we can look forward to that potential and those opportunities being taken up in coming years . . REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1631 This legislation builds on a framework designed to create a strong and efficient meat industry, able to take up the opportunities that will present themselves in the future, and to maximise its potential. I urge honourable members to support it. for Bendigo( Mr Reid) I think I should clarify the question that is before the Main Committee. The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable the Deputy Leader of the National Party has moved, as an amendment, that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. Therefore, the immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. livestock industry legislation provides an opportunity to talk about the marketing and sale of livestock in Australia. Much discussion has occurred in recent times on the selling methods available to producers for the sale of their livestock to domestic and overseas markets. One thing is for certain-that farmers want a fair and adequate return for their stock, which can be achieved where true market forces operate in a competitive environment. This can be achieved in a number of different ways and there is no doubt that saleyards will continue into the future in Victoria and throughout Australia. New selling methods, both on farm and off, certainly have a place, as do the new technology sales using video facilities. However, it is generally agreed throughout the industries that saleyards will remain the primary method of selling stock through a competitive bidding system in the long-term future. The issue, therefore, is which saleyards will grow and which saleyards will diminish and eventually close. The area that I represent, Bendigo, has the largest or equal largest sheep and lamb saleyard in Victoria and it will continue to play this role in a long-term future. The Bendigo saleyards recently opened a new on-scale selling facility for cattle, and that will help the city of greater Bendigo and the farmers in that area move with modem trends. There are a number of smaller saleyards in Victoria which are unlikely to survive into the future. However, it would be inappropriate for me to speculate on which these may be. The city of greater Bendigo is committed to maintaining a major saleyards operation in Bendigo. It is presently looking at a relocation of the saleyards which will ensure that Bendigo continues as the largest, or equal largest, sheep saleyards in Victoria. It will be also doing significant work to ensure that cattle, pig and, possibly, other sales will grow significantly. Saleyards throughout Australia, and particularly in Victoria, have a good future. While we acknowledge the existence of other forms of selling, saleyards will still be the predominant form of livestock selling in Victoria for the foreseeable future. I want to quote some figures in relation to the throughput of the saleyards in the Bendigo area, and then relate that back to the stock figures of sales in Victoria. At the city of greater Bendigo saleyards in 1993-94, the yardage figures relate to the various stock categories for th-t year, and they are: sheep, 875,980; cattle, 37,493; pigs, 30,380; and calves, 1,725. The figures from the saleyards of Victoria, where there are some 30 saleyards-there are smaller ones, but they do not keep reliable stock figures-show that, in the same year of 1993-94, Victoria had a total stock throughput in these categories: sheep, 4,950,891; cattle, 1,265,687; pigs, 59,010; and calves, 82,602. Some of those numbers have been down through those years; but, once the impact of the drought through northern central Victoria is removed, I am sure those numbers will increase once again. Cattle numbers have declined significantly for a",127,Representatives Main Committee

283,Mr Reid (Bendigo) (10.14 A.m.),"The cognate debate this morning on the meat andMC 1632 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 number of reasons, one being the drought; but there certainly has been a decline, and there may have been lost opportunities in the livestock marketing and selling area. I want to talk about the economic benefits that a saleyard can bring to an area. I refer to a document prepared by Crichton Maxwell Pty Ltd in May 1995, so it is absolutely current. That firm was asked by the city of greater Bendigo to evaluate what the economics of saleyards did to the economic region. It came up with an appraisal of what the economic benefits. of livestock selling would be for an area, and it particularly directed its attention to the city of greater Bendigo saleyards. It found that the total employment generated by the saleyards is conservatively calculated at 317 people, with an overall annual economic value to the City of greater Bendigo in 1995 of some $18.45 million. There would be few industries in the city of greater Bendigo that could match that result in terms of employment and economic value generation. The employment figures are made up in several different ways. Firstly, the figures for direct employment generated by the city of greater Bendigo saleyards and those employer categories are: stock agents, 40; transport operators, 30; city of greater Bendigo personnel,5; making a total direct employment of 75. Then there are all the indirect employment categories which support· the City of greater Bendigo saleyards including truck serviCing, engineering firms, shearers, tyre suppliers, the water supply authority, fuel companies, stock and station firms, cat retailers, and transport operators . .That also flows on to other areas of activity such as the retail sector in the city of greater Bendigo. The latest estimate of retail turnover in the City of greater Bendigo, taken out in 1993, was $442 million. That figure has been transferred to an employment generating figure as a result of direct saleyards activity. The saleyards directly employ 75, as I indicated; saleyards agricultural indirectly employs 112; the retail sector directly employs 52; and the retail sector dependent employs 78-totalling employment of 317 people. Honourable members can see that the saleyards are a very strong economic stimulus and a very strong livestock selling centre bringing direct economic benefit to the whole community. The direct cash flow generated by the City of greater Bendigo saleyards includes: stock agents' commissions, approximately $2.15 million; yardage fees, approximately $0.5 million; and transport charges, approximately $3.7 million. Some 80 per cent or $2.96 million flows directly to the region and the remainder goes to other regions, making a direct cash flow generated by the City of greater Bendigo saleyards of $5.61 million. Bearing in mind the economic stimulus that saleyards create and the importance of the livestock industry to the city of Greater Bendigo, one would have to wonder why in 1985 the two Labor members representing the area-the former federal member for Bendigo, Mr Brumby, and the former Labor member for Bendigo West in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, Mr David Kennedy-rejected government assistance of over $1 million to provide upgrading and relocation of the livestock selling centre in Bendigo. That money was to be available in 1985 under an employment (;reation grant. Regrettably, that allocation was not taken up. That was the opportune time to relocate because there had been a decline in numbers and it was an appropriate time to introduce all the new technologies that the saleyards could produce. Modem technology was evolving using a range of video facilities for on-farm and off-farm selling of livestock through saleyards. However, as a result of the reluctance of these two members to take up the additional funding that could have been made available, Bendigo lost the opportunity. Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1633 The proposal to relocate the saleyards has been accepted by the rural community. A great deal of consultation has been achieved by the city of greater Bendigo. Discussions included a range of people, including stock and station agents, stock and station managers, farmers, stock buyers, stock traders, transport operators, Bendigo business houses, Department of Agriculture staff, and agricultural economists. These people were of the view that saleyards would play an important part in the marketing and selling of livestock into the future .. The summary presented by Crichton Maxwell Pty Ltd says: The COGB saleyards are seen within the livestock industry to be one of Australia's premier selling centres, even though outdated facilities are used. Crichton Maxwell Pty Ltd refers to the fact that an opportunity existed in 1985 to upgrade and to relocate the facilities, but that the opportunity was not taken up. Stocks sold through the saleyards are drawn from a large proportion of Victoria and. also from New South Wales. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, directly to the north of my electorate is a large dairying industry and there is also production of fat cattle. Had the saleyards been upgraded and new technology introduced back in 1985, greater impetus and a higher yardage of cattle from the area would have been attracted. The saleyards are a substantial generator of both direct and indirect employment, creating some 317 jobs directly and indirectly. Of course, economic benefits flow as a res.ult of saleyards operating in that location: farmers come in and out of the district; agents come from all over Australia; and buyers come from all over the world to purchase livestock. The saleyards provide a very strong economic stimulus to the Bendigo region. The total employment generated is 317, with an overall economic value to the city of greater Bendigo of $18.45 million. The summary presented by Crichton Maxwell Pty Ltd states: The objective in relocating the COGB saleyards, should be to establish a Regional and Victorian Agricultural Centre that is the focus for a 200km radius, based on Bendigo, but also for a large part of south western NSW. Able to provide all first level demands and if unable to provide them all, the remainder being sourced or accessed out of COGB CBD. The farming community wants the opportunity to present stock to buyers in the best possible condition. Farmers want a fair and adequate return for the livestock that they are marketing and they want that return to be achieved in a competitive environment where true market forces operate. Whether attempts are made to sell stock at saleyards or out on a farm, the farming community is looking for a fair and adequate return for its efforts when stock is presented to the market in the best condition possible. Looking at the future of saleyards, obviously the numbers of saleyards throughout Australia will diminish somewhat because of the introduction of new methods. The city of greater Bendigo is taking important steps to ensure that the area in which it is located is the leader in the sale of livestock. The city of greater Bendigo wants to ensure that the conditions presented to farmers and to buyers are the best that are available so as to ensure that the area holds its place in the very important function of the sale of livestock in Victoria and throughout Australia. One of the low points for Bendigo is the loss of an abattoir which was located in the Bendigo area. The abattoir was operated by the Victorian Inland Meat Authority. When the abattoir was sold, ownership was transferred to a number of owners and it ultimately ended up as a part of the Mayfair group. At one time, there was an industrial dispute at the abattoirs. The industrial dispute was being resolved at a local level until Mr Wally Curran, Secretary MC 1634 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 of the Australasian Meatworkers Union, pulled the workers out on strike. Mr Curran kept them out on strike and then he departed for an eight-week holiday overseas. Regrettably, the meat works did not ever recover from the strike. Bendigo lost the abattoirs· and 600 people lost their jobs. Bendigo never recovered from that. It is an important adjunct to have a meat processing works which can use the livestock selling centre of Bendigo in providing a service to it and in providing both domestic and overseas killing facilities, so that the livestock can actually be processed in the area where the saleyards operate. That situation was to the detriment of Bendigo and it has had an impact on it. The city of greater Bendigo has picked up the challenge of providing better facilities for the rural community and for the buyers in this most important industry, the meat and livestock industry. I have expressed the wish of the rural community to have these facilities upgraded, relocated and providing the absolute best conditions available for the rural community to achieve a fair and adequate price for their livestock. bills form part of a package of legislation to reform the meat and livestock industry statutory arrangements. The purpose of the Meat and Live-stock Industry Bill 1995 and associated bills is to provide the framework which will constitute the future of the industry. This jsnecessary as a result of the changes within the industry. As the meat and livestock industry moves towards the next decade, it is necessary to provide it with much greater responsibility for its own affairs. This will enable it to be more competitive and more flexible in responding to future consumer challenges. My electorate of Leichhardt represents an economically diverse region. Major expansion in the tourism industry has radically altered the economic base. Its origins, however, are those of a regional centre and the local economy is still based on that core. As the Minister for Resources ( Mr Beddall) said in his second reading speech, this legislation is necessary to assist industry to move towards its goal of becoming more internationally competitive and better able to respond to the more exacting consumer requirements throughout the world. That is what this legislation is about. This could not be more 'true than for the Far North Queensland beef industry. The beef industry in Far North Queensland-as well as its horticultural, aquacultural and agricultural industries-has great potential to export to the South-East Asian and South Pacific markets through the seaports of Cairns and Karumba and through Cairns international airport. These markets are becoming more and more sophisticated in many ways. Clean food and clean environment are major selling points for Australia, and we should not forget that. This legislation will assist in the value adding of meat produced in Australia. The legislation allows the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, in cooperation with other organisations, to facilitate the marketing of goods other than meat and livestock. The AMLC's legislation will also be extended to cover by-products of the meat and livestock industry. This is a power which the Meat Research Corporation already has under existing legislation. The Meat Industry Council will have the responsibility to develop a strategy for adding value to the by-products and co-products area. As the Minister for Resources said in his second reading speech, there is considerable scope for further improvement in this area. Again, with the proximity of Far North Queensland to South-East Asian and South Pacific markets-which",131,Representatives Main Committee
284,Mr Dodd (Leichhardt) (10.33 A.m.),"The Meat and Live-stock Industry Bill and associatedThursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1635 is obviously also true to a great extent for some other parts of the Australian market-the Far North Queensland meat industry has an excellent opportunity to develop new markets. I was very pleased, very recently, to have the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) visit my electorate to launch the Australia wide business industry networks. They provide not only the opportunity but also government assistance to help small businesses to develop export markets, in particular to South-East Asia and the South Pacific. This is important because small firms have not got either the time or the expertise to develop their own infrastructure in relation to exporting. These industry networks provide a means for that to come about. It was very interesting, and I use that word very loosely, to hear the speech that was given yesterday by the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Anderson), who, as I understand it, is the shadow minister for primary industry. I think that his speech was quite amazing. I have just spoken about value adding, about the importance of that to Australia and to the meat industry in Far North Queensland. The shadow minister said nothing about that. The shadow minister made an incredible statement which has to be answered. I will quote it in full because it is $0 irresponsible that it just has to be quoted in full. When talking about this bill yesterday he said: Here we are debating that report, at a time when the industry is in very serious competitive difficulties, in the second chamber of this House and at a time when the responsible minister, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), is not even in the country. What a disgraceful statement to make because, if this Main Committee does not know, Senator Collins is now in Washington lobbying on the US farm bill. If anything is more relevant to the Australian Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, more important for him to be doing, than lobbying for Australian farmers, for the Australian industry, on the US farm bill, then I am in the wrong place. But I am in the right place and I am going to remain in this place because if that is the attitude that the National Party takes to Australia's responsibilities to its farming community then we are in a very sad way indeed. That is the comment-it is in the Hansard-that the so-called shadow minister made. He said that a minister, a senator, should be somehow in this Main Committee. That is the implication, that he should be sitting here today instead of being in Washingtoninterjection from the honourable member for Cowper. There is no other way you can read that quote. He said that the minister 'is not even in the country'. What a miserable statement. Australia is very poorly served by its opposition. It is very well served by the government but very poorly served by its opposition. I would suggest that the honourable member for Cowper would make. a far better shadow minister for primary industry than the honourable member for Gwydir after hearing that statement. Look at the rest of the honourable member for Gwydir's statement. It is typical of the opposition. All it does is attack Australian farm workers and say that the real problem is we should have lower wage rates in the farming industry. That is the whole implication of that speech.",134,Representatives Main Committee

The member who spoke before me again referred to trade unions-those opposite cannot help themselves-and attacked the workers of this country. As I said before, Australia is very poorly served at the moment, not by the government but by the so-called opposition. What the honourable member for Gwydir should be doing is getting behind Senator Collins in his lobbying on the US farm bill, and not getting up here attacking legislation which has the purpose of assisting in Australia's exports and the value adding of Australian agricultural products. BeforeI finish, it is important for me to go back and talk about my electorate. There are great opportunities for export from Far North Queensland of Far North Queensland products. As people know, in the 1980s Cairns airport became the nation's first locally controlled international airport. Alongside the Cairns seaport, this provides an excellent infrastructure for the supply of goods. Freeport, Indonesia, is already being supplied by Cairns. Our position as part of the western Pacific and South-East Asia offers huge opportunities for Far North Queensland. It is very interesting to look at the record of the potential for air cargo from Cairns. The volume of air cargo passing through Cairns airport has shown a spectacular growth in recent years. International air cargo has doubled every year from 1989-90 to 1992-93, reaching 14.8 million kilograms in 1992-93International air cargo, which overtook domestic cargo in volume in 1991-92, has benefited from the opening up of new freight routes, particularly into the Asian markets, as the number of passenger services has increased. The flow-on impact of increased air cargo space to far northern producers has been enormous, and has spurred the development of a plethora of new export industries in the far north. That is what this legislation provides potential for. That is what this legislation is about, and that is what the shadow spokesman failed to mention in his speech. He failed to talk about it. All he talked about was doom and gloom, and he talked down the Australian economy. The opposition knows there is an election coming up so it has to talk down the Australian economy. It cannot give any credit to the government in terms of the minister representing Australian farmers overseas or in terms of this legislation which the industry welcomes and which I commend to the Committee. for Gwydir( Mr Anderson) to this legislation, I take the opportunity to rise and speak in support of the comments made by the member for Gwydir which, in spite of the unfortunate attack upon him by the member for Leichhardt ( Mr Dodd), were really hitting the spot. I might say, too, that I will acknowledge the justice of one comment from the member for Leichhardt, that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) is in Washington. If that is where he is, and I accept what the member for Leichhardt says, it is very important indeed that Australia's interests should be presented to the American congress as this is 1995 and the year of their farm bill. As members will know, the American farm bill only comes up for reassessment or amendment every five years. The last one was 1990. This year, 1995, is one that is going to be of great significance to Australia. I know that because, in spite of the negative remarks.by the member for Leichhardt about the National Party, as a member of the National PartyI was in Washington in April lobbying from the Vice-President down for the Australian primary producers.

289,Mr Nehl (Cowper) (10.44 A.m.),"As seconder of the amendment moved by the memberThursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1637 delegation led by Senator Michael Beahan. It was an all-party delegation which attacked this in a bipartisan fashion, and that is the way it should be. I was privileged to be in the delegation. BecauseI was a National Party member and very conversant with things rural, I was able to be the major spokesman and the focus of the representations being made to the Americans on the needs of Australian primary producers. It is particularly important to realise that the American farm bill is American domestic policy. This is one of the things that I and other members of the delegation said on every opportunity. We said to people-and I actually said this to Vice-President Gore-'We realise this is your domestic policy. It is none of our business, except that you have to realise that if you cough, we get influenza.' That is true. We were also very concerned about the impact of what the Americans have done with their export enhancement program, EEP. The most senior person we spoke with was the Vice-President, which is almost as high as you can get. After that we met Pat Roberts, who was the chairman of the House agriculture committee. Senator Richard Lugar was very involved in his preparations for announcing his candidacy for the presidency, and we were not able to see him, but we also had very useful talks with other officials in Washington such as the Library of Congress research people involved in the formulation of the policy. Australia's primary producers should be aware that there is not going to be an easy answer to this. There are basically two farm bills coming through. One is from the Senate, sponsored by Senator Lugar, and he is making a much stronger move and seeking to have the subsidies reduced significantly. The one coming through from the House takes a much softer approach, and is more concerned with maintaining the subsidies. Everywhere that we went throughout the United States on the rest of the delegation, we told people that we had been talking in Washington about this on behalf of Australia's primary producers, and all the Americans said, 'What's going to happen?' Nobody knows. The reality will probably be that the subsidies will be reduced to some extent. We should realise that it is not just EEP. There is a whole range of ways American primary producers are subsidisedlike the food stamps program, which is bound up with welfare as well-so it is very important that we understand what is happening there. The reality is that the Americans do have to reduce their deficit. Theirs is on the same scale as the deficit of this government. Let us, while we are at it, realise that that deficit is not a surplus of $700-odd million. What a confection! What a farce! What fairy floss from the show! The real deficit is at least $8 billion. The New South Wales farmers have recently published a journal which quotes from Bain and Co. and shows that the real, fair dinkum deficit is probably over $12 billion. That is going to impact severely on Australia's primary producers. While I have the floor, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to make a point about the primary producers in my electorate of Cowper. I note what the member for Bendigo( Mr Reid), the member for Page( Mr Harry Woods) and the member for Leichhardt have been saying about their particular areas. The north coast of New South Wales is the major cattle breeding area for the whole of New South Wales. In fact, 70 per cent of the cattle bred in New South Wales are bred on the north coast. It is a particularly important industry for the north coast of New South Wales. We have major saleyards at Kempsey which handle a lot of cattle. Again, at Macksville there are excellent saleyards, and the major abattoir that we have is Midco at Macksville. I have to give full praise to the management and workers of Midco. They do a tremendous job, and produce great exports for Australia. MC 1638 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 sanctimonious interventions. I ask that he desist. The member for Cowper has the floor. Unfortunately, they fell upon hard times some years ago. When I was first elected in 1984 they were in a situation where a receiver had been appointed. They were in great trouble, so much so that one of the first things I did on being elected to this parliament was to have the Parliamentary Library prepare a special research paper on the economic impact on the Nambucca Valley, should that meat works close. That is how close it was. I know there are differing views about importing capital, and particularly about the impact of Japanese investment in Australia. But I must say that, since the Midco meat works at Macksville was purchased by the Japanese firm Mitsubishi, that meat works has gone from strength to strength. It has had its ups and downs but, by and large, it has been the iron lung of the Nambucca Valley and also, of course, beyond. People from places such as Stuarts Point and Bellingen actually work there. There are hundreds of employees. Over the last 10 years, I do not know how many millions of dollars Mitsubishihas invested, but it has made major investments, sometimes of $20 million in one whack. To go through that works and see the men at work is a great pleasure. The equipment and the lines are state of the art: all stainless steel. The efficiency of those fellows, as you see them working on the beast, is ajoy to behold. They are really great people. The primary producers are well served by that abattoir. There is also another small one, the Everson one at Frederickton in the McLeay Valley, which also does a very good job, though on a much smaller scale. In conclusion, the meat industry and the primary producers of Australia are of vital importance. Whilst some people tend to denigrate the value of primary production, it is still the mainstay of Australia's exports: one should have no doubt about that. I take this opportunity-to use the favourite phrase of my leader, the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fischer)-to salute the primary producers, the workers and the meat processors of Australia.

Of course, when I heard the member for Cowper( Mr Nehl) speaking-my good comrade, as I referred to him yesterday, and a good agrarian socialist, indeed-I thought that I had better get here. I will definitely be delighted to contribute to the debate on the second reading of the Meat and Live-stock Industry Bill 1995. I noted, as I was rushing here, that my colleague the member for Leichhardt ( Mr Dodd) did draw attention to the shadow spokesperson's contribution in the Main Committee yesterday. Indeed, I was physically in attendance and listened without any interjection to his speech, irrespective of the fact that he referred to me in less than helpful terms. Any review of the transcript of Hansard in the debates in which I have followed the member for Gwydir( Mr Anderson) would indicate that I have acknowledged his commitment not only to his constituency but also to the industry.

294,Ms Henzell,"Mr Deputy Speaker, when I heard your predecessor in the chair suddenlyThursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1639 misunderstanding or mischievous analysis of what I said in the House. HadI had his press release at the time, I would have referred to him specifically in my explanation to the House a few weeks ago. But I will pass over that matter, because the member for Gwydir, the opposition spokesperson, did raise some criticisms of this bill. Firstly, he criticised the fact that it was actually being debated in this chamber, a criticism which I thought was irrelevant. He indicated that the opposition would, in general, support this bill with a second reading amendment. We should remind ourselves that the Cattle Council of Australia and all the peak bodies involved in the meat industry in this country are supporting this legislation and these recommendations. The member for Gwydir criticised the lack in the bill of any procedures to implement the Industry Commission report. From the report, he quoted the first couple of paragraphs of the overview. Indeed, he quoted from the very first paragraph. We have to be very careful of selective quoting; and, while I do not deny that what the member quoted was exactly what the report says, let me read from the end of the overview about the effects of the Industry Commission's recommendations. In part, the conclusions of the overview read: The Commission's recommendations build on reforms which have been initiated over the last decade. They have been made with a view to facilitating the transition from a commodity based, adversarial industry with low levels of skills towards a modem, collaborative and productive industry. In particular, they are designed to: increase the level of skill in the workplace, the flexibility with which it is deployed and the level of workplace health and safety; assist the process of achieving greater market access for Australian meat and meat products; increase commercial incentives for firms to conduct their own research, development and market promotion . . . That is, they have been designed to take government off the back of the industry. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) has indicated that he wants to take government off the backs of the people. In this bill, the government has provided for the industry to take control of its destiny, to take control of its own procedures and to make itself more competitive and outward looking. Yet all we get is carping criticism from the opposition and a pretty fair wallop of union bashing from the opposition spokesperson, the member for Gwydir, yesterday. But I digress from the effects of the recommendations of the Industry Commission, which continue: ... increase the extent to which the industry, whether on its own or in collaboration with government, is able to adopt a means of ensuring the hygiene and safety of its output at least costobviously a key issue for exportersincrease the capacity of producers and processors to receive feedback on how they can each meet each other's needs; reduce the level of direct public sector involvement in the industry; and facilitate measures to reduce costs and increase productivity in all sectors of the industry. These are commendable recommendations. The matters in the bill, involving the restructuring of the industry, are designed to produce those results. The other issue that we have to be very careful about is to make sure that all parties in the industry are involved, including producers. For too long, there has been a tendency, particularly among members of the opposition, to say, 'It is the meat processors, in particular the meat workers, who cause all the problems.' The member for Gwydir referred to the Booz Allen and Hamilton report for the Cattle Council of Australia, International comparisons in the beef processing industry, which is an excellent document. His aim in referring to this was to show how uncompetitive the Australian beef industry is. MC 1640 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 One of the important points made on page 35 of this review is that up to 70 per cent of the processing gap-defined in the report as $198.49 a head-is beyond the control of processors; but that around 30 per cent is addressable. It is very important to know this. All sectors of the industry, particularly the processing end, are willing to address that issue. The report does make international comparisons, but it is misleading for the member for Gwydir to mention figures from industries in countries such as Argentina and America, when the report itself clearly makes the point that only 30 per cent of this is to do with the processing industry. This is hardly the point made by the opposition spokesperson and comes from a report initiated by the Cattle Council of Australia. The other report that the member for Gwydir used was the report made by Fellows Medlock and Associates, dated March 1995. This was a report to the Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Brereton) entitled Review of progress in workplace reform in the export meat processing sector. I am delighted that the opposition spokesperson referred to this, but once again he quoted rather selectively to suggest that all the problems in the meat processing industry were the fault of the unions. I believe that this is unhelpful to the debate and I will refer to aspects of the report to clarify the position. It will be instructive to all members. Under the heading 'Difficulties or impediments to enterprise bargaining' the document states: ... a number of evident impediments to enterprise bargaining are dealt with throughout the report and are summarised below. The major impediment lies in the attitudes of the industry's employers, union officials and employees. Whilst employers and unions have expressed positive views about the need to change, this has to a large extent not been reflected in action. That this has not occurred illustrates the poor relationships which exist in the industry with trust and goodwill clearly lacking. Where co-operative relationships have been established, it is possible to point to progress in improving productivity at plant level. . The key issue for this industry is making a difference to that cost gap of 30 per cent, but it will require changes to the culture of the workplace: changes in the attitudes of management, of unions and of the work force, and not only at the national leVel but also on a plant-by-plant basis. There is evidence that, where the culture of the workplace is an issue and there is a need to educate and train employees and take them through the process, you can actually achieve very positive results. The other issue that I think is important is this: what are the impediments to change? This is referred to on page 5 of the report. Impediments to change identified by this report included the following: a) Employers: with some exceptions, the industry'S individual employers generally display a traditional and nartow approach to relations with their employees and unions and have failed to acknowledge change where it has occurred. The concept of Best Practice is not well understood by the industry's employers who have generally looked for excuses rather than accept that the initiative for reform must lie with management. And the report is critical of the union and the work force. In the industry, there is a clear lack of unity and common purpose among all participants. Failure to support the central role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commi-sion and the absence of a respected and visionary employer association are major impediments to reform. I make these points to indicate that there have been initiatives on all sides, from the processing end, from the producer end and from the government end. Indeed, our reforms have reflected that change. However, we are talking about a very conservative industry on both sides, an industry where there has been a tendency to use very out-of-date industrial relations Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1641 mechanisms on both sides but where there is a preparedness and a willingness to change. However, that has to be capitalised on. The conclusions in the overview state: Despite the on-going debate about the relative significance of workplace refonn in the overall competitiveness of the industry, there is a broad agreement among the various parties that refonn will improve perfonnance at an individual and company level. However, before sustained improvements can be achieved, it is essential that a clear, consistent and supportive message is delivered at the workplace by both employers and unions. From the views expressed during the course of this review, it is evident that sufficient commonality exists for the parties to develop a shared agenda as the basis of a commitment to a widespread education process about the need for, and benefits of, workplace refonn. The challenge for all the parties involved will be to translate their support for refonn into a concrete action plan for change at the individual company level. That is the challenge for this industry and the one that all of us should be supporting. Having gone through a very effective consultation process with all players in the industry, the Industry Commission, on page 29 of its report, concludes: All parties expressed scepticism about any ability to achieve refonn at the industry level. There is no body, at this stage, which has sufficient respect or support to be able to playa role in bringing the parties together to foster refonn. While refonn must be focused at the individual plant level, an industry-wide vision for change, supported by agreed principles and a broad action plan could play an essential role in educating the parties and facilitating enterprise level refonn. It is certainly the case that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is one party to that reform but, if management and unions think that is the only way to do this, we will not achieve a great deal. The unions have shown a preparedness to be very flexible but, at the same time, that must be based on some degree of trust and confidence so that, where agreements are developed, employers will follow through on their promises. There is no doubt that educating the workplace, which is as much a challenge to the unions as it is to the employers, is going to be very important in this process. I want to give a classic example of this issue in my electorate of Rockhampton, where Australia Meat Holdings is at present in dispute with the AMIEU. I have had discussions with some representatives of AMH. I have discussed with them the sorts of initiatives the company has put into its operation at Guyra, which I dare say the opposition spokesperson must know about because it is in his electorate. He did not mention it yesterday. I think that at one level AMH is keen to adopt productive processes whereby it can initiate the sort of changes that are needed to improve capital utilisation. I have not had a chance to talk to the employees as Guyra but I know the union has some concerns about the way the process was developed. In the Country Life of 1 June, the AMH chairman, Keith Lawson, is reported as follows: ""Enterprise bargaining does offer the industry real hope. It will have significant ramifications and it is important that producers understand that refonn has been resisted and is therefore slow,"" Mr Lawson said. ""But we are committed to getting it right. It is our only hope of survival against international competitors. "" The problem is that at the bottom end of this kind of process we have got a situation at AMH Fitzroy Abattoirs, in my electorate, where the employees, having gone through a long process of trying to develop an enterprise agreement and working under an industrial award from the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission, became so frustrated that they walked off the job one Friday afternoon. They did not follow the disputes resolution procedure technically, but they were prepared to come back on the Monday and to re-initiate the process if they could get some commitment from AMH to follow through on the promises that had been made. What MC 1642 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 followed was essentially a lock-out of the work force, with public pronouncements by the industrial relations spokesperson to the effect that the company was simply going to re-hire anybody who would come-precipitating a strikebreaking operation. The union, in attempting to get a resolution according to the agreed-upon disputes resolution, spent considerable time attempting to get some agreement with the AMH representative and in the end had to go back to the Industrial Relations Commission. That will be heard tomorrow in Brisbane. At the same time, I understand, AMH was in the Industrial Relations Commission because it is in conflict with MATFA over whether or not it should be a signatory to the industry-wide award. While I understand the frustration and concern of AMH, the way it has gone about attempting to resolve this dispute will not forward an effective, productive enterprise bargaining agreement. The work force believes that the management will re-employ a number of the workers but pick off the workers that it does not want. The resolution yesterday at the picket line was that all workers would re-apply for their jobs but the union expected all its members to be re-employed, so that the enterprise negotiation would go ahead. In fact, the union officials obtained a commitment from the work force that workers would not stage any sort of walkout unless it was sanctioned by a state official. The union officials in this situation have worked very hard to forward the process of enterprise bargaining, but feel a great lack of confidence in the position of management. It is this kind of industrial dispute that, in my view, will put back enterprise bargaining for years in Rockhampton. It is an industry that is absolutely essential to the economy of Rockhampton. We have had the Smorgons Lakes Creek meat works closed all year, because Smorgons decided to divest itself of its entire company structure. company's meat processing industry but the whole thing. In the meantime, the company did not give two hoots about what happened to the workers and their families in Rockhampton. It held out and held out in terms of paying the redundancy payments that were due to those workers-workers who have to suffer seasonal working arrangements and hiring and firing on a daily basis. Basically, people in this place should know that we are talking about an industry that goes back a long way. It is a piece of industrial archaeology, to quote the Prime Minister( Mr Keating). It is not conducive to getting good performance out of any employee. perhaps take a different view of how it should be done. At the end of the day I urge, and I have done so, the people from AMH to sit down and start negotiating a way through this mess. They need to provide education and skill formation, and they need to do something constructive about bringing their work force with them. AMH may well decide that it can just pull the pin and move its operations but that will not help the beef producers of Central Queensland. At the moment, because our two meat works are closed, our cattle producers are having to freight their stock to Brisbane. The cost involved in that is huge. I was at a meeting at Claremont where the AMH representative was having a crack at workers by saying, 'It's all the fault of the work force.' The producers were saying, 'Yes, that is true.' But, at the end of the day, the meat processing companies screw down not only their work force but also the",138,Representatives Main Committee

There is a great need, at all levels of this industry, for men and women of goodwill to sit down and work out how best they can forward this industry which is so vital to Australia's future. I urge all players in this industry to do that, including the opposition. I would like to know the opposition's policy on this issue. All we hear from the opposition is criticism, in spite of the support of all of the peak bodies to this legislation. The government is once again delivering on reform. It is about getting the government off the back of the industry and about asking the industry to take responsibility for its processes, to become competitive, to get niche markets and to make sure of the product that it is producing. One of our problems is that we do not grain feed a lot of our beef. We still use open range and that makes us less competitive. There are a number of issues involved here. It is not just the poor old meatworker. appreciation to the House for the circumstances we found ourselves in a few moments ago and convey my apologies to you. the former Deputy Speaker, who was most accommodating at that point. that other members have outlined but to the exotic animal disease aspect of this legislation. It has concerned me for some time that there is a change in the ethos in assessing the vulnerability of Australia to the imported exotic diseases. It may be a fairly roundabout process but I ask the House to bear with me as we trace the change in the processes used by the government, and the animal quarantine and export branch of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. I think we can find part of the answer there that we need to have if we are going to build a safe and secure animal production industry in Australia. Safe and secure animal production for Australia is critical. Not only must we have an input into research and development, and the latest techniques of production, but we must be safeguarding our great industries as well. I wish to take the House back to the notorious case of the import of pig meat, take that as a case example, look at poultry production and draw from that some conclusions as to what might be proper practices and policies for this nation in the future. As far back as 1988, there were circulars from the Department of Primary. Industries and Energy with regard to pig reproduction centres and pig import conditions. Those circulars laid out some of the criteria that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy sought to impose upon those people producing pig meat in international circumstances and the conditions of quarantine that would apply should Australia consider the import of pig meat. At that time, there was great activity in the pig and poultry industries, as growers and producers tried to assess what, for them, was an innovation-the idea that Australia should actually be an importer of these fragile primary products, which notoriously could present a risk for Australian producers should exotic diseases gain entry into Australia in any way. At that time, I wrote to the then minister for resources, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Griffiths), asking him for details. He responded in August 1991. In that letter, he said: The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is a transparent and accountable organisation that uses the best advice available when assessing proposals and developing protocols for the importation",142,Representatives Main Committee

The procedure followed varies in the detail depending on the perceived risks and similarity of the proposal to pre-existing protocols. There are however some basic steps which are common to all major policy decisions such as producing new importation policies. These are characterised by extensive consultation with scientific and industrial bodies eg the state and Northern Territory agriculture departments or equivalent, the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), the CSIRO and the National Farmers Federation (NFF). Specialist national industry groups such as the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council and the Australian Poultry Industry Association, are also approached when their industry is involved. Overseas experts and organisations are also frequently consulted on specialised topics and the Veterinary Services of the exporting countries provide information on animal health in those countries. The AQIS Bulletin, a monthly publication available through the Australian Government Publishing Service, carries notices of AQIS's reviews and solicits comments. Through this consultative mechanism, AQIS obtains the best scientific information on which to base its decisions. I think that is a good letter, and it outlines, pretty fairly, the way in which Australia should look at these matters. There is another factor that I will raise later. It is the need for Australia to preserve its unique position, in intensely competitive markets, of having disease free, clean food products. That is something that is a priceless comparative advantage to us in any market. It is something that we need to preserve, because too many would want to see us destroy our comparative advantage of clean products and would want to see extra costs loaded onto Australian producers if we should import disease. The former minister's letter, of 21 August 1991, seems a reasonable letter. I decided, at that time, to test the minister's response and take up with the international expert bodies exactly what AQIS had done in order to consult widely. I had already consulted the Australian Veterinary Association, the CSIRO and the NFF. I had spoken to and received documentation from the Australian Pig Industry Council and the Australian Poultry Industry Association. The only group that I was unfamiliar with and did not have information from was the group of overseas experts that AQIS had consulted in giving advice to the government on whether or not Australia should import pig meat. I wrote to the universities and national institutions the names of which the minister supplied as having been consulted. I was somewhat surprised by the responses I received. Let me read some of the names of those authorities which were consulted by AQIS as being world authorities which could provide advice on which a scientific decision as to whether or not Australia should import pig meat could be based. The list reads: Agriculture Canada, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Australian Veterinary Association, Bureau of Rural Resources, Cambridge University, Chief Quarantine Officers (Animals) in all states and NT, Counsellor (Veterinary Services) Brussels, Iowa State University, Malaysian Veterinary Research Institute, New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Singapore Department of Primary Production, State Veterinary Institute for Virus Research, Denmark, United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, United States Department of Agriculture, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland and Veterinary Counsellor, Washington. I wrote to those groups and I would like now to read some of the responses to the House, because I believe that what we have before us is misleading, if not fraudulent, behaviour on the part of AQIS, in the way in which it spoke to the minister and provided advice to the minister. I will read first of all a letter from the British High Commissioner. It says: Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1645 Dear Mr Cadman, In his letter to you of 2 August the High Commissioner (who is currently travelling with a visiting British Minister) said that we would be asking our Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if they could provide copies or details of any submissions made by them or by Cambridge University to the inquiry conducted by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) into the import of Canadian pigmeat. The Ministry have now replied saying that they have no trace of any such submissions. I understand that it is quite possible that any contribution which they may have made to the AQIS inquiry would have been provided as answers. to specific questions put to them by AQIS, rather than in the form of a written submission. A very nice informal approach on such a serious issue, I would have thought, and one completely unacceptable in such important decision taking. The letter continues: The officials concerned would not necessarily have known that the questions were being asked in relation to an inquiry into Canadian pigmeat. I am sorry to say, therefore, that on the face of it we are unable to meet your request. But if you are able to provide any more detailed information about the dates on which consultations took place, preferably with the names of officials involved, I should be happy to make further inquiries. I could not do that, but the British High Commission had full details of the statements by the minister and what the minister said. I had a response from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, from the Bureau of Rural Resources, which gave me some breakdown on costs and charges on an economic basis, from the pig meat people of Australia, from the New Zealand government and from the government of the United States. I would have to say that in every instance of my contact with overseas experts, the response was similar to that of the British High Commission. If contact had been made, it was not known by the Australian representatives on their inquiries with universities, or with specialist groups. It is of deep concern to me that, based on what appears to be false and misleading information, we as a nation made a decision based on a very cooperative attitude from the Canadian government, which had a wonderful relationship with the Australian department and the minister and which said, 'There is no risk whatsoever of our pig meat bringing in disease to Australia, and here are the authorities and bodies that we wish to quote.' I would say that is prejudiced advice and, if the Australian government makes decisions in this way, I think that we are in a dangerous situatiori. We have before us the proposition that Australia should import chicken meat from Thailand, Denmark and the United States. I have to use this opportunity t() raise my deep concern that this not become another process of the type that we saw undertaken by the Australian government or its advisers in regard to pig meat. Fortunately, there have not been any grave consequences of the pig meat importation, though there may have been one outbreak of mystery swine disease created by the import of that Canadian pig meat-nobody has been able to say yes or no. Are we going to face the prospect of our poultry industry and then our beef industry and other industries being treated in this same way? The minister's letters are very revealing, because the basis of the decision used by AQIS and the government is not on a norisk policy but on what is an acceptable risk, so there is an endeavour to evaluate the cost of importing an exotic disease and the economic loss against the gain. In the chicken meat industry, the economic gain to consumers is said to be about $3 million a year. The cost to the industry if there were an outbreak of Newcastle disease is estimated, on average, at about $30 million a year. So if we get one outbreak in a lO-year period, any economic advantage is lost immediately.. MC 1646 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 In examining the AQIS position, I turned to AQIS's pamphlet on Newcastle disease, which is the disease most likely to threaten the Australian poultry industry. The pamphlet says: Newcastle disease, the most feared avian disease in the world has penetrated into most countries. Australia so far is free from the pathogenic forms of this disease. When the disease first enters a country it can cause havoc in the bird industry---commercial flocks, fancy birds, pet birds and native wild birds are all susceptible. Thousands of birds may die. Those that appear to recover can pass the disease on to healthy birds and may themselves remain chronically ill for the rest of their lives. There is no known cure for Newcastle Disease. The disease is caused by a virus so drugs do not help. Birds continue dying even if heavily medicated. That is from an AQIS pamphlet on Newcastle disease. I sought some expert information. Dr Balkar Bains-who is one of the most widely respected authorities on poultry disease in the world-states that the possibility of introducing Newcastle disease through imports of cooked meat is real, that the spread of the disease could not be controlled and that it could decimate the native bird population of Australia. He says, 'The evidence is not speculative, it is real.' I know and admire Dr Paul· Gilchrist, as a person who has contributed mightily to the Australian poultry industry and to knowledge on avian diseases, and would be the most widely recognised authority on poultry diseases in New South Wales. He has recently written papers called 'Newcastle disease is a threat to native birds' and 'Further comment-response to the AQIS position'. He says: Researches (1985) reported 100% cent mortality in Eastern Rosellas within six (6) days of artificial exposure to Newcastle Disease.' He also says: Researches (1989) tested 1,235 Australian birds of 130 species for Newcastle Disease virus and antibodies and none gave a positive response. This tends to confirm the lack of exposure of and thus probable susceptibility of our native birds. That is from Dr Paul Gilchrist. If we set the poultry industry to one side and go to the scientific evidence, we can see that AQIS has been derelict in chasing hard scientific evidence. We have two eminent world authorities, both Australians, saying there is a real risk to Australian native bird life here, and we have AQIS continuing to pursue the line with the minister-and with the Australian parliament-that there is an acceptable risk to bringing poultry meat into Australia. I have to raise serious doubts about whether or not we are pursuing a proper course here. I would like to see a full inquiry as to the advice provided by AQIS and the thoroughness of its investigations in all of these matters. I would like to see a detailed analysis of how AQIS arrives at what is an 'acceptable risk', because it seems to me that a 10 to one bet on whether or not there is going to be an outbreak is not an acceptable risk. I would like to see it be more like a 100 to one risk factor if we were even going to contemplate this process. Let me return to what I think is the nub of the whole situation, which is Australia's comparative advantage over the rest of the world. We have, at close quarters, some very active and highly productive countries. We live in a fiercely competitive world, in terms of agricultural products. If we are not going to defend the comparative advantage we have with clean food products, then we ought to pack up the Australian primary industries right now, because it is a philosophy that one cannot apply to one industry and not to another. It is no Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1647 good for the beef growers of Australia to say that we could do without some elements of the poultry industry. The way the argument runs, an acceptable risk is if there is a small economic advantage. I have illustrated the small economic advantage to the consumers of Australia. With $3 million a year spread over hundreds of millions of pieces of poultry consumed by Australians in a year, the advantage for the individual consumer is infinitesimal. If you said to the average Aussie, 'I would like you to pay 25c more a bird to make sure that we do not import disease, and our guarantee is that we are not going to let Newcastle disease into the Australian parrot population,' the kids of Australia would rise up in their schools and say, 'We will pay 25c to make sure that Australia remains disease free.' This is not a protectionist issue. The degree to which this argument on protection has gone on based on animal diseases is stupid, because we are running a risk of denying ourselves the comparative advantage that we have in an intensely competitive world trade in animal and agricultural products. Unless we stay with some semblance of being disease free and can sell without fear or favour around the world Australian products which are known to be disease free, then we will become like the rest of the world and, despite the economies of production, the tyranny of distance will kill our producers. I raise this in what I know is basically a beef debate. But I do so because I am really concerned about the direction I see the protection of Australian animals, flocks and vegetable products going. Our crops are also facing the same sort of threat. I will wait with great interest to hear from the minister the assertions and support that he cannot give in his correspondence, because he does say in the last few lines of his correspondence that there is no guarantee. He says that AQIS cannot give a guarantee that Australian flocks would be free of Newcastle disease. I think this is a terrible decision. (Time expired) industry and I would like to raise the simple question: how are these new proposals being put forward by the government really going to tackle the central problems facing the meat industry today? This is what ought to be concerning all honourable members and it seems to me that it is the one area that the government seems to have skirted around. In fact, one would have to say that we could judge them as being a failure. We do not have to go any further than the Industry Commission report on meat processing released in July last year, which was quite a while ago when you think about it. The government has had all this time to address some of the core problems. Instead of doing that, we are now going off onto another tangent, changing a lot of the structures around the meat industry but, at the same time, avoiding the primary problem. In the overview of the Industry Commission report, which has a very informative way of putting the problems in perspective, it says in part: ... Australia produces livestock at very low cost by international standards. However, efficient processing is necessary if we are to take full advantage of our comparative advantage in livestock production. Although Australian meat is generally price competitive on export markets, this is largely because processors are able to buy livestock at very low prices compared with processors in other countries .. I think that puts it in a very stark perspective. The report goes on to say: This· inquiry has found that,· despite some recent improvements, Australia's meat processing industry operates at significantly higher cost than processing industries of most countries with which it competes.",143,Representatives Main Committee

I would suggest to all honourable members that there are two very strong messages there. One is the fact that our processing costs are higher than those of our competitors, which is only compensated for by the fact that livestock producers are being paid less. The other more chilling fact is that we are losing market share in almost all our major export markets. I would have thought that the alarm bells would be going off. I find it most disconcerting to listen to some of the government members who seem to be completely avoiding this point and are not able to come to grips with it. . What is even more galling about this is to listen to the comments that the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) made which were reported by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the member for Gwydir( Mr Anderson), in his address. He said that, when asked a question about the problems of the high processing costs, the Prime Minister said, 'Aren't you a mug for highlighting the inefficiency of the Australian beef producer.' The Prime Minister obviously completely misunderstood the industry; he had no idea. I would have thought that that same description could be applied to many of the contributions by government members to this debate. BeforeI leave the Industry Commission report, I want to look very closely at the point that was made in the overview which seems to have escaped government members completely. They come in here like robots and suggest that members of the coalition are just knocking the workers and all they want to do is get lower wages. Talk about ignorant! They obviously have not even read the report. If we look at page 16 of the overview, we will find some comments about the industrial relations problems which really are the core issue in this whole question of trying to get a more efficient meat processing industry. The report says: The industry has been disadvantaged by a poor industrial relations climate and a poor occupational health and safety record. Remember, we are talking about an industry that has had this problem for many years, but, equally, we are talking about a government that has been in power for 12 years and has done, mighty little to address the problem. The report continues: Features of the industry'S award system inhibit innovation and have contributed to industrial Unrest. Seniority systems and daily hire provide insufficient incentives for training and skills development. The complexity of the tally system, and its structure of premium rates of remuneration for extra output, reduces incentives for improving working conditions and productivity. Capacity utilisation of the Australian industry is lower than that of our competitors, resulting in higher fixed costs per unit of output. Further on, it says: The Commission has foundthis is the important pointthat greater flexibility-particularly greater use of enterprise agreements---could bong about significant productivity gains, with benefits. I emphasise this pointfor workers, producers, processors and some consumers. Obviously, the government members were unable to get this far into the report to see that what is being proposed by the Industry Commission-the core issue-is actually going to be for Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1649 the benefit of the workers, not to their disadvantage, as people like the member for Leichhardt ( Mr Dodd) tried to claim when they came in and made their contributions. It seems extraordinary that it has taken report after report to highlight what has been so obvious to so many in the industry who have understood what has been going on for some years. Australia is the net loser because of the government's failure to act. We now have a package of bills which does not address that core issue but does a number of other things such as increase the minister's power over the structures to run the industry. It fails to address some of the major problems with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, as my colleague the member for Mitchell( Mr Cadman) was discussing in his contribution, and it still does not address the primary problem of how we make the meat industry more competitive on an international scale. I guess that, as usual, the government wants to be seen to be doing something, rather than getting in and tackling the central points. If we look at one of the claims in these bills themselves, apart from the fact those opposite do not address some of these core issues, there is a claim that there is no cost in introducing these changes to the AMLC. As I think anyone would know, if significant changes are made to the structures that are operating, it is likely to cause quite a lot of dislocation and there will be some costs, not only directly but indirectly, as people try to adjust to those changes. Clearly, they will have some difficulty in focusing on some of the core issues as they make those adjustments. If we take the question of market information, there is no explanation there as to whether or not the quality or, indeed, the quantity of market information is going to be improved by this change. A second point is about the question of a minister increasing his power in the whole issue. He has now been given two very key powers: he can veto or, indeed, vary the corporate plans of the Meat Industry Council, the Meat· and Livestock Corporation or the Meat Research Corporation. So that is very significant power-a power not only to veto but also to vary. He can have a very big degree of influence and involvement through the guidelines, approvals and appointments of key people on the boards of the various bodies. This is fraught with danger. There is a very real risk that, if a minister wanted to abuse that position, he could do enormous danger to this industry by appointing his cronies or people who are not competent to do the job to the best of their ability. I flag this concern because I think it is something that the government ought to be held accountable for. Clearly, by vesting so much power in a minister, there is a very real risk that the industry could suffer. We only have to look at the last two ministers for primary industry to see some of the shortcomings that I am referring to. When it comes to the meat industry, we have had a choice between two ministers-the current minister who seems to know nothing about the industry, and the previous minister who really did nothing. That is the choice we have had with this current government: the know-nothing or the do-nothing. I now come to my third point, which concerns the whole question of AQIS, the Quarantine and Inspection Service. Again, if we look at the Industry Commission's report, we find that it suggests that AQIS should be split into two. We clearly need more competitiveness in the whole question of meat inspection. I do not think it is good enough to continue to have a complete monopoly, as AQIS currently has. I think it is worth also reminding honourable members that meat inspection is a most expensiveA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.44 a.m. to 12.06 p.m. MC 1650 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 Mr HA WKER-As I was saying, one of the areas that does require some attention, as the Industry Commission report has pointed out, is the whole question of inspection services. Meat inspection in Australia costs producers around $90 million a year. That is not an insignificant sum, especially when you look at what some of our competitors pay. For example, in the United States, they pay nothing; meat inspection is provided by the government. One of the other points that is long overdue for recognition is the need to change our inspection system. As I said, this should involve not only splitting AQIS into two, but also looking at a system similar to the HACCP, the hazard analysis critical control point system, on the whole of meat inspection. One of the concerns is that, at the moment, we basically rely on end-point inspection which really only allows a quick glance at the appearance of the meat and clearly could easily overlook some of the possible problems that the whole inspection service is designed to avoid. Today's consumers require more than just a visual inspection. They want the microbiological tests. They want to make sure that the product is clean and that problems that are undetectable to the eye have, in fact, been avoided. Clearly, if we are going to do that, all stages of the processing chain, from the time of transport and from production itself, have to be looked at and what we might call a quality assurance system has to be instituted. This would not only guarantee a safer product but would also, I think, guarantee a better product. That is the whole point of this HACCP system because it eliminates this fisk. Therefore I think it is time that we started to look at this, instead of the government continuing with the existing system which clearly has some shortcomings. This would dovetail very nicely into some of the work that the Cattle Council has been doing in developing its quality assurance program. The fourth point, and probably the most significant one, is the whole question of industrial relations. As has been shown in the Industry Commission report-and was, in fact, shown in the Booz Allen and Hamilton report a couple of years ago-we do have a major problem in the cost of processing in Australia. That is why we are in the alarming position where not only are Australian processing costs much higher and Australian producers are receiving less than their counterparts in other countries but, at the same time, we are losing market share in many of our export markets. Part of the industrial relations problem that has been highlighted also adds to the fact that our processing costs are, in many cases, double that of the New Zealanders and more than twice what it costs to process in the United States. We can look at other parts of the chain, for example, the whole waterfront system. We have seen $430 million spent there, half of it provided by taxpayers, yet if we look at the latest Contship assessment, the performance of Australian ports is slipping back down the list. So all that money has been spent only to see that our performance is deteriorating when it is compared with that of other ports around the world. I have highlighted the industrial relations problem as it affects the meat industry in the processing area. I have mentioned the problems in the waterfront. We could also look at some of the inefficiencies in transport. But I come back to the point I made that was highlighted in the Industry Commission report: it is not a question, as some of the honourable members opposite have tried to portray it, of trying to force workers into poorer conditions or lower wages. It is quite the opposite. It is by increasing the productivity and by getting greater efficiency that, in fact, everyone can benefit. It is a tragedy for this industry and the country that Australian meat processors and producers have to pay a very high price for a system which all commentators in this country have Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1651 recognised is inefficient. Only the Labor Party seems unable to realise that we are putting a major impediment in the way of improving our export performance in this industry and, indeed, in just about every other industry. Producers are the ones who are suffering. It has been estimated that the average cattle producer in Australia is getting from $50 to $100 per head less than they would be getting if Australia had a world competitive system for processing and transporting products. This was illustrated very clearly by a recent example when Queensland, ostensibly because of the drought problem, found itself in a position where it had to import beef from United States and New Zealand. After paying all the costs of shipping that meat to Australia-and cattle producers in the United States are paid far more than the Australian producers-the beef could still be landed in Queensland at a competitive price compared with the Australian product. More clearly than anything else, that illustrates what a dreadful problem we have and, as I see it, the legislation does virtually nothing to address it. It is a forerunner to some of the other problems that the industry is going to face if we do not get efficiency into the whole process. Already it is clear that parts of South America are going to be able to send their meat into the United States and we will find that that will be very competitive. I would like to point out one issue which I think the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) has made a lot of noise about, that is, the importance of getting women involved in some of these associated boards. Everyone would agree with the thrust of that, but, when he talks about having quotas, it raises some concerns. Looking at government appointments to date, it is very hard to find people other than men. The most recent appointment, which only reinforces this point, has been to the position of chairman of the Meat and Livestock Corporation. It was none other than the former minister for primary industry, Mr Kerin. The government representative on the Meat Industry Council is a man, the government representative on the ILC is a man, and the Meat Research Council is headed up by a man. Most of these people are very competent, but I do not think the government's record is followed up by its rhetoric. In conclusion, I would like to raise these concerns again because one of our major primary industries is being sorely hampered by the fact that the government has failed to address the key issue of getting efficiency into the whole process. The Industry Commission· report highlighted the core problem of getting efficiency into processing and boils the problem down to the government being rusted onto an archaic industrial relations system while the rest of the world looks on in utter amazement. Clearly, the government has failed miserably to serve the best interests of our industry and to serve the best interests of Australia in addressing this problem. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.15 p.m. to 12.37 p.m. beef industry in Australia. These are landmark pieces of legislation, very important, and I want . to reiterate a few points that have been made by the opposition during this debate. The first point is that it needs to be highlighted that it has taken the government 14 months to respond to this Industry Commission report. This is not just a one-off situation as far as government responding to IC reports is concerned. The taxpayers of Australia put an enormous amount of resource into getting these professionally done and objective reports of industry analysis.",147,Representatives Main Committee
303,Mr Vaile (Lyne) (12.37 P.m.),"This package of bills will have a profound effect on theMC 1652 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday,S June 1995 At the moment we are also waiting on a report that is with a government minister and has been for 12 months-that is, the IC report on the petroleum industry in Australia. There has still been no response from the government in that regard, yet that also has an effect on this industry. It has taken 14 months for the governm-nt to respond to this Industry Commission report. I suppose that, if we look at some of the comments and recommendations that have been made in the IC report, we can understand why it has taken the government so long to respond to the report. The beef industry is one of Australia's most vitally important rural industries. We are very much world competitive, for reasons differing from those that the government recognises. Previous opposition speakers have passed criticism of the fact that this bill is being debated in the national parliament of Australia when the minister is overseas. We are not criticising the fact that the minister is overseas; we recognise that he has got to do that to do his job adequately in representing the rural industries of Australia. But it is probably an indication of where in the scale of the importance of things the government places the beef industry, when the government is prepared to run this legislation through in the second chamber when the minister is overseas. That needs to be put on the record. I know that there has been a fair amount of criticism levelled at the shadow minister for primary industry for making the same comments, but it is certainly worth putting it on the record that I think the government should have placed a little bit more importance on this package of legislation, which is very important to the prosperity of the beef industry. This package of legislation is complex. I was involved in the livestock selling business and auctioneering business in a former life, and so I can understand the frustration which many of my constituents have expressed to me with regard to recent levy charges and levy changes. It can be seen that the main bill is giving effect to the Meat Industry Council, and I understand that a great many of the other bills have the effect of transferring to the Meat Industry Council the ability to charge the levies which are already being paid. It is interesting to see which organisations are to be on the Meat Industry Council, and, indeed, the details of the composition of the council jumped off the page at me when I first read it. There are to be 18 members and the council will include a chairperson and a government member, both of whom will be appointed by the minister. The minister will also appoint other members on the recommendation of the Cattle Council of Australia, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia, the Australian Meat Council, the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Livestock Exporters Association, the Australian Lot Feeders Association, the Australian Supermarket Institute Limited and other members prescribed by regulation. Although it is not enunciated in any of the documentation that I have read in the course of my research, I would hope that, under that last criterion of 'other members prescribed by regulation', there is a representative from the Livestock Agents Association. Livestock agents are the people who, on behalf of the AMLC, and, in the future; the Meat Industry Council, collect levies. They are the people who have got to deal with the producers and explain to them what it is all about when the levy goes up. Livestock agents also have to explain how the money is being spent. Although as the collectors for the Commonwealth the livestock agents cop the blame, I do not see them listed as members of that body. I have not researched the situation any further, and they may be involved as other members prescribed by regulation. I certainly hope so. Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1653 I reiterate the absolute importance of having someone on the council who represents livestock selling agents from across Australia. There are a number of peak bodies in the states from which it would be possible to draw some very experienced people. I do not disagree with the selection of the other representatives on the council; their selection is obviously justifiable. However, although there are producers, processors, retailers and wholesalers represented on the council, the key conduit person from the middle of the process is not represented. It does not matter whether the product is consumed domestically or whether it is exported; the fact is that a large percentage of the beef cattle in Australia which are processed through saleyards are processed through livestock selling agents. It is very important that that fact is recognised, and I hope that the government takes what I have said on board. The government has obviously left a little flexibility at the margin so that someone else in that area can be included. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is included, and that is fine because many of the members of the union are involved in the beef industry in areas such as production and processing, transport, retailing and overseas shipment. However, do not forget a very important element: the livestock agents are the people who collect the levies for the Commonwealth in those circumstances. It is very important that livestock agents be included on the Meat Industry Council. The government asked the Industry Commission to undertake a study into the meat industry, and the commission reported to the government in July 1994. I have already made the point that the report had·been with the government for 14 months before a response and this draft legislation was received. In its report, the Industry Commission pointed out that Australia produces livestock at avery low cost by international standards. However, efficient processing is necessary if Australia is to take full advantage of our comparative advantage in livestock production. The comparative advantage in livestock production in this country comes from the producers. It does not come from anywhere else along the chain; it comes from the producers. We have the most efficient producers of beef in the world and this is because the prices that our producers receive for their product are very low by world standards. The Industry Commission report said that the reason Australia remains world competitive in this area is that processors are able to buy livestock at very low prices compared with the prices paid by processors in other countries. I can confidently state that this is a fact. There are a lot of members on both sides of this chamber who have direct links to the beef industry in the production, wholesale .or processing areas. The members concerned know that returns to beef producers have not progressed in real terms with the rest of the economy, and the members concerned all know that, in a lot of cases, returns have gone backwards. Returns are subject to the whims of the market. This was recently borne out when US beef landed in Australia at competitive prices after cattle producers in the United States were paid 60 per cent more for their livestock than Australian farmers. There is not much room for any improvement as far as our primary producers are concerned. They are becoming world competitive. This government has signed the GATT agreement and the World Trade Organisation comes into effect from 1 July 1995. In those agreements, as far as the reduction of tariff and subsidy is concerned, particularly in regard to primary products, it is on a percentage basis across-the board off different bases. The Australian Commonwealth and its producers were already receiving low subsidy and low tariff protection. Off that base, in the first year we are reducing MC 1654 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 our tariffs by 20 per cent, whereas Great Britain and countries in the European Union are reducing from enormously high levels of tariff protection in excess of 100 per cent. I just do not see how we are ever going to be really competitive in that area. The European Union and the United States of America still do not seem to be committed to the moral ethic of the Uruguay Round. Recently, the US introduced extra SUbsidies on dairy products into South-East Asia. It is going to be interesting to see, when the time comes, what we will do and what the World Trade Organisation will do when the US does not comply. It is doubly difficult for our primary producers. They are not supported in a genuine way by the rest of the industry as far as reform is concerned. Reform is not happening in a number of areas. In the processing sector, it is not happening adequately or quickly, noris it happening in the government sector-for instance, AQIS and its services. All Australian processors have committed themselves to quality assurance programs. In my electorate, a couple of processing plants, have gone the whole hog and spent an enormous amount of money on quality assurance. They have their own quality assurance people in place but the number of AQIS people has not been reduced. That is a burden in itself. It adds to the high cost of the end product that is not relevant to what the producer has to put up with. The government has not responded to a number of issues from the IC report. One of the documents I was researching was interesting. It says: While there has been an extensive consultation process leading to the introduction of this package of Bills, a major reservation can be identified. This is that the process was conducted against the background of issues raised in the Industry Commission report and the Discussion Paper and these, almost exclusively, focussed on perceived deficiencies in current arrangements, and concerns over the effectiveness of AMLC programs. Consequently, relatively scant attention appears to have been paid to those aspects of the present meat marketing system which are operating satisfactorily. Nor has there been any indication of the tangible benefits that presumably would flow from the package or of what, if any, the costs might be. The assertion that the proposed arrangements will provide a less regulatory operating environment for the industry is not yet supported by any evidence. While there has been a rearrangement of the roles and powers of various statutory bodies, in total the same array of objectives, functions and powers will largely endure. Furthermore, the proposed arrangements do not give industry a full self-determination role in policy and industry development because of two key powers vested in the Minister. These are the power to veto/vary MIC, AMLC and MRC ... directives with respect to performance of MIC, AMLC and MRC functions and powers. The Minister will also have;: a degree of influence and involvement through the likes of guidelines and approvals (such as appointments and export licences). It remains to be seen whether or not those who want the role of the AMLC phased down or out ... or those who wish to see statutory marketing and information continue ... can be reconciled, particularly given the MIC's levy setting responsibility. Given that there has to date been no commercial evaluation, or rigorous analysis of the worth of the AMLC and MRC to the meat and live-stock industry, it is possible that a minimally staffed MIC will not be able to mount well thought through proposals without the information base of the AMLC and MRC. The Australian meat and live-stock industries have not reconciled the age-old conflict between producers and processors to the extent that has occurred in the dairy industry. That is an absolute matter of fact. They have not been reconciled. There is not a whole of industry commitment to the outcomes that we want to see achieved in the beef industry, and that is so very true. Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1655 We wholeheartedly support the arrangements that have been in place under the Kerin plan and then the Crean plan. The opposition supported the arrangements that we have moved the dairy industry into, so that it can take on the agreements that we have signed concerning the World Trade Organisation, which comes into place on 1 July this year. But we have not got that whole of industry commitment by the beef industry. There are too many tensions, there is not the commitment to the outcome and there is not the fairness of the down-flow of benefit to the people that deserve it. We see the producers in times of drought receiving lower and lower margins. We see producers in good times, in flush times, being penalised because of corrupt overseas markets. When the market is bad, the people that bear the brunt of it are not the processing plants or the people that work in the processing plants, they are not the transport operators or the shipping people that take the containers over the wharves. Who are they? It is the producers that bear the brunt of it. Instead of getting $400 for a beast, they get $200 for a beast and have got to shut up and take it. They have absolutely no redress at all because those producers might have one sale a year. They might breed weaners for sale into a fattening market, and they have one sale a year. If that sale happens to fall in a time of low prices, they have no choice but to take what they are offered. That illustrates that there is no commitment right across the industry to see fair and equitable distribution of the profits of the industry back to the people who produce the goods and the other people involved in the industry who have got major investment. Without the producers, without the processors, the employees along the way would not have the jobs that they have got. It is very important that in the industry, and at this level of setting industry policy, these facts are recognised. To date I do not believe they are. It is interesting to note the amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister. I will put it on the record again: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the Main Committee deplores the fact that the Government has implemented only one of the Industry Commission's recommendations for the industry and has ignored the others, including important recommendations relating to industrial relations reform and the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service"". I have covered both those points in my address this afternoon and I go back to the other main points that I started with as far as this vitally important industry is concerned. It has taken all that time for the government to respond, in drafting this legislation, to that IC report; the government has addressed only a couple of the recommendations in that IC report; and it is running this legislation through the national parliament of Australia with the minister overseas. I am not decrying the fact that he is actually overseas working on behalf of the producers of Australia. I am just pointing out that the scheduling of this legislation when he is not here is an indication to us on this side of the House of the level of importance that the government places on this industry, which is absolutely vital. We are not seeing a genuine attitude towards all the government members' constituents that work in this industry, to try to see the ongoing viability of the industry and to see a fair and equitable distribution of the profits that flow from this industry in Australia. Most important is the fact that, in all the documentation that I have read, there does not seem to be any reference to the possibility of having a representative of any of the livestock agents associations around Australian represented on the Meat Industry Council. They are an MC 1656 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 absolutely vital link in the chain in this industry in Australia. They are the people who actually collect all the levies that this legislation is putting into place, for the Meat Industry Council to collect. They are the people with whom the bureaucrats in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy should be liaising. They should be told, 'This is how you explain it to the producers. This is what we were are doing with the money. It is all about making sure that our product maintains a very high reputation overseas.' We all agree with that sentiment. We agree with what has been done. The producers do not know that; that message is not getting across. The message is not getting down to those livestock agents. I implore the government to have a look at that particular area under the category 'other members prescribed by regulation' so that there is some representative of the livestock agents to give them input into what is going to be a very important body in the future. read a second time.

Second Reading Mr O'KEEFE (Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport) (1.15 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on jet aircraft landings at airports where noise amelioration programs are being funded by the federal government. Honourable members will be aware that construction of a new parallel runway at Sydney airport was completed during 1994, and the runway came into operation in November 1994. When the recently installed air traffic control system is operating at full capacity, the traffic handling capacity of the new runway configuration will be about 80 aircraft movements per hour, compared with 55 movements per hour prior to the commissioning of the new runway. While the operation of the new parallel runway configuration significantly reduces the overall number of people seriously affected by aircraft noise, particularly among those to the east and west of the airport, it significantly increases the level of noise exposure for residents of some other areas, mainly to the north of the airport. Recognising that this would be the case, the government, in 1991, commissioned a steering committee, convened by the Federal Airports Corporation, to prepare a noise management plan for Sydney airport, identifying possible measures to mitigate the noise impact of the new runway operation. A draft noise management plan was subsequently developed, with extensive involvement by the three levels of government, the community and the airline industry. The draft plan was released for public comment in June 1994. After considering measures proposed in the draft noise management plan, the government announced late last year that it would undertake a major program of acquisition and acoustic insulation of certain buildings in the areas worse affected by noise from the operation of the airport. In addition, the government has initiated a range of other measures, including mandatory flight paths, take-off procedures for jet aircraft and tighter curfew arrangements, to minimise the number of people affected by aircraft noise. The acquisition and insulation program encompasses the voluntary acquisition of up to 113 residential properties within the 40 ANEF zone; sound insulation of some 4,200 residential properties within the 30 ANEF zone; and sound insulation of schools and colleges, child-care facilities, hospitals and health care facilities and churches within the 25 ANEF zone. The scope of eligibility for this program is at least equal to that at any major overseas airport where a noise amelioration program is in place. It is the government's intention that the announced program be completed within a three-year period. This, again, compares favourably with the rate of implementation of overseas programs. Based on indicative cost data developed in conjunction with the draft noise management plan, the cost of the program was originally estimated at some $183 million. Following a reassessment of eligible buildings and the scope and cost of required works, the estimated overall cost of the program is now $260 million, in 1995-96 prices. Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1661 The airlines and their passengers will be the beneficiaries of the increased runway capacity created at Sydney airport. It follows that they should be required to meet the cost of reducing the noise impacts on the affected communities in the vicinity of the airport. The levy which this bill seeks to impose will provide the mea-s for giving effect to this principle. The bill provides that the levy will apply only at declared airports, which are those where the following conditions apply: · there are residences or public buildings in noise affected areas (as defined by ANEF contours) around the airport, · there is or has been a federal government funded airport noise amelioration program in place, and · the amount of levy collected at a given time is not in excess of the costs to the federal government of the noise amelioration program. The levy will apply, in the first instance, to Sydney airport only. This recognises the very significant change in noise patterns around the airport which results from the opening of the new runway. The government similarly expects that, where new runway developments or extensions enabling a significant change in either the number or type of jet aircraft usages occur at other major airports, the need for noise amelioration programs will also arise. Honourable members will be aware that the government has embarked on a program of leasing federal airports. As part of the next stage of the disposal process, the government will examine how best to ensure responsible environmental behaviour by users and operators of leased airports. Prospective airport operators will clearly have an interest in the development of environmental management measures, including noise amelioration, which may be warranted by significant runway works and changes in operations at the airports which they will be leasing. These leases will, therefore, be addressed in the context of the airport leasing program which will see the first of our major federal airports leased in 1996. Turning to the levy itself, the amount of levy payable per jet aircraft landing will be determined according to a formula developed as part of the Sydney airport draft noise management plan. The formula provides that the noisier an aircraft the higher will be the rate of levy payable per landing. For example, the amount of levy payable for a landing by a Boeing 747 will be some three to four times higher than for a Boeing 737, depending on the specific noise characteristics of the particular aircraft. The bill provides for the levy to apply to landings by jet aircraft only. This retlects the fact that generally jet aircraft create greater noise disturbance than propeller driven aircraft. There will be some quiet small jet aircraft which are not liable for the levy. It is a requirement of the bill that revenue from the levy at a particular declared airport not exceed the cost of the noise amelioration program at that airport. To spread the cost impact on airlines, it is not envisaged that the levy will necessarily be raised at a rate which keeps pace with spending on the noise amelioration program. The levy rate will be prescribed by regulations subject to the limitations established in the bill. It is proposed that there will be automatic annual adjustments of the levy rates in line with consumer price index movements. The rate will also be periodically reviewed in the light of other parameters, such as growth rates in jet aircraft landings and the cost of noise. amelioration programs that might be established at any other airports. MC 1662 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 It is the government's intention that the rate of levy be initially set at an amount of $155 per noise unit. This rate will be adjusted as necessary so as to enable the cost of the Sydney airport noise amelioration program to be recovered over a period of up to 10 years.· In 1995-96 it is expected that the levy will raise some $32.2 million. This translates to an average cost per jet aircraft passenger landing at Sydney airport of around $3.40. This is a landmark bill. It establishes a regime for recovering from aviation operators the costs of redressing the adverse impact of aircraft noise imposed on communities in the vicinity of airports, immediately in the case of Sydney airport and at other Australian airports in future years. In respect of the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill, the purpose of this bill is to establish a collection regime for the levy imposed by the complementary Aircraft Noise Levy Bill. The levy collection bill specifies in detail by whom, in what circumstances, and when and how the levy is payable. It also covers penalty and enforceinent arrangements and provides the necessary powers to allow the levy to be collected by a Commonwealth authority. It is proposed that the Civil Aviation Authority, or Airservices Australia when it is established, will perform this role. Since the processes for collection of the noise levy readily dovetail with the authority'S own revenue collection activities based on aircraft landings, it is expected that this arrangement will minimise administrative costs associated with the collection of the levy. I commend both bills to the House. That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House condemns the Government for its callous and incompetent policy on Sydney Airport, and condemns it in particular: (a) for its decision effectively to close the east west runway; (b) for misleading the people of Sydney about the noise that would be associated with the opening of the parallel runway; and (c) for its failure to develop adequate noise management measures prior to the opening of the parallel runway, rather than after it opened in a belated response to community pressure"". I rise on behalf of Senator Parer-who is our shadow minister for aviation and who has responsibility for carriage of this bill through the Senate-and, indeed, on behalf of the opposition generally. I take this opportunity to move my first amendment; I will be moving a second amendment relating to the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill at a later time, when we deal with the bill in detail. This amendment probably bests expresses the views held by many people in Sydney today about the disaster that has been over their heads every day of the year since the opening of the third runway-or the second parallel runway-at Sydney's Mascot airport. I do not think there is a soul living in Sydney-nor, indeed, in New South Wales-who would not be affected by the concerns which these people in Sydney have been drawing to our attention as a consequence of the dramatic increase in noise over the heads of many thousands of people in Sydney since the second parallel runway was opened in the latter months of last year. We have seen on television, right across the nation, demonstrations being lead by community leaders in Sydney-demonstrations complaining about the poor management of aircraft noise as a consequence of the opening of the second parallel runway, and demonstrations about the",159,Representatives Main Committee
309,Mr Sharp (Hume) (1.25 P.m.),"I move:Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1663 lies and deceit concerning the effects of the opening of the second parallel runway that have been given to the people of Sydney by this government. It is amazing to think that it was not until after the second parallel runway was opened by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) late last year that people became aware of the noise patterns that were to be created by the opening of that new runway and the effect that those noise patterns would have on the lives of Sydneysiders. People were not properly informed about the amount of noise and the places that that noise would impact upon throughout Sydney. As a consequence, some hundreds of thousands of people are adversely affected. I know the government drags out a figure of around 110,000 or 120,000 people affected by the second parallel runway. But figures have been put to me in recent days that indicate that some 600,000 people have been adversely affected by the second parallel runway's being opened late last year. I do not live in Sydney, but I live in a regional area outside of Sydney. I have relatives and friends who live in Sydney. When I go there, it is the topic of conversation that those people first raise with me. It is absolutely amazing to evaluate the impact that this has had on the lives of ordinary citizens living in Sydney. The thing that outrages them more than anything else is the fact that the people of Sydney were not adequately informed about the impact that this noise would have on them and the areas that this noise would impact upon. They believe-and we, in the opposition, agree with them-that they were lied to and were not provided with adequate information. I think there would be many people, not just on this side of the House but also on the other side of the House, who would agree that the proper information that should have been provided by the government was not provided to people in Sydney. It is for that reason that so many people are upset-upset because they were not properly informed but were lied to, and upset because for the first time in their lives they now have aircraft noise right over their heads, at levels that nobody had ever envisaged. It is for that reason that we have seen those demonstrations, which continue to this day and, I dare say, will continue beyond today despite the passage of this legislation through our parliament. The reason why I suspect there will be further demonstrations is exhibited on the front page of today's Sydney Morning Herald, which publishes a very timely leak to the newspaper detailing the government's proposals to further expand Sydney airport. That will ultimately increase the operations at Sydney airport and ultimately increase the noise over the heads of people living in Sydney. This will further fire up demonstrations of concern by people in Sydney because yet again the government, through the Federal Airports Corporation and, indeed, the Civil Aviation Authority, is not telling the people of Sydney the truth about the second parallel runway. While I speak about not telling the truth about the second parallel runway, I might make the point also that the government is not telling the truth about its decision to close the eastwest runway. Sydney has had a north-south, east-west runway operation at Mascot airport for as long as people can remember. The east-west runway was closed with the opening of the second parallel runway late last year. One of the reasons people are so upset is that, with the closure of the east-west runway, people who have bought their houses and lived their lives with the expectation that they will have aircraft noise over their heads and have paid a priceMr Leo McLeay-Absolute rubbish.

The people of Sydney know this. It has even been reported in a book. I do not need to mention any names because it has become folklore in parts of Sydney as to the reasons for this. It has been put by the government, and by the minister in particular, that, in addition to those reasons outlined by the honourable member for Watson, the closure is for safety reasons. It is said that we cannot have an intersecting runway operation at Sydney airport now that we have a second parallel runway. That is pure bunkum. We have lived with intersecting runway operations at Sydney airport for as long as anybody can remember. Major airports around the world, bigger than Sydney's Mascot airport, some of the biggest airports in the world-indeed, the biggest airport in the world-have intersecting runway operations as part of their normal runway operations. They manage to operate those safely, efficiently and effectively. The net consequence of closing the east-west runway has concentrated a great deal of noise over a substantial part of Sydney that never expected it. That is why people are fired up in Sydney. That is why they are arguing against the government. That is why they are making accusations that the government did not inform them adequately. That is why they are having demonstrations. As I was saying a moment ago, I expect that there will be more demonstrations because a report in today's Sydney Morning Herald says that there are plans to expand the Mascot operations through the addition of a number of buildings to increase the capacity of Mascot airport in the near future. The government has not told us much about that, just as it has not told us much about the new control tower at Mascot airport. The new control tower was supposed to open before the New South Wales election: It was conveniently delayed until Easter. Due to some technical failure, which we have become used to when talking about operations managed by the Civil Aviation Authority, the control tower is still not in operation. Mr Buck Brooksbank, the acting chief executive officer of the Civil Aviation Authority, says that nobody can give a date for when the control tower will be in operation and therefore able to alleviate some of the problems that we have been told it will alleviate. So Sydneysiders will have to live with these problems for longer than they were told they would prior to the New South Wales election. I believe that Sydneysiders will be living with these problems for longer than this government is prepared to admit, because this government is relying heavily upon its so-called fast-tracking of the Badgerys Creek airport-the Sydney West airport, as it is called. The government says, 'Do not worry, we'll solve these problems for you. Vote for us at the next election because we have got the formula to reduce the noise over Sydney by fast-tracking the construction of Badgerys Creek airport.'

320,Mr Sharp,"Mr Deputy Speaker, it was a deal, and it was struck for political purposesMC 1666 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 airport is the talk. We are getting a lot of fast talking from the Minister for Transport ( Mr Brereton) and a lot of slow tracking on Badgerys Creek. Years after this government promised that Badgerys Creek airport would be opened, we still have not seen anything happen out at Badgerys Creek. There has been a steady march of transport ministers since this government came into office in 1983. Over that time, various transport ministers or ministers for aviation have made specific predictions about the completion of Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek. The last minister before the current minister, Senator Bob Collins, made a specific commitment as to the completion date of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. That date passed by long ago. Yet this government, the present minister and the Prime Minister are asking the people of Sydney to believe their current speculations about the opening of Sydney West airport within the next few years. On the basis of its track record on Badgerys Creek airport, the government cannot be believed. I believe the only thing that is happening at Sydney West airport is some fast talking and not much action. We are going to find that the people of Sydney will be bothered by these noise problems for a lot longer than the government is prepared to admit. My colleague Senator Parer provided me with some information that was revealed by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority in its report on aircraft noise. The Environment Protection Authority concluded that many suburbs, including Kurnell, Bundeena and Rozelle, were experiencing annoyingly high levels of aircraft noise, despite the claim in the noise management plan that they would not be affected. In one street the noise level exceeded 80 decibels 26 times an hour and the residents living in that street do not qualify for the insulation program, despite the Australian standard that noise levels in homes should not exceed 60 decibels. That points to the fact that the bill does not deal adequately with the problems of noise for many thousands of Sydneysiders. Even for those Sydneysiders who do qualify for soundproofing of their buildings, schools and homes, this will not resolve all the problems. There have been some 3,000 submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney. Many of the submissions, which were made by 3,000 residents, are very sceptical about the soundproofing program. For example, one of them said that the recommendation to soundproof buildings and schools is only a partial solution, and that Sydney's mild climate lends itself to outdoor living. What happens when people or children move outside? Do they have insulated space helmets? This is not going to completely solve the problem of aircraft noise for Sydneysiders. At best, it will only partially solve the problem for some of the people who are affected by noise levels from Sydney airport and as a consequence of the second parallel runway being open. I thank my colleague the honourable member for Fadden( Mr Jull) for pointing out to me the other day that there are some rather unusual discrepancies in the way in which the levy for particular aircraft is going to work. He makes the point that the levy actually penalises the quietest jets at the expense of not penalising the noisiest jets as much. For example, a BAe146 will have a levy that is the equivalent of $5.17 per passenger, whereas a 747-400 will have a levy of $3.67 per passenger. Anybody who knows anything about aircraft will tell people that a BAe146 is probably the quietest commercial jet aircraft operating in and out of Sydney at the present time. IfI were a resident of Sydney concerned about noise levels, I would want to ensure that the government was doing its utmost to encourage the use of the quietest possible aircraft, given that Sydney Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1667 airport is going to be a reality for many years. Indeed, the levy on the quietest jet aircraft, that is, the BAe146, is the highest of all the jet passenger aircraft that operate into Sydney's airport. The honourable member for Fadden will go on and explain that in far greater detail in his speech later today, but it is rather inconsistent to be doing it in this fashion. As I say; if! were a resident of Sydney with aircraft roaring over my head, I would want to be encouraging the use of the BAe146 by having either no levy imposed or at least the lightest levy per passenger imposed on that type of aircraft rather than the opposite, which is the way the government has done it. The bill reflects the failure of the government to adequately manage the air traffic noise over Sydney airport. There has been very poor planning in the way in which the government has been developing its air traffic noise management proposals. For example, the original plan was to take 10 years to provide insulation for homes in Sydney that are severely affected by aircraft noise as a result of the second parallel runway. WhilstI am talking about insulation, I will make a little plug for my constituents, who are wool producers. Wool is one of the best forms of sound insulation available today. There is a gentleman in Goulburn who is going to insulate, free of charge, a number of houses-I think one of them is in Rozelle. Some of them might be in the electorate of the honourable member for WatsonMr Leo McLeay-It is nowhere near us. M.r SHARP-I know Rozelle is nowhere near you, but that gentleman will be working in a number of suburbs around Sydney-one of which I hope will be in the honourable member for Watson's electorate-because he is convinced, as are many people, that wool is one of the. most effective sound insulation materials available. I would urge the FAC, and anyone responsible for these insulation programs, to take into account the value of wool. It is extremely valuable in controlling and minimising the effects of noise. There are many concerns raised by Sydneysiders, which are not adequately dealt with in this legislation. The government's propaganda about fast-tracking Badgerys Creek does not fool too many people. Its propaganda about narrowing the flight paths and introducing heavy penalties for those people who breach those flight paths is not going to solve the problem. People know that pilots go where they are told to go. Air traffic control tells the pilots to take a particular heading and to follow a particular track. The trumpeting by the minister, late last year and early this year, of his method of solving the aircraft noise problems over Sydney by having heavy fines for pilots who do not adhere to those flight paths, is going to do very little indeed to solve the problems of aircraft noise resulting from the expansion of Sydney's Mascot airport. It is an issue of considerable concern. My colleague in the Senate Senator Parer, our shadow minister for aviation, will be making very strong representations in the Senate on this issue. I know other members in this House will also be making representations to try to do their best to bring some honesty and openness into the way in which this government deals with the people of Sydney over the aircraft noise problem. I can tell the House-as would the honourable member for Watson, who represents many people in Sydney-that this problem is destroying the lives of people in Sydney. The noise is incredible. I have actually been to some of these places, where the aircraft noise rattles the houses. My mother-in-law lives out in Castle Hill. That might seem a long way from Sydney's airport. Yet, for the first time ever, aircraft are flying over her house and destroying the lifestyle of the people living out there. MC 1668 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 This problem is affecting a very wide area of Sydney, previously never affected by aircraft noise. The people in those areas have a just argument; they bought or built their houses on the basis that they were not under a flight path. They paid prices for their houses that reflected the fact that those parts of Sydney were supposed to be quiet areas. Consequently, the value of their homes has been reduced. All Sydney's federal parliamentary representatives have to be very pro-active on this issue. I hope that they will be. They certainly should be, if they are to represent the interests of their constituents to the best of their abilities . The opposition calls on the government to be open and honest about what is going to happen at Sydney airport; to provide the public with the full details of this latest expansion proposal as revealed in the Sydney Morning Herald today; to provide the public with the truth about what is happening at Badgerys Creek airport because we are not getting the truth on that; to provide the public with the truth about the noise contours over Sydney; to provide the public with the truth as to the actual numbers of people who are affected by this; to do everything within its power to encourage the use of the quietest possible aircraft; and to ensure that the Civil Aviation Authority-or the new Airservices Australia as it will be known after 1 July-is effective in administering the air laws in a way that minimises the impact of noise over the heads of Sydney people. I can tell members now that a lot of people are very sceptical about the way in which this government has been approaching the whole issue of airports in Sydney and at Badgerys Creek and the whole issue of noise pollution over the heads of hundreds of thousands of Sydney siders. We will not, of course, be opposing this bill. The opposition is keen to do whatever is possible to assist in minimising the impact of noise over the heads of Sydney people as a consequence of this government's actions, so we will not be opposing it. I moved our amendment earlier in my presentation this afternoon. When we deal with the bill in detail, I will be moving an additional amendment that I have yet to refer to that deals with the incremental increase in the levy. necessary because the third runway at Sydney airport, the parallel runway, should never have been built. What is even less necessary than this legislation is the second reading amendment moved by the opposition. While listening to the member for Hume( Mr Sharp), I was starting to think that I must have been living on a different planet for the last 25 years. To hear the opposition, the New South Wales National Party and Liberal Party, suggesting that, somehow or other, they had a concern for the noise that was going to be created for Sydneysiders by Sydney airport is hypocrisy on a mind-bending scale. For nearly 30 years, the New South Wales Liberal Party and the federal opposition have had a policy of a parallel runway at Sydney airport. The study that was done in the 1960s concerned a parallel runway at Sydney airport. For the last 15 years, the member for Barton( Mr Punch) and I have been making speeches wherever we could and whenever we could about the problem that was going to be caused by that parallel runway. I first got elected to public life in 1971 on the local council and my program was one of opposition to the expansion of Sydney airport as proposed by Malcolm Fraser, the former Liberal Party Prime Minister.

When he was the opposition shadow spokesman-and fortunately they got rid of him-he wanted to do away with the curfew. Maybe he is going to speak after me and say, 'No, you have got it wrong. I never wanted to d() anything to the curfew at Sydney airport.' I think he ought to reread the papers. He ought to reread what he said in those days. These people have had a policy for 30 years of doing this and then they come out and say, 'Of course, the government should open the east-west runway again.' These people are the greatest advocates of the parallel runway at. Sydney airport in this country. Every day they got up and said that the parallel runway ought to be done quickly. The member for Barton and I got up everywhere we could and said to people, 'Just be aware of what this means to you. Just be aware of the disaster that this is going to make of your lives.' But what did the New South Wales Liberals, their National Party cohorts and the crooks in the FAC say? They said, 'No, no, let's have this. Let's have it now.' Of course, if that is what the opposition wants and if that is what the opposition gets, maybe they should also have read what the EIS said, because the building of the parallel runway at Sydney airport was predicated on the downgrading of the east-west runway. That information is in the EIS that the FAC put forward. For people to say, 'Now that it has been built you have to go and reopen the east-west runway for continuous traffic,' is a duplicitous joke that these people are trying to inflict on the people of Sydney. The involvement of the New South Wales Liberals and their National Party cohorts was revealed in the Sydney Morning Herald of 3 December 1994 when an article detailed just how involved the former Premier and his colleagues in the coalition are. Members might recall the article, which was headed 'Greiner pushed for third runway'. The article followed the release of all the New South Wales government documents on the parallel runway proposal. The New South Wales Liberals, according to the article, conducted a comprehensive campaign pushing for a third Sydney runway. The documents show that the former Minister for Tourism, Mr Garry West, a colleague of the member for Hume, who just spoke, advocated the easing of the curfew, as did his colleague, the member for Fadden, who will speak next. The documents make it increasingly difficult for the government in New South Wales at the time-the Liberal government-to distance itself from any decision to build the third runway, that is, the parallel runway at Sydney airport. Indeed, it has since been revealed that the Liberals even hired a PR firm to run their campaign for them. This is one of the most scurrilous episodes in the operation of the Greiner-Fahey government.

326,. Mr Leo Mclea Y,"Concerning the member for Hume, by his deeds he will be known.MC 1670 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 supported by the federal opposition now, the Liberals ate trying to tum it around by sayil)g, 'What the federal government did is terrible.' Unfortunately, the government was overwhelmed by the media campaign which was pushed by the Liberals, the FAC and industry. As were a number of my colleagues, I am on the public record as saying that it is a mistake. I said that the government should never have done these things and that the government should never have built the parallel runway. I have also said publicly that the people in the Federal Airports Corporation are a disgrace. They have lied to. the public and misled the government. It is shown again today in the Sydney Morning Herald that the FAC is not telling people what its plans are. There has been more duplicity and dishonesty by officials in .relation to Sydney airport than in any other exercise in government in the 16 years I have been in this House. It is an ongoing saga of lies and deceit from this GBE. The FAC had the hide to say at one stage that the Minister for Transport ( Mr Brereton) ought to let the FAC bid to buy Sydney airport when the airport is privatised. That is like letting the crooks take over the treasury. The FAC set this thing up, and now it wants. the management to buyout the buyer. Fortunately, the minister decided that he is not going to let that scam occur. The opposition now say, 'It's terrible. It's shocking.' The opposition say that, even though the opposition is part of the problem but not part of the solution. It is a sick joke. After all, it is people like the member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), who, all of a sudden, has discovered aircraft noise. He says, 'Isn't it terrible? Share the pain. Open the east-west runway.' Of course, when we talked about this earlier-when the proposal was that the government should build the parallel runway and when the government put forward the idea that Badgerys Creek ought to be developed quickly as an· alternate airport to Sydney airport-the member .for Bennelong and his constituents did not like it. This is because, when we look at the studies of where air travellers come from in Sydney, we find a great little concentration of air travellers in the electorate of Bennelong. Travellers from this area do not want to spend a bit of time travelling out to the western suburbs of Sydney to catch their aeroplanes, and they say, 'Oh, it's inconvenient to have to do that.' I say to them that there is no point in their saying that it is inconvenient to travel that far, just asthere is no point in their saying now how inconvenient it is that the poor old real estate prices have fallen and that it is inconvenient to have the planes flying over their heads. As I said earlier, these people are part of the problem, never part of the solution. What we are hearing now is something which is an unfortunate latter-day conversion on the road to Sydney or Badgerys Creek, depending upon how people want to -look at it. If only the opposition-and, indeed, the government-had been able to look at this a bit more carefully. If only members of parliament from all parties had not just been belly-aching and whingeing about how terrible it was that they had to spend 10 minutes circling Sydney airport on Friday afternoon on the way home from parliament, and how awful it was and how we had to get this parallel runway up. They were conned by the FAC that that was going to solve their problem, and they were conned by the airlines. One of the great little hypocritical stories in this is that now we hear the bleatings from Qantas, our so-called wonderful national carrier. These are the people who never did any planning for what they did at Sydney airport, and all they want to do now is Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1671 belly-ache about how terrible it is that the previous Liberal government gave Ansett all the land leases and that they do not have anything there. Yet they have the hide to say that if the government had done some earlier planning about Badgerys Creek then we would not have the problem at Sydney airport. Qantas did not do all that much planning, either. Qantas has not got any land, and its management is in the paper today saying they might have a plan to move their maintenance facility to Brisbane or to Melbourne because the government did not do something. It is the stupidity of the Qantas management in getting into bed with the Federal Airports Corporation and with Ansett in saying the solution to Sydney's airport needs was at Sydney airport with the parallel runway, rather than looking at what happened everywhere else in the world. Everywhere else, there are big airports out on the city rim and smaller airports close to the city, like Kingsford Smith is in Sydney. The reality of this is that the lives of tens of thousands of people in Sydney have been destroyed, and they have been destroyed by politicians on both sides of this House who were short-sighted. They have been destroyed, in particular, by the duplicity and the lying and the dishonesty of the Federal Airports Corporation, the government's own GBE, which allowed these things to happen and did not inform ministers or the public of what it was up to. Its program was always to build everything it possibly could at Sydney airport; and it was aided and abetted by the airlines, which said that the last thing they wanted to do was to move out to Badgerys Creek. James Strong, who allegedly works for the government as the head of a government GBE, says that Qantas's solution to Sydney airport is that everyone else ought to move out. We should get the commuters out of there, and get the charter operators out of there. Essentially, Sydney airport-Kingsford Smith airport-should become Kingsford Smith (Qantas) airport, and everyone else should go out to Badgerys Creek. The reality is that this legislation will provide some funds so that the problem can be ameliorated. The people who are using the aircraft will pay some money towards trying to ameliorate some of the noise pollution that is hitting the tens of thousands of people who live around Sydney airport-many of whom I represent now, and a great deal more of whom I represented when I was the member for Grayndler. There are very few people in this House who have clean hands on this issue. The member for Barton, the member for Grayndler (Ms McHugh), the member for Sydney( Mr Baldwin), the minister and I are a few of the ones who have, because we stood up and said how crook this thing was. At least the people who are going to cause the noise are going to have to pay for some of it now, and I think that is a fair thing. To my mind, one of the few ministers in this country who have actually had some thought about the people who lived around the airport has been the federal transport minister. One of the others was the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). They at least had a concern for the effect that this monstrosity was going to have on the people who lived around the airport. All the other beIly-aching MPs from both sides would come back here on Tuesday mornings and tell me, 'We had to queue up at Sydney airport again on Friday night. Isn't it terrible?' Bad luck. Isn't it terrible that we have inconvenienced some of them? They aU lobbied and went mad down here. The people who live in Marrickville, where I grew up, are actually going mad-literaIly going mad over this. They have these planes day and night. There are some people in the MC 1672 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 opposition who say that is not enough, we have to open it up for 24-hour operations. The government is not going to do that. The EIS was predicated on not reopening the east-west runway for continual traffic, and at least what this levy will do is ensure that part of the problem funds part of the solution. I might sound a little passionate about this, but I do believe that there has been a terrible injustice perpetrated in Sydney. A vast part of the greatest city in this country-indeed, one of the great cities in the world-has been destroyed by this parallel runway set-up at Sydney airport. I am truly of the belief that, if the Federal Airports Corporation had been open and had not concealed the truth about the effect this would have on the people of Sydney, no government would ever have built this monstrosity. But the truth did not come out until after it was done, and no-one is going to say to a government, 'You spent some billions of dollars on this proposal and you have to pull it up.' Where is the FAC now? It is where its plan always was: increase the capital structure and no-one will be able to do anything about it. While the government is saying it wants to try to move traffic out to Badgerys Creek, what is the good old FAC doing? It had plans leaked today. Of course, you cannot believe all that you read in the Sydney Morning Herald, but on some of these issues it has been right. If it is to be believed, the FAC has another plan to spend another $500 million at Sydney airport. This will make it absolutely impossible, when the Olympics come around, for anyone to sustain an argument that says, 'Do not do away with the curfew.' Some of the things that have been done in this business verge on the criminal. The effect it has had on the lives of the people in my electorate verges on the obscene. I think at least this will help them a bit. It is not going to help them much, but at least the minister has got to the stage where he is trying to do something for the people who are affected by the airport. Now we have the opposition saying, 'Isn't this terrible? The government should never have done it.' Crikey, this is the greatest case of amnesia I have witnessed in my life! My dear friend the member for Cowper( Mr Nehl), from the north coast of New South Wales, was in favour of this proposal because he wanted to do the best thing for his constituents. He wanted commuter airlines to be able to fly into Sydney airport. When he travels on Qantas next time, he ought to find out from James Strong what his plan is for the commuters from his electorate, because his plan is to get rid of them-they are a nuisance, so get rid of them. This whole scam has been run by the FAC for the two big airlines and a whole lot of other people have been sucked into it-some for good intentions, like country members, and others, like John Fahey and Nick Greiner, for their own political reasons. I think that everyone ought to very closely scrutinise anything that goes on at Sydney airport in the future, because the one thing to look back on is that what the member for Barton and I said is true. What we said would happen has happened. Everyone said at the time that we were misguided scaremongers. We were probably conservative, because it has turned out to be even worse than we thought. It was pretty hard to find anyone who thought worse than this for the last 10 years than the member for Barton and I. On that note I might finish. I commend the legislation to the House and I would suggest to all members that they very carefully scrutinise anything that goes on at Sydney airport. WhatI have said is not an attack on the minister, who I think has done more than anyone else to try to alleviate the suffering of the people around the airport, it is not even an attack on previous transport ministers on either side of the House, but it certainly is an attack on the Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1673 government's advisers. The FAC knew and it kept quiet, because it was an organisation that had been captured by its client group, the airline industry. honourable member for Watson( Mr Leo McLeay) with which I agree and which I will expand on in terms of the future of this particular piece of legislation. There are other aspects, of course, where he was right out. I categorically deny that I ever mentioned lifting a curfew on Sydney airport. I think the honourable member will find that that was a ploy that was leaked by a Labor Party operative who misquoted a letter that I once wrote to him regarding the future of aircraft noise. I was pointing out in that letter that aircraft were getting quieter and quieter and that by about the year 2025 we may not have conventional aircraft, as such, operating. That aside, the opposition is not going to oppose the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill 1995. I have a great deal of sympathy with what the member for Watson said in terms of some of the information that was given out regarding the effects of the opening of that third runway. This is but a very small way of trying to amend that particular situation. I want to give the honourable member for Watson some advice so that he can go in with his minister now and start getting things right for Badgerys Creek. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a major airport being on the edge of town, which Sydney West will be. The secret to the success of that particular airport will be the infrastructure, and the provision of fast and rapid transport to get in and out. Let us look at some of the major airports being developed now around the world. The Denver international airport, which opened a few months ago, is about 52 miles out of the city and it has plans for a high speed rail link. More importantly, I suggest that the honourable member for Watson have a look at Stansted Airport in the UK which is coming on stream as London's No.3 airport. It is interesting in that Stansted is an identical distance from the middle of London as Badgerys Creek is from the middle of Sydney. With the British Rail link that operates there, it is possible to get from Stansted to Liverpool Street Station, in the heart of London, in 42 minutes. Now, that is not a bad trip. Quite often, especially in the morning periods, it is almost impossible to get from Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport to the centre of the city in 42 minutes. The secret to it is that infrastructure: it has got to be high speed and it has probably got to be high speed rail. I was almost going to use an expression which would be politically unacceptable when saying that we can talk a lot about the development of Sydney West airport but, until such time as we get the infrastructure in place, we are not going to maximise the potential of that particular airport. There is no doubt that with the development of traffic coming into Australia, and into Sydney in particular, there will be a need for two airports. The reality is that about 62 per cent of the total air traffic in and out of Australia is going to use Sydney either for arrival or departure. With the expansion of airline services to Australia, and with things such as the Olympic Games coming up, there is no doubt that we will require those two facilities. It must be done properly this time so that, hopefully, we will never again see the situation that has developed in Sydney. This particular legislation is very much about Sydney airport. We heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport ( Mr O'Keefe) say in his second reading speech today that we have to have declared airports before these formulae for noise alleviation come into play. I would like to inform the government that there are a number of airports that will have",169,Representatives Main Committee
327,Mr Jull (Fadden) (2.11 P.m.),"There are some aspects of the contribution made by theMC 1674 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 to be declared in a hurry. If we are to look at the noise problems around Australia, may I suggest that the officials responsible have a very quick look at the approach path to Coolangatta. I am sure the honourable member for McPherson( Mr Bradford) will be talking about that a little later. I would also like to expose what has been happening in terms of Brisbane airport. What the honourable member for Watson was saying about government advisers is really quite interesting. There has been quite a lobby group on the south side of Brisbane for many years now who complained about aircraft noise when the new international airport in Brisbane opened in 1988. Seven years later there are still problems. As we see in this bill, there is a specific formula for determining what constitutes a badly noise affected area that would then allow people and institutions to take advantage of the bill. The magic figure is 60 decibels which, in technical terms, applies to 25 ANEFs. This particular group in Brisbane has been advised by Dr R.V. Dubs, the general manager of planning and development in the Civil Aviation Authority, that, as far as it is concerned, it would appear that Brisbane does not have these problems and that there are not any areas in the flight paths that would qualify for this sort of assistance. The reality is that there have been a number of studies done on noise exposure distribution in Brisbane, and it is quite interesting when the facts come to light. I would like to quote, as a couple of examples, studies that were done in April and June of last year in two very badly affected areas-namely, around the Tingalpa school and also at Cannon Hill. I would want to place particular emphasis on Cannon Hill because it is proposed to develop the area there that once contained the Brisbane abattoir by building something like 12,000 new dwellings. The Queensland state government and the Brisbane City Council seem to be pretty anxious to have 12,000 new dwellings put on that particular space. But the interesting thing about that particular location at Cannon Hill is that a noise monitor has been put nearby. In a particular period, from April to June last year, some very interesting figures came through. During that period there were 3,037 aircraft movements in that region. Of these 3,037 aircraft movements, no fewer than 2,857 of them registered above the 70 decibel mark-between 70 and 90 decibels. If the Queensland government is going to proceed with that housing development of 12,000 new dwellings, somebody is going to have a problem in terms of providing the insulation and the noise reduction facilities there. About 61.5 per cent of the traffic at that time actually broke the legal limit and, of course, while that is referring particularly to that new development site, Cannon Hill is one of those areas which are badly affected by aircraft noise. The second study was done at the Tingalpa state school, and bear in mind the CAA says that there are no areas that actually qualify for any of this assistance under its formula. In that period, from April to June last year, at the Tingalpa state school there were 4,249 movements of which 2,447 were registered as being above 70 decibels, or 56.5 per cent of the total. At this stage, this legislation is designed strictly for Sydney, but the reality has to be faced that places such as the south side of Brisbane have some real problems. Of course, one of the reasons that the CAA says that there are no problems in Brisbane is that aeroplanes are supposed to follow their designated flight paths. The official CAA map is really quite interesting because it shows where those aircraft should go. In fact, there is a noise monitoring facility at Princess Street in Morningside and another one at Tingalpa. There are some on the north side. But it is true that it is not uncommon for aeroplanes approaching Thursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1675 Brisbane, especially from the north, to be two or three kilometres away from their designated flight paths. In the very area where I live it is quite interesting because the southerly flight path is a couple of kilometres away from my home and I have watched those aircraft approach. There is a flight path that comes in from New Zealand over the Redland Bay beacon and I can watch that. They are the designated flight paths, but an awful lot of aeroplanes fly straight over the top of our place. That does not particularly worry me. I quite enjoy it, actually. I set up my monitor and I listen to what is happening in the Brisbane tower. I can tell honourable members that a heck of a lot can be learned about the operation of the Civil Aviation Authority by monitoring some of those conversations. As I have said, in a personal sense, I have got no vested interest in this. But the reality is that these aeroplanes do stray from their official flight paths. In terms of that area on the south side of Brisbane-through Balmoral Heights and Cannon Hill and down through Tingalpa to the Seven Hills area-people have a real problem. The government has duckshoved this for a number of years, and has denied that there is a problem there. My estimate is that we will probably see nothing whatsoever done about it. I have mentioned Coolangatta, and there are other airports around Australia which have these problems. I hope some people are not going to get their hopes up too much when they read that this legislation is in play, because this legislation provides only for jet aircraft, yet there are many airports that receive incredible amounts of noise from non-jet aircraft. The people of Moorabbin and surrounding places are not going to get any benefit from this particular legislation. One could look at Archerfield, in Brisbane. Any member on the south side of Brisbane will talk about the phone calls he gets-at 4 o'clock in the morning, at home-from the residents of Salisbury or Oxley because the propeller driven freighters are going over at 4 o'clock in the morning and blasting everybody out of their beds. Those people are not going to get any relief from this particular legislation, because we are only covering jet aircraft. Like my colleague the honourable member for Hume( Mr Sharp), I get a bit cynical about this, because the passengers who are going to be hit more than anybody else are the poor devils flying on the BAe146, one of the 'quietest aircraft in the skies. Are honourable members aware that we are so good that Australia is the only country in the world that has any curfew on the BAe146 whatsoever? Australia is the only country in the world that has any restrictions on this. The BAe146 happily flies around freight services during all hours of the day and night in Europe, with no restrictions whatsoever. But we come in here and we slam every passenger on the BAe146 $5.17 per head, on average. I really wonder. I know there are supposed to be provisions here to ensure that there is going to be no major profit made by the authorities from this particular operation. But I really wonder why that BAe146 crept in here. In fact, I would have thought that they might have been given a bit more encouragement than, say, the Boeing 727, which is still operated by Ansett. When the honourable member for Watson. and J started talking about aircraft noise in Sydney, the real argument, to a very great extent, has been about the fact that the 727 is still operating over some of those areas. It is a very rowdy aircraft. The two aircraft that probably cause more concern than most-they certainly do on the south side of Brisbane-are the Fokker F28 and the Boeing 727, which are old aircraft. The F28, apparently,. is going out of service. Ansett was suggesting that we were going to see the demise MC 1676 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 of the 727 from its fleet late last year. There are now suggestions that the 727 could be flying well into the next century. Unless they are hush-kitted, we are going to have some enormous problems there. But the fact that the BAe146 has got the big slam really makes me quite amused. The real worry is that this particular legislation is not going to cover a number of other people around Australia who have some real difficulties in terms of aircraft noise. I would hope that the government would prove to be quite genuine in providing for the people of Sydney, who have got their own specific problems, and genuine in terms of the people who live in the flight path of the Coolangatta airport or on the south side of Brisbane. I hope the government will be genuine for the people at Archerfield, Moorabbin or Bankstown, and make sure that all those who are badly affected by aircraft noise do get some sort of compensation. Most importantly, let us hope that there is some honesty, and that the officials who are responsible for these things do not try to ducks hove some of the noise readings and some of the formulas that they use. Let us make sure they get out there amongst the real people who are experiencing these noises. Let us make sure they put their monitoring services underneath the actual flight paths instead of the theoretical flight paths, and let us try to get some justice for the great number of people who are being very deeply affected by aircraft noise. impose a levy on the landing of jet aircraft at certain airports. At the moment, this policy is directed at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. The purpose of this levy is to attempt to introduce some financially based discipline on the use of Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. Currently, the residents of the inner city and certain northern suburbs of Sydney are sorely punished by the operations of this airport. The opening of the third runway has not proved to be an improvement. The situation is now worse and residents of my electorate and those of Sydney, Grayndler and Bennelong demand that this parliament do something definite to ameliorate their suffering. Hopefully, this levy will go some way towards controlling the noise and take-off pattern of jet aircraft into and out of KSA. There are two bills to deal with on this matter-the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill 1995-and I will consider these together. In connection with these bills, I would also like to comment on the woeful situation that has brought about the requirement for this levy. Given the financial commitment, both public and private, and the current standards of the infrastructure at Sydney airport, it is patently obvious that this facility will remain in operation for many years to come. I think that the calls to close Sydney airport at this stage are wide of the mark. It is also clear, given the above premise, that airctaft operations will affect a substantial number of Sydney residents and these residents require, on health and public amenity grounds, the insulation of premises, reduction of engine noise and rigorous control of the flight paths. In reducing the rate of growth at Sydney airport, the government has no option but to press ahead with a second airport at Sydney West. Our tourism industry cannot be curtailed. It is our biggest export earner and the Sydney Olympics is staring us in the face. Knowing this, the government has committed substantial funds to the new airport. The May 1995 federal budget contained a commitment to provide $610 million additional funding for the accelerated development of Sydney West· airport by 1999. This budget allocation means a total funding commitment by the government of $762 million for the site development and -infrastructure.",173,Representatives Main Committee
328,Mrs Easson (Lowe) (2.25 P.m.),"The Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 is for an act toThursday, 8 June 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 1677 This is excellent news but, again, I emphasise that, as of today, no concrete has been poured so, although Sydney West airport will provide some solace in the years ahead to my constituents, what about the immediate future of the next four years? As for the suffering of residents due to the current operation of Sydney airport, I do acknowledge the decision of the federal government to approve $183.4 million over the next 10 years aimed at reducing the impact of aircraft noise on residents living around Sydney airport. This program was announced as costing $183.4 million in November 1994, as estimated by the FAC consultants. Following the extension of the coverage of the program and more detailed costings, the estimated costs have now increased by $76.6 million to $260 million. The major reasons for the increase in these costs estimated by the FAC consultants are: additional buildings identified for treatment within the previously announced categories and assistant areas; outcome of more detailed assessment of work required, particularly for air-conditioning, structural reinforcement and electrical work in schools and colleges; an upward movement in external noise levels to more clearly reflect the actual measured aircraft noise and resultant upwards adjustment in the level of sound treatment required; cost estimates for preliminary design documentation; and the project management not included in the earlier estimates. The government announced the immediate commencement of the schools installation program with completion targeted for the end of the first term of this year but the state, Catholic and other school administrations have subsequently expressed a preference for a staged approach to noise treatment so that the schools experience minimum disruption to educational activities. The eligible schools in my electorate of Lowe are Drummoyne public school and St Marks Catholic school in Drummoyne. Child-care facilities will also eventually be eligible. These will include Drummoyne Occasional Child Care Centre, College Street Child Care Centre, Drummoyne municipal preschool and Drummoyne Baptist preschool. The following churches and other places of worship will also eventually be eligible: Drummoyne Baptist Church, Drummoyne Presbyterian Church, St Marks Catholic Church and Drummoyne Uniting Church. The noise amelioration measures are useful and timely and I think that much attention must be given to this question of noise as it is a major health question. The bills before us today are stated to be for the purpose of financing this noise amelioration. The financial impact statement contained in the general outline of the bills says: The rate of levy to be prescribed under the legislation will be designed to recover the costs associated with noise amelioration works currently under way in Sydney, with a target collection rate of $32.2 million in the 1995/96 financial year. I hope that this is true. My electors and the residents of Sydney would be very disappointed and angry if moneys raised by these bills were to disappear into consolidated revenue. I am not very happy to have to call into question the honesty of public officials. However, the saga of this airport and the third runway and all the associated matters have brought about a situation where a lot of Sydney residents simply do not believe the word of any official associated with this matter. This is a sad situation, but the facts of the matter do give grounds for deep suspicion. We must ensure that these bills do not end up increasing the duplicity surrounding this matter. BeforeI go on speaking on the various clauses of the bill, I want to put on the record the serious health and social issues associated with noise. Aircraft noise above a certain level is a public health risk and, since the opening of the third runway, the New South Wales health department has been collecting data on the use of medical resources by residents affected by MC 1678 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 the aircraft noise.:Morethan 70,000 people in Sydney now live withip the high noise contour area. Overseas studies have conclusively shown that aircraft noise is a serious cause of illness and the noise raises the stress level for' the very young and the very old. Medical investigations in Sydney show that areas affected by high aircraft noise have a highyr degree of arteriosclerosis, nephritis and nephrosis, and heart disease. Local general practitioners report a serious rise in insomnia, anxiety, high blood pressure and nerve ailments. The government's preferred option indealing with this problemis embodied in these biils. Frankly, I doubt whether firid will work effectively. I strongly suspect that the new community consultative committee, established by the Minister for Transport ( Mr Brereton) and chaired by Joe Riordan, will have to work very hard to monitor these prosecutions carefully, as well as the respective fines. These bills levy a payment on some jet aircraft landing at some prescribed airports. At the moment, it covers Sydney airport, but it is to be expanded with ministerial approval. The levy will represent approximately $3.40 per passenger in a jet aircraft at Sydney airport and it is intended that the levy rate will be adjusted in line with consumer price index movements. The aim will be to recover the costs associated with the program over a period of not more than 10 years. Clauses5 and 6 detail the method of calculation of the levy and stipulate that the levy shall be the same at all airports where a levy is charged. Because of the complexities of aircraft ownership-leaseholds, rentings, borrowings and all the other legal words surrounding possession and use-clause 4 of the levy collection bill boasts that it has a comprehensive definition of operator and thus identifies the person who must pay the levy. Clause6 of part 2 tells us about identifying those airports that qualify for the levy. Subclause (6) identifies the concept of ANEF. The ANEF system of noise measurement appears to be a questionable and easily manipulated one. It operates only in Australia and has been used extensively by the Civil Aviation Authority over the years. The CAA is now to be abolished by the government. Clause8 in part 3 leaves the question of actually paying the levy to be settled by regulation. I would suggest that the government not delay in issuing these regulations. I know that bureaucracy is large and deliberate and that it is invariably bad to rush things. However, I would again urge the bureaucracy and the ministry to be aware that the general public in Sydney is extremely distrustful of government in this area of civil aviation. This is a bad situation and my desire is to see the government adopt policies and regulations that actually address the aviation problems and help restore that level of trust and confidence that must exist between the people and their government. . Part4 of the levy collection bill deals with the power to gather information relevant to collecting the levy. This legislation is needed; I hope that it works. I have pointed out a few problems and perhaps I am wrong, but the bottom line is that swift and sure remedial action is needed to solve the noise problem at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport and to rapidly advance the construction of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek.
