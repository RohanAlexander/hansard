' CONSTRUCTION OF DESTROYERS. Mr O'CONNOR -According to a press report, the Minister for the Navy stated last week that, at the conclusion of the present ship-building programme for the Navy, it was intended to construct migrants to this country? four destroyers of the Daring class. Can the Minister for the Navy say when the present naval ship-building programme will be completed? How long will the new programme take to complete, and what arrangements have been made for spreading the work throughout Australia. made a statement in Sydney last week about the construction of four destroyers of the Daring class. This undertaking is in conformity with the naval plans, drawn up some time ago. The ships will be built during the next five years at Cockatoo Island dockyard and at Williamstown, in Victoria, because those are the ship-yards which normally do naval work. The Government has also prepared a plan for the construction of merchant ships, but I do not know where they are to be built. Officers of the Department of the Navy are at present overseas gathering information from the British Admiralty regarding the construction of the new destroyers. whether taxation deductions are allowed to sons and daughters who contribute toward an invalid mother or father who receives an invalid pension? If not, can the Treasurer say whether there is any section of the Income Tax Assessment Act under which relief may be obtained in cases of special hardship? Many such cases have come to my notice. in the act to cover the case of parents who are wholly maintained by sons or daughters. I will obtain details of the provision, and let the honourable member have a reply in writing. for Immigration seen the report published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph this morning stating that the Commonwealth Statistician, Dr. Roland ""Wilson, had released figures showing that last year departures from Australia exceeded arrivals by 2,384? Does this reflect the result of the Minister's efforts to attract half way through my voluminous mail I have not had time to read themorning newspapers. banking ? such protests. I shall have a look at the statement alleged to have been issued by the Commonwealth Statistician. I have no doubt that if the figures were supplied by him they are correct; and I have not the slightest doubt that the position can be satisfactorily explained to intelligent people.

27,Mr Calwell,"I propose to make ashall outline the whole position in respect of both last year and this year. The truth of the matter, basically, is that we could not get more people last year because we could not get sufficient ships; and we are confronted with the same difficulty this year. were able to leave Australia than came here. many people left these shores last yeaT because they were unable to leave Australia during the war. Thousands of evacuees were returned to their home countries, many to Great Britain and some thousands to Hong Kong, 3,000 In donesians were returned to Indonesia, 2,000 to China and Singapore and 600 to .Portuguese Timor. At the same time, 10,000 Australian brides went to the United States of America and several thousands to Great Britain. Against that, -of course, a number of British brides of Australian servicemen came to Australia. However, when the position is balanced up even the most captious critic will be satisfied that the Government has done a good job in the matter of immigration. Mirror of the 15th August last appears a tralia ? "" I replied, "" We could do with report of an interview given by the Min1,000,000 of them "". ister for Immigration upon his arrival in New York during the course of his world tour. Among other things the report statesMr Arthur Calwell, Australia's Minister for as the honourable member will appreciate. Immigration, said in New York yesterday that What the honourable member for Flinders Australia wants 1,000,000 immigrants from the United States, and he would offer £40 each does not yet perceive is that any subsidy to American ex-servicemen who would go there. paid to American immigrants will be more Is that statement correct ? If it is, where that these people will bring into this does the honourable gentleman propose to country. If we could get 1,000,000 obtain dollars to finance this expenditure, Americans here at a cost of £40,000,000 which would represent approximately to this country, they would bring to £40,000,000 ? If he proposes to pay £40 Australia something like $200,000,000 a head for American migrants, how much and that would be a very decided advandoes he propose to pay for migrants from tage at this moment. the United Kingdom? ber has correctly quoted a statement made by me when I arrived in New York on Queen Elizabeth on the 14th August following telegram from Mr Tait on last. I was asked a question about our behalf of merchants in Mackay:scheme to subsidize the fares of returned American G.I.'s and their American or vessel from Sydney appreciate your interest Australian brides, and the subsidy scheme view allocation vessel earliest possible date. if they were unmarried. Cabinet decided in May last that we should subsidize the fares of Americans who desired to come to this country. We offered them no better subsidy than we offered British people. British ex-servicemen travel to Australia under the free passage scheme. may be, it is borne by the British Government. There is no cost to the migrants. As to assisted passages, the Australian Government pays one-half, and the British Government one-half, of the difference between the fare and the £10 which the migrant is required to pay. We are anxious that as many as possible of the 10,000 Australian brides in the United States of America should return to this country with their American G.I. husbands. We are also anxious that as many good people as possible provided they are in sound health, among the allied powers should come to this country. That is government policy, and it has been carried out in its entirety, and, may I add, very successfully. The figure of 1,000,000 referred to in the newspaper article was, as it were, plucked out of the air. A pressman asked me, "" How many 1,000,000 more, than 1,000,000 fewer, than recouped by the.amount of capital Almost three months since Mackay had",13,Immigration Departures America N Ex Servioemen

Rural electrification has 'been seriously retarded in the war year, and particularly since war ended. Nineteen country electricity authorities have combined for the purpose of importing insulators from New Zealand. However, these insulators cannot be used, without three-quarter inch round steel pins. Twenty-five tons of round mild steel would enable suflicient pins to be supplied to fulfil orders from these electricity authorities whose areas cover the greater part of New South Wales. These insulators are most important foT servicing new homes as well as for assisting production, and their provision would confer benefits greatly in excess of the cost involved. grave shortage of round mild steel. This product is used for a wide variety of purposes, and it is not easy to make available to industry the full' supplies required for any particular purpose. However, I shall have the matter examined and ascertain whether anything can be done to meet the right honourable gentleman's request. Mrs. BLACKBURN -Will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping disclose the cement supply position? Is it a fact that cement is being used for much unnecessary and luxury work, and that the larger building firms are receiving supplies whilst small builders are unable to obtain their -requirements? Would it be possible to reserve the use of cement for home building exclusively until the housing need is satisfied ? the Australian Government in relation to cement is limited to the allocation of available supplies between the different States. What use is made of such supfor Post-war Reconstruction plies as they receive is entirely a matter for the State governments. It is not possible for me to allocate cement to individual industries, whether home building or any other industry. I should. say, however, that in my opinion, considering the many claims made upon them, the States are doing their utmost to allocate available supplies in the best interests of the people generally. the MOTOR VEHICLES what is the total amount of compensation paid by the Government to Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, under the Motor Vehicles Manufacture Legislation Repeal Act of 1945 ? Will the right honourable gentleman inform the House what proportion of this amount represents money actually spent by Australian Consolidated Industries Limited on the project ? repeal of certain legislation, claims were made by Australian Consolidated Industries Limited against the Government and the matter was finally referred to Mr Justice Roper of the New South Wales Supreme Court as arbitrator. It is some time since I have examined the matter, but my recollection is that the compensation fixed by Mr Justice Roper was approximately £55,000.

The honourable member committee that the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank was created in 1943, mainly to assist agriculturists and rural land-holders by financing their undertakings, thereby enabling them to become more effective producers of primary products. He desired to know how closely the Commonwealth Treasury was associated with the restrictive policy of the Commonwealth Bank in relation to loans to applicants for financial assistance through its Mortgage Bank Department. I should like to know the reasons for the refusal by the Commonwealth Bank to grant loans to primary producers especially as it is claimed by the Government and its. supporters that the trading banks do not fufi] the requirements of the community by making such advances.

If I am to refute his statements, I must give figures in support of mv contention. the honourable member desires to discuss was debated when the first item in tbe Estimates was under consideration. It cannot be debated now. ing, Mr Chairman, but I wish the committee to know that the Minister's statement was completely false, and could be refuted by quoting figures which I had hoped to present to the committee, and which I shall bring before honourable members at a later stage. In 1946, I submitted to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) a series of questions designed to elicit information as to the assistance given by the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank to farmers and other primary producers. I asked when the Mortgage Bank Department was inaugurated, and was informed that the date was the 27 th September, 1943. Thus, the department has been i i i existence for four years. I asked how many applications for loans had been made, how many had. been granted and how many rejected. I was informed that during the period of three years up to the time. I asked the questions 2,500 applications for loans had been made, of which number 936 had been declined. It is evident, therefore, that there is no free access by people in difficult financial I circumstances to the vast resources of the Commonwealth Bank, as had been claimed by Government supporters. I further asked how many persons, had been granted loans, and the total amount of the loans so granted. I was informed that the number of persons to whom loans had been granted was only 1,39S, while the total amount of loans granted was £2,924,000. I then asked how many mortgages had been taken over from private banks, how much was new business, aud how much money had been lent to pay off existing mortgages. From the answers supplied, I learned that mortgages to the value of £520,000 had been taken over from private banks, while new business represented £1,493,000. Thus, during the three years' life of the Mortgage Bank Department, the inauguration of which was hailed by Government supporters as representing the salvation of financially'distressed farmers, a paltry £520,000 worth of mortgages had been taken over from the trading banks, and only £1,493,000 worth of new business had been done, although the commitments of farmers throughout the Commonwealth run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Of course, it is inconceivable that during a period of three years any foreclosures would have taken place, and I did not ask for information on that point. However, the only other government bank in New South Wales has a long, list of foreclosures, ias is shown in the Australian Insurance and Banking Record. Thus, the borrower is not protected because he deals with a government department. He will be foreclosed just as quickly and finally as was the company at Port Kembla, to which reference was made to-day. is saying, in effect, that government banks are soundly controlled. they are condiueted by officials who have very limited authority.

90,Mr Anthony,"I am saying that,bound by Public Service regulations in oiher words, by red tape. Tbe managers of branches of government banks have not the same discretionary authority as is vested in the managers of branches ef private banks. The proof of that statement is to be found in the figures supplied to me by the Treasurer, and recorded in Hansard. I refute with all the vigour at my command the statements made last night by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I propose to refer once more to Land Sales Control, what it means to the community, and the inconvenience and loss which it occasions. Any person who applies for permission to sell property, whether a farm or a home or a city building, must obtain the consent of the delegate of the Treasurer, who is required to have the property valued by a person accredited by the Land Sales Office. This valuator must give a certificate that, in his opinion, the price at which it is proposed to sell the property does not exceed the current value as on the 10th February, 1942. ""Well, this is October, 1947. values are largely a matter of individual opinion. One person might think that a horse, or a cow, or a dress or any other piece of property is worth so much money, while another person might believe it to be worth more or less. The opinion of one valuator as to the current price of a property on the 10th February, 1942, might be altogether different from the opinion of another valuator. The only real test of value is the current market price. The Treasurer, of course, is concerned to prevent trends, but I believe the time has arrived to lift all land sales control because it is impossible to adimdnister the law. The regulations are being circumvented in all kinds of ways. It often happens that the buyer and seller sign a contract of sale at a price approved by the Treasury, and then agree among themselves that an additional amount of money is to be handed over without any contract at all, this additional amount representing the difference between the approved price and the market price. Evidence is accumulating that this is becoming a common practice, and the responsibility rests upon the Government for trying to enforce Mr Anthony. regulations which cannot, in fact, be enforced. The real value of a property is what it will fetch on the market. Both buyers and sellers recognize this, and resort to various devices to circumvent the regulations. When this is not done, a sale does not take place because the seller is not prepared to part with his property for less than the market value, while the Treasurer insists upon the application of the old formula based on the value of property as on the 10th February, 1942. In view of the relaxation of controls in Canada, in Great Britain, in South Africa and New Zealand, I believe that the time has arrived when the Government should revise its policy. It is no more possible for us to enforce an artificial set of conditions which the community is not prepared to recognize than it was possible for the Government of the United States of America to enforce prohibition. Eventually, that law had to be repealed because it was honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Therefore, it is time that the Government submitted land sales control to a close review. I maintain that property We have already had a scandal in the Land Sales Control Office in Sydney. Months before the royal commission which inquired into that administration was appointed, I raised the subject in Parliament; and I then stated that once the lid was lifted there would be an aroma that would overwhelm everybody. That has been proved to be the case, although only a fraction of the transactions handled by that administration was investigated. I have not evidence of the kind which a royal commission would inflationary require; but if a royal commission were appointed to investigate the whole of the ramifications of land sales control throughout Australia, and persons, such as presidents of real estate institutes, auctioneers, agents and solicitors who are handling these transactions every day, were enabled to come forward under protection to give evidence as to what is going on in the community, I venture to say that the Government would not be able to sustain its present attitude that it can peg values of land and property to-day at the levels ruling as at the 10th February, 1942. It is no more possible to maintain those values to-day, five years later, than it is to peg wages, or the prices of commodities, at the 1942 levels. The Prices Commissioner makes admissions every day that he must concede increases of prices of this, that and the other commodity, because existing conditions have made it impossible to peg prices at their previous levels. applies to land values. Therefore, I urge the Government to give consideration to the protests which are mounting throughout the community against these iniquitous regulations which are achieving no good purpose but are doing an inconceivable amount of harm. It is about time that the Treasurer ceased to be influenced by the placid air of Canberra. His administration would he very much benefited if he went farther afield than Bathurst Canberra. He should travel throughout the country districts, and visit the cities tion. I direct attention to the desperate of the Commonweatlh. He should get away from the Trades Hall, and mix with the people throughout the country in order to find out things for himself. To-day, he lives in the isolated and rariform of additional imports from the fied atmosphere of Canberra; and it is impossible for him to understand existing conditions while he keeps aloof from the everyday life of the people. I have never known of another Prime Minister who isolated himself to the same degree. He practically lives in two small' centres of the Commonwealth, and, consequently, is out of touch with what is happening throughout the continent. Even President Truman of the United States of America keeps personally in touch with the people in all parts of that country. Australia and the Treasurer himself would benefit if he departed a little from his present practice of isolating himself in Canberra. He is not aware of the many abuses which now exist under his administration, because he has not familiarized himself with the life of the people of this respect. For a long time he refused to country. 1 hope that before the next budget is introduced he will do something practical in recognition of what is happening in this respect in the community. --Yesterday , we listened to a speech by the honourable member for Reid( Mr the Mandated Territories and F i j i during Lang) with regard to the dollar exchange position and the action of the Government in restricting imports from the United States of America. I have always disagreed entirely with the politics of the honourable member. I believe that he did a great disservice to New South Wales when he was Premier of that State; and I do not think that he has The same observation done any service to the community. However, he has never deserted his Labour principles, and, to-day, as he sits cheek by jowl with his old friends in this chamber, he is regarded as the Gladstone of the Labour movement, the Grand Old Man of the Labour party. Yesterday, he pointed out how desperate is Great Britain's position, and. dealing with the balance of payments between that country and the United States of America, be said that there was no adverse payand ment'so far as Australia is concerned. I do not propose to argue that proposiposition in which Great Britain now finds itself and to its efforts in cutting imports from dollar countries. Only through assistance from the dominions in the dominions, and by increasing its own exports can Great Britain be enabled to overcome its dollar problem. Despite all the assurances of the Government, we in Australia are not pulling our weight in that respect. Neither are we obtaining imports from the United States of Amerioa which aire vital to the welfare of this country. Last year I addressed a series of questions to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) with respect to our gold reserves. On the basis of Australian production, imports from tbe Mandated Territories and F i j i and our exports of gold, I calculated the quantum of gold held by the Commonwealth within Australia, and I asked him what was .the correct figure in that say what the total amount of gold held in Australia was. Eventually, about May of last year, he said that the amount of gold held by the Commonwealth Bank on behalf of the Government amounted to £17,000,000 sterling. We must now take into calculation production of gold and imports of gold from the intervening period. According to a report published this morning in the",21,Department Op The Treasury
91,Mr Abbott (New England) [11.55].,"Sydney Morning Herald a spokesman for the Government has stated that in order to help the United Kingdom, South Africa has. decided bo remit to Great Britain a large proportion of its substantial gold reserves for the purpose of buying dollars. ""We have not done anything in that direction. We are sitting on our golden egg refusing to use our gold for the purchase of dollars, or for the purpose of buying from Great Britain the goods we need. Only by that means can we hope to develop our exports. At the same time we would thus helo Great Britain in its dollar problem, and also assist the British people to obtain vital consumer goods which they cannot obtain from any other country. Not only should we send our new gold production to Great Britain but we should also be prepared to emulate South Africa and throw in a considerable portion of our gold reserves to the dollar pool. Why does not this Government hand over its gold reserves to help the British Government? I suggest the reason is that, being a socialist government it has a thorough appreciation of the incompetent manner in which socialist governments are conducting their affairs throughout the world to-day, and it is fearful to make the whole of its reserves available to the British Government lest they go down the sink should the British Government not be able to right its own affairs. Australia is able to produce the cheapest coal in the world notwithstanding that the people engaged in the coal-mining industry are paid the highest wages in the world. We should develop our coal resources and export coal from Australia into the dollar areas, thus increasing the dollar pool. The honourable member is getting a long way from the Estimates before the committee. that those responsible for the development of the Blair Athol coal deposits in Queensland should export to dollar areas 1,000,000 tons of coal per annum in order to build up the dollar pool. I submit, Mr Chairman, that the question of the development, of an export market for Australian coal in dollar areas is a matter vitally connected with the estimates of the Department of the Treasury. honourable member is stretching his argument a little too far. within the last month, the Imperial Government Chair. not to interject. man and I do not like being barked at by Scotch terriers. Within the last month the British Government has paid £5 12s. a ton to the United States of America for coal delivered to Swansea and northern British ports. The cost of that coal had to be met from the dollar reserves of the Empire in which we are vitally concerned. If our coal markets had been expanded as the result of the development of open cut mining, particularly the Blair Athol field, we should, have saved the British Government the precious dollars expended on coal imported into Great Britain from America and, in addition, we could have established dollar reserves in Chile, Argentina and other countries within the dollar area. I therefore submit, with great respect, that the development of export markets for' Australian coal is vitally connected with the Estimates now under consideration. I do not propose to elaborate my remarks, however, because you, Mr Chairman, will probably rule me out of order. However, in your quiet moments, sir, I assume you will be only too pleased to read what authoritative writers have to say on this subject. On all sides in this country there is a feeling of frustration, because, as the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) abhorrent to me as is the honourable gentleman himself-thi s Government has muddled its own affairs whilst it has been busily engaged in meddling with the affairs of other peoples. Curiously enough this is the sole occasion on which I find myself in agreement with the honourable member. Whereas in 1943 there were 4,998,000 dairy cattle in Australia, the number has now diminished to 4,592,000, and there has been a consequent reduction of the production of vital exportable fats.

Continuance of the pegging of rural land values is having a disastrous effect upon stock prices throughout the country. Anybody who is associated with primary production knows that pastoral land is valued according to its carrying capacity. If the price of land is pegged, the result must be the forcing up of stock values above economic levels. This is a dangerous trend, and I believe that the sooner this control is removed the better it will be for the people of this country, and for the people of other countries who are depending upon the foodstuffs that-we produce. In the United States of America, where most war-time controls have been removed, the production of steel has reached 62,000,000 tons a year, and the output of coal is 700,000,000 tons a year out of a total world production of 1,500,000,000 tons. The United States of America, of course, does not believe in socialistic enterprise; but on its doorsteps the socialistic countries are slobbering and pleading for American private enterprise to save them from ruin. [12.15] -Some time ago, I addressed a question to the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) in his capacity as Treasurer on a matter of considerable importance to the leather industry. Subsequently, I was interviewed by officers of the Treasury, who were investigating my complaint that a surcharge of 20 per cent, was being levied by the manufacturers of leather. The Treasurer's reply to my question was that this surcharge was permitted to leather merchants, and, I assume, tanners, on all hides purchased for saddlery or any other purpose. Nobody seemed to know just how this tax had come to be retained, although it was made clear that the Treasury had permitted it in the early part of the war. This is another instance of increased prices that have been permitted to large manufacturing concerns, including manufacturers of agricultural implements who have been allowed to increase their prices by 20 per cent. This has placed a heavy imposition on purchasers of agricultural machinery. I ask that the surcharge on leather be investigated. It represents a further profit to the manufacturers of leather without conferring any benefit upon primary producers who produce the hides. It is an unjust and unfair imposition upon those who use or buy leather goods. I wish to refer briefly to the Land Sales Control, particularly in relation to a case that has been brought to my notice by a constituent of mine who lives in a prominent town in the Wimmera electorate. This man is in business, and his premises are situated in the main commercial section of the town. He has been paying rent for the premises for 30 years. One of his sons was killed in New Guinea, and another has come back to this country after a lengthy war service. This man hopes to set his son up in the business, but if the premises are not retained in the main business part of the town, and have to be moved to a back street, the undertaking will be quite unsuitable for the rehabilitation of an ex-iserviceman.",25,Chairman Order The Put It An D His Views Are S Totally

119,Mr Turnbull (Wimmera) [12.17].,"The delegate of the Treasurer has valued the property at £930. A very efficient local valuer has set the figure at £1,030. It is part of a deceased person's estate, and the figure fixed by the vendor is £1,000. Should there not he some give and take in the Treasury's valuation in an important transaction like that. It is probably the only opportunity that this man will have to buy the property, because it is well known that throughout Australia land and property are being sold on the black market. He will have nothing to do with the black market. This is the only opportunity he has of buying the premises of a business established by his father, and handing it over, as a going concern, to his ex-serviceman son. I hope that something will be done to meet cases like this. Leader of the Australian Country party) [12.21] I agree entirely with the sentiments forcibly expressed by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) and the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) and other honourable members about the control of land sales. If it is the policy of the Government to continue this dangerous method of control it should at least ensure that it shall demand a full explanation of the reasons not be badly administered. I have brought to the notice of the Government many instances of sales having fallen through because the delegate of the Treasurer would not permit the sale to be effected. I know of one property in respect of which the vendor and the prospective purchaser agreed upon the price of £8,500, but the delegate of the Treasurer would agree to only £6,000. The deal was not completed, but, in due course, a sale was allegedly made at the price stipulated by the delegate of the Treasurer. 1 know of more than one such instance. I suggest that an option should be given to the person who desired to purchase the property in the first instance, if a sale is subsequently completed, at the price agreed to by the delegate of the Treasurer. does not have to be clairvoyant to know what happens when the vendor and -the original prospective purchaser are not allowed to complete a deal because of the difference between the price agreed upon I understand that a levy of 2d. per ton is by them and the price fixed by the delebeing paid on coal to-day as a contribugate of the Treasurer. If the sale is subsequently completed with another purchaser, a good deal of the money paid is not disclosed in the documents. It is paid ""under the table"". Circumstances should not exist to enable that sort of thing to be done to tbe detriment of hone3t people who desire to comply with the law. I direct the attention of the Government and the committee to the matter of trust funds. The' country is entitled to a full explanation of what, on the face of it, is an unsatisfactory state of affairs in the Government's financial administration. Trust funds are created under the Audit Act and may be expended only for the purpose for which they are created. The balance of general trust funds carried forward on the 1st July, 1947, amounted to £171,134,501. Last financial year, an additional £25,000,000 worth of internal treasury-bills, carrying interest of 1 per cent., was issued and substituted by the Government for money balances in trust funds; I do not suggest that they have been used illegally. I find that about £70,000,000 has been taken out of trust funds and that IO U's in the form of treasury-bills have been substituted. I for their existence. There is a credit balance of £1,102,470 in the Allied ""Works Plant-Materia l Trust Fund. Was that built nip by appropriations during the war? Does it represent an unexpended appropriation? In the Coal Storage and Handling Trust Fund there is a credit balance of £174,956. In the Defence Clothing Material Trust Fund there is a credit balance of £2,573,633. That, from the meagre information available to me, constitutes an unexpended appropriation. Then we come to the following funds and their respective credit balances in round figures:£ Enemy Subjects 1,162,000 Diverted Cargoes 1,178,000 One Import Procurement Suspense 2,009,000 Liquid Fuel Equalization . . 2,477,000 Manufacture of Munitions . . 3,325,000 Marine War Risks Insurance 4,765,000 tion to the Marine War Risks Insurance",26,Chairman Order The Put It An D His Views Are S Totally

Treasurer has said that, during the current year, he will have to provide, distinct from the direct social services contributions of the people, a sum of £8,000,000, which can be drawn only from this accumulated fund. However, there is no cash in the fund. Its credit balance is represented merely by IO U's. The fund should have been kept intact. honourable member for Dalley( Mr Wine Export Encouragement 1,061,000 Rosevear) said, by interjection during a recent speech by the Minister for PostI suppose that the last-mentioneditem war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), that is a true current trust fund.

The honourable gentleman and I are in agreement on that point, and The country is entitled to a full explanathe Minister has unwittingly expressed tion from the Government of the reason agreement with us. He has admitted that for the maintenance of those amounts as Mr Fadden. tent, it would not be sufficiently substantial to meet its current liabili3,150,000 ties. The Treasurer himself has stated 2,020,000 that he must draw £8,000,000 from that 3,407.000 fund during the current year in order to I shall state what I think r unwittgenerally. It should have been treated expressed almost the same as the War Damage Fund was treated. from taxation or loan fund. The Treasurer has demonstrated I refer now to the items under the £ Munitions .. 690,000 Navy .. .. 426,000 Supply and Shipping .. .. 835,000 Other funds listed are as follows:£ Overseas Shipping .. 5,333,000 Post Office Stores and Transport .. 322,000 Salvage .. 1,478,000 War Damage Fund .. 11,158,000 Wheat Industry Stabilization Fund .. 1,075,000 It is strange that the Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund .. 5,500,000 £ Wool Contributory Charge .. 3,787,000 Wool Industry 7,045,000 trust funds. degree represented by treasury-bills which have been taken. out against them. In fact, the money >has been used by the Government for its own purposes. There is no quibble about the way in which the funds have been used, but there is a quibble as to their existence in terms of cash. I contend that the funds should be cleaned up and that the proper position with regard to the treasury-bill liability in respect of them should be finalized. If these trust funds are not in current use, and are not likely to be drawn upon to the amounts of their credit balances, they should be wound up and the treasury-bills which represent them should be automatically cancelled as a consequence. The National Welfare Fund should be an absolute trust fund. It was collected as such, the people contributed to it as such, and therefore it meet future liabilities to present-day conshould be maintained in the interests of the contributors, who may well be beneficiaries from it in the future. It is foreign to the nature of a properly equipped trust fund to maintain it in such a way that it is not available for the use for which it is intended. I contrast the National Welfare Fund with the War Damage Fund, which has a total of £11,158,000 to its credit; We all know that compensation for war damage was provided by means of an insurance scheme. Let us compare the way in which the Government has treated that insurance fund with the way in which it has treated the National Welf are Fund, which should have been maintained as a trust. The credit balance of the War Damage Fund does not consist of substituted treasury-billsI 0 U's which must be renewed from year to year. The National Welfare Fund should be made up of the most reliable securities available to the Government. War amounting to £11,158,000 have been invested in Australian consolidated stock and Commonwealth government stock at the rate of 2£ per cent, per annum. The first instalment, £3,658,000, will mature on the U th November next. I ask: What will be done with this money after the date of (maturity 1 Will it be used to meet war damage claims? Of course it will not, because all the money will not be required for that purpose. The war damage risk is finished. Is the money to be used for the general purposes of government? Does it constitute another nest-egg or reserve which will be added to the amount which I have already disclosed to honourable members? The country is entitled to know the answer. claims have not yet been met. should inform the country that all war damage claims have not yet been met, and should state what will become of the balance in the fund when all of them have been settled. However, the point which I emphasize is that while the War Damage Fund of £11,158,000 is held intact in a trust and the money is invested in Australian consolidated stock, the National Welfare Fund, which was established to tributors, is represented in the worse possible form of investment, namely, treasury bills at 1 per cent, renewable each year. For the reasons which I have enunciated, I contend that the position of these trusts requires a thorough overhaul, and the facts should be disclosed to the Parliament and the people. Most important of all, we should be told what will become of the £11,158,000 which belongs to the War Damage Fund and which has been invested in government securities. We should also be told what will become of the other trust funds which I have mentioned. Sitting suspended from 12.43 to S p.m. never been able to discover the exact purpose of the attack of the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) on the Government's policy in regard to trust funds and the investment of balances damage insurance collections held in various funds. However, before referring to that matter in detail, I propose to deal with Land Sales Control, a subject which was discussed at some length in the course of the debate on the estimates for the Treasury. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton) suggested that the comiplete abolition of land sales control would resultin the immediate settlement on the land of ex-servicemen and others, hut, in my",27,Chairman Order The Put It An D His Views Are S Totally

125,Mr Burke (Perth) [3.0],"I haveopinion, the immediate removal of those controls would certainly not have the effect desired. I think that the honourable ment's financial practice. Blain) supplied the answer to the honourable member's contention when he said that land agents and valuers in ""Western Australia had asked for a gradual relaxaright honourable gentleman did not make tion of the controls. That suggestion is infinitely preferable to the one made by the honourable member for Swan, because there is no doubt of what will happen if controls are removed completely and immediately. Because of the current prices of wheat, wool and other primary products, the capital value of holdings must rise immediately. settlers would have to "" buy in "" at high prices, and as prices for primary products receded they would lose much of their equity. In Western Australia a bill was introduced in the Parliament by a Labour Government which empowered the Government to acquire property for the settlement of ex-servicemen, but techto day, require to be invested in a more nical amendments were made to it by the Legislative Council, the effect of which was to make it more difficult for the Government to acquire property for settlecall. ment by the people I have mentioned. Legislative Council amended the Labour Government's bill. ginal measure introduced by the Labour Government conferred sufficient power on the Government to acquire land on satisfactory terms, but that intention was almost defeated by the action of the Legislative Council, and the present Government is handicapped by the restrictions imposed by the amended act. Presumably the same difficulty exists in regard to land settlement schemes generally throughout Australia. The Leader of the Australian Country party has attacked the Government's policy with regard to the investment of trust funds, and although I think his attack is without foundation and should be ignored, the fact remains that the press has given considerable prominence to his utterances. Glaring headlines in the press have suggested that he charged the Government with pursuing an unwise financial policy, or that some measure of dishonesty is involved in the Governthat. that suggestion, but that is the interpretation given to his remarks by a section of the press. The simple fact is that the investment of funds is governed by a general principle that funds must be invested so as to secure, on the one hand, a regular return of interest which can be utilized, or, on the other hand, in some Intending form in which they can be liquidated at any time. Governments have to meet distant liabilities, and against those liabilities it is quite proper for them to invest funds in long-term securities bearing a comparatively high rate of interest. On the other hand, moneys in the National Welfare Fund and other funds, which have to be drawn upon from day liquid type of security such as treasury bills. Treasury-bills bear a lower rate of interest, but the funds are available at fare Fund does not have to meet large commitments from day to day; only £8,000,000 have been drawn from the fund since it came into existence. The funds from which money is required to be drawn from day to day are tbe income tax and social service contribution funds, which are entirely different. are made from day to day from social service contributions and those moneys are required from time to time to meet social service payments. If the interest from funds invested is sufficient to meet those payments the funds can be invested in long-term securities. Securities yielding a higher return are always at a premium. The_ simple reason is that the higher interest yield makes the security more valuable than, say, an ordinary investment at par in a loan raised currently by the Government at a lower rate of interest. If the reverse position existed and interest rates were rising, investments in current loans would",29,Chairman Order The Put It An D His Views Are S Totally

Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [3.22J -The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr ment that no Minister takes the trouble Blain) is well off the beam. The expenditure of money for the purchase of properties in the Northern Territory does not come out of the War Damage Insurance Fund, but is authorized under the Darwin Lands Acquisition Act 1945. It appears under another item altogether in the Estimates. It is true that there is £11,000,000 in the War Damage Insurance Fund, but it is also true that no claims on the fund have been made by property owners in New Guinea. made? been received but have not been dealt with. The majority of claims have not been made at all. Therefore, it would be improper for the Government to use the money in the trust fund for any other purpose until all claims which may properly be made on the fund have been received and dealt with. If , when that time arrives, there is a surplus in the fund, the Government will decide what shall be done with the balance. the principal points made by the Opposition has been in connection with the administration of Land Sales Control, and, therefore, I thought that when the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr take pla.ce when the Government Dedman) rose to speak that criticism would have been answered. The Government is treating the Parliament with contempt in allowing so' deep-seated and widespread criticism of a major matter of government policy and administration to pass without making any attempt whatsoever to answer it. The policy of the' Government and its administration of affairs in the matter of lands sales control and prices control affect every stratum of society in Australia. A case has been made out by honourable members on this side of the chamber showing that there is grave reason to believe that the law in respect evaded on a large scale. Responsible members on this side have made allegations of corruption; they have said that numbers of people are engaged in land transactions of a nature which amount to an evasion of the law. .Surely we have not reached the stage where the Government is so contemptuous of the Parliato rise to answer charges made in the Parliament. I have accused the Government of acting in defiance of a principle which it seeks to impose on the citizens of this country. I have cited instances of the Commonwealth Bank having bought land in a town, which I have named, at a price far above that which the Treasury was prepared to approve in respect of a private transaction. When a member of the Parliament says that he has information that such an important institution of the Government as the Commonwealth Bank is acting in defiance of the Government's own policy, we have a right to expect an answera denial, or an explanation, or an assurance that an investigation of the charge will be made.. The committee is entitled to know whether one set of conditions shall apply to citizens, of this country who desire to deal in real estate, whilst governmental instrumentalities which also are engaged in similar transactions are not bound by similar conditions. The Commonwealth Bank, the Postmaster-General's Department, the Department of Civil Aviation and other departments are continually engaged in land transactions throughout Australia. In addition, many other transfers of land arbitrarily exercises its power of compulsory acquisition. If instrumentalities of the Government are not to be subjected to the same conditions as private citizens who desire to buy and sell land, how can law and order be sustained in this country? Many speeches have been delivered by supporters of the Government in an attempt to impress on the Parliament and the people of this country the importance of checking inflationary tendencies. There have been references to the necessity for maintaining rationing, prices control, land sales",32,Chairman Order The Put It An D His Views Are S Totally

But they will not be accepted if the people realize that government departments act in complete contempt of the principles propounded by Ministers. When a debate of this nature occurs, and serious allegations are made by members of the Opposition, the only construction which can be placed on the silence of the Government is that it is utterly contemptuous of protests, and completely unconcerned about giving effect to the principles for which it declares it stands. The people of Australia are "" fed u p "" with the conduct of autocrats who are part of a dictatorial administrative system. If respect for government is to be maintained-and I can think of no higher purpose of government than to maintain respect for the processes of government-Ministers dare not remain silent in the face of the charges which have been made by members of the Opposition. I hope that before this proposed vote is disposed of I may succeed in stingand relieved the immediate necessities of ing some Minister to state where .the Government stands in this matter. When I spoke on the subject last night, I expected that, after I had exposed what was brought to my notice as a very questionable land transaction in the town of Numurkah, an explanation would be forthcoming. However, we were merely treated to a tirade from the Minister of Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) of a kind to which we have become accustomed. I do not complain of that. I complain, not of iwhat he said, but of what no Minister has yet said. I challenge the Government now to say whether the Commonwealth Bank is to proceed from town to town purchasing land at a price far in excess of what Land Sales Control will approve in the case of private transactions. Is the Government to participate in land deals of a kind which it continues to forbid in the case of private citizens under its attenuated wartime powers? That is a question which permits of a straight out answer, and the Parliament is entitled to receive one. desire to bring to the notice of the Government two anomalies in connection with Land Sales Control of a kind which has prompted many honourable members to fight for tbe abolition of control. Probably, abolition would not be necessary if the Government were more amenable to reason. In the last Parliament, an attempt was made to induce the Government to agree to the setting up of an appeal authority which would be more readily accessible to aggrieved persons than are the present authorities. The proposal found much favour with government supporters. The honourable member who secured the adjournment of the debate on the proposal was in favour of it, but, like all motions that emanate from this side of the House, it was left on the notice-paper until the Parliament was prorogued, and nothing -more was heard of it. However, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) undertook to investigate some of the more glaring cases which I had mentioned, and I am grateful to him that in some of the worse instances adjustments were made. Nevertheless, although he appeased me, the aggrieved persons, he left the principle unchanged. I know ' of several properties which are now out of production because Treasury officials will not agree to the valuation accepted by both buyers and sellers-who , after all, are the people who understand the businessand this at a time when national, and perhaps Empire, survival depends upon increased production. The owners are willing to sell, and the prospective buyers, who know their business, are willing to buy at an agreed price. Then the Treasury enters the field, and tells them, in effect, that they know nothing about their own business, with the result that the land is lying idle, land which should be used at this time to stem the downward trend of production which has been noticeable over the last few. years. I particularly stress the point that the Treasury, which interferes with deals of this kind, should at least pay for its own mistakes. I have in mind the case of a returned soldier who has been made tbe victim of a Treasury mistake. The delegate of the Treasurer agreed to a sale contract at a price £750 above his own valuation. The prospective purchaser paid a deposit of £750 which he was likely",33,Chairman Order The Put It An D His Views Are S Totally
149,Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [3.33],"Ito lose if he failed to go on with the purchase, because we established the fact that he had no legal redress: I mention no names at this stage because the case is still, being investigated nearly seven months after I first wrote to the department about it, and I do not wish to prejudice the matter. It could have been adjusted in a fortnight if the Treasury had been prepared to accept responsibility for its own mistake. It is not important whether the victim be a returned soldier or any other citizen. If a person has been victimized as a result of government policy, the Government should accept responsibility. The Government is able to provide millions of pounds in some cases, and thousands of pounds in others, for things which no one wants, so it should have no difficulty in providing the few ""hundreds of pounds necessary to do justice in this case. It may be claimed that this is an isolated case, and so it is a fact which may be highly satisfactory -to the majority, 'but poor consolation to the few who are victims. I have received much correspondence about the case, including a letter from the Prime Minister himself, admitting that a mistake was made, and saying that he had advised the delegate of the Treasurer what price he should have agreed to. I am still hoping that, after seven months, the department may do something in the matter. I ask the Minister for Post-War Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), who is now at the table, to take note of the case, because the matter is not so far remote from his own department, and I trust that provision will be made to remove an injustice. -Proposed vote agreed to. Proposed vote, £528,000. I note that the estimated expenditure for the present financial year on the Commonwealth Investigation Service is £22,075 more than was expended in the previous year. I am wondering what plans 'the Government has under consideration that would necessitate that increase of expenditure in respect of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. At this juncture it appears to me to be very [20] important that the Government should take some definite line of action -with respect to matters that have recently arisen as the result of the Soviet's decision to revive the Comintern. That decision is of world-wide import. Almost every democratic country is now concerned about what might happen with the revival of the Comintern.' It appears -that every country, with the exception of Australia is so concerned, because almost daily we read reports in the press regarding action thatother countries are taking to purge their administrations of this particular brand of saboteur. But in Australia we shrug our shoulders blissfully and say, "" What can we do about it ?"" Early in this sessional period I asked ithe Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) what action the Government proposed to .take to purge the Public Service of the Communist menace. The right honourable gentleman replied that such a purge might assume the form of a Gestapo. If the Public Service, and all bodies associated with the administration of government are not purged of those elements, there will be no doubt in the Communists' mind as to the formation of a Gestapo when they assume control of government departments. 'This morning I drew attention to action contemplated in the United .States of America. I referred to a cablegram published in the press stating that the American Department of State announced yesterday that it would dismiss instantly any ofBcer, or -employee, deemed to be a security risk. That report statedThe State department announced yesterday that it would dismiss instantly any officer or employee deemed to be a ""security risk"". The announcement said the State department was a ""vital target"" for persons engaged in espionage or subversion of the United States Government. It added that people in the following categories would not be regarded as good security risks. The report then sets out four headings covering those Who would not be considered to be' good security risksThose who advocate treason or subversion, or are members of or affiliated with or in sympathetic association with the Communist, Nazi, or Fascist. parties. We can assume, indeed, it has been proved, that as all those parties uphold -authoritarian ideologies, they come under",34,Chairman Order The Put It An D His Views Are S Totally

Those ""who knowingly divulge secret information without authority and with the belief Unit it would be transmitted to a foreign government, or who are consistently irresponsible in handling such information. Those in habitual or close association with known agents of foreign governments.

That talk may have been effecMr Harrison. for its decision. One need only review the leaders of many of our trade unions, and recall the pressure which Communist leaders in those unions have brought to bear upon the Government in the past, to realize that their strength and power were too great to be resisted by the Government: Indeed, during the war, the leaders of the Communist party were appointed by this Government to positions of trust in this country. The Government thus enhanced their reputation and built up their prestige in the trade unions, giving them a standing which they could not have acquired otherwise. All honourable members are aware of those facts. In addition, the Governcontemplated ment has given directions to branches of the Labour party to cleanse their organizations of communism. We hear I note that very little about that to-day, because so many branches of the Labour party at present are dominated by Communists over whom neither the Government nor A definite responsibility rests the Labour party can exercise control. in this matter I direct attention to the points Departwhich have been made by the the CommonAmerican Department of State, because Service.

156,Mr Harrison,"I want to show thestrength to bring about a bloody revolution "". Dr. Lloyd Ross has said that the Australian Communists take their directions from Moscow, and he is a mouth-piece of the Government at present. Mr Thornton's statement indicates clearly the danger of a violent upheaval in this country; and how better could a revolution be inaugurated than by striking at that great administrative inabout such a range when they are able to stitution, the Public Service? As I have said, the Public Service is riddled with Communist cells, ready to assume control when the moment to strike arrives. When I was Postmaster-General it was common knowledge in .the departmentthat there existed in that organization Communist cells of great strength and influence. Acknowledged Communists had formed not merely single units, but multiple units. They openly discussed Communist policy, and claimed allegiance to the Communist party. Thus, in one of the most important sections of the Public Servicea section controlling the pursued. Has the Government any sense lines of communication of this countryCommunists are well organized, and ready to act at a moment's notice as they have done in other countries. Australia should that while seeking to purge .their own do what the other democratic countries are doing, and thoroughly cleanse the Public Service of individuals who are associated with Communist organizations. Here is an example of the influence that the Communists are able to exert: Recently, twelve telephones and twenty extensions have been installed in Marx House, Sydney, although there are approximately 30,000 people in New South Wales alone waiting for telephones for the carrying out of ordinary business, much of it of an urgent nature. Apparently the influence of the Communist cells in the Postmaster-General's Department has enabled the Communists of Marx House to obtain priority for the installation of telephones. It cannot be to rid the organization of Communists argued that the Communists are securing preference because they are performing a national service: there is no need for me to emphasize that they are rendering a great disservice to this nation. They, are saboteurs, they formulate treachery and they deal in treason; yet this Government allows them to proceed on their way despite the example that has been set by other democratic countries in which government administration has been purged of Communist influences. All we can get from the Prime Minister is a blithe glossing over of our warnings. Acknowledging that this menace exists in the community, the Government has introduced legislation to protect the proposed guided weapons range in Central Australia. But what do the Communists care control the Public Service and the lines of communication in this country ? Protests against the appointment of certain individuals to important governmental and semi-governmental positions have been made in this chamber on several occasions. For instance, a defeated politician, and, of course, a Government supporter, was appointed to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. His brother isa well-known Communist, and the views of this gentleman himself are open to suspicion. One naturally would like to know how far this policy is to be ofresponsibility to the people and to democratic ideals? Are honourable members opposite so devoid of understanding trade unions of Communists, they believe themselves justified in refusing to extend the purge to that great administrative organization, the Public Service? They say, in effect, "" We know of the Communist menace, and we aim to purge the trade unions of Communists "" ; but, at the same time, they smile and bow to Communists in the Public Service because their influence is so great that it dare not be resisted. In the interests of this country and of tbe democratic cause, there is a responsibility upon this Government to ensure that before the Communists are able to undermine the entire Public Service, action should be taken to check the records of all appointees, and already within its ranks. Speaking on the estimates of the Attorney General's Department, and with particular reference to the Commonwealth Investigation Service, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) has suggested that the Government should undertake at once a purge of the Public Service of the Commonwealth.

This prominent member of the New Guard talks more like Hitler every day. He made an astounding proposition that the Government should immediately direct the Commonwealth Investigation Service to pry into the private lives of public servants. The Government has been criticized for having increased the staff of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. It is unthinkable that a responsible body of intelligent men should be treated in such a way., The honourable member used the word "" purge "" over and over again. He said he did so advisedly. We can only draw the inference that he wants the letters of public servants to be opened. He wants to subject public servants to the (methods of the Ge9tapo in Germany and the O.G.P.U. in Russia.

What would be the position in this country if we adopted a system of spying on the Public Service. We must rely on the law as it stands. To do as the honourable member suggests the powers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service would have to be enlarged. The honourable member said that the proposed vote for the Commonwealth Investigation Service was insufficient to meet the cost of an increased staff. I do not think that the Commonwealth Investigation Service could do anything more than submit a report if it knew or bad reason to believe that an offence was being committed. The honourable member referred to the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act and its provisions to preserve the secrecy of experiments on the guided weapons testing range in Central Australia. I remind him that deadly weapons that might be used in another war will be tested on that range and that it is of the utmost importance to not only Australia, but the whole British Commonwealth, to preserve the strictest secrecy.

If we are to judge the sentiments of the Government from the remarks of the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Williams), we must conclude that the Government is lacking in intestinal fortitude. I am searching for a word. sive word. It could not have come from the Labour side, for honourable members there do not know its meaning. I rose mainly to refer to the Legal Service Bureau. I congratulate the Government for having decided to vote additional money for that bureau. The proposed provision is £34,300. I assume that tlie. bureau will deal with problems of ex-servicemen, domestic or otherwise. In remote parts of Australia legal men are trying to give that service. I refer particularly to the representative of the bureau in Darwin. Although he and his superior officer asked me not to refer his troubles to head-quarters, I wrote to the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), who unfortunately is away, asking him to ensure the provision of adequate transport for this official. A motor car is needed to enable him to do his work. A few months ago, when I was in the Northern Territory, I found that he had to "" hitch-hike "" from Darwin to Alice Springs along the bitumen road. He should have a serviceable motor car to enable him to cover the enormous area that he has to cover east and west of the bitumen road between Alice Springs and ' Darwin. At mining camps he met 250 ex-servicemen. He was able to handle 50 cases on the spot, but the remainder have to be referred to head-quarters. It is not fair that he should be asked' to "" hitch-hike "", 3adging lifts from truck drivers in the territory mentioned. He should be provided with a reliable car. are mining camps in many outlying places which these officers have great difficulty in reaching because of the lack of ordinary transport facilities. They are providing an excellent service for ex-servicemen in the Northern Territory. Without any solicitation from me, one of them handled a case at Tennant Creek on behalf of two ex-soldiers whose mining claim had been jumped while they were at the war. These men found, when they returned to Tennant Creek, that their claim had been given to four army officers who had passed it off to some company promoters in Adelaide. A court of inquiry was held and recommended the payment of £600 compensation to the two men. However, the amount was not paid, and I am doubtful whether even their travelling expenses were refunded. In fact, this Government refused to pay these "" diggers "" the compensation to which they were entitled. The Legal Aid Officer wrote to me explaining the case, and I took it up with the appropriate authority. Strangely enough, the Government, has some shame and it took action to have the leases returned to the men. I stress the importance of the work that these officers, are doing and emphasize the difficulties which they must overcome in order to move about the Northern Territory. I trust that the letter which I have written to the Attorney-General will not be overlooked. The officers particularly asked me riot to raise this matter with the Minister because they feared that my intervention might influence him against them. I decided to explain the situation to the Minister and did so "" off my own bat but there has been no result so far. The estimated expenditure for the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is £54,300. I understand that only yesterday the recently passed Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act embodying the machinery provisions was proclaimed, and I am hopeful that either to-day or to-morrow the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1947 will also be proclaimed so that a legislative council for the Northern Territory can be elected before the wet season breaks in the north of Australia. Time is pressing, because the wet season is due in NovemThere ber. I urge the Government to bring that act into force immediately so that citizens who are willing to serve on the Legislative Council and. aid the development of the Northern Territory, in return for a meagre expense allowance, will be able to get to work.

I am amazed when I hear them sand like an ostrich, is not aware of the trying to convince the people of Ausmenace? Are we to believe that the Gotralia, by means of the Hertzian waves vernment of the United States of by which our debates are broadcast, that America, which came to our aid during the Communist menace does not exist. the war, is composed of fools and that it They are inveterate vote cadgers, and, is having a purge of its own departments perhaps, that explains their attitude.

167,Mr Blain,"am sure that they know, deep down in their hearts, that the menace is real, just as I know that it is. The guided weapons range must be jealously guarded. unless a military guard is on duty there at all times. Above all, the secret archives where the results of the tests will be listed must be preserved from the prying eyes of traitors and saboteurs. I warn honourable members opposite that the people of Australia know the truth about communism. They may try to fool themselves about this, but the people will show what they think in their own way at a later stage. As an example of Communist activity in Australia, I refer to events which took place at Brisbane last year. The then Deputy Premier of Queensland, Mr Cooper, who is now Lieutenant-Governor of the State, visited a wharf at Brisbane and there heard a letter from the files of the Premier's Department, which he had signed, being read to wharf labourers. The Communists held their big school at Brisbane last year. They gave up their Christmas holidays on the 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th of December for that purpose. ' Will not honourable members opposite who come from Queensland believe that statement? If they do not, let them check it . The Communists gloated over the fact that they had the Premier's letter, which they read at their meeting, and which had been stolen from the Premier's office. I could cite other examples, but I shall not give the details. The Commonwealth Investigation Service has its own methods, and thank goodness one of the officers in charge is Brigadier Galleghan, under whom I served in Malaya. Nothing passes him but lightning. Tbe CommonAvealth Investigation Service should be made stronger, so that a vigilant eye may be kept on these Communist ""cells"" in Commonwealth and State departments. We are discussing the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department, which is responsible for the administration of justice in the Commonwealth. In a democracy it is essential that the public shall have a respect for our law courts, particularly the High Court of Australia. The Labour party desires to make the High Court the final court of appeal in this country. However, some members of the Labour party appear to set out deliberately to bring the High Court into contempt. In the Sydney Domain last Sunday afternoon, I beard a speaker exI shall not be satisfied press the following opinions with rancour: The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! I remind the honourable member that the High Court is not included in the portion of the Estimates which the committee is now considering. Attorney-General's Department, Division No. 46, "" H i g h Court"", for which the estimated expenditure on salaries and payments in the nature of salaries is £12,700. I congratulate the Government; on its decision to increase the salaries of those eminent gentlemen who are justices 1 of the High Court. In passing, I often wonder why the senior judge of theSupreme Court of the Northern Territory has not received an increase of salary. However, as that subject should be raised under another department, I shall not make a more extensive reference to it at this stage. The speaker in the Sydney Domain, to whom I referred earlier, saidI n defiance of the mandate of the people the trading banks had appealed to the High Court against the order to public bodies to bank w it h the Commonwealth Bank. . . . The Government and the people had been knocked back by seven incompetent septugenarians; also that the Government believed that the banks intended to attack every section of the 1045 banking legislation, and the Ministry could not take the risk of going before that court again and had therefore decided to nationalize the banks. able member in a few moments. Yesterday, in this chamber, I , as a representative of a democratic people, attempted to refer to this matter, but Mr Speaker ruled that my remarks were out of order.

176,Mr Holloway (Melbourne P O R T S,"of the department should be greater than in the past. He mentioned the purchase of scientific equipment for the Defence Department, the experiments which will be conducted at the testing range for guided weapons and the need for the appointment of additional officers to the Commonwealth Investigation Service. The adoption of those suggestions costs a considerable amount of money, and explains very largely this increase of the Department's expenditure. The Commonwealth Investigation Service will require the provision of an additional £22,075. Fifty-two additional officers have been appointed to carry out investigational work under the direction of Colonel Lungfield Lloyd. The honourable member for ""Wentworth also stressed the necessity for the appointment of a sufficient number of security officers, but I believe that the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Williams) struck the right note when he pointed out that this is not a subject which can be discussed in a propagandist fashion. The investigational work of the Defence Department is not a subject for public speeches, and I do not imagine that any honourable member would ask me to tell him exactly where the security officers are located or what they are doing. The conduct of those investigations must be left to the experts who are engaged upon them. £22,075 will be expended on the provision of an adequate investigation service. The honourable member for the Northern Territory said that he was perfectly happy with the work done by the Legal Service Bureau. This organization was established to assist ex-servicemen, and its operations have extended to a greater degree than was anticipated. The service provided by the bureau is greatly appreciOffice. ated by ex-servicemen, who are availing themselves of its assistance in greater numbers. In the Northern Territory, some very useful assistance has been rendered to ex-servicemen. The cost of maintaining and extending the functions of the bureau has increased correspondingly. The honourable member alleged that two ex-servicemen have been badly treated, but I understand that the reports submitted, after an official inquiry had been held, disclosed that the men had no claim. In saying that, I speak from recollection only. I shall examine the matter in order to ascertain whether anything can be done to assist these two men, and I trust that it will be possible to do so. I have visited the Tennant Creek, Katherine, and Darwin areas on foot and in a truck, and I realize the difficulties confronting ex-servicemen who desire advice and assistance from the Legal Service Bureau. Their isolation is the problem. I shall bring the matter to the notice of the Minister acting for the Attorney-General, and suggest that some means of transport should be provided. Complaints, were made about the arrears of work of the Patents Office, and the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) criticized the department when he spoke in the debate on amendments proposed to be made to the Patents Act. The explanation of the arrears of work is shortage of staff. Most of the work performed by its officers is of an expert nature and it requires two years to train officers for these duties. The percentage of enlistments in the department's staff was particularly high, and it was quite impossible for the remainder to cope with the department's work during the war. Since the war ended, many of the serviceAsI stated, an additional men have returned to duty, but at least an additional 50 or 60 qualified men and women are required to overtake the accumulation of nearly two years' arrears. It has always been most difficult for this department to secure the services of adequately qualified officers, and even before the war its work was probably twelve months in arrears. The appointment of additional staff explains the increase of the estimate for the Patents The implementation of the amendments to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act has necessitated the appointment of a number of additional people, including fifteen conciliation commissioners. That number was fixed on the advice of the judges of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. pose to send a conciliation commissioner to Darwin as a matter of urgency?",44,Attorney Genbrai S Department
177,Mr Blain,"Does the Government prothe honourable member asked how long it would be before the conciliation commissioners were appointed, and stated that its activities on the testing range for he had read in the press a report that the act had been proclaimed the previous day. The Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration convened a conference of the conis obvious to any one that the world ciliation commissioners this afternoon, and I understand that they have been sworn in and their duties allocated to them. One of the most able of those gentlemen, Mr Wallwork, has been deputed to deal with industrial disputes occurring in the Northern Territory and in Western Australia. 3dr.

We know £60,100 and is estimated to spend £74,200 that there are Moscow-trained Comthis year. I presume that the reason for that increase is the realization by the Government of the necessity for policing guided weapons. Not only is our own security concerned in that project, but the security of other Empire nations, including Great Britain, is involved. It situation to-day is menacing, and it is ominously reminiscent of the state of affairs which confronted us ten years ago. When we read reports in the press of the tirades delivered by Vyshinsky we are struck with their similarity to the utterances of Hitler and Goebbels.

180,Mr Edmonds,"The honourable memare ready to cause discord, and suffering and loss of life. ""When Mein Kampf was published, we laughed at the crazy person who had written it, but when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany some of us realized that there was danger. Even then there were those who laughed at the so-called war-mongers who saw the possibility of a world war. A person must be either blind or a Communist who is not prepared to admit the danger which exists to-day. Russia has revived the Comintern which it abolished during the war, when England saved the Russians from defeat. intern though was mere deception. It has now been revived, and the Communist-controlled countries have been united in a solid Hoc to oppose any schemes for the revival of Europe, such as the Marshall plan. Another function of the Comintern is to create discord between nations, as when the Communists succeeded in entangling us with the Dutch over Indonesia, and besmirching our good name. I urge the Government to spend wisely the money which is to be voted for the Commonwealth Investigation Service. It is not suggested that there should be anything in the nature of a heresy hunt. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Williams), who is a lawyer, made a drivelling speech when he said that it had been suggested by honourable members on this side of the House that there should be a purge, accompanied by the opening of private letters. Nothing could be further from the thoughts of honourable members on this side of the House. All that is needed is the appointment of a royal commission to conduct an inquiry, as was done in Canada. I quote the following reference to the report of that commissionTlie Soviet Minister to Canada and other Soviet representatives were absent in Moscow when the trap was sprung. They obviously had had some warning of what was coming. According to A.P.A. the organization discovered was on three levels (1) an inner circle of Eussian agents, taking orders direct from Moscow; (2) a middle circle of detached and paid professional spies-all , it is believed, Canadian citizens; (3) Communist civil servant red-ants or subjects of blackmail, who willingly or unwillingly made available government secrets. The Canadian Communist party was "" deeply involved"", and one of its members had been arrested. A member of the Canadian Parliament was tried and sent to gaol, and a prominent English scientist was also imprisoned. Canada is a British dominion, and what happened there is happening in Australia. It is not the declared Communist, the Thornton's and the Sharkey's, who talk of revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, but the undeclared Communists who are the real danger. Men such as Lenin himself, were out of Russia at the time of the revolution in 1917-bu t returned to seize power from The abolition of the Comthe Liberal government which had been set up. I urge the Government to appoint a royal commission, when it can choose whom it likes to sit on the commission. Many people will beprepared to come forward and say then what they know, so that the Government will be able to "" ticket"" the persons who menace us, and if (trouble should come, they can be marked as traitors and put aside where they cannot disturb our safety. agree with the Minister for Labour and Social Service( Mr Holloway) that no one should expect the Government to give details of how the money is spent which is voted for the Commonwealth Investigation Service. We recognize that in work of that kind security must be a first consideration. Like the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) I rise to speak on this subject because of the increased influence and numbers of the Communist party in Australia. In view of this fact, no one can successfully maintain that the proposed vote for the Commonwealth Investigation Service is sufficient. I do not want to labour this subject of the danger of eommunism, but I remind the committee of what honourable members on this side of the chamber have said on this subject in the past. Members of the Opposition do not object to Communists because of their political beliefs. We oppose the Communist party because We say that while its members are citizens of this country, while they take advantage of everything which this country offers, they admit of no loyalty, but take their orders from the Kremlin, and set out to work against our interests and to destroy",46,Blain H E Is An Able Man
181,Mr Gullett (Henty) [4.56],"Ius. The danger of communism has increased since Russia announced its intention to revive the Communist international movement known as the Comintern. This declaration has been hailed by the United States of America and Great Britain as so important that it may -well lead to the breakdown of the United Nations-. It means the end of all pretence that Soviet Russia intends to make a "" go"" of efforts to achieve peaceful relations with thedemocratic countries. It also means that, through the Communist there is let loose in the world, and in this country among others,' a fifth column which will insinuate itself into all kinds of organizations for the purpose of bringing about our destruction. As a step towards fighting this menace we ask, not that a Gestapo should be set up, not that people should be sent to gaol, but merely that an investigation should be made intb the activities of Communists. We ask that those in authority should know where they stand, and -who are the enemies in our midst. We further say that there is no excuse for the Government continuing to employ Communists, who must be known as such to the Government, in important posts. It is, in particular, a disgrace that they should be employed in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and in certain munitions factories, and it is known to all honourable members that certain well known Communists are so employed. That is a terrible condition of affairs. In Australia some most important experiments in armaments are shortly to be carried out. For our own security, and that of the Empire, the Goverament should not permit people to hold important and confidential positions, if they have affiliations with organizations outside this country. We ask that the Government should take action to show that it regards members of the Communist party as a potential menace to the State, and to ensure that, in certain circumstances--as, for instance, warthey shall be dealt with immediately What has the Government done in response to the insistent demands on honourable members on this side? It has not done anything. Instead, it has made use of the Communist party, and has given Mr Gullett. tacit consent to its growth. In the last, election campaign several government candidates ran comfortably in harness with Communist candidates . In my own 1 eleotoriaite, ..the Labour candidate was closely associated with the Communist party, which issued pamphlets defaming me. Too much tolerance is shown towards this organization. Mr Duthie interjecting, the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr organization, Duthie) employs himself as a lay preacher from time to time. That is admirable, but 1. remind him that Communists are radically opposed to our freedom, religion ond laws. Instead of defending them, the honourable member would do better if he would consult the opinions of the people he is supposed to represent and give evidence of the .convictions that he professes to hold. defending them? Communists decide to publish a new magazine or newspaper, newsprint for the purpose is made available to them. I could name half a dozen publications which have been started by Communists during the last two years, and for which ample supplies of newsprint have been made available by the Government. By denying them these facilities the Government could prevent 'their growth. I emphasize the .seriousness of the growth of Communist organizations in our midst; in Victoria 'alone the Communist party has 5,000 active members. When we remember the determination of these people and their highly organized activities that is a matter for concern. Another organization which is working on the well-known theory of the Communists that if the youth of a country is captured, in good time the adult population is captured, is the Eureka Youth Movement. I have watched with growing alarm the increasing numbers of young people belonging to this organization. So great is this menace that yesterday the Governor of New South Wales saw fit to make strong references to it at a Scouts rally. Steps should be taken to investigate this movement, and where it is found to be working against the best interest of",47,Blain H E Is An Able Man

The Opposition does not ask for drastic steps to be taken, and it is ridiculous for the honourable member for Robertson to say that we want to establish a Gestapo and to put people in gaol. We ask for nothing of the kind; but we do ask that the Government should undertake a thorough investigation so that the people may know where danger lies. [5.4J I view with great concern the growth of communism and the privileged that are extended to such traitors in this country. I have no desire to score a political advantage, but I hope that the Government will take steps to protect Australia against the white-anting activities of the Communists. The experience of the war should be sufficient to convince the Government that the Opposition is always ready and willing to assist in the protection of Australia, and, therefore, it must be aware that it can rely on the support of every member of the Opposition in any action that it may take against the foe in our midst. Communism should be suppressed in the interests of the people of Australia, and we on this side are prepared to accept our share of the responsibility for any action that may be taken against those engaged in subversive activities. have urged that Communists should not be employed by bodies such as the Council for Scientific andIndustrial Research, chamber are prepared to take our full which undertake scientific investigations on behalf of the Government. I go further, and say that no such person should be engaged in our telegraphic or telephonic services. There should be a general clean-up of government departments because, should the occasion arise, these enemies of Australia would not hesitate to destroy essential services in which they are employed. In other countries Communists have shown that they are engaged in open warfare against democracy and freedom and, therefore, I hope that tbe Government will take the Opposition into its confidence,, and ask it to accept a share of the responsibility awsociaited with the suppression of those who would destroy all that we hold worthwhile in life. Every week in the Sydney Domain, and elsewhere, Communists openly defy our laws, and give clear demonstration of their determination to check the development of our primary and secondary industries. In our love of freedom we have allowed them too much licence. Recently, a prominent member of the Communist organization, Roache, travelled to Cairns, in north Queensland, to arrange an illegal stop-work meeting of waterside workers which is now in progress. His object was to organize a strike which would prevent the loading of barges with cargoes for Indonesian ports. They continually hold up transport in this country, and prevent the export of food which is so much needed overseas. When one industrial dispute has been settled, they engineer another. They are working day and night, causing trouble, in this and every other democratic country. To the detriment of the Mother Country, they are actively, engaged in Egypt, India, Irak, Iran and Greece. They describe their activities in support of the proposed bank seizure in these terms: "" We in our fight for the seizing of the banks "". ment under their control. tunately, it appears to be so. If the Government would take the Opposition into Other honourable members its confidence, it would have no need to fear trouble from the Communists, because we who sit on this side of the share of the responsibility for dealing with the problem. We do not want the support or advocacy of men who are traitors to our country. We want to suppress them, if possible. It has been said that we want to put them in gaol. Those who are upsetting our transport and our home light supply and interrupting production by continually instigating strikes for no reason, should be put in gaol, or be sent to a country which would not allow them to have the freedom that they have in Australia.

Consequently, were the Government to institute an inquiry along the lines suggested by the honourable member for ""Wentworth, it would be quite likely that a man, because he was sufficiently militant to demand his rights, talk so freely, only one candidate who socially and industrially, would automatically be branded as a Communist; and,according to honourable members opposite, he should be thrown out of the Public, Service. further still. The honourable member spoke of a man who holds a high position in the Public Service and has a brother who is a Communist. Under the honourable member's suggestion, not only that Communist, but also his non-Communist brother, would have to be dealt with, and be thrown out of the Public Service. Honourable members opposite should try to realize exactly where such a proposition begins and where it ends. However, let us assume that the Government is foolish enough to fall into the trap which the honourable member for Wentworth is attempting to lay for it, and arrange an inquiry of the kind he suggests. Could such an inquiry be confined only to Communists? There are traitors in the Public Service besides Communists. I refer to persons who are not Communists, but who give confidential information to honourable members opposite who do not hesitate to read in this'chamber the information supplied to them by such persons. Such an inquiry would have to embrace traitors of that kind in the Public Service as well as Communists. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) and the honourable member for Henty( Mr occurred in the intervening years to Gullett) declared that the Communists are daily growing in strength. In this respect honourable members opposite are making a mountain out of a mole hill. The Communist party, over a long period of years, has nominated candidates at both State and Federal elections. Incidentally, such candidates, almost without exception, have opposed Labour candidates. They have rarely opposed tory candidates. It is reasonable to assume that such candidates would be tbe pick of the membership of the Communist party. We know that unlimited supplies of money have been placed at the disposal of such candidates. Does any one suggest that those funds were supplied to the Communist candidates by the Liberal party? However, despite this alleged growth of strength of the Communists about which honourable members opposite has presented himself to the people as a Communist candidate has succeeded in being elected to any parliament in Australia. That fact alone shows that the But we must go claim made by honourable members opposite is unfounded. I admit there are far too many Communists in control of industrial organizations, and I should very much like to see the' day when they are rooted out of those positions. vernment do something about that? plained what I believe to be the solution of the problem. Ever since I have been capable of thinking for myself I have always argued as a trades unionist that there is no need, or very little need, for direct action on the part of trades unionists in this country. There is no need for communism in this country, because our system of industrial conciliation and arbitration affords to the workers means of dealing with every industrial dispute that may arise, whether it be of major or minor proportions. When I was fifteen years' of age I was appointed the union "" rep."" on my job, and from that time to this day I have always advocated conciliation and arbitration as the best and only means of solving industrial troubles. Nothing has cause me to alter that view. When honourable members opposite make roaring statements in the fashion of the honourable, member for Wentworth this afternoon, and the honourable member for Wide Bay, and talk wildly about how the Government is failing to do certain things, alleging that it is tied up with Communists and that Communists dominate the -Government, they are simply talking rubbish.

However, as a democrat, I -cannot refuse to allow any person who keeps within the law of the country to aspire to political honours. No democratic government in .the world refuses freedom of political activity in that way. I throughout the war, there were Communist members of the House of Commons in Great Britain. The honourable member for Warringah said that Communists insinuated themselves into key industrial organizations. I concede the truth of that statement. I manoeuvre themselves into positions in local governing bodies. In fact, the Kearsley Shire Council in .the Hunter electorate is controlled by Communists. Why is that so? Why also do Communists secure key positions in industrial organizations? I know the answer to those questions, and I also have the remedy. We have been advocating the introduction of compulsory voting at municipal elections. If compulsory voting were enforced at such elections, we should find that the views of the people would be reflected in the results of the elections. Thait is what ha ppens' in Commonwealth and State parliamentary elections. Honourable members know that most Communist party candidates at federal elections lose .their deposits owing to lack of support from the electors and that there is only one Communist party member in any State parliament, namely, in tbe Queensland Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Honour statedMenzies) is reported to have said' that he would not be prepared to ban the Communist, party now and would prefer instead to try to educate its members. However, there is mutiny amongst his supporters. The Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) has said, without equivocation, that he would declare the Communist party an illegal organization and ban it. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) and the honourable member for Warringah are also after Communist scalps. Experience in Australia has proved that the banning of political organizations is wrong and unsatisfactory in its results. We have seen how Communists continue to work underground when their party is officially banned. I should rather meet a straight-out Communist than a camouflaged Communist any day. The man who works for the Communist party under another guise is much more dangerous than the avowed Communist. He is the remind honourable members that, sort of man of whom we must beware. We have been startled this week by the news that the Comintern has been revived. Nine nations have united to re-establish a Communist Information Bureau. It will be regrettable if these nations endeavour to undermine the United Nations. The Opposition in this Parliament is emphatic in its condemnaalso concede that Communists tion of communism, but I have known honourable members opposite to be loud in their defence of subversive organizations. I refer in particular to the Australia First Movement. Some honourable members opposite advocated the payment of compensation to members of this subversive organization who were interned during the war. The leader of the movement was Percy R. Stephensen, a Queensland Rhodes scholar, who studied' at the University of Oxford. His activities are outlined in a' report prepared by Mr Justice Clyne, who inquired into the detention of members of the Australia First Movement during the war. Fifteen counsel appeared on behalf of the members of the movement, and Mr Dovey, KC.. and Mr Shand, KC., appeared on behalf of the Commissioner and the Commonwealth Security Service respectively. Mr Justice Clyne accepted the statements of some of the persons who had been interned. On page 5 of his report, HisT have referred to the meetings of the so called Yabba Club. In the discussions which took place at these meetings strong political views were expressed and, amongst others, Miles, Stephensen and Valentine Crowley took a prominent part and expressed views calculated to foster feelings of hostility to Britain, and to cause disaffection in Australia. A t a meeting in June, 1940, a member expressed the view that England was "" buggered "" and he added that he was only waiting for the rain of bombs to start and they would be forced into submission. Shortly afterwards this member expressed the view that the sooner Germany bombed England the better. This same member, at a meeting in January, 1941, said that wherever the British flag has flown, it has brought poverty, corrugated iron and dirt, and that Churchill was the greatest calamity that has ever fallen on Britain. . It was also said at a meeting in February, 1941, that England would get the greatest hiding she has ever got. member's statement? made by the friends of members of the showing an intention to make contact w it h the Opposition.

As with the notes of statements made at Yabba Club meetings, I can see no sufficient reason why the substance of the reports of these speeches made by the investigators should not be accepted. There is little doubt, in my opinion, that some of tlie speeches made at the public meetings were prejudicial to Australia's war effort . . . I think I am justified in coming to the conclusion that despite the formal aims of the Movement, the activities of some of its members were likely to have caused a distrust of Australia on the part of her allies, and to have created such ill w ill and hostility in the community as would have impaired Australia's war effort . . . The Commissioner proceededThe substantial reason for the arrest of these persons He gives the names of these personsnames ? record. Some of themare to be found in the following paragraph of the reportPrior to March, 1942, certain persons in Western Australia had become interested in the Publicist and also in the formation of the Australia First Movement. One of these persons, Laurence Frederick Bullock, had had some correspondence with Miles and, though Stephensen denied any knowledge of it , a letter from Bullock to him was found amongst his papers. Bullock wanted to set up an agency for the Publicist in Western Australia and appeared to be anxious to form in that State a branch of the Movement established in Sydney, and another Western Australian, Edward Cunningham Quicke, appeared desirous of obtaining information about the Movement. It was probably due to this correspondence that the Intelligence Section caused a man named Thomas to make investigations in Western Australia and the sequel to these investigations was. that Bullock and Quicke, and two other persons, Charles Leonard Albert Williams and Nancy Krakouer, were arrested on 9th March, 1942. These four persons were subsequently charged with conspiracy to assist .the Japanese. The substantial reason for the arrest of these was that there were found in their possession some incriminating documents, a plan for the death of many important people including "" democratic politicians "" and "" hierarchy of all denominations"", and an armistice with Japan and which contained a welcome to the Japanese militar y leaders to lay down arms on penalty of death. It is difficult to imagine what moved these puny conspirators to such ambitious and dangerous designs. I might add that these conspirators were ultimately detained.

With the greatest respect to you, sir, it seems to me that the relevancy of any honourable member's speech, once a point of order has been taken, must be determined by the Chair in relation to the Estimates and not hy the remarks of any preceding speaker. honourable member for Hunter's speech is as relevant to the subject as was the speech of the honourable member for Wentworth or other members of the Opposition.

No member of parliament has encountered more opposition from Communists than I have, but I am .sufficiently democratic to prefer to shake followed by the honourable member for hands with a ""dinkum."" Communist, rather than a member of the Australia First Movement or .the Jehovah's Witnesses Sect. I detest the camouflaged Communist, for he is our greatest source of danger, as -we do not know which way he will jump next. I say that quite fearlessly.

So far as subversive organizations are concerned, I wish to refer to another body which has been mentioned in judgments of the High Court, and that is the Society of Jehovah's Witnesses. The members of that society did more damage to this country during the war than the Communist 'party ever did, particularly when we recollect the desperate tactics to which they resorted. The Government found it necessary to cancel their wireless broadcasting licence, and members of .the organization indulged in acts of treachery on the waterfront itself. honourable member must connect his reAt Newcastle they made it a practice to farewell outgoing vessels, and in the guise of singing hymns, such as "" Sailing o'er the 'ocean waves"", they endeavoured to convey to the enemy submarines which were outside the port of Newcastle the sailing times of ships by stating the time at the station. [8.24] I think that the debate on communism is germane to the discussion of the particular section of the Estimatesnow before us. The honourable member for Stephensen and Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) raised .the question of the usefulness of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, and' emphasized the necessity for members of that service to employ themselves on the important task of countering the nefarious activities of the treacherous organization, known as the "" Communist party "" which flourishes in this country. Later he was Herbert. ( Mr Edmonds), who made a speech which might be described as resembling tbe explosion caused by thedetonation of a slow explosive like gunpowder on a redgum log. The honourable member put himself in the delicious position of saying that members on this mountain out of a Communist molehill. Then be went on to tell the committee that members of his union, and he himself in particular, had devoted a good part of their lives to combating the activities of the Communists. In other words, he was contending that members of the Australian Workers Union, whom he professes to represent, have devoted the effects of communism. He associated the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) with his assertion because the Minister is a member of the Australian Workers Union. I point out to him however, that that union does not trespass very far into the capital cities of this country. does not know of what he is talking. honourable gentleman likes to produce the union's membership roll marks with the matter before the Chair. tude adopted by the honourable member for Herbert and his colleagues seems to be that the Communist party is a dreadful show, a fearful thing, but something about which nothing can be done.

It is an organization which is under allegiance to a foreign power and one which is doing work of such a treacherous nature that it ought to be banned by any government. However, members on the opposite side of the chamber seem to regard it as a sort of death adder which one ought to take to bed with him as a good companion on a winter night. Going back to the time when that organization was banned, it is true that the ban had the effect of driving the movement underground; but was the Communist party ever anything but an underground movement in any country? The small part of its ramifications which we are able to perceive is only part of the movement, just as the roots of a big tree are concealed under the ground. When the Menzies Government went out of office we know what happened. The Communist party was demanding peace with Mr Adolf Hitler, before that gentleman decided to turn dog on Poland, just as the Communist party will turn dog on the Australian Labour party whenever it gets the opportunity. never done anything but turn dog! the Curtin Government came into office this matter. I have seen too many in the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), who stances, and so have other honourable apparently "" leftish "" views, seemed to profess the of gentlemen who are known adherents attitude that the Communists were, after of the Communist party, who are so close all, not bad fellows.

A government put into office by a party which has declared that this is a traitorous organization has something to explain to the electorate and to the taxpayers when it uses the money of the taxpayers to send these alleged traitors overseas to represent it. We do not need any more than that. That is what the Australian Labour Government has to stand up to. It has to act,as well as talk. I may say that, on this subject, its talk has not been overloud. It has to show by deeds, as well as by soft words, that it is prepared to deal with this nettle, this nefarious, traitorous organization in our midst, which, according to itself, is "" redanting "" the unions, which are the foundation on which the political structure of its party rests, or be condemned as a government which does not mean what satisfied with the attitude which the Ausheld unorthodox and members on this side of the chamber, We must look closely at the character Every man It has not",60,Blain H E Is An Able Man

246,Mr Archie Cameron,"When tralian Labour Government has taken inshown the slightest concern for either the rights of man or the laws of God, in any country in which it has become established. There is no alternative but for this Australian Commonwealth to get rid of this growth, root, trunk and branch. I remember saying, when the Russians attacked Finland, something which some people might not like to be reminded of now, namely, that so far as our local Communists were concerned, if their hearts were in Moscow their hides ought to beno closer home to Australia than in Vladivostock. That is still my viewthat we cannot tolerate in our midst an organization, call it political if you like, cally so strong as to control unionists, which owes allegiance to some foreign power or authority. We see to-day in eastern Europe the set-up of the old Comintern in another form, the nine powers behind the so-called iron curtain. I have never had any doubt as to what would be the effect of the conquest of eastern Europe by those people. I said, long before the last war started, that the natural frontier between Europe and Asia was the Vistula River. But where is it to-day? It runs from the Adriatic, right through Berlin, on to the North Sea; and a good deal of what is really Europe is under a foreign, Communist, Asiatic domination. I remember that, at the signing of the peace pact between Russia and Japan, M . Stalin said to Matsuoka, the Japanese Ambassador, that it was a pact between fellow Asiatics. Their whole idea, everything that they stand for, are as foreign to the interests, the aims, the objectives and the life of our community, as one thing could be to another. There is only one thing for the Commonwealth Government to do, and that is to root this organization out quick and early. I tell the Labour party that the conflict ahead of it is not so much a conflict betwen it and the Opposition in this chamber, as a conflict between it and the death adder which it is tolerating inside its own show. This debate has become regularized by reason of a speech of considerable virulence which was delivered by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr When I first entered the Parliament his Harrison). It has become more regularized by reason of the fact that the Attorney-General's Department is under discussion, and the honourable member for Wentworth has declared that the Commonwealth Investigation Service should be employed for the purpose of inquiring into the ramifications of Communists. I heard the speech of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). AlthoughI appreciated its temperate tone, I take leave to urge against it that the unions must do more in regard to the Communists. Unless the Labour party prevents the infiltration of the Communists into the unions to such an extent that they would become numeriit will be undone. I have expressed that view before, and I repeat it now. The Labour party must take steps to prevent Communist-controlled unions from acting inimically to the best interests of the party. There are many reasons why we should take a definite stand against the Communists. They are loyal only to a foreign power; they are anti-Christian in their outlook. The latter reason alone is sufficient for us to condemn them. supplemented by the Opposition. raised by the interjection, I can only say that a Communist stood against me at tlie last election. only against Labour candidates. ceived a great deal of support from the Liberals. As I am convinced that Communists are anti-Christian in their outlook, and are opposed to the best interest of the Labour party and of the country, I believe that they should be condemned. For the reasons that I have given, the Labour party must take a definite stand against them. Something must be done about those unions which have a majority of Communists among their members. I have listened to the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) on a number of occasions in this chamber, hut never with more interest than to-night. resonant voice filled the chamber and commanded the attention of honourable members of all parties.

He was emphatic in the view that'the Labour party would have to take a f i r m stand against the Communists, or be undone. No truer words have ever been spoken in this chamber. I go further, and say that, the freedom-loving people of Australia must take a stand against the Communists, or be undone. facing a crisis in the affairs of the nation and, indeed, of the world. Although the nations have only recently emerged from the most terrible war in history, an even more terrible experience is not a distant possibility, but a probability. The hope of mankind is that another conflict w ill be averted, but there tial. On the 1st November, 1939, the is great fear that another war is not f a r distant. Should-war come, the power of the Soviet Union w ill be opposed to that of the United States of America and the other democratic nations. An y one who studies world affairs must realize that mankind to-day is beset by the fear of another war and, therefore, Australia must take a realistic view of world conditions and give careful thought to the security of the Commonwealth. Where does our security lie? Should war come, Australia cannot do other than take its part on the side of the United States of America, a nation which is making every effort to counteract Communist infiltration of its own administration. Last week the Secretary of Statef or the United States of America issued instructions that any person in the employ of the United States Government who had Oommunist connexions must vacate his -position. That is an indication of how seriously the nation which would be our most powerful ally in the event of war regards the menace of communism. We can best judge our friends and our enemies from our experience of them. Now that the subject of Communist in filtration has been raised, I propose to refer to the past activities of Communists as a guide to what we may expect in the future. The war broke out on the 3rd September, 1939. On the 9th September, the Communist executive in Australia issued a manifesto in which the following passage occurred:The honourable gentleman is We stand for the full weight of Australian man-power and .resources, and for the. organization and training of forces to fight overseas. Then, on the 3rd October, after Molotov and Ribbentrop made their pact for the partition of Poland, the Communists in Australia issued the following statement :The destruction of Hitlerism can be safely left to the people of Germany themselves. This would be greatly assisted by the restoration of peace. ""We are Thus, the Communists first pledged themselves to the support of an all-out Australian war effort. Then, after the pact had been concluded between Russia and Germany, they said that the destruction of Hitlerism could properly be lef t to the German people themselves, and that the conclusion of peace was the first essengeneral secretary of the Iron workers Union, Mr Thornton, published the following statement in the Ironworker:The Federal Management Committee of the Iron workers declares the war should cease. That was when H it l e r was astride of Poland. He had blitzed his way toWarsaw, and it appeared as if he had Europe at his feet. MrJ . B . Miles, chairman of the Communist party in Australia, stated in the Communist Reviewf or November, 1939All must turn, and force their governmentsto turn, against the war. It had by then, in the Communist view, become an imperialistic war. Statements of this kind did 'not emanate only from Mr Thornton and Mr Miles. A certain very influential member of the Labour party in the House of Representatives was at the same time enunciating the same kind of sentiments. I ' quote from Hansard the following statement which he made on the 16th November, 1939, about the same time as Mr Thornton and Mr Miles were making' their declarations :, Instead of carrying on this stupid conflict,, an effort should be made at the earliest moment to summon a conference of the major powers for the purpose of ending it. That statement was made during a debate on the war by the gentleman who is now Minister forTransport in the Chifley Government, Mr E. J. ""Ward. I wish to point particularly to the connection between the dates of the statements made by this Minister and by the Communist leaders, which show that, although Labour members deny all connection with the Communists, we nevertheless find some of them in this Parliament following the line advocated by the Communists outside. In 1940, the Communists went very close to capturing the Labourmovement. En a vote taken on the 16th April, 1940, which was before Russia came into the war, a motion introduced by Mr Thornton at the congress of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, 65 votes to 63. This motion urged the ending of the war and the conclusion of peace straight away. It was in the form of an amendment to a motion which had been tabled by one of the more responsible delegates to the effect that the working class and the trade union movement should give their full weight to the prosecution of the war. On the 15th April next, the Communists started an anti-conscription drive, and held parades all over the country in opposition to conscription. That was before Russia came into the war. In April, 1940, the Menzies Government declared the Communist party an illegal organization. In June of the following year, Hitler invaded Russia, and, within a few weeks, the Communists, who had been opposing the war as an imperialist war began to clamour for a second front to help Russia, and to advocate conscription in Australia. There can be no doubt, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), that the Communists serve only one master. That master is a foreign power, and that foreign power is the most likely enemy that this country can have if there should be another war. I propose to review the attitude of this Government to the menace of Communist infiltration, and I cite the case of a gentleman named Rudkin, who has been previously mentioned in the Parliament. Et illustrates how tenderly the ComUr. Anthony. munists have been dealt with, particularly by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman). It furnishes, indeed, an. example of how not to deal with Communists. I quote the following from the newspaper West Australian of the 7th June, 1940:Acting under National Security Eegulations, police yesterday made, three arrests in Perth. The arrested men and the charges against them were as follows:Rudkin, Arthur William (31), journalist, charged that he, between 19th January and 2Sth May, in a manner likely to prejudice the eflicient prosecution of the war, published information purporting to be information with respect to matters .which might be useful to the enemy. The accused Rudkin was editor of tlie Workers' Star, one of the nine Communist was defeated by only publications which recently came under the ban of the Federal Government. Rudkin is also a senior air raids precaution warden for the Victorian Park district. He was arrested by detectives McLennon and Richards. I particularly emphasize the fact that. Rudkin was a senior air raids precaution warden how he was appointed, and what are the methods and tactics of the Communist in getting members of the party appointed to key positions. I propose to show, also, how the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction connived at such action, and has since rewarded the Communists for their disloyalty to the country.' This appeared in the West Australian on the 11th June, four days laterRudkin was charged under section 10 of the National Security Act, Regulation 17. Rudkin. in defence, said he wanted the A.R.P. Act improved so that it would give better protection A letter found in possession of a man named Dean, who also was sentenced to sis months' gaol for offences under the National Security Regulation, stated This letter was initialled by Rudkin, who never contested its authenticity, and this is what he wrote to DeanI understand that with the exceptions of Comrade Zog and myself, the party membership in Western Australia ignored our circular advising that where possible they should become air wardens.",62,Blain H E Is An Able Man
253,Mr Dedman,Who appointed him?,64,Party Members As Air Raid Wardens
254,Mr Anthony,"I propose to showThis question should be taken up again. Victoria Park Victoria Park was the area in which Rudkin was senior air raid warden. . . is the most advanced suburb in this work. Others are extremely short of wardens. In North Perth, for instance, there are only three wardens. Over 100 are required. Any party member becoming an air raid warden in a suburb where there is an extreme shortage would be sure of almost immediate promotion to the rank of senior warden (about twenty required in each ward). Party members not known as such would have a fair chance-of promotion to a position to get more confidential information than I have any chance of getting. Xhe question of A.R.P. is sure to give rise to some considerable mass agitation in the event of gas being used in the present war, and . we will have a much better chance of leading this agitation if we have plenty of men on the inside of the organization. The portion of the letter which I quote,' strictly fro m the newspaper report, which was not read out in court, dealt, among other things, with gases which might be used in air raids, and the alleged possession by GreatB r it a in of a special gas, and methods of gas protection. That portion of the letter was not read out in court, because at that time we were in the middle of the war and the magistrate forbade publication of it . That portion concluded w it h the following words:[ suggest that the above information be passed on to Comrade J. B. M. before he leaves, as it would not be safe to send it through the mail "" J . B . M . "" , it was revealed, was Mr -T. B . Miles, the chairman of the Communist party in Australia, and the "" C.P.G.B. "" was later revealed to stand for the Communist party of Great Britain He should be asked to pass the information on to the C.P.G.B. if there is any means of sending them an uncensored communication. I have reason to believe that all letters going into Great Britain are subject to a strict censorship. Probably the C.P.G.B. knows of the above facts, but, if so, it is strange that they have not worked out a way of making use of them. The Crown Prosecutor in the case, Mr Lappin,.also quoted the following passage from the introductory part of the letter written by Rudkin: This information is not supposed to have been given to any Australian below the rank of Deputy Head Warden, but the anti-gas lecturer at Victoria Park passed it on to a group of wardens and senior wardens in great confidence. I am simply stating the factual position in respect of this case. The magistrate, Mr Wallwork, in . sentencing Rudkin to four months imprisonment saidIf this letter of the accused was quite an honest one, written with the object of getting more adequate air-raid protection, why should that information have to be communicated in a form that would escape censorship? The last paragraph of the letter obviously deals with the white-anting of the A.R.P. organization by the introduction of Communist party members and the meaning of the concluding sentence, concerning the leading of a'mass agitation is quite clear. The magistrate sentenced Rudkin to imprisonment for four months. A t the conclusion of the case, the prosecutor said that the question had been asked what the authorities would do after sentences in such cases had expired. I shall show what happened after the sentence imposed upon Rudkin expired. On the 16th A p r i l last, the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) raised this matter, and asked the Ministerf o r Post-war Reconstruction, who is in control of the Council for .Scientific and Industrial Research, which is handling one of the most i m portant phases of our defence, whether Rudkin was an officer in the employ of the Councilf o r Scientific and Industrial Research and whether the Minister had in fact approved of his appointment. The honourable member went on to point out the history of this individual as I have related it , and the Minister, in his reply, saidThe appointment of any official to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is governed by the act, which provides that the Minister may approve recommendations by the executive. At the time. I approved the recommendation for the appointment of Mr RudkinI was not aware of his alleged record. I do not believe that some of the statements which have been made concerning Mr Rudkin are correct. That was on the 16th A p r i l . I ask the Minister now if he has ascertained whether those statements are correct, and whether Rudkin is still employed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. If he is, I want to know whether it is the reward of a traitor to be given confidential employment in one of the most vital departments of government in Australia. I point out also that the leopard has not changed his spots; because in October, 1946, this same Mr tion, Mr Chairman, to the disorderly Rudkin who was sentenced to imprisonment for four months for an attempt to betray Australia in 1940, wrote in a paper called The Focus the following article:Naturally, politicians as dumb as Truman and Bevin are dumb enough to try to use compulsion on scientists, and in an attempt to terrorize them, have imposed heavy gaol sentences on two leading physicists, Dr. Alan Nunn May and Dr. Charles Boyer, for carrying on the perfectly normal scientific activity of discussing their work with fellow-scientists of a nation to which Mr Churchill, when Prime Minister, pledged all possible scientific and technical assistance . . . That sympathetic reference to Dr. Alan Nunn May is a reference to a scientist who was sentenced to ten years penal servitude for attempting to betray the atom bomb secret. This is what. Mr ransom. Because of their control of key Rudkin wrote about Dr. Nunn May and his colleagueScientists, in short, are getting tired of churning out discoveries to be used by brass hats, crooked politicians, and mud-brained profiteers for their anti-social ends. That was written hy Mr 'Rudkin less than a year ago. He is the gentleman who was appointed to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. It is time that we took some kind of a stand on this issue. Many members of the Labour party profess hostility to communism. I do not doubt that in this respect their interests are identical with our own. On an issue such as this honourable members on both sides of the cham.ber should be able to combine in an attack upon a common enemy but, unfortunately, such.a combination has not been .possible because, while honourable members opposite profess to condemn communism they apologize for Communists when any effort is made to deal with their activities. In concluding his speech, the .honourable member for Hunter said, "" I hold no brief for the Communists "" ; but nobody, not even a King's counsel, could have :put up a better defence for them than did ithe honourable member to-night. Mr Anthony. sition stand on the matter? interjection by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), who, as Speaker of the House, should know better. A great deal was made by 'the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) of the bill which he introduced a few months ago making it a penal offence for any person to interfere with an approved defence project, such as the guided weapons testing range, in Central Australia; but the damage which the Communists may do in preventing the execution of such a project is as nothing compared with the harm they might do by exercising the power they possess over the key unions of Australia. That danger was referred to in pointed terms by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brenaian) during this debate. To-day, the Communists, as the agents of a foreign power, hold Australia to unions in this country at the behest of their masters they .can precipitate strikes in industries of all kinds, tie up transport, bring about stoppages on our railway systems and close down our munitions factories, and they will do it unless strong action is taken by the Government to put ithem in a place where they can no longer exercise their power. The honourable member for Batman says that something must be done to counter this menace, that ithe Labour party itself must tackle the desperate problem -which faces the people to-day because of the activities of these agents of a foreign power. I propose to quote the opinions which were uttered by an English gentleman who, before the outbreak of World WaT II . , in 1939, was scorned as a warmonger. Dealing with the Communist menace, this .gentleman saidCommunism is not only a creed -It is a plan of campaign. A Communist is not only the holder of certain .opinions; he is the pledged adept of a well-thought-out means of enforcing .them . . . The method of enforcement is as much a part of the Communist faith as the doctrine itself.

The scope of the debate on these Estimates has, however, been widened to include the whole of the ramifications -of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, and a discussion of what activities should be engaged in by that organiza-. -tion. Many honourable members have, I am afraid, abused the privileges of debate during the discussion of these Estimates. I shall allow the honourable member to continue, but I ask him not to digress too widely from the Estimates before the committee. whose words I have quoted is no less a person than Mr Winston Churchill, who uttered those words in 1937, two years before the outbreak of World War II . Mr Churchill was then scorned as an unrealist; but had it not been for his clear vision of the dangers of Hitlerism and communism the world might have been very different from what it is to-day. Mr Churchill continuedFree speech, the right of public meeting, every form of lawful political agitation and constitutional right are paraded and asserted. Yet honourable members opposite have the member's time has expired. for the Interior) [9.15] -The discussion of the estimates for the Attorney General's Department has been cunningly used by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) as a vehicle for launching an attack upon the Labour party for its alleged attachment to the Communist party. No such attachment exists. The Communist party is equally the opponent of the Labour party as are the Opposition parties in this chamber. The Communist party has one objective only, namely, to bring about the destruction of the Labour movement and of Labour governments in the State and Commonwealth spheres. All the allegations that have been hurled against the Labour party to-night have been intended to demonstrate, not to this Parliament but to the people outside, that there is some connection between the Comnaiuinist party and the Labour movement;but the people will not be fooled in this way. They know that the Labour party [21.1 has put up a redoubtable fight against Communist elements both inside and outside of the trade union movement. How was the Communist party able to gain a footing in this country? In order to answer this question one must go back to the days when 800,000 men and women in this country were unemployed and on the point of starvation. Mass unemployment constituted a happy breeding ground for the spread of Communist propaganda. At every street corner the representatives of the Communist party pleaded with the people to contribute 6d. towards the party funds, promising to obtain better conditions for themi. At that timetbe governments in office in this country were those led by the parties now in opposition in this chamber. Honourable members opposite were themselves the creators of the conditions which brought about the spread of communism. Governments supported by them had been in office in the Commonwealth for 25 long years. As soon as the anti-Labour Government took office it hamstrung or repealed the wise legislation placed on the statute book by the Fisher Labour Government. honourable audacity to criticize the Labour movement and Labour governments. Where would this country have been to-day had not a Labour government come to the rescue of the people in 1940 ? Honourable members opposite may try to live down their past administrative misdeeds, but as long as I have breath left in my body they will not be permitted to do so. As a Western Australian, I am well aware of the vulnerability of Western Australia to attack at the time the Curtin Government answered the call of the people to put the defences of this country in order. Opposition members interjecting, tion members are endeavouring to interrupt the Minister's speech. They were given an uninterrupted hearing, and I insist that the Minister also be heard in silence.

262,Mr Johnson,"When I was amen not to join their unions. In almost every instance, employers gave preference iu employment to those Communists, whose main task was to spread that propaganda. I know this to be true because I had to fight the Communists on the mining fields. Supporters of the Opposition parties are the ones who have been responsible for the growth of communism. The Australian ""Workers Union has been mentioned in this debate, and my name has been coupled with that organization by certain speakers. I point out that when the Australian Workers' Union had a rule that gave to its executive the power to reject a nomination for membership if it found that, the nominee was a member of the Communist party, a government formed by the parties now in Opposition compelled the union to amend that rule. I was one of those members of the Labour movement who originally opposed the lifting of the ban on the Communist party, but after I had heard certain arguments advanced, and in the light of my own experience when I , too, had to endure victimization, I changed my views. I recall the days when a man who had an Australian Workers Union membership ticket in his swag could not get a job in the shearing sheds. We had to fight for our jobs from shed to shed. I support the view that little can be gained by oppression. I believe that the Communist party and any other organization that is opposed to the demobers are endeavouring to pull the wool cratic principles according to which we are governed cannot live in the open in this country. We can disregard most of the talk that we hear from the Opposition benches about Communists. We can' have little faith in the views of honourable members opposite on this subject, because at election times Labour candidates almost without exception are opposed by Communists. In almost every election that I have fought I have had a Communist candidate opposed to me. I have heard a Gommunist candidate read telegrams from members of the parties now in Opposition in this Parliament asking that the second preferences of Communist supporters be given to the Liberal party candidate, Mr Lee. Opposition members Mr Johnson. does not hurt at times. I do not speak cft-en in this chamber, but I have had long experience and have fought many political battles. Opposition members have talked glibly in this debate about communism and the Government's responsibility to suppress it ; but I have not been misled. There is an election pending in Victoria, and, as I said in my opening remarks, this debate has been cleverly manoeuvred by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, purely for propaganda purposes. That is the only reason why I have risen to-night. I repeat that almost without exception, Labour candidates have been opposed by Communists at election times, but in only a few instances have Communists opposed Liberal or Australian Country party candidates because they all work hand in hand. Where the Communists obtain their finance I do not know, but they seem to have ample funds. A practice has grown up amongst opponents of Labour to condemn, as a Communist, any militant unionist who has the courage to stand up for the conditions to which he is entitled under his award, or for an improvement of his award. The Australian Workers Union, with 120,000 members, is the biggest union in Australia, but throughout the whole of the Commonwealth, not one official of that organization could be charged with being a Communist. Opposition memover the eyes of the people. Their aim is not the betterment of this country;, they are doing exactly what the Communists want them to do, namely, contributing to the destruction of the Australian Labour movement; but they have a big job'in front of them. Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) has said truly that the Communist party is endeavouring to destroy the Labour movement. It is attempting to destroy all constitutional government in this country, and the Labour movement has formed part of that constitutional government. I believe that it is not without significance in this debate that Labour speakers have included two meminterjecting, bers of the legal profession who probably",67,Party Members As Air Raid Wardens

264,Mr Holt (Eawkner) [9.25],"Th ecan exercise some measure of independence, and two other members of the party who have been directly associated with the Australian ""Workers Union-the one union in the Commonwealth, and a very powerful union, that has endeavoured to make a real fight against Communist infiltration into trade union affairs. I should like to hear from some other Government supporters, who so far have not had either the courage or the opportunity to speak so frankly. They know that a very real influence is still exercised and will continue to be exercised in Labour party affairs, particularly in pre-selection ballots, by unions which are acknowledged to be dominated by Communists. It is a pity that the Minister for the Interior did not attempt to discuss the really grave problem concerning this country at presenta problem that has been made graver by developments since this Parliament last discussed communism early this year. One important development has been the re-creation of the Comintern, a move that is accepted throughout the world as being of the utmost significance-the open resumption by the Communist party and by the Russian Government of international activity with a view to installing Communist inspired regimes throughout the world. vividly home to us in Australia by what has occurred in Canada and the United States of America in recent times. In Canada a royal commission discovered a sprawling Russian fifth column permeating, every stratum of Canadian life designed to seek information that would be useful in the event of another warAccording to the A.P.A. report the organization discovered was on three levels: (1) an inner circle of Russian agents, taking orders direct from Moscow; (2) a middle circle of detached and paid professional spies-all , it is believed, Canadian citizens: (3) Communist civil servant 'red-ants or subjects of blackcharges as the Minister for the Interior mail, who willingly or unwillingly made available government secrets. The Canadian Communist party was ""deeply involved"", and one of its members had been arrested. While inquiries were proceeding Moscow countered brazenly. Admitting that it had obtained information from certain Canadian citizens, it blustered that the information was valueless in view of the superior technical development of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Honourable members who have studied the report of the royal commission will recall that the witness Gouzenko claimed then what has been shown to be ifact, that the Comintern had not been dissolved but was continuing and that Communist parties throughout the world were being made the tool of Soviet policy. We have to make up our minds whether this development is occurring in Australia. Not only has it been clearly shown to be occurring in Canada, but J. E. Hoover, the principal executive of the Bureau of Investigation in the United States of America, giving evidence recently before the House of Representatives Appropriation Committee, saidCommunists have penetrated every field of activity in the United States of America, and over tbe last few years the penetration has been intensified. He was giving evidence on the Appropriation B ill as relating to the Department of Justice. He said that Communists had penetrated into radio, newspaper, motion picture and labour organizations spheres and for every one of the 74,000 memers of the Communist party there were ten other individuals ready to do the party's work. The Minister for the Interior and the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Williams) claim that economic conditions created communism. I assure them that if they regard that as the explanaThat is brought tion, they will err greatly in handling this problem. Communism has developed in countries with the highest standard of living as well as in countries with low standards of living. Nor is communism confined to people on depressed living standards. In the United States of America, Canada and this country you find Conumiunists among some of the comfortably situated citizenry and the best educated and best placed people in the community. Do not bluff yourselves that communism is a purely economic problem. Its roots go much deeper than that. The Government could employ itself more usefully than by making such counter made in his utterances by asking itself whether, there is any evidence of a link between the Communist party of Australia and the government of Soviet Russia. It is beyond dispute that many of the leading figures in the Communist party of Australia have, at some time or other, received tutelage in the Russian Lenin-Marxist Institute. That is beyond argument. It iswell established. We have it on record in an official publication of the Communist party. I quote from tbe pamphlet No War on Soviet Russia, published by tbe Central Committee of the Communist party of Australia and written by Comrade R. Dixon, one of the best-known figures in the Communist movement in Australia. either. for Reid, who has made a close study of communism in Australia, says that that is not his right name. Undoubtedly we see only a small part of the total Communist activity in this country reflected in those who openly declare themselves to be Communists. We know that there are others working underneath who can carry on if those who openly avow themselves as Communists are touched by the government of the day. Under the heading "" Communism is Foreign "", Comrade Dixon wroteW. M . Hughes, and other gentlemen of his ilk, tell us that communism is foreign to Ausout, it constituted a very ugly incident, and it tralian conceptions and that the working class w ill have nothing to do with socialism. The Communist party, they solemnly assert, is a subversive organization under foreign domination-it is directed from Moscow. Well! Well! Well1 Perhaps they would prefer that the Communist party be directed from Canberra. Or better still, from Downing-street. Then .with a sneering reference to the fact that my leader, the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies), declared war on the Communists in the I place these facts on record because name of the people of Australia, and the 'honourable members and such members of right honourable member for North the general public as may be listening to Sydney( Mr Hughes) wanted conscripthis debate may be able to determine for tion in this country, he went on to sayThe Communist party in this country has themselves whether it can really be grow=n out of the fertile soil of the class alleged, as two honourable members oppostruggle in Australia and bases itself upon site have tried to allege, that the Opposithe best traditions of the working-class movetion is trying to make a mountain out of ment.

The resolution said this in relation to the guided weapons project in Central Australia and the attempt by the Communist party to prevent the project from being proceeded withI t is apparent that the propaganda recently issued by the Communist party in connection with this undertaking is for the sole purpose of defeating the Australian Defence Policy in the interests of a foreign power. So the Labour party was at last convinced. The Attorney-General himself has become convinced, because, commenting on the circumstances of the resolution, he saysAlthough the attempt has temporarily fizzled has undoubtedly opened many eyes to the menace to the Australian defence interests involved in a facile acceptance of proposals put forward by members of the Communist party. For, although the Central Committee of that party late in the day openly dissociated the party from the boycott move, tlie evidence of its Communist origin is too strong to be put aside. . . . In other words, it was not a humanitarian object, but a political amd international objective which was being pursued. a molehill. Is it a molehill if the Federal couch a resolution in those terms?

266,Mr Holt,"The honourable memberthe responsibility of Australian security, could even regard such a problem as lightly as many of this Government's supporters apparently do. I say that more government supporters should have risen to-night as the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) did to condemn communism. General himself claimed, when we were debating this matter earlier this year, that condemnation and criticism were the best weapons with which to fight communism. If that be so, honourable members opposite, instead of attacking us, should join with us in our attempts to elements that comprise the trade union open the eyes of the people to the danger that threatens them. candidates give preference to Communists on their ""how-to-vote"" cards? the honourable member's interjection. The Leader of the Opposition, for one, must have recollections of the way in which the Labour party instructed its supporters in the Kooyong electorate to give their second preference to his Communist party opponent. Other honourable members on this side of the chamber have similar recollections. I have had Communist opponents in my electorate, and they have always been placed at the bottom of my "" how-to-vote "" list. Can it be claimed that the Opposition is making. a mountain out of a molehill when Comrade Thornton, one of the leading exponents of communism and one of the ablest trade union leaders in the country, is able to state that tbe Communist party almost completely dominates the trade union movement? Ti.e Minister for the Interior said a few minutes ago that members of the Labour party have been fighting communism all their lives. Other Ministers and supporters of the Government have made similar declarations. Nevertheless, a few weeks ago, Thornton was able to say that, but for a few "" twisters"", tbe Communist group would have completely dominated the trade union congress in Victoria. He claimed that the Communist policy prevailed on every issue of consequence at the congress and that the Communist forces were defeated only when a secret ballot was held. That inditives and methods and publish the names cates the measure of success which hasattended the Labour party's efforts to combat communism in Australia! The Communist-dominated union groups have assumed almost complete control of the trade union movement, which, in the words of Mr Kennelly, a member of the The AttorneyVictorian Government, determines the policy that the Labour party"" shall follow. Mr Kennelly made that statement publicly ata Trades Union Congress at Toronto. ""We are there to do what the trade union movement tells us to do "", he said. What are the movement? But for a few votes, apparently, the movement would be controlled by the groups dominated by Mr Thornton and his colleagues. We, on this side of the chamber, have no fight with the Government and its supporters on this issue if they are determined to fight communism with us. Let them come out in the open and aline themselves on our side. We believe that the most effective way to meet the Communist menace is, not to establish some elaborate gestapo organization or to employ repressive tactics, but to bring home clearly to the Australian people the real significance of the movement so that they will understand what its activities will lead to in this country. That is what the Government should be doing. We believe, as the Government claims to believe, that the overwhelming mass of Australians are loyal to the country and to its democratic institutions. However, because the Government is -not prepared to come out in the open and fight, it is allowing the Communist influences which dominate the trade union movement to dominate, in turn, the political life of the country. We press for a public inquiry into Communist activities in Australia. When we did so previously, the Attorney-General said that such an inquiry would perhaps disclose what the Government was doing and thus might embarrass it in the pursuit of ifs own inquiries. That was not a satisfactory -reply to our demand. It is not sufficient for the Government merely to have a lot of information at its disposal.

268,Mr Holt,"I am interested to hearof its leading figures. Tlie Communists should be made -to declare what they are doing and where they secure the funds which enable them to maintain throughout tlie Commonwealth newspapers that no other political party could afford to maintain. They should be made to declare how they secure specially favorable treatment from the Government which enables them to obtain newsprint as they desire it, .and to have twelve telemark about septuagenarian judges. He phones installed at Marx House in Sydney at a time when thousands of decent, patriotic citizens cannot secure telephones either for business or for priTerritory ( Mr Blain), who visited the vate purposes. How do these people secure such favorable treatment, and how is it that some of the leading Communists of Australia are able to go abroad under the auspices of this Government and have their expenses paid by the taxpayers? Is that the way to fight communism? Of course it is not! It is time that the Goverament realized what it should be doing to defeat communism. I refer now to another matter which should not be allowed to pass without comment in this chamber and which should be cleared up promptly. Apparently the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) spoke in the Domain in Sydney during the week-end on the subject of the nationalization of banking and said some very disparaging things about the supreme judiciary in this country, namely, the High Court of Australia. kind. I referred to the judges as septuagenarians, which they are. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -Order! What the honourable member for Dalley said in the Domain on Sunday has nothing to do with the proposed vote which is now under discussion. Domain on Sunday in relation to the High Court has a great deal to do with the proposed vote for the Attorney General's Department. The High Court is one of the prime responsibilities of the Attorney-General, and if there are people in high and responsible positions in Australia who seek to damage that institution by derogatory references to it, I want to know whether the Attorney General, or whoever speaks for him in this place during his absence abroadthe Prime Minister for preferenceintends to make any pronouncement or take any action in Telation .to those derogatory remarks. The honourable member for Dalley has stated, by interjection, that all he said on Sunday was that the High Court judges are septuagenarians. Presumably he made some other reference to them too. He would not just make a remust have said also that they had done something or had failed to do something. The honourable member for the Northern Domain on Sunday, and who claims to have heard what was said, has made a statement which I propose to repeat. If the honourable member for Dalley is misquoted in that statement he will have an opportunity to say so. The honourable member for the Northern Territory claims that the honourable member for Dalley, referring to 'the judgment of the High Court in the recent banking case, said that seven incompetent septuagenarians had defied the people of this country. I do not suppose ithat the honourable member will deny having talked about seven septuagenarians, and presumably he spoke of them in an unflattering sense because of the action that they had taken in respect of the High Court judgment. retired. able member for Dalley has not gone quite so far as the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward), who would do away with them altogether as a court of appeal in this country. The honourable member was a former associate of the Minister for Transport, and, no doubt, when the Minister recently referred to judges of the Arbitration Court being overfed and under-worked, there was a sympathetic response in his breast, because now he has attacked the competency and capability of the judges of the High Court. Let us assume that , all of them were in their seventies, as the honourable member for Dalley suggested. Even that does not excuse offensive references to the highest judiciary in this land, functioning under the Constitution of the Commonwealth. But,",71,Party Members As Air Raid Wardens

272,Mr Holt,"Apparentl y the honorat least, if any one is to make offensive remarks of this kind, let those comments -be accurate. On examining tbe details, because I took the trouble to do so when I heard the speech of the honourable member for the Northern Territory to-day, I find that four judges of the High Court have ages ranging from 55 to 61 years. That is not a very senior age for men who are expected to have had long experience in the legal and judicial life of this country. ber for Dalley must be in that age group. ing three justices of the High Court is the Chief Justice, Sir John Latham. If there is a more alert, intelligent mind either in this chamber or outside it, I should like to be told who it is. I do not honourable member for Dalley to speak on believe that any one who has any knowledge of Sir John Latham and his ability would claim that the High Court is badly served by his presence on it. Nor are the remaining members by any means the least competent of those upon the Bench. The honourable member for Dalley cannot have forgotten so quickly that he was a member of a caucus which elected to ministerial office not very long ago a gentleman aged 77 years. So let him be accurate and fair. He knows that the Standing Orders of .this Parliament preclude honourable members from making offensive and derogatory references to the judiciary of this country, and when he goes outside the Parliament to make statements which are undoubtedly offensive and intended to weaken the confidence and faith of his listeners in the High Court, he should have some regard both to accuracy and to his responsibilities to the community. This is a well-known technique which is practised by those wbo desire to destroy democracy. The Communists have exploited it in relation to the Arbitration Court. They set out to sabotage that tribunal by disChairman when the committee began to crediting it, and they have succeeded in doing so. The Government itself has now taken action to deprive the court of a large measure of its authority. What will be the results of that action only time will tell; but, at least, the Communists have succeeded in doing what they set out to do, namely, discredit the arbitration institution of this country. Now they are seeking to discredit our other judicial tribunals, and this Parliament. He is a foolish man, regardless of where he sits in this chamber, who aids and abets the work that the Communists are trying to do by attempting in turn to discredit these democratic instrumentalities. I hope that we shall not hear any more of this talk from the honourable member for Dalley, the Minister for Transport, and others who, in the past, have been all too free with their attacks on and their criticisms of the highest tribunals in this land. as to forestall the usual drivel that we hear about my leaving the Chair in order to take part in a debate, I am now, in committee, exercising my right as' the this particular subject.

Russia was the breeding ground of communism, which has spread throughout Europe because of the sufferings of the European peoples. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to talk about feeding "" starving Europe"" ; the fact is that before the war millions of people in Europe were starving, and it was 'amongst those people that the doctrines of communism received such an impetus. In no country in the world to-day has communism a deeper root than in the countries where tyranny and oppression were roost rampant. In Asia we find that China is riddled with communism, and we know that China in the past was notorious for the starvation and oppression endured by its people. Of the countries in which communism has taken root it is notable that its spread has been most prolific in those which experienced the greatest oppression by the reactionary forces which honourable members opposite seek to flatter to-day. We have heard a great deal about the growth of communism in Australia, but what has been the result of the elections for Commonwealth and State parliaments in this country? In practically every case the Communist candidates have forfeited their electoral deposits, and the significant fact is that where elections have been contested by representatives of the Australian Labour party and the Comimrunist party, the Liberal party and the Australian Country party have advised their supporters to give their Labour party and the alleged infiltration No. 1 vote to ibhe Communist representative.

Australia party, save in the case of Newcastle"". In my electorate there were, onlytwo candidates, Mr Cram, the Communist, and; myself. The official recommendation of both the United Country party and the United: Australia party was to vote Cram No. 1 and Knight No. 2. I have made no statements that I cannot back up with proof. I have given the date of the issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, which contains the advertisement which I have just read, and honourable members can read it in the library. That report shows that in 'the contest between the Ctammunist and Labour candidates the United Australia party and the United Country party advised voters to give the Communist candidate their No. 1 vote and the Australian Labour party candidate their No. 2 vote. When we consider things like that we wonder at the solicitude of honourable gentlemen opposite for the Australian of Communisits into that party. The honourable member for Richmond House by the honourable member for New unfortunate choice. Under the protection of the privilege of the Parliament the honourable member for New England traduced the names of at least 40 citizens of Katoomba, New South Wales, all of challenged him to say outside Parliament what he had said inside it.

299,Mr Rosevear,"He saidof the privilege of parliamentary protection. Although he is aware of their challenge to him he continues to take refuge in the coward's castle and to avail himself of the privilege of Parliament to repeat the charges which he made against those people. Had there been no contradiction of the statement of the honourable member for New England there might have been some excuse for the assertion which the honourable member for Richmond made to-night, but the honourable member for Richmond knew perfectly well that the citizens whom his colleague had maligned as "" Communist sympathizers"", and even as outright Communists, had challenged the honourable gentleman to repeat his charges outside Parliament. Yet notwithstanding that, he chose to repeat to-night the charges which neither he nor the honourable irnember for New England were-o r are-gam e to repeat outside the precincts of the Parliament. The honourable gentlemen I have mentioned protest against attacks made in this Parliament on members of the judiciary and other prominent people in the community, yet they do not scruple to malign citizens under the shelter of parliamentary privilege. The honourable member for FawkneT ( Mr Holt) said that if government supporters were prepared to go out and fight the Communist party members of the Opposition parties would be with them. The point is that we do not want them to be with us; we can fight the Communists ourselves. And if honourable members examine the records of the men who control the governing bodies of the trade unions in this country, namely, the Australian Council of Trades Unions and the trades and labour councils in the various States, they will find that not one to be the Chief Justice or Lieutenantof them is controlled by members of the Communist party. It is true that there has been infiltration of Communists in those councils. No one denies that. But Opposition members ought to give to the Labour party the credit that in every State of the Commonwealth it has organized within the trade union movement to destroy whatever prestige or ground the Communist party has gained. Our position is not improved by the arguments of honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Batman Mr Rosevear. ( Mr Brennan) to-night spoke the truth. There has been infiltration. But that has been arrested. All parties have undesirables, even the Australian Country party and the Liberal party, and they are difficult to drive out. The line has to be drawn somewhere. I often wonder how some persons become members. As I view the matter, the organized Labour movement has been able' to hold the trade union fort, and to keep those forces in check. I know that certain organizations may be cited as having Communists as their leaders. Any organization has the right to choose its own leaders. Surely industrial organizations have not to bow the knee to honourable gentlemen opposite! There would not be a trade union if most of those honourable gentleman had their way. Industrial organizations can choose their leaders by the same democratic method as is adopted in connection -with the election of the members of this Parliament. The honourable member for Fawkner has referred to some statement which I am alleged to have made in a speech on the banking issue. I do not deny that I described the High Court as "" a bunch of learned septuagenarians "". I have since discovered that the average age of the justices is 66 years. The age of the eldest is 84 years, that of the next 75 years, that of the third 70 years, and those of the three youngest 60 years, 57 years, and 54 years. I do not deny that I challenged their judgment. I have a perfect right, as a public man, to express my opinion of a judgment of the High Court, whatever the age of the justices might be. I have done more. I do not hold that they are on such a pedestal as to be beyond reproach. A gentleman whom I believe Governor of Victoria, certainly a distinguished judge, took it upon himself recently to. lecture the parliaments of Australia. If the judiciary has the right to lecture the parliaments of Australia, those parliaments have the right to lecture the judiciary. I have done what most honourable gentlemen opposite have not done, in that I have read the judgment of each of the justices on the banking case. I would not say that they are merely political judgments, but I would say that if the one justice did not write all of them, one journalist did. I share the view of the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward), and always have, that no oourt in the land should be superior to the high court of the people, namely, the people's Parliament. I do not walk away from that; it is my view. mean nothing to the honourable gentleman? people to alter the Constitution. The High Court is placed on a pedestal, and one is supposed not to criticize its members. No acrobat in a circus has thrown more somersaults than has the High Court in the judgments it has delivered over the last twenty years. How can any one talk about the High Court always being right? What about the James case, in which only one justice-the present Commonwealth Attorney-General -wa s right, and the rest of the justices were wrong? Since all of those justices were proved to be wrong in their interpretation of legislation that had been passed by this Parliament, and only one justice was proved to be right been. The presence here of the honourable gentleman also is accidental. for twenty years. cannot be blamed for that. WhatI am trying to emphasize is that if an honourable member, whether he be the Speaker of the House or only a private member, is to be precluded in a democratic country ifrom challenging a decision of the High Court, from commenting on that decision, as well as upon the ages of the justices, questioning whether they should be permitted to remain on the bench until they retire voluntarily or die by four years in stating the average age. If it be right to retire public servants at a certain age, why should it not be right to retire members of the judiciary? gentleman apply that to politicians? doing so. Not very many of them are over 60 years of age. I offer no apology for what I said, even though I imay be said to have spoken at that meeting on banking legislation as the Speaker of the House, which I did not profess to do; I went there as the member for Dalley, in which capacity I am speaking now. is entitled to do that. views on that judgment, and on the competency of men of the ages of the justices of the High Court to continue to pass judgment on highly important matters. I repeat them here, and offer no apology for them. man may not criticize the judiciary in this Parliament. ing it. The committee is considering the estimates of a department which pays the salaries of the justices of the High Court. If I hold the view that those justices ought to be retired at the same age as are public servants, I am entitled to say that we ought not to continue to pay their salaries after they have passed that age. I am not walking away from that. States. M i . ROSEVEAR I understand that there is a retiring age in the States. The position should not be different in the Commonwealth. That is all that I have to say on that point. I emphasize that before Opposition members seek to lecture the Australian. Labour party on the infiltration of the Communist party, or ask us to root out the Communist party, lock, stock and barrel, and to suppress that organization, they ought at least to ensure that their own leaders are unanimous in the views that they hold in the matter. Honourable members opposite speak of the infiltration of Communists, but they will not do anything about it so long as the Leader of one Opposition party says, "" I will suppress them"", whilst the other says, "" I will keep them alive "".",75,Party Members As Air Raid Wardens

MENZIES (Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [10.21] -In view of certain matters which have occurred during the debate, I think that I should express my own views on two of them, at any rate. The first of them is the second matter referred to by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), namely, the matter of the High Court. It is not a discussion in which I take part very willingly, because I think that it is a sound rule of the Parliament that the personal qualifications of judges should not be canvassed in this place. I refer to the matter only to draw attention to a vital distinction which the honourable member for Dalley has overlooked, but which Mr Speaker, in other circumstances, would see like a flash. It is this: Nobody has ever pretended that a judgment given by a learned judge of the High Court cannot be diseussed, provided that the person who discusses the judgment is competent to do so. All the legal .journals are f u l l of discussions of judghe will, or at least he should, remember, ments that have been given. I myself have, on more than one occasion, contributed to legal journals articles examining some judgments of-the High Court, and offering criticism of them. It is quite right that at all times there should be critical and informed contributions in relation to professional matters. But when a man who knows nothing about it proceeds to offer a criticism of a judgment given on a legal problem, he undertakes a considerable task. Even then, he -might be forgiven, because "" a cat may look at a k in g "" ; but it is an entirely different matter when he discusses the merits of a judgment-whethe r it is in accordance with the law, or expresses the true view of the Constitution, or where he turns to personal abuse' of the judges who delivered the judgment. The honourable member for Dalley can hardly escape from the consequences of his own words in the Domain by professing that he did not say anything about incompetent septuagenarians, but that he merely referred to septuagenarians; that, in other words, he merely said to a crowd of people, many of whom were willing to be hostile to the judiciary, that these were a lot of men too old to do their jobs. He meant that they were incompetent to do their job. learned septuagenarians. I heard him. speech in my own way without much assistance from the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan), though I am bound to say .that he usually assists me. able gentleman think that Mr Justice Rich is too old ? ber for Watson( Mr Ealstein) was for one brief period of his life a practitioner of the law. As such, he must have become acquainted with the fact that by the decision of the people of Australia-the very same decision as that by which they wrote the banking power into the Constitution-the y provided that justices of the High Court should be appointed for life. If the honourable member has the faintest recollection of the few fragments of law with which he became acquainted that some of the most distinguished lawyers who have sat on the Bench have been men of advanced years. Every time. I hear people say, as the honourable member for Dalley has said to-night, that a judge ought to be treated as a civil servant and be retired at 65 years of age, I cannot help reminding myself that the law reports of my own State would not have been enriched as they have been were it not for judgments delivered by Sir Leo Cussen, who, in the f u l l height of his power, was sitting on the Bench at 75 years of age delivering judgments which were masterpieces of learning. Some of the best men who have sat on the High Court and on the Privy Council Gavan Duffy? interjection that the honourable member for Dalley desires to say something detrimental concerning the late Mr Justice Gavan Duffy. The only effect of this exchange is to make it clear that the honourable member for Dalley intended to be personally abusive to the judges. That is all.

330,Mr Menzies,"I am not growling.my own behalf, and on behalf of tbe party which I lead, have indicated that, in the circumstances then existing, we did not propose that the Communist party should be banned. In 1940, we, in fact, banned the Communist party because, at that time, its members were engaged in treasonable operations in time of war. I have repeatedly stated that my own mind on this matter is that, in time of peace, all doubts ought to be resolved, as far as practicable, in favour of freedom of speech; and that, therefore, we ought to attack the Communists, insofar as we can, by general laws, and not by particular laws. Thus, if they become breakers of wise, general laws, they may be dealt with as lawbreakers. Otherwise, we should, as far as possible, fight them in the light. There is no novelty in that statement. I have said it in one form of words or another on many occasions, but I want to say this to the committee: It is not to be assumed that all policies of that kind are perpetual. Events move on. If a state of affairs arose in this country which satisfied me, for one, that the Communists were again engaged in treasonable activities, I should not hesitate to be a party to treating them as in time of war. Ail these matters have to be judged on the facts. tion to them can be static. fore. I want to elaborate a little further, so as to say exactly how I apply that principle to this problem. The Communists were up to 1941 subversive agents in Australia. ""When some of them were interned, they were properly interned. When their party was banned, it, was properly banned. Then Russia came into the war, and the Communists came on our side. They said, "" Good, we are now in favour of this war. It is no longer an imperialist war, and we are in favour of the war effort."" Then, as the war went on, and was within measurable distance of being won, the Communists, who had gone quietly, once more became industrially aggressive. They became in 1944 and 1945 the aggressive militant element in the trade union movement. But they did not stop there. Having had some sticcess in the industrial field, they then extended beyond industrial activities, so that their disputes were no longer of an industrial kind, but had merely Mr Menzies. political ends. In other words, Communist activity in the last two years in Australia has been directed to enforcing political policies, and not to enforcing industrial demands. We have seen instances of this in the waterfront dispute, and in the case of the guided weapons testing range, in which the Communists' designs evoked from the Government at long last legislation to deal with the position. We have seen the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) conceding that Communist activity was no longer merely industrial, but was reaching out beyond that point in pursuit of political purposes. That is why, in a passage that has l)een quoted previously, the Attorney General referred to the resolution of the federal executive of the Australian Labour party, which statedI t is apparent that the propaganda recently issued by the Communist party in connection with this undertaking is for the sole purpose of defeating the Australian defence policy in the interest' of a foreign power. No words that have fallen from any honourable member on this side of the House could be stronger than these: "" To defeat defence projects in the interests of a foreign power "". That is the very definition of treason, and in such circumstances I want to make it No policy in {relavery clear that I think the time is long Thereoverdue for a thoroughgoing, searching investigation of all that the Communists are doing, and the rendering of a report to the Australian people concerning the result. We know that the Communists assumed various forms. We know that one does not need to look for the label "" Australian Communist party "" in order to come across some Communist organization in Australia. Al l sorts of Eureka leagues, youth leagues, and other mildsounding organizations form a part of the Communist scheme. It is a part of their cleverness that they introduce into their work people who would be horrified were they told that they were fellow travellers with a Communist. But the community ought to know what these people are doing. The people of Australia are entitled to know how the Communist party is related to bodies outside Australia. There are very many honourable members in this House-o n both sides of the House -wh o believe that these people do have an association with elements in Russia, who believe that these people have sources of revenue which are not very obvious and not to be explained on normal grounds or by normal subscriptions. And the public are entitled to know. If an investigation shows that their operations are unrelated to anything outside, industrially, or in any other way, they are entitled .to have those facts made known .to the public; but if, on the other hand, these people are more and more engaging in subversive activity, more and more trying to undermine the security of this country, trying to defeat the public policies of this country in the interests of some other powerif those are the facts, then it is elementary that those fact® are to be made known. From first to last, I have never understood why this Government, which has appointed a. few royal commissions on appropriate occasions, has refused an investigation. This matter was brought up here on one occasion some months back. At that time, I think that the Attorney General was present, and he said in the course of the debate that it would be very undesirable to hold an investigation, that the investigation people had tabs on the Communists, and knew what they were doing. The Government had all the information, but it would not do to publish it because that might reveal the sources of its information. On that occasion I occupied the time of the House by saying what I now repeat. Nobody wants the public to be told what the sources of information of a.n investigation branch are. That would defeat, to a considerable degree, the purpose of the investigation; but what is there to prevent an investigation being made by a competent au'thority and the result of that investigation being conveyed to the people of Australia? Why should not, the people of Australia know which are the bodies in Australia that are CommunLst -controlled ; whether these people have any tie-up with interests outside Australia? It is not sufficient to point, as people used to do a. little while ago, to the dissolution of the Comintern as making the consequential result, "" It is all right. The Communists are no longer engaged in international propaganda and no longer ""have expansionist ideas"". I must say that I never did believe there was very much in the dissolution of the Comintern. But the Comintern has now been revived under another name. Nobody in this chaimiber can have the slightest doubt, if he looks at events during the last two years, that there is a vast expansionist movement promoted by the Soviet Union; and none can have very much doubt that .in 'that expansion Communists all over the world regard themselves as the agents of Soviet expansion. If they do, they are in plain terms the fifth column in Australia, in the United States of America, and in whatever country it might be. We have only to look at some recent events to realize that there is far more than coincidence in the co-operation that exists between the Soviet Union and the Communists inside Australia. Take, for example, the Netherlands East Indies. What happened? The Communists in Australia have been exercising all the pressure in Australia by waterfront holdups, by direct threats to the Government in favour of the Indonesians who are in rebellion against the Dutch. While that has been going on in Australia, the Soviet Union at the Security Council has been directing precisely the same arguments and precisely the same propaganda at a world tribunal. To all of what I have said about those matters there may be some answer. If there is, I am willing to hear it, but I am not willing to hear it from a partisan source; I want to hear it from a judicial source. I want to know-so do the people want to know-as the result of investigation just what these people are doing; and if we find that what they are doing is not merely legitimate political agitation, hut something which is aimed at the security of Australia, then we shall be in a position, all of us, to formulate policies in a democratic way for dealing with them. So, my position is this: I do not regard this matter as fixed, but fluid. My whole approach is what I stated in the first instance; but I want above all things that we should have in Australia, as there has been in other countries, a searching inquiry into what these people are doing and how they manifest themselves; and on the result of that inquiry the whole future policy of the party which I have the honour to lead will depend. ' I wish to deal briefly with the Legal Aid Bureau established by the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt). The bureau was set up in the interests of ex-service pera way out of the resolution carried by his sonnel of the last war and their dependants. As a member of the Parliament, I have on numerous occasions been asked to seek assistance from this bureau on 'behalf of widows and dependants of ex-service personnel. I believe that if ever a worthwhile service was set up in this country it is this service. I compliment the Attorney-General upon the manner in which it is being operated in South Australia. I am also pleased to know that the conciliation commissioners appointed under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act were sworn in to-day, and that their duties in respect of various industries have been allotted to them. As I said when that measure was under consideration by the Parliament, I sincerely hope that both employers and employees will co-operate with the conciliation commissioners with a view to enabling the new scheme to function in the interests of all sections of the community. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), in the course of his remarks, referred to a gentleman whoimi he called "" Comrade"" Dixon who, I understand, is a Communist. During the regime of a United Australia Party Government in 1939-to-da y the members of ihat Government call themselves the Liberal party-the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who was then Attorney-General, made an offer to "" Comrade"" Dixon on the 3rd September of that year to broadcast over the national vour to secure control of it the Comradio network of this country a talk dealmunists have issued more literature and ing with the merits of the Communist party. Hoaorable 'members will recall very vividly what a wonderful opportunity was given to the members of the Communist party by the United Australia party in September, 1939. It is my firm belief that the Communist party is an auxiliary of the ""Liberal party and of those associated with it. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) admitted quite frankly to-night that his party did not intend to ban the Communist party in Australia, but he qualified that statement posed in .the event of an emergency. In making .that qualification the right honourable gentleman was obviously looking for party. I have no brief for the Communist party. The workers can be emancipated only through the efforts of the Labour party. assists me very greatly. The Constitution provides for slow progress, and when the Australian Labour party endeavours to speed up progress 'in any way it is consistently opposed by ithe honourable member. Just prior to the resumption of these sittings of the Parliament I was invited to a dinner by a number of business men in Adelaide, at which, among other things, the activities' of Communists were discussed. These men claimed that the Opposition parties and the press had been responsible for the build-up of the Communist party in Australia. ness men? The honourable member may rest assured that never on any occasion have I endeavoured to mislead honourable members by inventing a fiction. I am well aware that it is the aim of the Communist party to secure control of our industrial organizations, and I agree with the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) that the best way to prevent them from doing so is for the members of the organizations to attend their meetings in full strength. I belong to the second strongest industrial union in South Australia. In an endeapamphlets than they would issue during a most hotly contested by-election in which a Communist candidate was opposed to a Labour candidate. The moderate men in the union, however, rallied the workers to fight against the infiltration of the Communists, and so great was the attendance at the annual meeting that it was necessary to hire one of the biggest theatres in Adelaide to accommodate the meeting. the honourable member refer ?",79,Party Members As Air Raid Wardens

Its experience bears out my contention that if members attend meetings of their organizations in force the Communists can never gain control of them. Much has been said about the exchange of preferences between Communists and Labour candidates at Commonwealth and State elections. Prior to the 1946 elections a leading Communist in Adelaide expressed his regret that a Communist was not standing against me. I left him in no doubt as to my views on the matter. I told him that I should much prefer a straight-out contest with a member of one of the recognized Opposition parties than a three-cornered contest in which the Communist preferences would be distributed. At that election I trebled my previous majority. We neither desire nor do we accept Communist support. I appeal to 'the workers to do everything in their power to enable the new conciliation commissioners to carry out tlie duties of their office effectively so that follows:we may be able to secure that industrial peace which is so necessary to our progress.

R EAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS : OREMOKNE ber, the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) addressed a question to me regarding the purchase of a house at Cremorne by D r . Coombs. I have examined the papers in connection with this transaction and find that the purchase price was supported by two independent private valuers and confirmed by qualified departmental valuers. WAB tember, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) asked for advice as to the action taken on Army matters raised at a meeting of war widows in the TownH a l l , Melbourne. I desire to advise follows:The majority of matters referred to at this meeting are understood to relate to pensions and other payments which are the concern of the Minister for Repatriation. One of the matters referred to, however, related to payments to the next-of-kin of deceased members of the forces in lieu of recreation leave accrued at the date of death, on which a decision has been given by the Government on my recommendation to the following effect. Payment in lieu of recreation leave to be assessed from 1st July, 1942, or from the date of enlistment, whichever was the later, up to the date of death, should be made to the estates of members of the military forces who died on service or whilst prisoner-of-war before 20th March, 1945. This payment has already been made in respect of estates of servicemen who had died on or after 20th March, 1945. Payments under this authority will be made where legal entitlement is established to the deceased estate by persons of the following relationship: parent, step-parent, fosterparent, wife or child, or where the claimant was actually dependent on the soldier at the In the case of those who died whilst prisonerof-war, leave will be assessed at the rate of two days per month, subject to a minimum of fourteen days and a maximum of CO days. In cases of death other than whilst prisonerof-war, leave will be assessed in accordance with the following formula: Service of less than one year-fourtee n days. Service of one year and less than eighteen months-2 1 days. Service of eighteen months and less than On the 26th Septemtwo years-2 8 days. Service of two years and less than 30 months-3 5 days. Service of 30 months and less than three years-4 2 days. In some instances the implementation of this formula may result in payment in lieu of leave although leave may actually have been taken, while in other instances it is possible that payment in lieu of leave may be less than the actual period of leave that may have been due. On an overall basis, however, it is considered that tbe method of effecting payment in lieu of leave is a fair way of ber, the honourable member for Franklin ( Mr Falkinder) asked whether Army Routine Orders have been published banthe honourable member as ning the wearing of service chevrons and wound stripes. If so, what were the reasons for those orders. A t the time, the honourable member was informed by me that the matter would be examined and a reply furnished. I am now in a position to state that the decision on this question was given as a result of a recommendation from the Defence Committee as affecting the Army, Navy and A i r Forces. During the war, the wearing of service chevrons and wound stripes was authorized and was applicable throughout all sections of the fighting forces. Since that date, all personnel who are continuing to serve in the forces, or may serve in the forces in future, have had their eligibility for the award of campaign stars and medals determined, and serving members have been issued with the appropriate ribbons which they are required to wear with their service uniform .",83,Answers To Questions
