In view of the serious problem facing the Australian timber industry, can the Minister inform the House whether arrangements are in train or have been completed for interested members of the timber milling industry in Australia to present their case to the Government? that was asked by the honourable member for Bass on 31st August on this subject and subsequently advised the honourable member that I would be willing to meet representatives of the Tasmanian timber industry if he would arrange for them to come to Canberra to meet me and subsequently to meet the appropriate officers of the Department ot Trade. That arrangement stands. I have since been told by the honourable member for Bass that the Australian timber industry wishes to join in the discussions and accordingly, would like to widen the scope ol the interview. I am informed that the Australian industry desires that some other members of Parliament should assist the honourable member for Bass in presenting a case. 1 am willing to meet them and they will meet officers of the department later. 1 understand that other honourable members from other States will also attend. to the Prime Minister. As the Italian Government, in order to alleviate hardship, is giving additional assistance to Italian immigrants in Australia who are receiving the unemployment benefit, will the Australian Government take similar action and give additional assistance, in cases where hardship exists, to Australians who are receiving the unemployment benefit? Government intends to take with regard to the unemployment benefit was set out in the Budget papers, and we are not proposing to alter the Budget. The legislation will be dealt with by the Parliament. tion to the Minister for Repatriation. As the Repatriation Department undertakes the transport of handicapped ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen to and from repatriation hospitals and many other places, will the Minister consider the desirability of obtaining specially designed motor vehicles, on to which patients in wheel chairs can be wheeled and in which they can then be transported? This would overcome much of the difficulty sometimes experienced in transferring patients from wheel chairs to conventional vehicles and back again. ber is right in saying that the Repatriation Department transports disabled ex-servicemen to and from repatriation hospitals and clinics for examination or treatment. I think I am right in saying that the vehicles used are ordinary motor cars, or ambulances when required. It might be useful and economic to obtain special vehicles for the purpose, and I will gladly look into the suggestion. I will do so the more readily because I know that the honourable member for Mallee, as a result of his own war experience, speaks with some knowledge of the repatriation system. ivtinister for Social Services say whether the Cabinet has yet considered the proposal that eligibility for the unemployment benefit should commence from the date on which the person concerned becomes unemployed, instead of seven days after he makes application for unemployment relief?

One was that negotiations should Soviet Union of nuclear bomb testing, and begin on that date for the conclusion said that I might make a further statement of a treaty on the suspension of tests this week. I should like now to trace in under effective international control. Anmore detail the course of negotiation on other was that Russia should not resume this most important question, and to exatesting. mine some of its implications for us. It was in July, 1957, that the Western powers on the sub-committee of the United the very next day-the Soviet Union exNations Disarmament Commission first proploded an atomic device. Two days later posed that a group of experts meet to it exploded another. Despite this flagrant devise an inspection system to control the breach of faith, the United States declared suspension of nuclear tests. The Soviet that it would adhere to its undertaking, Union did not respond. The following month the Western powers proposed the suspension of nuclear tests for two years, during which time a system the negotiations have continued, with of international inspection could be worked occasional adjournments, and they are still out to ensure that all future production of technically continuing. Despite the Soviet fissionable material would be used solely resumption of testing, they have still not for peaceful purposes. In making these formally been broken off. Progress has proposals, the Western powers again called been slow. From the beginning it was on the Soviet Union to join in expert apparent that Western and Soviet views on studies. The Soviet Union refused. In November, 1957, these proposals by painstaking persistence, with the United were endorsed by the United Nations Kingdom and the United States making General Assembly, but the Soviet Union every effort of compromise to break deadstill refused to discuss them. Not until March, 1958, after Russia had concluded a series of tests, and just before the start of a United States series, December, 1960, in the last days of the would suspend tests unilaterally for six months. I emphasize that, because possibly that unilateral declarations, without a system of inspection and control to ensure that the declarations were being honoured, were valueless; and called again on the Soviet Union to take part in technical discussion on the feasibility of devising an effective system and the form it might take. So, in July and August, 1958, the first conference of experts met in Geneva.

79,Mr Menzies,"Eisenhower administration, there had been adopted a preamble and seventeen articles of a draft treaty, and two annexes. Important differences on issues of principle still remain unresolved, but the progress which had already been made encouraged the hope that with perseverance agreement could yet be reached on the outstanding points. "" With perseverance "", I have said. PerhapsI should have added, "" and witb goodwill and sincere endeavour "", for there were already by the end of last year disquieting signs. Honourable members may recall that, as I stated to the press afterwards, when I talked with Mr Khrushchev in New York on 12th October, 1960, he expressed the view that the suspension of nuclear tests was of diminishing importance. Nevertheless, the Western powers, for their part, continued their unremitting efforts to seek agreement. President Kennedy, on assuming office, ordered an intensive review of the issues involved, and when the conference resumed on 21st March, 1961, a new set of proposals was submitted by the United States and the United Kingdom. These proposals, which incorporate important concessions to Russian positions, were1. To reduce the number of on-site inspections in each of the nuclear countries from a fixed figure of twenty to a possible twelve, depending on the number of suspicious seismic events; 2. To reduce the number of control posts on Soviet territory from 21 to 19; 3. To extend from 27 months to three years the proposed moratorium on smaller underground tests and the associated research programme; 4. To institute a ban on all nuclear weapon tests at high altitudes and in outer space; 5. To ask Congress for legislative authority to permit Soviet inspection of the internal mechanism of the nuclear devices used in the seismic research and peaceful uses programmes; 6. To accept the Soviet request for veto over the annual budget of the control organization; 7. To accept the Soviet demand for a parity of seats between Western and Soviet bloc states on the top Control Commission-a n arrangement which would give the Soviet Union a voice in guiding the control system equal to that of the United States and the United Kingdom combined, and which would be unprecedented in an international organization. These, as honourable members will observe, were notable concessions in the attempt to secure some agreement in the interests of the world. Then on 18th April, building on the agreements already reached and incorporating these new proposals, the United States and the United Kingdom tabled a complete draft treaty for the suspension of nuclear weapons tests. The Soviet reaction was ominous and disheartening. Not only did the Soviet delegate, Mr Tsarapkin, return to the conference table without constructive proposals, making it clear that the Soviet Union had not used the three months' adjournment to seek ways of resolving points of difference, but he even went back on an agreement which the Soviet Union had made over a year previously. He insisted that, instead of having, as had been agreed, a single neutral administrator as chief executive officer of the control organization, there should be established a triumvirate of administrators, one from the Soviet group, one from the Western powers and one from the "" neutralists"", who would be required to reach their decisions unanimously. Each member would therefore have a veto. This is the so-called "" Troika"" principle which the Soviet Union put forward at the last General Assembly of the United Nations to replace the office of Secretary General. It would give the Soviet Union the power to prevent any inspection by the control organization of suspected breaches of the treaty by the Soviet Union. Whoever might be deceived by that sort of proposal, it would not deceive a child in an ordinary country. This uncompromising, retrograde attitude was continued by Mr Khrushchev when he met President Kennedy in Vienna. The Russian"" aide-memoire "" or memorandum of 4th June reiterates this new Soviet contention that "" there do not and cannot exist neutral men"". I call it "" new"" advisedly, because in January of last year. Mr Tsarapkin, the Soviet negotiator, said at the conference, "" Out of the three thousand million human beings on earth we shall always be able to find some one on whom you and we can agree "". And the following month he said, "" In neutral countries, it will always be possible to find a person, a really neutral person, who can be used for the job of carrying out the duties of administrator"". And in June, 1960, he said, "" It will always be possible would give the Soviet Union the power of to discover in the world a person acceptable to both sides for nomination for the post as administrator "". Now we are told that there is no such thing as a neutral man. The Vienna memorandum also proposed that the negotiations on the suspension of nuclear tests should be merged with discussion of general complete disarmament. That is to say, the Russians proposed that the measure of agreement which had been so painfully won through nearly three years of patient negotiation should be tossed back into the melting pot. They proposed that agreement on the suspension of nuclear weapons tests, which is, despite its complexities, a relatively simple operation, should be made dependent upon achieving agreement on the much vaster and the infinitely more complicated question of general and complete disarmament. This memorandum also disclosed the hollowness of the much vaunted offer to despite all discouragement, with the West accept unconditionally any proposals of still trying to meet the Russian objections. the Western powers on control if they On 28th and 30th August, the United would accept the Russian proposal on Kingdom and United States representatives general and complete disarmament. This made three new and important conmemorandum makes it plain that the Ruscessionssians will accept control and inspection only after disarmament has been completed because "" as long as states maintain their armed forces, no control can be free from intelligence. When armed forces are abolished and armaments destroyed, then only control will not be connected with intelligence."" That is a rather orotund way of saying that their view was "" You are not going to have inspection because that will be espionage; so you must first agree with us that all arms are abolished and take our word for it. When that is done, perhaps you may have some inspection, but it will not matter very much."" The memorandum further suggests that the policing of a disarmed world would be through national contingents-in other words there would be no standing international force which "" could be used through the Security Council""-that is to say, they would be subject to the Russian veto. In addition, "" all the main groups of States should, of course, be equally represented on the command of such international forces ""-that is to say, they would be under a "" troika"" command which veto over the day-to-day operations of the forces. The United States replied to this memorandum in a note of 17th June. This note patiently rehearsed the substantial concessions which the West had offered since the talks resumed, pointed out the objections to the Russian proposals, and drew attention to the wider consequences for which the Soviet Union would be responsible. The Russian reply was a long note, dated Sth July, which made no concessions, but maintained the new Russian position uncompromisingly. The exchange ended with a United States note, of 15th July, which returned to the central issue and sought to determine whether the Soviet Union was willing to reach an agreement which would halt nuclear weapons tests under effective international control. The conference at Geneva continued, (1) They tried to satisfy the Soviet Union completely about small underground tests. These at present cannot be reliably detected and a moratorium had been suggested to allow research into improved detection methods. The new proposals envisaged consultation before the moratorium ended. During the last six months, a panel of experts would report on recommended improvements in the control system, the capability of the system in the light of these improvements, and whether or not it would be possible to reduce or eliminate altogether the range of undetectable explosions. (2) They tried to satisfy the Russian doubts about the impartiality of the administator, by making him removable from office by simple majority vote in the control commission, which would comprise four Russians, four Western representatives, and three neutrals. (3) They tried to allay Russian fears that Government, I have to-day ordered the resumption inspection teams would be used for espionage by offering to make half the number of each team nationals of "" uncommitted"" countries. The Soviet reply, made on the same day as the last two of these concessions, was to announce its intention to resume testing. On 1st September, the Soviet Union exploded a nuclear device. Even this did not exhaust the patience or the hope of the Western leaders. On 3rd September, as I mentioned last week, President Kennedy and Mr Macmillan made a joint offer to Mr Khrushchev that their three governments agree, with immediate effect, not to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere such as would produce radioactive fall-out. They proposed that their representatives meet at Geneva, on 9th September, to record this agreement. They further emphasized that this proposal was not in any way conditional upon the establishment of new or additional controls and that they were prepared to rely on existing long-range methods of detection which would not involve entry into or overflight of Russian territory. The Russian reply, as we all know, was the explosion of a second nuclear device, and a third and then a fourth. The explosion of four atomic devices within a to conclude partial disarmament or suspenspan of six days points to a high degree of sion agreements, but wishes to consider all planning and advance preparation over a these problems in the context of general and long period. It means that Soviet particicomplete disarmament, is a transparent pation at the Geneva talks has for some propaganda device. The problem of general time been a sham. It means that while the and complete disarmament is vast and Russians have allegedly been negotiating complex and a solution cannot be achieved for the suspension of nuclear weapons tests by short-cuts. The West has always believed they have been preparing an extensive that a major step towards general disarmaseries of tests which, it must be assumed, ment would be the conclusion of a nuclear will add materially to Russian nuclear test ban treaty. In fact, some progress had weapons capability. In this context I would again recall that such a treaty. Yet the Soviet Union, by its on 28th August, 1959, the Soviet Governpresent actions, seems prepared to nullify ment announced its decision "" not to resume the progress already made. In the light of nuclear explosions "" if the Western powers this Soviet intransigence it was no surprise did not resume. In the face of the Soviet Union's patent indifference to the Western proposals or world opinion, President Kennedy found himself obliged to make the following announcement on 5th September, after the third in the present series of Russian tests:In view of the continued testing by the Soviet of nucJear tests in the laboratory and underground with no fall-out. In our efforts to achieve an end to nuclear testing, we have taken every step that reasonable men could justify. In view of the acts of the Soviet Government, we must now take those steps which prudent men find essential. We have no other choice in fulfilment of the responsibilities of the United States Government to its own citizens and to the security of other free nations. Our offer to make an agreement to end all fall-out tests remains open until September 9. The Soviet Union has now rejected the joint United Kingdom-United Sta.es offer and has gone on to conduct three further atmospheric tests of nuclear devices, two with a force of several megatons, that is to say, equivalent in explosive power to several million tons of TNT. Mr Khrushchev, in rejecting the Western offer, contended that a nuclear tests suspension agreement must be considered in the wider context of general and complete disarmament. This Soviet reaction, as I suggested last Thursday, provided "" a complete test of the good faith and pacific intentions of the Communists "". They have failed that test. In contradiction to Mr Khrushchev's repeated statements on the need to protect the world from the dangers of radio-active fall-out, they have brushed aside the offer of an agreement which would have done just this. The Soviet claim that it is not prepared been made towards the establishment of when the Geneva conference adjourned indefinitely on 9th September. On 10th September, immediately after adjournment of the conference, the Soviet Union announced that it would begin testing multi-stage rockets to be fired into the Pacific Ocean in an area south-west of Hawaii. The rockets to be tested are said to be more powerful and improved versions of multi-stage carrier rockets already used in space experiments. The record makes it clear that the Soviet Union has, from the outset, treated the whole issue of nuclear test bans with complete cynicism, recklessly pursuing what it conceives as its national interest, yet at the Kennedy's decision to resume underground same time playing on the hopes and fears of the millions of decent, peace-loving people throughout the world. The first Russian"" suspension"" in March, 1958, followed completion of one series of tests. The next series, in November, 1958, was pressed through with a total disregard of international opinion. In August, 1959, presumably when the immediate requirements of the Russian military machine had been met, a solemn promise was given that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics would not be the first to conduct any further nuclear tests. The events of these last days show how much faith can be placed in assurances of this kind. It is also clear that while professing to negotiate seriously at Geneva, the Russians were making detailed preparations for the current series of tests. I say these things merely by way of the Russians and the underground testing summarizing and restating what I have now being undertaken by the United States. already put to honourable members. No doubt as soon as the series has been completed there will be yet another Soviet not come as a complete surprise, their proposal for an unconditional suspension on suddenness and brutality-and the threat both sides, with the Communist propaganda which they pose to world peace-ar e nonemachine fully mobilized to denounce the theless shocking and deeply depressing.

The Soviet Union was States, "" Now. that is wicked of you,""; and among the signatories to this agreement, a lot of people, foolishly and without thinkunder which nuclear explosions are foring, will believe them. F.7613/61 -[40 ] The Australian Government commends the patience and restraint-contrastin g sharply with the Soviet approach to this issue-whic h the Western leaders have shown throughout the long and, as now proved, fruitless negotiations at Geneva. Still more commendable have been their persistent and imaginative efforts to seek out every possibility of agreement and, in recent days, to salvage something from the wreck. Given the total lack of response from the Soviet Union, it is inconceivable that the United States should continue its self-imposed ban on nuclear testing in the present grave situation. My Government wholeheartedly supports President tests, a decision which the Soviet actions have now made essential to the security of the free nations. For, let us make no mistake, our own security is directly involved. So long as the Soviet Union refuses to conclude an effective agreement for the prohibition and control of nuclear tests, we will be left in the grim position that the only assurance that its leaders will not resort to the ultimate weapon is the knowledge that its use would mean their own annihilation. At the same time, it is noteworthy that even now the United States, at a substantial sacrifice in time, convenience and money, still refrains from carrying out the atmospheric tests which generate fall-out. There is a clear and important difference between the atmospheric tests conducted by Although the recent Soviet actions have bidden in the Antarctic. I should still like to hope that in the larger interests of mankind, the Soviet leaders could recover something of the spirit of moderation and co-operation which marked the Antarctic Conference and that the ban on nuclear tests, with proper control and safeguards, will become universal. Until it does, the free nations can place no reliance on Soviet professions of concern for mankind. Nor can they accept as genuine the Soviet claim to be the champion of general and complete disarmament. I lay on the table the following for discussion and, of course, for action.

He made many references tary of the Returned Soldiers League in to instances where, in his opinion, remedies Victoria, and a colleague of mine in the could be applied, particularly in regard to old sixth battalion.

Apparently the department was clogged up. article, although he did not name anybody The article continuedThe worth of the gift will depend on the way a lot of speechifying, a lot of nicety, a lot the new Minister intends to operate.

But if he chooses to content himself with sitting in with the Commission, or with being an honored guest at meetings of ex-service organisations he will be purely decorative-hardl y a flutter anywhere. Ex-service bodies will gain a new speaker, but the speeches will be the same-probabl y from the same source. Over the past 11 years the department has had as its Minister one of the most kindly and gentlemanly men ever to grace a Commonwealth Cabinet. I agree with that. The article went on to sayIf a sympathetic bearing and a superb charm of manner were all that were necessary to endear a Minister to returned men, the former Minister was ideally suited to the role. His addresses to meetings of the RSL. left no doubt of his sincerity, or of his concern for his fellow-returned men. Returned men, however, need more than charm and sympathy from their ministerial head of Repatriation, and a thousand speeches at smoke nights and meetings, as pleasing as they might be, offer no assurance whatever to the returned man of a well administered Repatriation Act. man who made that excellent contribution is a man of very temperate views.

He raised some department are reasonable and genuinely sympathetic as far as the act allows them But no department can function satisfacdate-al l parties bear some responsibility for this-the Repatriation Department has think it is quite evident from Mr Joyce's or say so directly, that he felt there was lacking. Mr Speaker, I have mentioned that this measure provides for increases here and there. The basic 100 per cent, pension has been increased to £5 15s. As I have said on many occasions, when we consider whether an increase in pension rates is adequate we must examine the movement in pensions over a reasonably long period of time. In 1939, prior to the outbreak ot war, the basic wage was 78s. a week. The 100 per cent, war pension was 42s. a week, representing in round figures 53 per cent, of the basic wage. To-day, the basic wage is 288s. a week and the 100 per cent, war pension is 115s., representing, again in round figures, 40 per cent, of the basic wage. So, over that long period of time, during which we had a world war, and were governed by Labour governments and Liberal governments, the relationship that the 100 per cent, war pension bears to the basic wage has dropped by 13 per cent.",24,Repatriation Bill 1961

In 1939, when the basic wage was 78s. a week, the T.P.I, pension was 80s. a week. It was actually higher than the basic wage. It represented, on my calculations, 102 per cent, of the basic wage. In 1961, when the basic wage is 288s. a week, the T.P.I, pension is 265s. a a week, representing 92 per cent, of the basic wage. What is the position with regard to the war widows' pension? In 1939, when the basic wage was 78s. a week, the war widows' pension was 23s. 6d. a week, repretheir war service their wives, in many cases, senting 37 per cent, of the basic wage. In 1961, with the basic wage at 288s. a week, the war widows' pension is 115s. a week, which is 40 per cent, of the basic wage. So, since 1939 the war widows' pension has improved by 3 per cent, in its relationship to the basic wage. I am prepared to admit that when looking at these rates we cannot leave out of consideration the fact that in some cases wives' allowances and dependants' allowances have been increased. There has been some liberality in relation to what may be called that many pensioners, particularly T.P.I, related fringe benefits. removed. ceiling limits have been removed, but the removal of ceiling limits does not mean anything to a person who has no income other than his repatriation pension. The removal of ceiling limits would not affect thousands of pensioners, particularly T.P.I, be doing what thousands of men in Australia pensioners. persons to whom the removal does apply. limits has no application where a pensioner has no other income. All that he can get is his T.P.I, pension, plus allowances for his wife and children. to that also. After all, these are only made to these people for the things that fringe matters. Let us look at another aspect that is not the committee stage the Government will taken into consideration sufficiently often. accept the amendments that the Opposition ment of fringe benefits has compensated for the fact that repatriation pensions have lagged behind the basic wage. But is the Minister unconscious of the fact that in 1939 the number of married women who worked was small compared with the number lo-day? To-day, thousands of married women are working in industry, professions and business. In 1939 the number of women employed in industry and elsewhere was 437,000. By 1961 that number had increased to 849,000. If the men who now receive repatriation pensions had not suffered injury or illness as a result of could have earned incomes equivalent to, and in some cases greater than, the incomes earned by their husbands. But because of their husbands' condition of health those women are forced to remain in their homes and are unable to go out and earn a living. That is something that should be taken into consideration when we are dealing with repatriation pensions. When comparing rates paid in 1939 with those paid in 1961 we must bear in mind pensioners, but for their war-caused disabilities, would to-day be employed in professional capacities and would be earning incomes of the order of £2,000, £3,000, £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 a year. Others, but for their war-caused disabilities, would have been numbered among the hundreds of thousands of skilled artisans in Australia who are earning wages substantially higher than the basic wage. Many of these men, but for their war-caused disabilities, would have been doing since the introduction of the 40-hour week-holdin g down two jobs and thereby increasing their incomes. If we are to look realistically at this matter of pension payments we must bear in mind that, according to the Commonwealth Statistician's figures, the average earnings of the community are not the basic wage rate but £21.83 a week. So, to comto take the lowest possible basis for comthey have been deprived of. I hope that in",25,Repatriation Bill 1961

100,Mr Pollard,"That is so. Surelythat now exists between ex-servicemen and civilians, and so result in a happier state of affairs generally. I do not want to spend too much time on this subject, and 1 merely say that I hope the Government will consider the matter seriously and agree to the suggestions of the Opposition. I now turn to the amendment that the Opposition will propose to provide for medical and hospital treatment for members of the forces as defined in section 23 of the act. We believe, in fact, that this treatment could well be made available also for wives and dependants of ex-servicemen. Why should this not be so? Would there be any great cost really involved? These people have to be treated in some way at some time and at a cost to somebody. Surely this principle could be accepted. I think that last year the Government provided for medical treatment for the dependants of service pensioners. Is that correct? for themselves. misapprehension. I confused the dependants with the pensioners themselves. Another indication of the way in which the position of these pensioners has deteriorated is to be found in figures given by the Commonwealth Statistician. The wholesale price index for basic materials and foodstuffs in 1938-39 gave a figure of 108. In 1961 the figure is 356. To give the same purchasing power as was available in 1938-39, the pension now would have to be fixed at a rate which would reflect this increase in the price index. On the question of medical benefits I again wish to refer to "" M u f t i "" and to some remarks of Mr Joyce quoted therein. In a recent issue of the publication, Mr at least see fit to accept the amendments Joyce saidEvidence exists in abundance that in hundreds of claims substantial justice is not being given and claims are not being met. Hundreds of sick men and women who sorely need hospital treatment are not getting it. The Commission's hospital at Heidelberg, for instance, built at enormous cost to accommodate nearly 1,300 patients stands half empty. Fifteen wards and 600 beds go unused week after week, and month after month, whilst returned men in their hundreds suffer at home. These men at home are being taken care of by their wives, many of whom are themselves sick and frail, who should never have been asked to bear the burdens thrust on them. Husbands, much heavier than the wives who attend them, have to be lifted from bed to bathroom and toilet-nursin g attention has to be given day and night-specia l foods have to be prepared-al l this while a hospital erected at enormous government expense stands to the lasting disgrace of the department half empty. It is not really to the lasting disgrace of the department; it is to the lasting disgrace of the government of the day. Mr Joyce went on to sayNo wonder TPI men ask for medical treatment for their wives; for all too many of these have been sacrificing themselves for years doing the job that should have been the Commission's. For years these women have been an unpaid, unofficial auxiliary of the Commission, without appreciation or thanks except from their husbands, and sometimes not even from them, for many are too ill to care. 1 think it is worthwhile quoting freely from these articles by Mr Joyce in "" Mufti "". In another issue of the journal treatment of service pensioners he saidThe other week a Dr. Pearson returned from Russia with a report of the free medical treatment available there to the community generally; he expressed the opinion, in a press and television interview, that Australia, too, would some day have to provide free medical treatment for its people. In Russia, said Dr. Pearson, treatment is afforded not when one has the money to pay for it, but when it is needed. Money does not come into it. Expense is no bar in Russian hospitals to treatment to get a patient back into employment. Sickness is regarded as nationally uneconomic, to be overcome as soon as humanly practicable. Mufti has not at any time supported any Russian plan, or made any comparisons, and the Australian method of treating the community sick may be the most satisfactory procedure practicable. These are matters that the community and the Government should seriously consider, and I am hoping that the Government wDl that will be proposed by the Opposition. I think it was the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) who said last year that he favoured the proposal to have cancer accepted as a war-caused disability, but he voted against the Opposition's amendment. He has again indicated that he favours the proposal, but he will probably again cast his vote against the amendment that will be moved.

You need have no fear that your vote will defeat the Government; the time is rapidly approaching when the Government will be defeated in any case. J shall leave it at that, Mr Deputy Speaker. 1 simply express disappointment that the Government has not been more generous. Repatriation) [4.15] -in replyI have listened carefully to the many speeches that have been made in this second-reading debate on the Repatriation Bill 1961, including that of the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) who has just finished. The honourable member has not altered the impression that I formed in the earlier stages of the debate that two things have been made clear. The first is that across the broad field of repatriation this Government has kept the promises it made to the ex-servicemen before the election of 1949, and that it has kept repatriation benefits up to date. We all know that one of the functions of an opposition is to complain, but this Opposition has not been able to do more than make some insubstantial complaint on matters around the fringe of the repatriation system. In any field of social services it is easy to say that this payment or that should be greater than it is. We all want to provide everything that is practicable for our disabled ex-servicemen. As Minister for Repatriation I want to do everything that can possibly be done for them, but as a member of a government I know that this generation of Australians has many responsibilities and wide obligations to many groups of people. Numerous claims-jus t and reasonable in themselves-ar e made for Government expenditure, but those claims have to be judged against the other needs of the community. Revenue is not unlimited. To the extent that any government grants one request, expands one service or undertakes one obligation, its capacity to grant another request is limited. Bearing all this in mind, no one can suggest that this Government has neglected the country's acknowledged obligation to its injured ex-servicemen-to those who fought for it in time of danger and who suffered injury in its service. The other thing that has emerged quite clearly in this debate is that there is only one consistent field of criticism of repatriation policy or administration. It is a limited field, and it is bound up in the phrase "" the onus of proof "". Most of the complaints which come under this heading result from a misunderstanding of the proper meaning and effect of the provisions of section 47 of the act, which is known as the "" onus-of-proof"", and from a misunderstanding of the application of those provisions by the various determining authorities of the repatriation system. As honourable members know, that section provides, first, that any inference whicb reasonably can be drawn in an applicant's favour must be so drawn; secondly, that any doubt which arises shall be resolved in the applicant's favour; and thirdly, that before an application is dismissed the onus is on the Repatriation Commission to prove that the application should be dismissed. These determining authorities have to discharge a quasi-judicial function. They have to act judicially and they have to apply the law. A presumption to be drawn in favour of an applicant must be a reasonable presumption. The doubt which must be resolved in an applicant's favour must be a doubt in the mind of the determining authority, not a doubt in the mind of the applicant, his advocate or his witnesses. The onus-of-proof provision means that instead of an applicant having to establish his case affirmatively, which could be an insuperable difficulty after many years from the end of a war, the commission must establish affirmatively that the application should not be allowed before disallowing it. The section gives directions as to how doubt should be resolved. But those directions do not relieve the authority of the responsibility of deciding between conflicting bodies of evidence. Every judicial body has to do that. body which has to act legally within the terms of the legislation. For example, one",28,Repatriation Bill 1961
103,Mr Osborne (Evans,Minister for,29,Repatriation Bill 1961

105,Mr Osborne,"It is a quasi-judicialgroup of witnesses may say that a complaint could have been of long standing and could have been associated with a war-time experience. But another body of evidence may say that the complaint definitely is of recent origin and could not have had its basis until long after the end of the war. The evidence against the applicant may or may not be convincing. If it is so convincing as to leave the tribunal in no doubt, the tribunal must decide accordingly. But if the tribunal itself is left in doubt that doubt must be resolved in the applicant's favour and the claim must be admitted. From experience extending over the greater part of one year, I am satisfied that the tribunals discharge their duties in accordance with the provisions of the act and that very few mistakes occur. In the course of his speech, the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) referred to a case which he proposed to bring to me in the hope that I would examine it. I have never failed to consider any case which any honourable member has brought to me; nor will I do so. But I ask honourable members to remember that I administer an act of Parliament which provides that decisions on claims are to be made by statutory bodies and whichassures the independence of those bodies. I have no authority to influence their Perhaps one can advance a logical argudecisions, and I have no right or intention ment in favour of an appeal to a court from to attempt to do so.

IfI see such an point of law. But what the Opposition proopportunity I do not hesitate to take it. I have stated already that our system for deciding claims and appeals-thi s threestage system of repatriation boards, the commission and the appeal tribunalsworks satisfactorily, and that I believe mistakes are rare. Clearly no administrative system which is charged with the responsibility to decide whether a person is entitled to receive benefits and pensions which are of very great value to those for whom they are intended, can ever hope to convince every one that an adverse decision is a correct decision. Repatriation is no exception. As I said on another occasion, I believe that from the very nature of the system the cases which reach members of Parliament are almost invariably those which have passed through all stages of application and appeal without success. The satisfied applicants, or the ones who feel that they have been given justice-the y are in the vast majority-hav e no occasion to seek out their members and tell them so. But, notwithstanding this, the Opposition proposes to introduce an amendment which is intended to allow an appeal to be made to the High Court of Australia or to a supreme court of a State. a tribunal's decision on a point of law. Such an appeal exists under the English system. There are arguments in favour of that I have been speaking about the possible poses in the amendment which it intends to",29,Repatriation Bill 1961

121,Mr Osborne,"I bave stated what IAt a rough calculation, the repatriation general hospitals would have to be far more than doubled to cope with the needs of ex-servicemen, and the annual cost would be vastly increased. I suggest that those who put forward this claim should think carefully and consider whether, if they succeeded, they might do so only at the cost of breaking down the value of the present system, which has been so carefully built up. The number of ex-servicemen personnel is still high-the greater part of 1,000,000 men and women-so that if this process were to go on, we would really have two systems of public medicine-on e for those who served for any time in the Forces and one for those who did not. Would public opinion in future years support that? Would future governments be able to find the money to sustain a greatly expanded repatriation service at the very high level at which the service is carried on now? Past governments-le t it be said to the credit of the people of this country-hav e not been niggardly in discharging their responsibilities to ex-servicemen in -espect ot war-caused injuries. Would future governments be able to maintain the system at its present level? Would we be able to preserve the very real and undeniable value of our present system to those for whom it has been designed-ex-serviceme n with war-caused injuries and their dependants? Those who value our present system, which has been built up with care to discharge the solemn promises which were made during two wars to those who fought for this country in time of danger and who suffered through doing so, should consider carefully whether too wide an expansion of the system might destroy it. I turn now to another of the Opposition's war pensioners' wives. arguments, which is that medical treatment should be provided for all veterans of World WarI . for all complaints, whether due to war service or not. In this, the repatriation system. They may have the Opposition repeats a claim and an argubenefit of the pensioner medical service ment it has been advancing for several provided under the National Health Act. years past, and it does so completely withWhat we are debating now is the Repatriaout regard to the very considerable alteration Act. tion made last year by this Government. In advancing the argument again this year, the Opposition overlooks entirely the fact pensioners already have it. that the Government has already provided medical treatment for service pensioners ment in repatriation hospitals. They have for all their disabilities. Every one who served in World WarI . must now, by the inexorable mathematics of time, be over 60 years of age. Any one who is over 60 years of age and who served in a theatre of war is entided to the service pension, provided he can meet the means test. So that, in advancing this claim again this year, the Opposition is seeking to apply the benefit of medical treatment only to those who cannot meet the means test. It proposes to give a very expensive range of medical treatment to people who, if single, may be receiving an income of up to £8 15s. a week or have property to the value of £4,860, and, if married, may have a joint income of £17 10s. a week or, between them, property to the value of £9,720. The Australian people as a whole might well ask whether giving free medical treatment for non-war-caused disabilities to people with means of that order is putting the social needs of this country at this time in their correct priority. In any case, this has struck me as a strange suggestion, coming from a socialist Opposition. Another claim put forward by the Opposition is that the wives of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen should be entitled to pensioner medical services and that the rate of the T.P.I, pension should be increased to an amount equal to the basic wage. I have looked at both of these claims with a great deal of sympathy because of the feeling we all have for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen. It is a mistake for the Opposition to confuse the pensioner medical service, which comes under the National Health Act, with the repatriation service.

You ruled against the Opposition's point of order. the honourable member will relate his remarks to the motion for the allotment of time. my remarks, most emphatically, to the limitation of debate at the committee stage that the Minister for Repatriation has proposed. It is obvious that when the Minister was making his half-hour speech which concluded a few moments ago, he intended to move that the bill be considered an urgent Haylen, L.

The Minister must be afraid of the amendments that we are to put forward. Apparently there are a certain number of ex-servicemen on the other side of the House who were going to support us when those amendments were proposed, and now the Minister refuses to allow the Opposition to put forward its arguments in support of the amendments. I believe the Minister, who has held the portfolio for twelve months, has shown a total and callous disregard for the problems of ex-service men",34,Repatriation Bill 1961

Territories) [4.56] I think members on both sides of the House know that it is necessary to have this legislation ready to go to another place by a certain hour of the day. Unfortunately, because of an occurrence which we all regret, we did lose some debating time in the House this week, but I do not think we want to discuss that aspect of it. It was one of those very regrettable incidents which lead to a suspension of the sitting. However, that suspension truncated our time. I suggest to the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) that instead of telling the House about all the things he would like to say if he had the time, he might defer that, allow the bill to go into committee and then put forward his point of view. The longer he and his colleagues protest against the guillotine, the more they The time limit proposed by the Minister for rob themselves of time in committee. The rime allowed for the second-reading debate and the time remaining for the committee stage are ample for the consideration of all the points of view. It is necessary for the smooth conduct of the business of the House and the forwarding of bills to another place, that we should pass this bill by a certain hour to-night and for that reason my colleague, the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Osborne), has proposed this motion. with the honourable member for Lang( Mr denied pensions, and they seek redress. Stewart) in protesting at the way in which They have not been able to get that redress this measure is being treated. I protest through the present agencies and all that particularly because in my opinion, and the Opposition wishes to do is to enlarge I think in the opinion of any objective the field so as to allow a court to deal with observer, the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr such matters in order that justice might be Osborne) has already pre-judged the amenddone. Not only should justice be done, ments which are to be moved at a later but justice should appear to be done to stage. He has a closed mind and has indithose who are denied these benefits at the cated that they are not acceptable. In present time. respect of some of the amendments, which have not yet been moved, let alone argued, the Minister has indicated that he is not these matters and if one ex-service man or even prepared to bring an open mind to the woman is to-day being denied a pension arguments that will be brought forward in that is his or her right, the position ought support of them. What is more, the to be corrected. It is an appalling, unhappy Minister has made up his mind before they and most unsatisfactory state of affairs that have been moved to reject them. He will members on the Government side of the not give other members of the Parliament House remain silent and are not prepared the opportunity for argument, within reasonable time, so that justice may be done to people who have long been denied it. The simple fact is that these amendments are not flimsy things of inconsequential nature, but are matters of vital and far-reaching nature. They refer to things like the automatic acceptance of cancer as a war-caused disability for which the sufferer is eligible for a pension and the proper provision of pensions for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen. Those are matters of vast consequence for people in the community. Apparently they are to be rushed through the committee after about half an hour's discussion and all the people in this place who should have an informed mind to bring to bear on these questions will be arbitrarily denied the opportunity to do so. I lodge my protest. Repatriation ( Mr Osborne) is insufficient, because there are major issues of principle at stake. The Minister does little credit to the cause of the ex-servicemen or the department that he represents in this place when he proposes the action that he has proposed to the Parliament this afternoon. The major principles which are involved deal with matters of great concern to ex-service men and women. Surely the six amendments to be proposed by the Opposition deserve fair and reasonable consideration! There are ex-service men and women Scant consideration is being given to all",35,Pairs

Mr Stewart (Lang) [5.8],"I m o v eservice pensioners to receive the equivalent of the class B widow's pension, which is at present £4 7s. 6d. per week, but will rise to £4 12s. 6d. a week when the increase that has been announced by the Government is implemented. The amount of the allowance that is at present paid to the wife of a permanently incapacitated service pensioner is at present £1 15s. per week, so that when the new rate of service pension of £5 5s. a week and the new rate of the allowance to a wife of a permanently incapacitated service pensioner, of £2 7s. 6d. been increased, apart from the increase per week, comes into force, a service pensioner and his wife will receive a total amount of £7 12s. 6d. per week. The pension plan of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, copies of which were sent to most honourable members, asked that the service pension be increased from £5 to £5 10s. per week. The League did not ask that the allowance paid to the wife of a permanently incapacitated service pensioner be increased, but it did ask that the rates of allowances paid to the wives and children of general rate war pensioners be increased. I point out that the allowance paid to the wife of a permanently unemployable ex-serviceman who is in receipt of a service pension has remained at £1 15s. per week since 1952, and by this bill it is being increased to £2 7s. 6d. per week. The amount of the allowance, when it was introduced in 1943, was 15s. per week. In 1947. it was increased to £1 per week. In 1949. it went to £1 4s. per week, in 1951 to £1 10s. per week and in 1952 to £1 15s. per week. It was not increased between 1952 and this year despite the fact that every few years prior to this year, when an increase of 12s. 6d. is being granted, previous Governments-bot h Labour and non-Labour-foun d it necessary to increase the amount of the wife's allowance. The service pension in 1952 was £3 been cut off from remunerative work in the 7s. 6d. per week and the wife's allowance relatively early stage of his life, but his wife was £1 15s. per week, or more than half is faced with extra responsibilities.

Because of her husband's condiapart from the increase of 12s. 6d. per wp»k tion, she has to accept responsibility for the that is granted by this bill. I suppose that care of their children, and she is unable to the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Osborne) will be prepared to sit like a mute in his place and say nothing on the arguments that are advanced in committee by honourable members on this side, because when replying to the second-reading debate, in effect he answered arguments that we shall put forward in committee. I should like the Minister to tell the committee why the allowance paid to the wife of a permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman who is in receipt of a service pension has not proposed in this bill, since 1952. In 1949, the Chifley Labour Government increased the amount of the allowance from £1 to £1 4s. per week, and in 1951 this Government further increased the amount to £1 10s. per week. As I have said before, the amount was further increased to £1 15s. per week in 1952, and it has remained static since then, apart from the increase proposed in this bill. As increases in this allowance were made every few years between 1943 and 1952, I cannot see why the amount has been allowed to remain constant from that year till now. If the wife's allowance was an amount greater than 50 per cent, of the service pension in 1952, it should have been increased as the amount of the service pension was increased since that time. The Opposition has been impelled to submit this amendment owing to the fact that the wife of a permanently incapacitated service pensioner is unable, due to the application of the means test, to earn anything greater than a set amount without affecting her husband's service pension. The wife of an invalid service pensioner is saddled with extra responsibility. She has to care for her sick husband, whatever disease he may have. Furthermore, service pensioners who receive the pension because of invalidity are below 60 years of age. Not only has the service pensioner himself enjoy a full life in many other respects. Her finances are severely limited, and because of that she is placed in a rather difficult position. It is not much to ask the Government to see that the wife of an invalid is granted a pension or an allowance that will allow her and her husband, and any children they may have, to live in a reasonable degree of comfort. The Opposition believes that the rate of allowance payable to the wife of an incapacitated ex-serviceman in receipt of a service pension should be increased to £4 12s. 6d. per week so that the total amount of the service pension and the wife's allowance would be £9 17s. 6d. per week. Even that amount is a miserly amount considering that the ex-serviceman has served his country well in time of war. The wife of an incapacitated service pensioner, not only because of his war-caused disabilities but also for other reasons is called upon to care for an invalid husband and she has to make many sacrifices in order to make ends meet. The Labour Opposition has submitted this amendment out of sympathy and because it knows and understands the problems that the wives of invalid service pensioners have to face. If there is any compassion, if there is any understanding, if there is any sympathy among honourable members on the other side of the chamber, particularly the ex-servicemen among them, then those honourable members, I feel, must support this amendment. I should like the Minister to explain why, although this Government saw fit to increase the wife's allowance in 1951 and 1952 it has left the allowance unchanged since then. The Government stands condemned for its callous indifference to the problems of invalid service pensioners, and the Opposition asks all honourable members who have any sympathy or understanding to vote for our amendment, because all it seeks to provide is a measure of assistance to support the amendment moved by the to the wives of invalid service pensioners. Repatriation) [5.15] -The clauses now sideration of the financial circumstances of before the committee are clauses I to 8 the wives of permanently unemployable inclusive.

As the honourable member exception of one section, the amending act for Lang has pointed out, the rate of penwill come into operation on the day on sion for the wife has remained unchanged which it receives the royal assent.

I believe that the Minister for time-table has been worked out so that we Repatriation has himself just acknowledged will be able to get this bill through this chamber and through the Senate as soon as possible in order that the increased pension rates may be paid as soon as possible. I am sure the committee appreciates that the time-table has had to be brought down so as to ensure that the bill will go to the Senate to-night. Clauses3 to 6 do not, I think, give rise to any controversy. They deal with machinery matters connected with administration. None of the provisions contained in them subtracts from anybody's rights. Some of them enlarge or ensure the existing rights of some people. The reason for those provisions was detailed with some care in my second-reading speech, and I do not propose to take up the time of the committee by recapitulating them now. Clause7 provides for an increase of 12s. 6d. a week in the pension for the wife of a service pensioner whose service pension has been granted on medical grounds-that is to say, because he is permanently unemployable or suffers from tuberculosis. The Government decided to increase this rate by 12s. 6d. a week, from £1 15s. to £2 7s. 6d. The bill also will increase by 3s. 6d. a week the rate of service pension payable to the first child. The Opposition has brought forward another amendment to provide a considerably greater increase. Pension scales are always matters on which people can argue that one particular rate ought to be higher than another. The amount of increase on which the Government has decided for this year is what we have determined as being the most that we can do in the present circumstances, and we therefore ask the committee to agree to the amount provided for in Ihe bill and not to accept the additional amount proposed by the Opposition. honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart).

During the second-reading debate 1 pointed out that many of the ex-servicemen who have qualified for service pensions on the grounds of permanent unemployability are people whose disabilities could quite easily have been accepted by a repatriation body as being due to war service. It is only because of the element of doubt in their cases-and this is a matter which is often referred to in this chamber-that the repatriation authorities have not accepted these people as eligible for the repatriation pensions paid to people whose injuries are held to be due to war service. Had they been so accepted, they would be receiving the special rate of pension, but, because, as I said, there was an element of doubt, the repatriation authorities have rejected their claims and they now qualify for no more than a service pension on the grounds of permanent unemployability. After this legislation becomes law, the wife of such a pensioner will receive £2 7 s. 6d. a week-the first increase granted since 1952, despite the tremendous increase in the cost of living since that year. The honourable member for Lang referred to the special circumstances involved in those cases, pointing out that not infrequently the wives of service pensioners are obliged to relinquish full-time employment because of the medical condition of their husbandsThe Opposition holds that in such cases the wives should be compensated to an extent which would enable the couple to live in much better circumstances than tihey can now live in on their combined pensions. As was stated by the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) last night in his second-reading speech on the social services legislation, a future Labour government will initiate legislation to provide that the wife of a service pensioner will receive a rate of pension equivalent to that received by a B class widow. Our amendment proposes that the wife should receive a pension of not less than £123 10s. per annum, which is the same as the B class widow's pension at the rate of £4 12s. 6d. a week. We believe that this is only just and reasonable. The Minister himself has acknowledged that even despite the increase now proposed by the Governwill still remain inadequate that. it. He may deny it, but he implied that the Government was not in a position at this stage to do any more than it proposes, and I suggest that the inference from that is that the amount should certainly be increased. I ask the committee to accept the Opposition's amendment. speak only briefly in order to correct a statement made by the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) which was untrue. The honourable member suggested that service pensioners who are totally unemployable through illness are in receipt of their present pensions instead of the pensions paid to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen simply because there is some element of doubt as to whether or not their condition was caused by war service. That is not a fact. The people concerned are incapacitated, but not because of war service. Had there been any element of doubt as to whether or not their incapacity was due to war service the completely impartial repatriation tribunals would most certainly have resolved the doubt in favour of the ex-servicemen. Does anybody seriously suggest that the people to whom the honourable member for Bass has referred, who have been incapacitated in their civilian lives, should receive the same consideration, in the way of repatriation pensions, as people who have been totally and permanently incapacitated as a result of their war service? There is no element of doubt in the cases with which we are now dealing, which are of men who are ex-servicemen but who have become totally and permanently unemployable through illness or accidents in their civilian lives. The illness or incapacity is in no way related to his war service, but the Repatriation Commission, as the honourable member for Bass knows, goes to the extreme point of",39,Pairs

Let us not confuse the minds of members of the committee on this point. The incapacity referred to in clause 4 is a civilian incapacity, with no relation whatever to war service. I am very pleased that the Minister, having recently taken over the Repatriatio:'. ( Mr Wight) in shorthand. First, we do not portfolio, has seen fit, in the first amendments that he has introduced, to provide for an increase of no less than 12s. 6d. in the wife's allowance. increase in the rate of any pension or allowcase, with the ex-serviceman totally incapaance in any year. The honourable member for Wills may sneer. But let me remind him that at no time during the Labour Party regime did it ever increase any pension by anywhere near that amount. So it ill becomes the honourable member for Wills to sit on that bench, sneer and make remarks such as that which he just made in regard to the increase that has been prothe bill to see the valuation that the Governvided. I for one am proud that the Government is providing for an increase of 12s. 6d. This is a very sound move on the part of the Government, and the committee must not be misled by the statements made by the honourable member for Bass in an attempt to confuse us and strengthen the debating points that he put forward. This is a repatriation bill. This clause refers to a service pension, and the incapacity suffered and come over on this side when we divide. by the ex-servicemen, for which he and his wife are receiving consideration, has no relationship whatsoever to war service. The honourable member for Bass knows that if Stewart's amendment) stand part of the clause. an ex-serviceman has an entitlement under the Repatriation Act and is receiving a pension for some war-caused disability that restricts his mobility-make s walking difficult for him and impedes his progress across a street-and is knocked down by a motor car, he can relate the injury resulting from being knocked down by the motor car to the war-caused disability and he can then receive a T.P.I, pension if he is totally incapacitated. Cases of that nature are on record in the files of the Repatriation Department. Let us clear our minds. We are considering now civilian disabilities for which ex-servicemen are receiving recognition under the Repatriation Act. The Minister is to be congratulated on the increase in pensions provided in clause 7. the limitation of time, I shall have to demolish the honourable member for Lilley agree that the onus-of-proof provision is satisfactorily applied in such a way that everybody is covered. Secondly, this is a simple matter of common humanity. The allowance for a wife is miserable in the extreme. If both persons were of an age to qualify for the age pension, they would be receiving over £10 a week. In this citated and possibly dependent upon his wife for care, she will receive an allowance of £2 7s. 6d. We say that it is time that wives of pensioners received the same consideration as they would if they were themselves pensioners. One has only to look at the schedule to ment places upon a woman living On her own. In view of the fact that there has been no other amendment for seven years, this provision is miserable in the extreme. Because a wife is being treated differently from a widow, even though she subsists in the same society, we have moved an amendment. We suggest that the honourable member for Lilley look at his conscience, have less care for the Government's pocket, Question putThat the words proposed to be omitted ( Mr The committee divided.

Let us disregard the position of the ex-serviceman and examine what the schedule means when applied to mothers or widows. schedule provides that the pension payable to a widowed mother of a serviceman who was below the rank of leading seaman, -corporal or any relative rank or rating shall be £4 10s. a fortnight. Then there is a fine gradation in, I suppose, a sort of feudal system. The widowed mother of a leading seaman will receive £5, of a petty officer £5 3s., of a chief petty officer £5 5s. 6d., and of a warrant officer £5 13s. 6d. Then we come into the silk department. The widowed mother of a member of commissioned rank below lieutenant in the Navy, captain in the Army or flight lieutenant in the Air Force will receive £5 18s., and of a lieutenant, captain or flight lieutenant £6 8s. The schedule then goes through all the ranks until we reach ranks higher than captain in the Navy, colonel, group captain and relative ranks. The widowed mothers of such officers will receive £8 6s. This is almost double-no t quite, of course-the amount payable to the widowed mother of -members of ranks below leading seaman, corporal and relative ranks. It is not difficult to imagine families living on the more senior ranks. side by side who have lost sons of widely differing ranks.

I realize that there has been a gradual breaking down of these great differences, but I cannot justify those that moveremain and I think the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Osborne) should turn his wordsattention to them. We on this side of the chamber do not propose to vote against the provision, but honourable members should consider what it means in the repatriation system. Repatriation is based upon sacrifice and provides some compensation to ex-servicemen and their dependants because of that sacrifice. We all stood equal in sacrifice, no matter what the rank was. Widows and mothers stand equal in the face of sacrifice, and there can be no possible justification for the differentiation in this schedule. If the Minister does not get around to this The matter before December, we will fix it ourselves after December. make some reference to the remarks of the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant). As a preface to other comments 1 want to make, let me say that I agree with the sentiments that he has expressed. However, I point out that in 1943 a committee was appointed by the Parliament to investigate the Repatriation Act, and that the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) was a very distinguished member of it. The committee recommended that any increases in pension rates should apply uniformly to every rank referred to in the schedule. Since 1943, the recommendations of the committee have been adhered to, and in the past twelve years that this Government has been in office, the recommendations of the committee have been followed with even 1 increase matie in the pension rates. The honourable member for Wills will concede, therefore, that in the time we have been in office, there has been a reduction in the relativity between the rates of pension payable to those on the low ranks and to those If we continue to adhere to the recomIn clause 10, omit from paragraph (a) the "" ' RATE FOR SPECIAL PENSIONS-TWENTY-S K insert"" ' RATE FOR SPECIAL PENSIONS-TWENTY-EIOH I The increase proposed in this amendment brings the pension into line with the basic wage which applies to-day if averaged over the six capital cities.

153,Mr Wight (Lilley) [5.41],I want to,43,Pounds Sixteen Shillings Per Fort Night
154,Mr Barnard (Bass) [5.43],"1not breaking new ground. We have consistently advocated that the special rate of pension should be at least equal to the basic wage. This was part of Labour's policy in 1955, and was contained in the policy speech in 1958. At this stage, we have decided to move it as an amendment to the bill. We believe that the very minimum tha should be paid to a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman who is no longer able to accept his full civic and social responsibilities is this special rate of dowment would bolster the payment. But pension. Our point of view has been upheld by various organizations interested in the welfare of ex-servicemen. Although it may be true to say that the ex-servicemen's organization, in its last submission to the Government Members Ex-servicemen's Committee, did not ask that the equivalent of the basic wage be granted, let me point out that the Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers Association requested in April last that the special rate pension be increased to £14. I suggest that that sum was in line with the then existing basic wage. So, in moving that the special rate pension be now increased to £14 8s. a week, we are endorsing the principle that has been accepted by the Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers Association. The Government has seen fit in the legislation now before the committee to increase the T.P.I, pension by 15s. a week, bringing the rate to £13 5s. a week. As I have already indicated, the Opposition proposes that it should be £14 8s. to accord with the existing basic wage. In Australia to-day, 20,807 ex-servicemen are in receipt of the special-rate pension. If the special rate pension were increased by £1 3s. a week as the Opposition proposes, the Government would be involved in an additional expenditure of approximately £28,000 a year. When all is said and done in £1,600.000,000, the sum of £28,000 is not very significant. But the payment of that money would mean a lot to people who. because of their war service, are obliged to live on a special rate pension which we believe is quite inadequate. At the second-reading stage, the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) referred to the special rate pension and said that that was not the only amount received by the ex-servicemen concerned. He said that the wives' allowance also entered into the picture. I have consistently claimed in this chamber that the sum which the wife of an ex-serviceman, in this case the specialrate pensioner, receives because of her husband's disability has nothing to do with 1 his pension. We are discussing the amount that is paid to the special rate pensioner himself. On a number of occasions in this chamber Ministers have said that child enchild endowment and the wives' allowance have nothing whatever to do with the amount of pension that is paid to a special rate pensioner. We believe that the proposition that has been advanced by the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen's association-that is, that the special rate pension should not be less than the basic wage-is sound. I have already indicated that on numerous occasions we ourselves have advocated the payment of a pension of that order. The Opposition's amendment should receive the support of Government members. I should like to see supporters of the Government rise in their places and hear them say that the special rate pension now advocated by the Opposition should not be adopted. I should like to hear them tell me why the special rate pension should not accord with the basic wage. We believe that an amount equivalent to the basic wage is the very minimum that should be given to these pensioners. "" Hansard"" report of what we have said. honourable member for Mallee, who has interjected, would be the first to agree with me when I make that point. There is no need for me to labour the matter. In the a Budget for approximately past, we have consistently put forward a case in support of the proposition we are now advancing. I am sure there are supporters of the Government who are in sympathy with the Opposition's amendment. Indeed, I am sure no Government supporter is prepared to rise in his place and say that the special rate pension should not be increased to the amount now proposed by the Opposition.

Supporters of the Government frequently tell us that the person in full employment who is receiving only the basic wage is rather a rarity, yet we are begging and pleading with the Parliament to provide the equivalent of the basic wage for those who should have the highest regard and full recognition of the community. The Totally and Permanentally Incapacitated Pensioners Association has asked not only that we should increase the pension to £14 but also that the allowance for a wife be increased to £3 and that it be paid by the Repatriation Department so that it will not be subject to any means test. They believe that the wife's allowance "" Hansard"" and it can be read by any should not be paid, as it is at present, as part of the income of £17 simply because the spouse is the wife of an invalid person and has to qualify under the means test for a social service pension.

With all that in mind, I compliment this Government on what it has done for ex-servicemen while in office. It has given increases in pensions and all sorts of amenities to ex-servicemen.

I remember that during a debate on this matter in 1960 the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron) admitted, in answer to a question directed to him in this chamber, that there was no known cause of cancer. If the cause of cancer is not known, I submit it must be very difficult for a doctor to justify the rejection of evidence submitted by an applicant that his cancer is due to war service. I was most impressed, as, I am sure, were other honourable members, by figures given this afternoon by the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Osborne), when closing the debate on the second reading of this bill. The Minister said that about 50 per cent, of the applications made to the repatriation authorities to have cancer accepted for entitlement to repatriation benefits had been",46,Pounds Sixteen Shillings Per Fort Night

If it is not possible for a doctor to say with any degree of certainty that a particular case of cancer was or was not due to war service, then, unless the repatriation authorities can show beyond any reasonable doubt that it was not due to war service it obviously must be accepted under section 47 of the Repatriation Act. I believe that all the arguments that were submitted to this Parliament in favour of having tuberculosis automatically accepted as a disability entitling the sufferer to benesubmitting is not a new one. It has been fits under the Repatriation Act apply with equal force in the case of cancer. We have been told that it is most difficult for the Repatriation Department to supply statistics required by honourable members on this subject. The fact remains, however, that the department itself has admitted, and the Minister for Health has admitted in this Parliament, that it is not possible for a doctor to say with any degree of certainty that a particular case of cancer was not due to war service. If a doctor cannot say this with any degree of certainty, then obviously the condition must be accepted by the department as entitling the ex-serviceman to repatriation benefits. Because of the inability of doctors to discover the cause of cancer, I believe that in all fairness the unfortunate people who contract this dread disease should be placed in the same position as those who have contracted tuberculosis, whether during their service or after it. Undoubtedly the provision of the legislutely whether the amendment is justified. lation under which tuberculosis is autoAsI have said, I believe that it is justified, matically accepted for entitlement to benefit but the department has not been able to is a generous one. The Government introfurnish the figures which I believe are duced that provision because of the nature necessary if we are to make up our minds of the disease itself. But the arguments in definitely one way or the other. I am not favour of the acceptance of tuberculosis are prepared to accept the idea that tuberculosis equally cogent in respect of cancer, and I suggest, therefore, that cancer should also should not have been regarded as a warbe accepted as a disease automatically caused disability in all cases. entitling the sufferer to benefits under the Repatriation Act. I said a few minutes ago that this proposal renresents the contention not only of honourable member is talking about and 1 members of the Opposition. I have no doubt also know what I am talking about. I am that the amendment is viewed sympanot prepared to accept the idea that tuberthetically by honourable members of the culosis should not have been accepted.

If the claim, of course. The last three annual the honourable member for Flinders could reports of the league have contained resee my point he might clarify his own quests that the Minister consider the automatic acceptance of cancer for purposes of repatriation benefit. For instance, on page 11 of the 44th Annual Report of the organization, item 45 saysCommonwealth Government to provide that Section 37 of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act be amended so as to include after the words "" pulmonary tuberculosis"" wherever appearing, the words "" and/or cancer of the lung "". As I have said, the proposition we are put forward year after year by the Returned Servicemen's League. We believe that in fairness to ex-servicemen generally, because of the nature of the condition, and because of the inability of the medical profession to say with any certainty how an ex-serviceman contracted it, cancer should be accepted as calling for automatic entitlement. In view of the fact that the Opposition's amendment, which has been proposed on numerous occasions in the past, has received such wide support from the returned servicemen's organizations, obviously it should receive also the support of the Government. the outset I should like to say that I am inclined to believe in the justification for the Opposition's amendment.

173,Mr Mccolm,"I know what themind. When tuberculosis was accepted as a war-caused disability a precedent was set. I believe that if the medical profession cannot state definitely that a certain disease has not been war-caused, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the ex-serviceman concerned. I know that individual cases are not necescomplete and thorough investigation by a sarily the best basis on which to work, but I know of an ex-serviceman whose application was rejected by the board within the last few weeks. This man was in the Army for a number of years during the war and was discharged in 1944 with a nervous condition. At that time he had a tenderness of the stomach. From 1945 until he died four months ago he had what the doctors called spasms of the stomach. In other words, spastic contractions of the stomach were occurring with gradually increasing frequency. Shortly before the man died an operation was carried out and it was found that he had cancer of the stomach. I do not think for one moment that the board should have rejected the application to have this cancer accepted as a war-caused disability, but it has been rejected. The matter now is before the commission and I have every hope that the commission will deal with it in the way laid down by section 47 of the act. I believe that these matters are important. There are many different forms of cancer and the amendment now before honourable members covers cancer in every form. I think that the only sensible way to deal with this matter is to set up a committee of the House to investigate the question thoroughly. Such a committee could get all the information that is available from the department and from the cancer authorities in other countries because we are by no means the leading cancer authority in the world. Honourable members do not have this information at present. We are being asked to judge this matter without being in possession of the full details. I can only say that I support completely the Opposition amendment. I propose to abstain from voting, but I suggest that a committee of the House should be set up. Mr L. R. Johnson -Why not propose an figures in relation to what it will cost the amendment along those lines? ment along those lines. However, I believe that a committee should be set up so that honourable members' minds may be clarified on this point which already has received a good deal of thought by ex-servicemen generally and by ex-servicemen's organizations. Clarification can only come from a committee of the House. A department that implements government policy is not the proper body to provide the information that is necessary. This is a matter on which the House has to make up its own mind. sorry that the honourable member for up his mind. ber has made up his own mind and feels that other people's minds should be made up for them. We of the Opposition have made up our minds. In fact, we made up our minds as early as last year. cancer is too wide. honourable member would have any difficulty in accepting our definition. If the definition is deficient technically, it would be the simplest thing in the world to have that little weakness rectified when the bill is before the Senate. I think that should satisfy the honourable gentleman and remove any doubt from his mind. The honourable member for Bowman stated that he wants some figures on this matter. I do not know the nature of the figures that he wants. Does he want to know the number of claims that might be made on the Government? I do not think that is material to the issue. Ever since the repatriation problems first cropped up honourable members have been talking about giving the benefit of the doubt to ex-servicemen. Here is an opportunity to clarify the position at least in relation to cancer. Let the benefit of the doubt be given forthrighfly and unequivocally to the ex-serviceman.

If the age group between 40 and 60 years of age has a cancer incidence of, say, 5 per cent., and the age group between 50 and 60 years has an incidence of, say, 10 per cent, cancer, that Opposition members apparently have what has that to do with the question? The fact remains that no one knows whether the cancer could have been caused by the war. This cannot be stated with any degree of certitude, so the benefit of the doubt must be given to the ex-serviceman. If it is a question of financial responsibility, how deeply will the country be involved? If a cancer is of a minor character, the medical fraternity can nip the trouble in the bud, and the patient recovers. That is the end of the matter and the patient is no longer pensionable. But if the cancer is in a serious resolution in the Queensland branch of the form then unfortunately the patient may not live for very long and so will not draw a pension for very long. So if, in terms of cold hard cash, it is a question of the impact of these payments on the Budget, that is a miserly attitude to adopt. I have never read or heard of the medical fraternity anywhere claiming that it knows what causes cancer. The medical fraternity states that it knows that certain chemical elements, irritation, and a wide range of other things may induce cancer, but I understand that no one has been able to say definitely what the origin of cancer is, so why not give the benefit of the doubt to the ex-serviceman? Some members of the medical fraternity will say one thing and some will say the other. That is no reflection on them. But we must look at the facts. Only recently, in Victoria, there was disputation over the cause of death of a man who worked on the wharfs loading wheat which had been treated with a particular kind of disinfectant gas-phosgene . One very eminent medical man said that undoubtedly his death had been caused by the inhaling of this gas, and another equally well qualified medical practitioner said that death was not due to that cause. I think that this Parliament has to take its courage in its hands and say that cancer in an ex-serviceman shall be accepted as entitling him to repatriation benefits, whether or not it is war-caused. Why not do it? That would not cost the country very much, but it would bring great credit to the Parliament for doing the decent thing in solving this problem for ex-servicemen. man, before I deal with the essence of the argument on this amendment, let me say not read very closely the terms of the amendment which has been moved. Each Opposition speaker who has discussed this amendment has advocated that cancer be accepted as a war-caused disability. Nothing in the amendment suggests that the Government or the Parliament should accept it as such. The Opposition's amendment is based entirely on a resolution which has emanated from the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. I claim to have initiated the league. I had it accepted there and submitted to the national body. statement can be checked. The fact is that cancer is not required to be accepted as a war-caused disability. The suggestion is that section 37 of the Repatriation Act be amended to embody a reference to cancer. I remind the committee that that section provides that tuberculosis in an ex-serviceman shall be treated "" as if the incapacity or death resulted from an occurrence that happened during his war service "". Under the terms of this section, an ex-serviceman who has tuberculosis receives a pension and treatment from the Repatriation Commission, notwithstanding that there is no suggestion that the disease was in fact caused by his war service. A proviso requires that he shall have served in a theatre of war. As I have said, Sir, I initiated the resolution in the Returned Soldiers League. I am sure that nobody will contradict that. Honourable members can check the fact with the league. One would suppose that I , having initiated the resolution in the league.",49,Pairs

But I do not do so, because, since initiating the resolution and initiating, also, discussion of this matter in the Parliament, I have had a series of discussions with the Commonwealth Statistician and with officers of the Repatriation Commission about the argument which I advanced in favour of the acceptance of liability respecting cancer. As a result of a speech made in this chamber, I received a letter dated 9th July, 1959, from the gentleman who was Minister of Repatriation at that time. That letter contains certain statements which 1 should like to mention this evening. I showed it to the honourable member for Bass( Mr Subject to the above remarks, I append the Barnard) and suggested that I incorporate it in "" Hansard "". The honourable member intimated to me that the Opposition would not oppose such a course. The letter contains a great deal of statistical information relating to the incidence of cancer among ex-servicemen. It embodies, also, statements which I believe will be of value to honourable members in debating this matter from time to time. Accordingly, with the concurrence of the committee, 1 incorporate the letter in "" Hansard "". There are three typewritten pages. The letter is as follows:I refer to the reply to your Parliamentary Question relating to cancer which 1 furnished through my colleague the Minister for Health on 29th April, 1959, and I have noted with some concern your remarks on it in the House on 7th May, 1959. I hope I need scarcely emphasise that neither I nor my department had the slighest intention of concealing available information to which you are entitled, nor is there any reason why we should attempt to do so. In answering your Question 4, I did not intend to convey that no facts whatever regarding deaths from cancer were known to my department, for as I pointed out in the House, the first part of my answer indicated that knowledge of some deaths from cancer had come to the notice of the department. What my answer was intended to indicate was that no information which was complete and from which any safe conclusions could possibly be drawn was available. Prior to 1959 no statistics were kept showing deaths from cancer of 1914-18 members. The information available in regard to 1939-45 members up to 1959 is confined to those whose deaths became known to the department because of some war pension entitlement action. I am setting out hereunder the available information relating to these cases, but in doing so wish to point out the following factors which prevent valid deductions being drawn from the figures:(a) The class recorded cannot be taken as representative of all servicemen of the 1939-45 war. The incidence of death from all causes is likely to be greater among this group; (b) All deaths due to cancer have hitherto been recorded under the single classification "" Malignant New Growths and Cysts ""; (c) The available information does not relate deaths to large groups. This is, of course, of major significance in relation to cancer; (d) There is no information available to show the relationship of deaths from cancer to other significant variables-e.g. , duration, nature and area of war service would not have been significantly different from the normal life of the community. following information in regard to the 1939-45 war:Recorded Total Average deaths from deaths number of Year ending malignant from all members in 30th June. new growths causes of receipt of and cysts members in pension for known to department. receipt of pension.* all types of disabilities. 1946.. 34 307 51,931 1947.. 72 493 76,046 1948.. 93 633 87,826 1949.. 103 707 95,754 1950.. 101 822 104,387 1951.. 80 924 111,092 1952.. 129 1,044 118,415 1953.. 87 957 123,127 1954.. 101 1,049 127,646 1955.. 68 1,119 132,452 1956.. 122 1,193 137,114 1957.. 124 1,337 141,152 1958.. 178 1,424 143,278 Total 1,292 12,009 * Not all deaths from cancer known to the department would necessarily be included in this figure, as some of the members who were recorded as having died of cancer may not have been in receipt of war pension (e.g. death accepted as due to war service though member not in receipt of war pension). As from the 15th January, 1959, the ""International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death"" has been adopted throughout the department. This lists eighty-six different kinds of Neoplasms, including fifty-six malignant types. Also from 15th January last, causes of death (in accordance with the International code) are being recorded for members of all wars, other than South African, though difficulty is experienced in getting information where the deceased was not a war pensioner. A great deal of information, not recorded statistically, is contained in the individual medical files of deceased members of both World Wars. However, to extract and record this would involve a tremendous amount of time and labour, including professional staff which it is difficult to make available from other duties or to recruit. At this stage I am not prepared to undertake the task. As appears from the Commission's Annual Reports to Parliament, a fairly wide range of",50,Pairs

With the resources which can reasonably be made available for the purpose, it has been necessary to collect and collate statistical material on a strict basis of priorities. However, Cabinet has recently approved the introduction of machine processes for payment of pensions. It is planned to use these machines also for statistical purposes, and it is intended, as resources permit, to record on punched cards a wide range of medical statistical data, not only from current files but ultimately from the files of deceased members. Necessarily this work will take time to complete, but once recorded, a wide range of information can relatively quickly be extracted by machine. I shall formally reply to your Question of 7th May (Question No. 25), and also to another Question on this subject of 13th May (Question No. 39) at the next Sittings. Meanwhile, I hope the foregoing information will be of some assistance, and give you some indication of the complexity of the problem from the medical, statistical, and administrative aspects. Finally, if you desire and if the opportunity presents itself, the Chairman of the Commission and the Principal Medical Officer would be glad to discuss these matters with you in further detail. I now want to refer specifically to the suggestion made by the honourable member mittee of this Parliament be appointed to consider whether or not a reference to cancer ought to be embodied in section 37 of the act. section. able member suggested that a committee be appointed to consider the matter, though. I suggest that at this stage that proposal is premature, because we, as a Parliament, have to approach the subject with the responsibility that one would expect of a National Parliament. Before we, as a Parliament, can make any determination, we need to ascertain the facts and the statistics. Those are not yet available. With respect to this, I now refer the committee to a paragraph in the letter which I have incorporated in "" Hansard "". The paragraph readsHowever, Cabinet has recently approved the introduction of machine processes for payment of pensions. It is planned to use these machines also for statistical purposes, and it is intended, as resources permit, to record on punched cards a wide range of medical statistical data, not only from current files but ultimately from the files of deceased members. Necessarily this work will take time to complete, but once recorded. a wide range of information can relatively quickly be extracted by machine. I suggest that this Parliament is entitled to have, and should demand, production by the Repatriation Commission of the statistics that will enable us to determine this matter clearly in our own minds. We require statistics of the incidence of deaths of ex-servicemen due to cancer in its various forms. We want information regarding the service of each ex-serviceman so that we can relate the kind of service to the cancer which caused his death. It is important that this information be classified in the various age groups because the incidence of cancer varies according to the age group. As a Parliament, we should demand that the commission extract by the use of the machines that have been installed this data that we need. I agree that, once it is available, we may then consider the suggestion by the honourable member for Bowman that a committee of this Parliament investigate the matter and give to the Parliament recommendations based on facts. ber for Lalor is like a parrot or a cockatoo sitting on a post chattering away. He repeats himself and makes no sense at all. He has had his turn and he ought to let other speakers have their say. He should be called to order by the Chair. When1 was so rudely interrupted, Sir, I was suggesting that this Parliament has a responsibility to the taxpayer as well as to the ex-serviceman. I have never known an ex-serviceman to demand more than he was justly entitled to in his opinion or more than he felt he was justified in seeking from the taxpayers. Therefore, 1 suggest that in order to satisfy ex-servicemen and the Parliament, and to do our duty as members of the Parliament representing our constituents, we must not come to a decision on an emotional basis. We have to decide the matter on the facts. Therefore, we have to ascertain the facts. That means that we must have the statistics in order that we may put the case clearly to the people and say, "" Ex-servicemen are entitled to have cancer provided for under section 37 of the Repatriation Act "" .",51,Pairs

194,Mr Wight,"The honourable memberFor these reasons, Sir, I here and now oppose the amendment that has been proposed by the Opposition. I believe that that amendment, first, and primarily, is based on emotionalism, and, secondly, represents an attempt to capitalize on a situation which has arisen as a result of a request made by the Returned Soldiers League. I suggest that the amendment has been put forward purely in an endeavour to embarrass the Government on an emotional issue, and not as a result of a reasonable, sound and intelligent approach to the problem. We, as a Parliament, cannot say at this stage that cancer ought to be provided for in section 37 of the act. Before we can say that, we must have the information on which we can determine the matter. I believe that the Repatriation Commission has a responsibility for finding this information and making it available for every member of the Parliament so that the issue can be settled once and for all. Chairman, I should like to think that the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) had the same concept of the responsibility of this Parliament for the many millions of pounds that are spent in other fields as he seems to have in relation to the poor unfortunate ex-serviceman who happens to suffer from cancer. Would he, for instance, subject the defence estimates, which, in one sense, are a fairly closely allied his dependent family are entitled to know subject, to the same intensive mechanical scrutiny as he demands on this issue? The simple fact is that nobody has been able to say what are the causes of cancer. On the other hand, the Minister has said that medical men are able to say what does not cause cancer. It seems to me ridiculous to suggest that it can be said with confidence that any statistical analysis can assess the effect of a serviceman's active service under differing climatic conditions, in a whole -'""t v of physical conditions and in varyin?, emotional stresses, none of which can ever be measured by any kind of modern apparatus. We are making an appeal to the social and human conscience of our people to help these unfortunates, for not only does this matter affect the ex-serviceman himself, but more often than not it also affects the wife and children who, in the large majority of cases, are left after the ex-serviceman has passed on. When we realize what a vital difference there is between what such a soldier's widow would enjoy as a civilian widow pensioner under a means test with very few other concessions and the concessions that she would receive if she were regarded as a war widow, one cannot help but appreciate the feeling of frustration such people must have. If cancer were accepted as a war-caused disability, the widow would enjoy not only the war widow's pension, but also domestic allowances, extra children's allowances, assistance from organizations like Legacy and from the soldiers' children's education scheme, all of which I think are outside any consideration of the means test and all of which are designed to bring some kind of comfort to a widow who has been left in those circumstances. If the Minister feels that the tribunals can say with confidence that a particular ex-serviceman suffering from cancer contracted the disease as the result of some his war service, let the tribunals take the responsibility of openly saying what were, in their view, the particular conditions that caused his cancer. That is the proposition that is put to them. After all, the onus of proof is placed upon them, and if they can say without doubt at all that an ex-serviceman's cancer was caused by conditions not related to his war service then both the ex-serviceman in that unhappy plight and what the medical authorities of the Repatriation Department have determined were the causes of his cancer. That is our direct challenge, and I cannot possibly see how, in the light of all expressed opinions about the causation of cancer, any medical authorities can say with absolute, unqualified confidence that they are in a position to make such a judgment. That is the challenge that is made to them. As I have said, when one realizes how much is involved in this matter, not merely for the ex-serviceman himself but for his unfortunate dependants, who may live on for many years after him, one must conclude that the department has some responsibility in the matter. I think that in his own heart the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) realizes that this is a just cause. He also realizes that in connection with pulmonary tuberculosis there was not a demand for all",52,Pairs

I believe that no statistical evidence could ever be crucial or critical in making determinations of this kind. We have to exercise sympathy in this matter. I do not think we can possibly be excused for not taking action simply because we have not available to us crucial statistical evidence to compel us to act in the sympathetic way in which we are being implored to act. If we have to wait for years until this kind believe we can ever get statistics that can be of evidence can be prepared, how many a crucial factor in arriving at a decision on more ex-servicemen will pass on? How these matters. I say that because I feel many more wives will be added to the that there are so many uncontrolled factors thousands whose husbands already have died when a human being is exposed to such of cancer and who have had no pensions variable conditions as can be found in time granted to them?

To illustrate how far medical it must be proved conclusively for the opinion can go on this matter, I emphasize benefit of the taxpayers of Australia that that in many cases the cancer is not found an ex-serviceman's disability is waror diagnosed until a post mortem examinacaused. tion has been made. Only last week one case came to my knowledge of an ex-serviceman who has been suffering from the effects of gas since World WarI . and who receives a pension for a chest complaint. That man is now suffering from, indeed dying from, same sort of remarks in his second-reading cancer, but his application to have the speech. We say that if the onus of proof cancer accepted as a war-caused disability means anything, if there is any doubt whathas been rejected.

The question arises as to whether we can allow to continue the possibility of injustice, suffering and hardship while waiting on statistics which may not be produced for about 50 years at the present rate of progress, by which time the whole question will be resolved, for all the ex-servicemen will have passed on. As the honourable member for St. George( Mr Mr L. R. JOHNSON (Hughes) [8.42] Clay) has said, statistics can prove anything. You can prove from statistics that being Prime Minister of Australia is a cure for baldness because only one Prime Minister has been bald. This kind of argument which honourable members opposite produce is completely out of line with the purpose of the repatriation system. We have chosen to mention cancer, not because the honourable member for Lilley thought of it first and not because the Returned Servicemen's League thought of it first, but because it demonstrates to us that the onusof-proof section of the act is not being applied in accordance with the spirit of parliamentary debates on this subject. We intend to use cancer as a test case to test the Government's sense of responsibility to ex-servicemen. speech of the honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds) evidenced the contention of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Anderson) has talked about statistics as Wight) that the Opposition's case for the inclusion of cancer as a war-caused disability is based on emotional grounds. It was an emotional speech. I should think that better evidence could be furnished by comparing statistics relating to ex-servicemen who died of cancer and civilians who died of cancer in various age groups. If these statistics reveal a higher mortality rate ex-serviceman's cancer condition was the from cancer among ex-servicemen than among civilians of corresponding age groups then the Opposition would have a strong argument. It was for statistics such as these that the honourable member for Lilley asked, not the kind of statistics to which the honourable member for Barton referred. Only simple, vital statistics are required, but the Opposition has produced nothing but emotional appeals. I have great sympathy with the ex-servicemen concerned in this matter. But, as I said in my F.7613/61 -R -[41 ] speech during the second-reading debate, there are other complaints of which doctors do not know the cause. If cancer is accepted for repatriation purposes as the Opposition suggests this would open the field very wide. However, if the Opposition were to obtain the statistics that I have suggested should be obtained it might be able to present a good case. There is no time to develop any argument of substance in this matter because of the guillotine on this debate. If there is any extended argument on this issue we will not have the opportunity of pressing for a vote on the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. hours of argument. Mr L. R. JOHNSON -The Opposition wants a vote to be taken in order to clarify where members stand, not only on this amendment but on the host of controversial points that come before the Parliament from year to year, as the Minister has said. We want the opportunity to put honourable members right on their mettle. In this case we are talking about statistics. Basically, we are considering whether or not to extend the provisions of section 47 of the act-the ""benefit of the doubt"" section. The honourable member for Hume( Mr though these could provide the complete answer to the dilemma confronting the Parliament. It would not matter if statistics showed-afte r the years of inquiry that would be required-that there is no higher incidence of cancer among ex-servicemen than there is among non-ex-servicemen.

Surely that name strikes a note, perhaps more with honourable members opposite than with some of us on this side of the chamber. Is it not reasonable to assume that some one who was in the Changi camp or some other prisoner-of-war camp, and who came back an emaciated skeleton would be susceptible to this or that disease? The figures might show that there is no higher incidence of cancer among ex-servicemen than among civilians but there could be one or two or 50 cases in which there is a genuine association between cancer and war service. The honourable member for Lilley and the honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) are two distinguished ex-servicemen. Surely, in time of battle they felt that if ever an issue of this type arose they would be prepared to extend the benefit of the doubt to an ex-serviceman! How have they lost touch with the great spirit that prevailed in those times? What would the Opposition's proposal cost the Government? A miserable £5,000 or £6,000 or £7,000!

The onus-of-proof provision has been the subject of a great deal of debate in this Parliament. Only a few weeks ago I initiated a discussion on it and the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Osborne) replied. This amendment has been proposed on previous occasions by the Opposition when repatriation bills have been debated in this Parliament and I believe that all the arguments which the Opposition feels should be advanced in respect of section 47 of the Repatriation Act have been advanced at those times. We believe they are the correct arguments and the Minister is well aware of them. Earlier this afternoon he had an opportunity, in quite unusual circumstances, of replying to our case before it had been put to this Parliament. The Minister chose to do it in that way, and he has not replied to any of the amendments proposed by the Opposition in committee. 1 have previously said, when dealing with this contentious section 47 of the Repatriation Act, that numerous opinion* have been expressed as to whether or not it is being applied in the way that Parliament originally intended. The Opposition has consistently contended that the section has not been applied in that way. 1 have referred on other occasions to the opinions which have been given on this matter by a former Leader of the Opposition, Dr. Evatt, by a former Attorney-General of this Government, Senator Spicer, now Mr Justice Spicer, by the former member for Balaclava, now Mr Justice Joske, who frequently spoke on this matter in this House and, more recently, by the present Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwicki The present Attorney-General recently gave an interpretation of this section. With the exception of his interpretation, each of the gentlemen I have mentioned who expressed an opinion Parramatta? ception of the opinion recently given by the honourable member for Parramatta, the present Attorney-General, each of these opinions clearly laid it down that if section 47 of the act were correctly applied the benefit of any doubt must be given to the appellant or applicant. There is no shadow of doubt about the meaning of the act. As I and honourable members on both sides of this chamber know, there have been cases before the entitlement tribunewhere an opinion has been given against the appellant by the repatriation doctors and an opinion has been given in his favour by a specialist with some knowledge of the case. Despite the fact that the specialist has given a clear opinion in favour of the appellant or applicant, the case has been dismissed. I ask: How can a case be dismissed when a specialist is prepared to give an unqualified opinion that the ex-servicemen's condition has either been clearly related to his war service or has been aggravated by it? How can that evidence be overthrown if the onus-of-proof provision is being correctly applied? On numerous occasions in this Parliament arguments have been advanced to show that",56,Pairs

204,Mr Barnard,"Yes. With the exthe onus-of-proof provision is not being correctly applied. I make no criticism of the tribunals themselves, because no one appreciates more than I do the difficult position that these gentlemen must find themselves in with respect to applying the onus-of-proof provision. I suggest that all honourable members consider the full reports of"" the entitlement appeal tribunals tabled by the Minister only yesterday. They show the number of appeals on which action has been taken by the various tribunals and the number allowed. I am not suggesting that one tribunal is more favorable to an appellant than another, but I suggest that the tribunals do havegreat difficulty in applying the onus-of-proof provision. In view of the fact that so many of the cases that come before the tribunals rest, in the final analysis, on a point of law, surely it is not too much to ask that this Parliament should consider favourably a request from the Opposition that, if there is a legal doubt, the appellant should have an opportunity to submit his case to the High Court or to the Supreme Court of a State or Territory. We believe that that is the only logical solution much as the Opposition does the need to to the problem. I have no need to remind honourable members that, this matter has been debated in this. Parliament before the present Government came into office. Honourable members who are now sitting on the Government side were just as adamant, when they were in Opposition, as we are that section 47 was not being correctly applied. I say quite, frankly that all governments have been at fault in this matter. A review of the Repatriation Act by an all-party committee of this chamber presented an opportunity to overcome the difficulty, but the fact remains that the tribunals themselves obviously have great difficulty in applying section 47. We believe in fairness to the appellant. If there is a legal doubt he I say to the honourable member for Bass should have the right to submit his case to the High Court or to a Supreme Court. The Minister has said nothing in his any other responsible body of ex-servicemen argument that has convinced me that this is in favour of this amendment. should-not be done. It has been requested by the Returned Soldiers' League. I am not suggesting that that organization has Time is running out and I cannot speak requested that our amendment be applied, at length, because we have other amendbut the fact remains that it has indicated ments that we wish to have put to a vote. that section 47 is, in its opinion, not being correctly applied. So the weight of opinion not only of the members of this chamber but also of ex-servicemen's organizations, would indicate that there is some difficulty at least over section 47. We believe that our amendment presents an opportunity to this Parliament to provide a means to give the appellant every chance to have his case favourably decided on a disputed point of law. Repatriation) [9.4] -The course I adopted this afternoon was by no means unusual. During a long debate in which fourteen honourable members spoke on the second reading, one member of the Opposition after another stated that the Opposition intended to move certain amendments, outlined what these were and argued the case for them. The amendments were circulated, and I was completely in order, and acting in accordance with ordinary practice when I replied to the arguments at that stage of the debate. I do not want to take up the time of the committee. I want to see the Opposition get on with its amendments. I regret as curtail this debate by the use of the guillotine but honourable members opposite know that unless we get this bill through this chamber and into the Senate to-night there is a very strong possibility that the people intended to benefit by the measure will be denied for a fortnight the increases provided for. That is why the bill is urgent. I will content myself by saying that I think that in my reply to the second-reading debate I covered adequately the claim that there should be a rehearing of the case of each dissatisfied appellant, before the High Court or a Supreme Court. That course is impractical for the reasons that I stated. I doubt very much whether it would be in the ex-serviceman's interest as a whole, and ( Mr Barnard) that he is on very shaky ground indeed if he tries to make us believe that the Returned Servicemen's League or Mr L. R. JOHNSON (Hughes) [9.5] -",57,Pairs
205,Mr Osborne (Evans,"Minister forHowever, 1 want to make some reference to the whole principle of the routine adopted in relation to ex-servicemen's claims for acceptance of disabilities as war-caused. It has already been conceded that tribunals, boards and commissions can be wrong in their judgments, because the Repatriation Act provides the facilities to enable an ex-serviceman to appeal from the decision of one body to another. So, the very structure of the act concedes the possibility of error on the part of tribunals. case in the light of these figures. I ask The only point of difference at the moment between the Government and the Opposition is whether or not there should be one further medium of appeal. That is all. I repeat, the existing legislation concedes that the first authority by whom an ex-serviceman's case is decided can make a mistake, and that the second authority to which the case may go can also make a mistake. There is provision, therefore, for the case to go before a third authority. We are asking for still another authority-the High Court or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory-to which a case may be taken. The figures in regard to appeals dealt Court of the type which is already in with and appeals allowed are interesting, operation in the United Kingdom. The and I rose mainly to read them into the former honourable member for Balaclava, ""Hansard"" record.

This is another which went to the entitlement appeal tribunals for action was 10,573, and the number upheld was 1,085a ratio of ten to one, roughly speaking. Something is rotten in the State of Denmark. The appeals that went to the assessment appeal tribunals in respect of the ex-servicemen of all wars totalled 12,303 for action, and the number allowed was 5,008. It is very important to see this whole how many of the people who make those applications and appeals are seen by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) who is interjecting. For my part, being a very humble citizen able to see the element of common sense in the attitude expressed by my constituents, I am obsessed by the idea that so many ex-servicemen are denied justice. For the life of me I cannot see why so many of these ex-servicemen fail to get a favorable decision. All that we are proposing is that, since the fact that mistakes may be made is already conceded in the act, we should provide a further judicial tribunal to hear appeals. We are asking for a form of appeal to the High Mr L. R.

I listened carefully to the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson). He said there was only one difference between his side and our side, but 1 think there is a considerable difference. 1 ask any Opposition member who may speak after me to give the committee an approximation of the cost of this proposal to the country. On an earlier proposal, the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) consistently said that the Opposition's suggested increase of the special pension would cost £28,000 a year. It would cost £1,820,000 a year, not £28,000 a year. If the Opposition would tell us what this present proposal would cost, we would be very interested. day the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr If the Minister can give any explanation Osborne) tabled the annual reports of the for the greatly increased percentage of four war pension entitlement appeal appeals allowed by the Nos. 3 and 4 tritribunals, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.

IfI have time a little later, I will give between the number of appeals granted by the exact number of cases it heard and the the tribunals. number it rejected. The No. 2 tribunal accepted 13.2 per cent, of the cases that came before it and the No. 3 tribunal to oppose the amendment. The Returned allowed 25.4 per cent.

The Nos. 3 and 4 tribunals are apparently much more sympathetic than are the Nos. 1 and 2 tribunals.

Instead of having figures even as high as those given by the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart), far fewer returned servicemen would have their cases accepted, because any decision would have to be made strictly on the basis of law.

But the answer is not to be found in providing a right of appeal to a Supreme Court. I urge the committee to consider the very important point that no ex-serviceman's organization is advocating the adoption of the suggestion made by the Opposition. PerhapsI could illustrate this by recounting what happened at a recent meeting. Only a month ago, the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Osborne) came to Queensland. A meeting was arranged, with the Sandgate Sub-branch of the RSL. acting as host. A great many RSL. sub-branches and other ex-service organizations in the area were invited to send representatives. The meeting was specifically called to discuss section 47. Not one representative of one ex-servicemen's organization voiced his dissatisfaction with the manner in which the provision was now being implemented.

220,Mr Fox (Henty) [9.33],"I do notwhich 1 raised in this House last May with respect to pensions and allowances paid to merchant seamen. As the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman) reminded us in his second-reading speech, this legislation was first enacted during the war years, in 1940, in order to provide pensions and other benefits for Australian seamen incapacitated by war injury, or for their dependants. Generally speaking, 1 think that we have nothing to learn from the social services or repatriation legislation half a dozen in the whole of the Commonof the United Kingdom. However, the United Kingdom Government does pay pensions and allowances to seamen who served in the 1914-18 war, while the Australian legislation makes no such provision. In the year ended 31st December, 1959, there were 13,700 pensions being paid in the United Kingdom in respect of merchant seamen of the Second World War, while only 1,070 pensions were still current with respect to the First World War-onl y about 8 per cent, of the number being paid with respect to the second war. I have obtained figures from the Departpension, but who remarried and then became ment of Shipping and Transport which show widows once again. I take this opportunity that approximately 132 pensions are being to repeat my request that the Minister conpaid under the legislation which we are sider the position of these women, and 1 now considering. These are paid to merhope that he will adopt a more humane chant seamen of the Second World War or approach this year than he did last year. to their dependants. If the proportion of pensions payable in the United Kingdom in respect of the first war as compared with those payable as a result of the second war is accepted as applying with approxicommittee without amendment or debate. mate equivalence in the case of Australian seamen, there would not be, in my opinion, more than a dozen extra persons in Australia affected, and any surviving seamen of the First World War would be over 60 years of age at the present time. I would ask the Government to consider making (vide page 1080), on motion by Mr provision for them under this legislation as Robertonthe United Kingdom Government does. There is no logical reason why they should not receive the benefits, as they served in very similar circumstances to the merchant moved, by way of amendmentseamen of the Second World War. not delay the House on this matter. I simply ment of various Social Services to correspond with wish to ask the Minister for Shipping and increased prices, and particularly condemns the Transport ( Mr Opperman) once again to Government consider a request that I made when legislaendowment unaltered since 1950, during which tion of this kind was being considered twelve time its purchasing value has halved "". months ago. At that time. I referred to a seaman's widow who had been eligible for a pension-equivalen t to the war widows' pension-wh o remarried and who later again became a widow. The widow of an ex-serviceman in similar circumstances is entitled, if she is in necessitous circumstances, to receive an allowance from the Repatriation Department. 1 asked the Minister to consider the cases of the very limited number of women, possibly not more than wealth, in this category. The Minister promised to look at the matter, but as soon as the smoke of battle died down the Government did the dirty on us. It did not look at it, and 1 received a reply to the effect that the request I had made in the House had been considered, but that the Government was not prepared to bring down any amendment or to give any relief to these unfortunate women. As I have said, there would probably be no more than half a dozen persons in this category, ex-servicemen's widows who had been eligible under this legislation for a Question resolved in the affirmative.

221,Mr Jones (Newcastle) [9.35],"I shall ment for having failed to increase rates of payLabour Party election excesses of some years ago were recalled to mind during the debate last evening when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) announced the Opposition's social services election promises. abandon the honourable member, as spokesman for his party, enticed votes for what 1 suggest is an unhappy and manysplintered political group. As he enticed these votes surely he was incurring many millions of pounds additional Commonwealth expenditure to make possible the benefits that he was promising. Some of the newspapers of the country have stated that the Labour Party's promises in this field of social services could be estimated to cost £80,000,000. Other newspapers, other estimators and those interested in social services have said that the proposed benefits would cost many more millions of pounds. 1 think that I can claim to have an interest in this field, and 1 estimate the value of the Labour Party's promises at well in excess of £100,000,000. And the honourable member was suggesting that this amount should be spent over and above that incurred in the benefits which are available to-day! How easy it is for any person or for any party to advance proposals of this kind! Any reasonable leader in the community to-day would like io stv almost every benefit increased if only this were possible. Then the elderly citizens and under-privileged people would find their lot so much easier. Any thinking man, any member of Parliament worth his salt, would like to see increases in benefits of that kind. But the parliamentary purse is subject to the revenue which John Citizen provides. We who are elected to the high office and responsibility of members of this chamber, and particularly those who are called upon to exercise office in the executive of government, have a responsibility to see that the right and proper thing is done according to the availability of the finance which can be called in from the taxpayers. ensure that balanced development receives attention while at the same time, the country's social services and other responsibilithe House in some detail of what was ties are refined or improved. It would appear that the Labour Party would introduce irresponsible government of the kind which the people indicated they feared by their deliberative vote a few years ago when the then leader of the Labour Party with more than gay abandon horrified With gay the country with the estimated cost of the social service benefits which he was then offering. Yes, I suggest that the Labour Party of to-day would introduce irresponsible government in this way probably by whittling away the defence expenditure in large lumps, if not completely, and stepping up social service benefits too quickly and applying them too widely. good printing press. a good printing press to make the amount of money that it would want to spend. The bill before us provides for a further increase in the maximum general rate for age and invalid pensions from £5 to £5 5s. a week. In addition, the allowance paid lo the wife of an invalid pensioner or a permanently incapacitated age pensioner will be increased by 12s. 6d. a week io £2 7s. 6d.. while the allowance for the first child under sixteen years of age will be increased to 15s. a week. These are commendable increases. Some of us might like to see them increased still further, but let us recognize that the recipients will receive a benefit which is not small and which is not without value in the present situation. Many of us too have been concerned about the lot of the class A widow who has two or more children. This bill provides that in addition to the base rate increase of 5s. a week the class A widow will receive a further increase of 5s. a week for each child after the first. Those are the principal amendments of the act with which we are dealing. No reference to the age and invalid pension scheme of to-day is complete without reference to the merged means test which has operated since March of this year. In his second-reading speech the Responsible government must Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) paid a very genuine tribute to the officers of his department and, justifiably, reminded involved in the introduction of the merged",63,Social Services Bill 1961

224,Mr Cleaver,"It would need to havemeans test. We would expect the Minister, with his close association with his department, to pay such a tribute but 1 think that those of us who, with some delight, supported the introduction of the merged means test and those of us who have been interviewing so many hundreds of people who wanted clarification as to what benefit might apply in their case, would be lacking if we did not follow suit and pay a like tribute to the officers of the department because of the splendid co-operation that we have received from them. So to-night 1 want to add my words of praise to those that already have been spoken. I want to remind the House that at least 106,000 people have benefited from the merged means test. Therefore, thousands of grateful people have moved up to a full pension entitlement from a part-pension, and thousands more have received a partpension for the first time to help them meet their commitments in their latter years. I should remind the House, as other honourable members have done, of the significant fact that under the merged means test as we know it a married couple to-day are entitled to some pension assistance until their property exceeds in value £9,500. Of course, that amount of property is entirely distinct from the exempt property, being the house in which they live, the motor car which they may have saved so carefully to buy in the latter part of their lives, and their personal furniture. This is a splendid arrangement and I for one, like so many others I am sure, would like to pay once more a tribute to the Menzies Government which ensured that the merged means test was adopted in last year's Budget and came into operation in March last. Let me now provide the House with the latest statistics in the field of social services. by a number of Opposition members about These statistics are applicable as at 30th June last. I understand they have not yet been released in the printed form in which we are accustomed to seeing them in the department's annual report. In the last financial year total expenditure under the Social Services Act reached £257,700,000 which represented an increase in that financial year of £24,100,000. As the House is fully aware, under this legislation we deal with benefits totalling a very large amount. But how manv neople are covered? What is the spread of the benefit of this legislation? Surely it is interesting for us to place on record that last year a record number of persons-562,79 0 of themreceived an age pension. The proportion of age pensioners to persons of pensionable age now exceeds 50 per cent. Some 177,271 men and 385,519 women to-day receive the age pension. Women represent 62 per cent, of age pensioners. Quite a lot of inquiries are received by honourable members about the proportion of pensioners who receive the full pension. I note with approval that 90 per cent, io-day are in receipt of the full pension, and 10 per cent, receive a part pension. The average weekly payment last financial year to every registered pensioner was £4 16s. 8d. When we turn to supplementary assistance, we find that the Opposition has recognized the value of this scheme which was introduced by the Menzies Government. The Opposition has stated, of course, that it will widen the scheme-a t tremendous cost. The act at present provides for supplementary assistance of 10s. a week for those single pensioners who pay rent. The statistics show that this supplementary assistance is received by 68,869 women and 22,645 men Supplemehtary assistance is given by the Department of Social Services to 12.8 per cent, of age and invalid pensioners throughout the country and to 15 per cent, of those women who are in receipt of a widow's pension. I notice that 6,850 people receive benefits under the arrangement made to enable pensions to be paid to people who, unfortunately, must reside in benevolent homes. The benefits of the pensioner medical service are being extended to 88 per cent, of registered pensioners. We have heard a great many comments child endowment. I am pleased indeed to be able to point out that a record number of children-namely , about one-third of the total population of Australia-ar e covered by child endowment payments. Of the total Australian population of about 10,500,000, 3,340,302 children are covered by child endowment. Some people may be interested to hear the spread of these payments over the various sizes of families. Families with one child receive 35 per cent.; families with two children, 32.5 per cent.; families with three children, 18.4 per cent.; families with four children, 8.6 per cent.; families with five children, 3.3 per cent.; and families with six or more children, 2.2 per cent. I praise the Government most genuinely for its achievements, Mr Speaker, but I do not claim that all anomalies have been removed and that full justice is done to all. I stated earlier that everything cannot be done at the one time to meet the wishes of everybody. However, the Government has from time to time implemented proposals emanating from many sources. Opposition, of course, hopes that some of its amendments will be adopted. Private members on the Government side of the House also have their ambitions for charges in social service legislation. is keen to see benefits for certain classes of people increased. I believe that there are areas in which assistance might well be approved, and I offer a couple of suggestions in passing. I have already mentioned supplementary assistance. I suggest again, as I have suggested on other occasions, that the Minister for Social Services and the Government take action to liberalize the eligibility requirements for supplementary assistance to some extent in order to provide for all single pensioners who are considered to be entirely dependent on the pension. assistance of 10s. a week is helpful and is appreciated, but I believe that a lot more deserving pensioners would benefit if this assistance were extended to them at some future date. Opposition members have discussed the funeral benefit in this debate as they have done on other occasions, and have criticized the Government for not increasing it. I suggest that there is little point in paying a higher rate of funeral benefit to relatives who are not in need, but I am keen to see a supplementary payment of, say, £15 to £20 in addition to the present funeral benefit of £10 paid to a person who is considered to be entirely dependent on the pension and who is liable for the funeral costs of a spouse. I am sure that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will nod his approval of that suggestion. Mr Allan Fraser -Indeed, I do not. the honourable member does not, for I believe that benefits of this kind could go with advantage into the pockets of deserving people. I for one would be glad to support the payment of an increased rate of funeral benefit to the remaining spouse in view of the high cost of funerals to-day. My time is limited, Sir. I am sure that other honourable members would like an opportunity to contribute to this debate, and so I shall reduce my speech and take less time than I would normally have taken. I conclude with these comments: I believe The that the correction of a number of anomalies which remain in the field of social services would have little impact on the total cost of social services. The areas concerned are well worthy of consideration. For example, the class A widow's pension might be paid I happen to be one who to the wife of a prison inmate with a dependent child from the date of the committal of a prisoner sentenced to three months' imprisonment or more, instead of from a date six months after committal as at present. I suggest that the present arrangement is an anomaly that is well worthy of attention. I do not think that the cost of this improvement would be very great. Another suggestion that I offer is that the definition of a child in relation to the class A widow's pension and age and invalid pensioners be amended to include full-time The present supplementary students over the age of sixteen years in the care and custody of the pensioner. A widow who is keen to encourage a child who shows promise and whose study will continue beyond the age of sixteen ought to receive increased benefit for the child beyond that age. I suggest, further, that a pension of 10s. a week for the provision of amenities might well be paid for each inmate of a mental hospital. sition happens to agree with that proposal. Finally, I suggest that legislative action be taken, if not with respect to the Social Services Act, which we are now considering, then with respect to some other social services legislation, to provide for a Commonwealth subsidy of £1 for every £2, other than government or semi-government moneys spent on the construction of recreational centres for pensioners. This is an aspect of social services in which the need is",64,Social Services Bill 1961

227,Mr Cleaver,"I no'e that the Oppobecoming more and more apparent in our community to-day. These proposals which I have mentioned are, I believe, worthy of ihe Minister's enthusiasm. 1 for one will continue to advocate that they receive attention at some future date. I suggest that as we debate this excellent, piece of amending legislation which offers such attractive and worth-while benefits to so many people, we must realize that this Government needs to offer to the people of Australia no apology whatever for its record. When we look back over the years of the Menzies Administration, we find that in this field of social services there has been a substantial increase in benefits and in the spread of those benefits amongst the community. There is no thought in our minds of apologizing for even one area. We simply say that what has been done is very commendable and I believe, as a member coming in contact with the pensioners in my own constituency, that by far the great majority of those who are recipients of benefits under our social service legislation are well satisfied. It is on that record, in which 1 believe the Minister and his colleagues might well take pride, that this Government will confidently face the forthcoming election. inadequacy of social service payments in all fields is a continuing problem. In recent years, because of the failure of the Menzies Government to contain rising costs, the inroads of inflation have continually reduced the purchasing power of pensions, child endowment, unemployment benefits and all other forms of social service payments. Even with the increases contained in this bill, no one could reasonably say that social service payments are adequate in these inflationary times. Certainly no one could argue in this chamber that age or invalid pensioners can maintain themselves reasonably on £5 5s. a week. The fantastic rise in the cost of living in recent years has not extravagant but only fair to the brought with it high rents, high food prices, a great increase in clothing costs and a tremendous lift in the cost of all important fuel in winter months. It is unfortunately true that numerous items essential to life covered much of this ground, and my chief have become luxuries to many of those purpose in joining this debate to-night is to on the basic pension. It is true, too, that outline two apparent anomalies in the social some pensioners are in a better position than others. Those with a home of their own are generally in a far better position than those who are forced to pay rent, although inflation has left its mark on local government finance and municipal rates are a constant problem facing pensioners who own their own homes. I am sure that every honourable member has come in contact with a great number of pensioners, both single and married, who exist on living standards that bring shame to the community, and to the Government which allows such conditions to develop. A variety of factors contribute to this unfortunate situation. Chief amongst these is, of course, the high proportion of the pension which some recipients pay in rent. With the introduction of the merged means test in March last, there are now separate classes of pensioners who receive a basic pension of £5 5s. On the top rung are those who have a bank balance, who own their own home, a car and many of the domestic appliances that make life easier, and who perhaps receive some additional income within the permissible limits. On the bottom rung are the under-privileged who pay rent, who cannot earn additional income, because of illness or incapacity, and who exist on the bread line. As the means test has been liberalized, there has become more apparent a need to get away from the concept that a basic pension should be given to all. Accordingly, the proposal which the Opposition will put to the electors that a special payment of up to 30s. be made to individuals with special requirements, would fill a great need in the social service structure. Certainly it would bring light to the lives of the many needy of the nation. For more than ten years now, child endowment has been given the go-by in successive budgets. Whatever the arguments put up by the Government, the fact remains that the purchasing power of child endowment has dropped drastically in those years. Clearly, the proposals for increases put forward by the Opposition are families, especially those on the lower incomes who need help most. During my speech on the Budget. I",66,Social Services Bill 1961
228,Mr Beaton (Bendigo) [10.1],"Th eservice payments and to submit proposals tor overcoming them. First, 1 want to draw the Minister's attention to an unfortunate aspect of the application of the merged means test. The Minister will recall that under the old income means test a pensioner could earn £182 annually. He Could earn it in a variety of ways. He could earn it in weekly amounts of £3 10s., he could receive it in a lump sum. or he could earn it in a period of short-term employment at a higher income than £3 10s. a week. For instance, he could work for ten weeks in temporary employment at £18 per week, so earning £180 for the year. He would then not work for the remainder of the year and still receive his pension. I emphasize that under the old income means test there was no limitation on weekly earnings. On the other hand, under the new merged means test a pensioner without property, or one with property of a value below the permissible £200, who earns over £7 in a fortnight must notify the Department of Social Services. If his income should exceed £7 in the next fortnight, action is taken to reduce his pension accordingly. my knowledge in the Bendigo district. By this action, many pensioners who have each year, be granted a refund of the amount employment to help eke out a living are penalized. change. are a number of processing factories where essentially seasonal work is carried on. It has been the practice for a number of pensioners to work during a season, particularly the summer season, at processing tomatoes, fruit and so on, earning additional income below the £180 for a short term, and helping to eke out their living. In recent months, since the introduction of the merged means test, numbers of these pensioners have had their pensions reduced because of their earnings over a short period. I stress that many of these pensioners have no property. All they have to look forward to is the small income they receive for their short period as seasonal workers. reduction. ter that this has happened in my district. These pensioners on basic pensions have suffered as the result of the introduction of the merged means test. They are not now able to go out and work for eight or ten weeks at £12 or £14 a week and still enjoy full pension payment. After a certain time, they are notified that their pensions will be reduced. and I certainly will. The Minister says that this does not happen. I can assure him that it does. That being so, I ask for two things in seeking a solution. First, 1 ask that an exemption be granted to those pensioners without property in these circumstances so that they may earn £182 in a year without having their earnings calculated in fortnightly periods. Failing that, I suggest that those whose pensions are reduced because of this provision, and whose income does not reach £182 in a year be granted a refund of the amount withheld at the end of each year. The second matter to which I wish to refer is the need for unemployment benefit for those in the community who are under sixteen years of age, and I put these points to the Minister: In many cases, an unemployedfifteen-year-oldwould be the eldest, if not the only child in the family. In such cases the endowment received would be 5s. a week only. This would also apply in the case of most fourteenyear-olds. The second point is that the 5s. a week would be a poor substitute for the £1 15s. per week to which the fifteenyear-old would be entitled if he were still unemployed on and after his sixteenth birthday. At fifteen years of age he is just as much in need of benefit as he would be at the age of sixteen. Third, in a great majority of cases, a child goes to work at the age of fourteen or fifteen years because of extreme hardship in the family. It is often a matter of pressing necessity for a child to earn his living at the fee of fifteen. In tim?s of recession, the child has no compensation for the loss of his job and he can pay nothing into the",67,Social Services Bill 1961

236,Mr Beaton,"I accept the invitationhousehold where it could well be that the father is also unemployed or on short time. Fourth, Lie Commonwealth Government recognizes the right of the employed child under sixteen still to claim endowment, appreciating that even when a child is earning wages it still falls upon the parent to provide much for the child. It is therefore illogical to deny unemployment relief to a child who is within the age group for endowment. My final point is that in a great number of cases, children of fourteen or fifteen years of age are working in the daytime and attending night school. A considerable proportion of their earnings goes for fees, school books and equipment. The payment of unemployment relief would help to keep them at their studies. Endowment would not. Accordingly, 1 ask the Government to give earnest consideration to these points which I believe outline the case for the payment of unemployment relief to children under sixteen years of age. In conclusion, I believe that the increases proposed by the Labour Party in other social services recognize the unfortunate position in which the social service recipient has been placed as a result of the Government's failure to retain the value of what we term the Chifley £1. Australia's economy needs a shot in the arm. No member could correctly say that increased pensions or social service allowances would result in luxury spending or increased inflationary pressures. The bringing of a better share of this country's increased productivity to pensionersa just sharewould result in increased purchasing power which would provide the stimulus that the economy so urgently needs. I wish to address my remarks to the amendment proposed by the Opposition, which reads as follows:That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof:"" this House condemns the Government for having failed to increase rates of payment of various social services to correspond with increased Eden-Monaro enunciated earlier. I have prices, and particularly condemns the Government for again refusing to make any increase in child endowment, thus leaving child endowment unaltered since 19S0, during which time its purchasing value has halved "". I ask the House to take notice of the implications of this amendment. The interpretation that 1 place on it is that the Opposition has implied that the purchasing power of pensions has halved. If this is so, the Opposition sbould claim that the base-rate pensions should be doubled. Mr Allan Fraser -We say that the value of child endowment has been halved, not the rest of the social service payments. Opposition becomes inconsistent, as it usually does. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser), in support of his proposed amendment, advocated an increase in the base rate of age, invalid and widows' pensions of only 5s an amount to which the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) referred as "" another measley 5s. increase "". Let us look at the facts. When the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission decided to fix the basic wage on the new principle of the capacity of industry to pay, the child endowment content, which previously was a factor in wage adjustment, went by the board. Because of that, as has been illustrated, the basic wage rose quite sharply from that time onwards. I believe that, as the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) enunciated earlier in this debate, the child endowment content should still be maintained in fixing the basic wage. I believe that the capacity of industry to pay should be assessed on the wage, plus a child endowment content. But the Opposition wants it both ways. It wants an assessment on the full capacity of industry to pay, and on top of that it wants child endowment. The Opposition has stated that present pension rates have less purchasing power than when Labour was in office. Let us examine that claim, because it is the Opposition's challenge. Mr Allan Fraser -That is not our challenge. for Bendigo( Mr Beaton) reiterated the policy that the honourable member for here figures which have been taken from various booklets issued by the Commonwealth Statistician. They show that in June, 1949, the basic wage was 124s. whereas in May, 1961, it was 288s., an increase of 131.5 per cent. In that period",68,Social Services Bill 1961

Similarly, the age pension has risen from 42.5s. to the 105s. proposed under this legislation, an increase of 147 per cent. In other words, if the age pension had been kept down to the level of the consumer index the pensioner would be receiving only 86s. 3d. per week. If it had been held down to its relationship with, the basic wage the pensioner would receive 98s. 2d. per week instead) of the 105s. per week which is now proposed. There is another aspect of this matter which some people might not have noticed. That is the relativity between health and social service payments and the Government's annual income. In the year 1948-49 the cost of health and social service benefits was £80,777,000. The Government's income in that year was £535,048,000, so that health and social service benefits repre£83,300,000 for proposed increased social sented 15.1 per cent, of the Government's income.

In 1959-60 the cost of health and social service benefits rose to £330,605,000 which represented 20-.2 per cent, of the Government's income of £1.638,000,000. In 1960-61 health and social service expenditure represented 21.1 per cent, of income. Thesefiguresgive the lie to the accusation that social service pay£300,000,000 or £400,000,000 a year proments are not keeping pace with increased costs. Let us look at some of the Opposition's proposals. The proposed increase in child endowment would, I am reliably informed, cost £61,700,000 per annum. The increase in age, invalid and widows' pensions from £5 5s. a week to £5 10s. a week as proposed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro would cost £9,50.0,000 per annum. Increased allowances to the hardship cases to which he has referred would cost an additional £5,000,000. Increased funeral benefits would cost an additional £800.000. The increases proposed in the allowances for wives and children would cost £1,300,000. The proposed increase in maternity allowances would cost £4.000,000. The proposal to reduce the residential qualification-wit h which I agree-woul d cost £1,000,000. figures total £83,300,000 or 26 per cent, of the country's income. They do not include those items which are too difficult to cost such as the abolition of the means test other than the property means test and the extension of the provisions of the aged persons' homes legislation. There is also this, beautiful little bubble proposed by the Opposition-the extension of prenatal, care. They should know that in most cases medical, practitioners make a bloc change for a confinement which also covers pre-natal care. So this proposed benefit means nothing really. The Opposition also proposes the abolition of the pay-roll tax which would cost £61,000,000 and cuts in sales tax which would cost about £41,000,000. The exact figures cannot be obtained. Labour also proposes to exempt the basic wage from taxation, and to reduce taxation on incomes up to £40, a week at a cost of probably £40,000,000, making a total of about £142,500,000. If we add to this the service benefits we get a total of £225,800,000. Then we have the proposal for a shipping line at a cost of perhaps £100,000,000 or £200,000,000 a year, and additional development of the north. Do not forget that not more than about 15 per cent, of the community in Australia earns salaries in. exc.ess of £40 a week. This means that this extra burden of posed by Labour would have to be borne by that 15 per cent, of the community and by industry. I ask the electors to ponder on the inevitable repercussions if Labour is returned to power and implements these extravagant promises. I wish now to refer briefly to two anomalies which I find in the present act and to which I have made earlier reference in the Budget debate. The first refers to the definition of class A widows. In the new pamphlet issued by the department, as in the old one, there is reference to continuation of class A pensions. There we readA class A widow may continue to receive her pension until her child reaches 18 years of age if the child is a full-time student, is not in employment and is dependent on her. This is not so. Section 63 (1.) (ab) of the act, which grants the extra 10s. per week These for the succeeding children other than the first is quite clear, and statesin the case of a class A widow who has the custody, care and control of two or more children -a n amount per annum ascertained by adding to the sum of Two hundred and sixty pounds the sum of Twenty-six pounds for each of those children other than the elder or eldest child; In section 79 (1). we readThe Director-General may direct that a pension shall not cease to be payahle (or having ceased to be payable, shall again, subject to this. Act, become payable) to a class A widow so long as she has the custody, care and control of a child who(c) is receiving full-time education at a school (including a technical school) or deservedly given to the Government for the a university (including a university college). But the Director-General cannot use any discretion to reduce that pension until the youngestchild attains the age of sixteen years. This means that because of this anomaly in the act the children of many widows .are denied higher education, for which they may be we}] fitted. I feel that this provision should he amended and it would not cost very much. Such an amendment would give the class A widows who struggle to give their children a higher education a possibility of giving them that to which all children, are entitled. That is what the. pamphlet signifies, by its wording and not, as the act provides, that it shall apply only to the last child. The other anomaly relates to the position of a class A widow with perhaps two or three children, who has the misfortune to have the younger child attain the age of sixteen years when she herself is just under 45 years of age. She loses her class A pension and gets nothing further. 1 know the intention was that the children could then keep the mother, but that is not possible in these days. A girl of perhaps nineteen or twenty years and a youth of seventeen and perhaps the youngest child of sixteen may have been looked after for twelve or thirteen years, during the woman's period of widowhood, and during that time she has had no chance of acquiring the skills which would enable her to enter some form of continuing employment, but she is still debarred from receiving assistance. Her children cannot bring to the home more than perhaps the bare sustenance for themselves. provision which allows a widow of 45 years and one day when the youngest child reaches sixteen to get the class B pension until she reaches 50 years of age or right through, whereas the other widow has to wait until she is 50 years of age before she can claim that pension. I feel that this grevious anomaly could be overcome by deleting from section 60 (1.) (b) (ii) the words "" after having attained the age of 45 years "". The bill before us carries forward the tremendous record of the Menzies-McEwen Government in the field of social services. It adds to the terrific amount of credit introduction of the merged means test and also for the way in which it has examined the position and is still examining the various suggestions put forward not only by members on this side of the House but also certain of those by the other side. I commend the bill and will vote against the amendment. menting the Government on its programme of soeial services as outlined in this year's Budget, I do not wish to traverse the same ground as was covered by the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) in his speech. It is a matter of record that the Menzies Government throughout its term of office has continued to enlarge the range of benefits and to increase the rates of benefits paid. At the same time it has eased the means test in relation to both property and income to an extent which has never previously applied. I was pleased to hear the Minister refer to the fact that structural changes are under consideration. To my mind, we have now reached a stage where further regular increases in the basic rates of pension will not achieve the effects that they should; that is, to relieve distress and give help where it is most needed. After this bill receives the Royal assent it will be possible for an aged couple who have no dependent children, who own their home and. therefore have no rent to pay, and who have an income of £7. per week from either superannuation, annuity or some other source, to receive a joint pension of £10 10s. a week, or a total income of £17 10s. a week free from income tax. When comr pared with a married man in receipt of the Here we have a basic wage, who has two or three children to feed, clothe and educate, the aged couple are well off. On the other hand, a single pensioner living alone and having to pay rent, will receive only £5 15s. a week, which",69,Social Services Bill 1961
240,Mr Fox (Henty) [10.25],"In compliis a totally inadequate amount. I believe that any proposed increase in expenditure should in future be directed towards assisting those persons whose needs are greatest. If we are prepared to spend sufficient money to effect a general increase of 5s. a week in pensions we should be prepared, as an alternative, to increase the pensions of those really in need, by 10s., 15s. or even 20s. a week. We must also remember that under the merged means test every increase in the rate of pension causes a greater number of persons to become eligible to receive the pension. It is my personal belief that the present means test provisions are already generous. To-day a married couple, owning their home and a motor car, and having £4,040 in the bank may still receive a joint pension of £10 10s, a week and they do not lose their pension entitlement altogether until the amount of their bank account or the value of other assets reaches an amount of £9,500. Any further easing of the means test at the expense of those really in need would, to my mind, not be justified. In future, we should try to relieve the distress of those who are having difficulty in making ends meet and to remove some rather obvious anomalies which exist under the present legislation. I propose to refer to some of these anomalies. The first of them concerns a married couple, the husband being over 65 years of age and in receipt of an age pension. His wife is not yet 60 years of age and the couple find difficulty in living on the age pension plus the wife's allowance. She endeavours unsuccessfully to obtain work, and registers for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service. As the present rates of unemployment benefit provide that a married couple will receive £5 12s. 6d. a week, with a total permissible income of £2 a week, the total income of the couple would therefore be £7 12s. 6d. a week. I am referring to the present rates, not those proposed in the legislation. As the husband receives an age pension of £5 a week his wife therefore receives £2 12s. 6d. a week unemployment benefit-bu t each time the age pension is increased her unemployment benefit decreases by a like amount because of the limit placed on permissible income, and even though it is obviously the Government's intention for the couple to benefit by the increase in age pension, in actual fact this does not happen and their joint income remains the same. I believe that the Minister should have a look at this apparent anomaly. Now let us take the case of a B class widow, who is a widow of at least 50 years of age, or one of at least 45 years of age whose class A pension has ceased because she no longer has a child in her care. Her pension rate is £4 7s. 6d. a week and her permissible income £3 10s., or a total weekly income of £7 17s. 6d. Anything she earns in excess of £3 10s. a week reduces her pension by a like amount. An age pensioner whose needs in many respects are less than those of a woman of 45 or 50 years of age receives a pension of £5 a week and her permissible income is also £3 10s. a week, making a total possible income of £8 10s. a week. Conceding that there is justification for the age pension to be higher than the B class widow's pension, I believe that it is not unreasonable to give the B class widow permission to earn more income-a t least such an amount as will bring her permissible income to the level of that of an age pensioner. The cost to the Government would be nil, and I suggest that the Minister examine this proposal also. I was disappointed to find that the Government has not reduced the residential qualifying period for age pensions for immigrants. Personally I should like to see immigrants become residentially eligible upon naturalization, but if this is too much to expect in one budget I believe that the qualifying period should at least be reduced to ten years residence for immigrants who have become Australian citizens. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) in what I can only describe, after consideration, as a vicious attack on the Prime Minister"" political deceit "", "" political betrayal "" and "" political humbug"". If that is not a vicious attack, I do not know what it is. He endeavoured to show that the Prime Minister had not honoured his election promises to the pensioners but had kept in full his promises to his friends, and he",71,Social Services Bill 1961

The honourable member for Eden-Monaro conveniently forgot to direct the attention of the House to the Government's record expenditure on health and social services. In Labour's last full financial year of office Social Services set up by the Federal Conference -the year ended 30th June, 1949-the Labour Government spent £80,777,000 on health and social services. then? am glad that the honourable member menrepresented all the facts of the case.

The honourable basic wage has increased by nearly 150 per member for Port Adelaide said that he was cent, in that period-it has not gone up by really responsible for first directing attenthat much, but I will concede that for the tion to the need for a merged means test, purposes of illustration-the Government's and I do not deny that he may have been expenditure on health and social services so responsible. He saidthis year, by Labour's 1949 standards, should be about £250,000,000. because of the introduction of new benefits I wrote to Mr Chifley on 20th August, 1948. It and the continued easing of the means readstest, we find that health and social services are estimated to cost this year not £250,000,000, but more than £350,000,000. Let me put it in another way. Labour's expenditure on health and social services of £80,777,000 in 1949 represented 14.6 per cent, of a total Budget expenditure of £584,400,000. mated expenditure this year of £358,000,000 on health and social services represents more than 21 per cent, of the total Budget expenditure of £1,697,000,000. Those figures surely refute the misleading statements of the honourable member for Edenwent on to sayMonaro. In regard to the introduction of the said at the time that it would cost £22,000,000 to merged means test the honourable member do what I suggested. There were one or two of 12th September, 1961, at page 1053. saidLast year, the Minister introduced a generous improvement in the property means test, but I remind the House that he did it in rather peculiar circumstances. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) has already given the facts and they have not been denied by any one on the Government side of the House. He further saidAs the honourable member for Port Adelaide has mentioned, the proposal which last year became part of the Government's Budget, and which was given effect in the Social Services Bill, was examined by the Interstate Committee on of the Australian Labour Party. A letter was sent to the Minister setting out the proposal and inviting him to give an estimate of the cost involved so that the committee could judge whether it was politically and economically practical. The Minister replied lhal no estimate of the cost of such a proposal could be made. The next we heard of it was when it was announced in the Budget. But, I have in my hand a copy of a letter which These suggestions would mean the abolition of the property test as we have it at present, and after allowing for the first £100 to be exempt, £1 per annum for each complete £10 to be included in the calculation of income of the claimant or pensioner. This, I feel, would meet the strong objection that has been made for so long to the prohibition of persons with, formerly, over £400 property and, latterly, This Government's esti£750 property, receiving any pension whatsoever. I would ask that information be obtained from the Pensions Department to supply, if possible, the additional cost of such alteration.

The Minister discusses the scheme by sayingThere is no known way to stabilize the value of money, there is no known way to confine the demand for expanding health and social service benefits within certain fixed limits; there is no known way to strike a permanent rate of contribution within the competence of every person to pay without regard to income, or the lack of Treasury-that is, the taxpayers of a countryfrom the responsibility of meeting the very subThose of us who believe in the introduction be permanent.

Various Government supporters have strongly eulogized the Government on its record in the field of social services, and many remarks have been made about what Labour did when it was in office, up to 1949.

True enough, subsequent to its election in 1949, it introduced child endowment for the first child and fixed the rate at 5s. But, despite the inroads of inflation and increased liabilities of parents, particularly in the matter of education, the Government has not increased the rate of child endowment. Every one knows of the sorry plight of many of our families arising from the cost of bringing up the children. This Government has tried to insinuate that it has sympathy for the parents who are educating their children in non-State schools. Can you think of a more direct or helpful way of giving assistance to those people than by recognizing their family responsibilities as the Labour Party intends to do? In other words, we propose to bring child endowment at least to the level that existed when the Chifley Labour Government left office. It was the Chifley Labour Government that made the last increase in child endowment for the second, third and subsequent children in 1948. Supporters of the Government have implied that they have sympathy with the people. I suggest to the Government that if it has any sympathy for those who are confronted with the economic problem of educating their children, particularly in private schools, here is the way to do it without inflaming feelings and causing any controversy in the community. We do not need to stress the point to those who have the burden of educating their children in private schools, but this applies also to those who send their children to State schools. The State schools are only nominally free. As a matter of fact, they are very expensive for those parents who recognize the need to keep their children at school for a longer period than was the case formerly. The compulsory school attendance age has been raised in many States but apart from that, the other kind of economic compulsion demands that parents equip their children with education of a sufficiently high level to enable them to cope with jobs that are available in our modern community. It is necessary for them, therefore, to go to more expense in educating their children Parents of school children are aware of what it costs to equip their children for a State school, particularly those who have had experience of children moving from a primary to a secondary school. They have to meet the cost of books and equipment, sports and book-lending tees and all the other expenses associated with the maintenance of children from the age of twelve years to sixteen or seventeen years. This places a very heavy burden on parents. We are suggesting a way in which the Government can go to the assistance of these people. We are very anxious to bring families into Australia. In the House to-day, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Downer) mentioned the desirability of bringing family units here. That is very commendable, but I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that it is very commendable also to encourage Australian families to bring up their children properly and equip them adequately to meet economic demands, both individually and as part of the nation aa a whole. SoI earnestly urge the Government-if it is not too late before this Government goes out of office-to recognize the desirability of giving assistance to our family units and especially to assist them to meet the increased cost of maintaining their children at school. The question of allowances for dependent wives has been a sore point. In this case, we are talking, of course, of men who, because of invalidity, are no longer able to work. Such a man might be eligible for the age pension. To attract a dependant's allowance for his wife, he must be an invalid as well as aged. On the other hand, he might be simply an invalid, not 65 years of age but 45 or 50. Since 1952. this Government has compelled the wife of such a man to live frugally on 35s. a week. At long last, by the persistent efforts of members of this House and the representations of organizations outside, the Government has been compelled to show some humanity and it is increasing the pension from £1 15s. a week to £2 7s. 6d. a magnanimous increase of 12s. 6d. a week. In other words, an adult couple",75,Social Services Bill 1961

251,Mr Reynolds,"It has made oneare compelled to live on £5 5s. a week for a husband and £2 7s. 6d. for the dependent wife. The husband might be an invalid unable to work under the definition of the law applying to invalid pensions. In all probability, his wife is unable to get work even if she could take a job. We do better than that for the age pensioner. Nobody suggests that £10 10s. a week for an aged couple is an example of excessive generosity or that it is even generous. Despite what supporters of the Government have said, an aged couple receiving £10 10s. a week live a pretty frugal existence. It might be all right for those with additional income and with the resources permited by the merged means test; but many old people in Australia have not either of these. In addition to their living expenses they have to pay rates unless State governments or municipal authorities give them aid. Life is difficult enough for aged couples; how much harder must it be for the man with a dependent wife who has to live on £5 5s. for himself and £2 7s. 6d. for his wife? The Australian Labour Party has stated its opinion that both the husband and the wife should be paid the full pension rate, and I do not think anybody could quibble with that proposition. Reference has been made to the unemployment and sickness benefits to which I referred in my speech on the Budget. There is a grave responsibility on this Government to compensate people properly in these days when governments arbitrarily intrude into the economy and decide in their wisdom or otherwise to introduce economic measures which they know could lead to unemployment. When, in fact, governments are purposely putting people out of employment and depriving people of their earning power, they should compensate the people. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr bers opposite that if they are not prepared Anthony), who is interjecting, would expect to get compensation if his property was resumed. If the Government took over someone's factory or some other instrument of production, would not honourable members opposite be the first to clamour for compensation for those affected? Does it not follow then that a man with a dependent family who loses his employment should be entitled to the same consideration? When you take away a man's capacity to work, you are depriving him of the one thing he has to maintain himself and his dependent wife and children. When the Government interferes in the nation's stability purposely, it is arbitrarily depriving men of their living. In those circumstances, there is a moral responsibility on the Government to compensate those who have had their income earning capacity taken away from them. It is a matter of utter shame that the Government proposes that a man and his wife with any number of children should be asked to live on £7 a week when the husband has lost his employment. This is even worse than the case of the pensioner with a dependent wife to whom 1 have referred. Actually, it is much worse than we are offering a couple on the age pension. We give them £10 10s. a week, but we ask a man and his wife and any number of children to live on a sickness or unemployment benefit of £7 a week. It is true that the children might attract child endowment. lhat pleases you? ber for Richmond has done very well in directing attention to the positive aspects of the Government's proposals.

I am here to direct attention to matters that need ventilating. I am here to speak for the people who elected me and who expect me to indicate the need for reforms. There are enough persons here patting the Government on the back without me joining the crusade. I have no qualms about making these requests. It may be said that this is a negative sort of approach, but let me tell honourable memto implement the proposals I am making, there is a Labour Party here prepared to do so, and pledging itself to the nation to do so, despite all that honourable members opposite say about the cost to the nation. I have made some remarks about the cost, and I have shown that Government spokesmen have been putting forward fallacious arguments.

255,Mr Reynolds,"Well, tell me which the expense of paying even child endowment in respect of these persons. They have come here already matured, in the full flush of life, ready to work, and making few demands on our social service scheme. Having in mind the Minister's announced humanitarian programme ot bringing family units to this country, surely these young people should be able to expect that their parents will be eligible for the age pension within a shorter period than twenty years. I heartily recommend that the Government consider reducing the qualifying period. We have made an excellent investment with our immigration programme. It has been a marvellous thing for the country. It has helped to youthify our population, if I may coin a term, just when we were noticing an increase in the average age of our population. At a time when we were starting to worry about the preponderance of aged persons in the community, we suddenly had a new influx of young people contributing to the productive capacity of the country. It would represent some kind of thanks to these people to make their parents eligible for the age pension after ten years residence. After all, ten years is still a fairly long time to wait before qualifying for this benefit. I would also like to refer to a subject that has been mentioned, I think, once or twice previously. I refer to sheltered workshops for invalid persons. The provision of these workshops helps such people not only economically, but also in their social adjustment. Unfortunately we have a number of comparatively young adult people in our community who have become invalids and who are receiving the invalid pension. In the suburb of Bankstown in Sydney there is an institution where one of these sheltered workshops is operating, principally because of the support given by the local Lions Club. I must say that I was really inspired by what I saw there. It was by no means a perfect arrangement, but it is making a marvellous contribution. It allows these invalid pensioners who, under the special departmental provisions, are normally restricted to earning £2 a week, to get £3 10s. a week. They are assisted by a few people, devoted to the cause, who obtain contracts for the purchase of the articles manufactured in these workshops. I understand that the United Kingdom Government has taken over the whole project in that country, is running these sheltered workshops and employing in them many thousand of invalids. I do not know how long it will be before Australia can reach that stage, but if we cannot do the job ourselves we can at least give a lending hand to those people and organizations who are willing to do it. In the district in which I live both the poliomyelitis and the physically disabled society, as I think it is known, as well as those people who are charged with the care of spastics, are prepared to get together to build in the St. George area of Sydney a sheltered workshop comparable to that which now exists in Bankstown. They are appealing to the State Government to provide a block of land on which to build, and they have asked me to appeal to the Commonwealth Government for a subsidy towards the establishment, not only of this centre but also of similar centres in various parts of Australia. They would be a marvellous contribution to the economic welfare of those people and, above all, to their social adjustment. It is marvellous to see them gathering in their groups in this social community, each with a sympathy and understanding of the other's difficulties and inhibitions. It is marvellous that they are able to get together in this way and have some social outlet. This gives them a sense of worthwhileness, if I may use that word, because they are able to do certain things for themselves and are not totally dependent upon the community. They receive great satisfaction from this. This project could be given great encouragement. Although the Government has taken worthwhile action in subsidizing homes for aged people, the provision of these sheltered workshops is a very worthwhile project which should attract the attention of any government. With regard to homes for the aged, the plea has been made that the Commonwealth subsidy be extended. The Labour Party would like to see the subsidy made available not only to private and church organizations but also, if we are genuinely concerned about doing the very best to house aged people, to other organizations which are able to provide the one-third of the cost which attracts the two-thirds Commonwealth contribution. In other words, let us make the benefit available to municipal authorities which are prepared to raise the one-third of the cost. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. [11.12] I should like to preface my remarks by saying that during the whole time that my distinguished colleague, the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton), has held his portfolio 1 have found him exceedingly prompt in handling correspondence and extremely sympathetic in dealing with any matter that falls within the financial capacity of the vote that is allocated to his department. So if I suggest something that could be of first-rate assistance to the unemployed it must not be thought that 1 am lacking in any appreciation of the Minister's good work. The position in the city may be different from that in the country where an unemployed man has to wait for one week and, from my own experience, probably two weeks before receiving unemployment benefit. In days gone by the scheme of providing what were called track rations was in operation. This meant that if a man went out looking for a job he received something to help him to carry on. In the depth of the depression he was given a weekly rationa dole if you like-whic h enabled him to move from place to place seeking employment. I suggest that when a man loses employment now and feels that he can perhaps find something for himself in another district he be given a card signisystem of State education. I have heard fying that fact and indicating when he is entitled to a track ration. I am sure this would be of great benefit to very many men and, in addition, it would save the country a fair amount of money. I realize that this is not purely a Commonwealth matter and that it lies within the co-operative sphere of the Commonwealth and the States, but of my own experience I know that it is a matter of great importance. 1 listened with interest to two matters raised by the honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds). The first referred to the amount that a pensioner may earn over and above his pension. A pensioner and his wife may each earn £3 10s. a week and this amount, added to the pension which now will be £5 5s. a week each, will give them a weekly return of £17 10s. The only thing I would say to the honourable member is that in fixing the permissible weekly income of a pensioner couple you should have some regard for the basic wage on which a man. his wife and two children are expected to live. I was extremely interested in what the honourable member for Barton had to say about the load that falls upon parents who endeavour to educate their children in what I shall call non-State schools. It is a great pity that whenever this question arises it is apt to be bedevilled by feelings of sectarianism which, I trust, will not enter into this present discussion. In my own State of New South Wales people are apt to invoke the name of Sir Henry Parkes as though it was the Ark of the Covenant. It is no disparagement of the magnifiicent job that he did in the act of 1880 to say that. I. as a student of the things that happened at that time, believe it to be clear that Parkes himself never sought an exclusive system of State schools, with no government assistance to others. This was forced upon him as many things are forced upon us in our political lives. The natural result is that families which to-day desire to maintain and educate their children in non-State schools carry an almost intolerable burden. I am a descendant of the Covenanters and therefore I speak as one who has no bias in favour of one religion as against another. I believe that this country cannot afford to have within its boundaries a regimented my friends in this place rise night after night and hammer away at the dangers of communism. Those dangers are apparent to all; but there is no danger which should be more apparent than the danger of having a regimented system of education, the control of which is confined solely to the State. That is what Hitler succeeded in doing; that is what Mussolini attempted to do. and that is what Khrushchev and his friends are doing now. In Australia the child must be brought within a regimented system of education. Let me emphasize that we have here no counter-balancing factors such as are found in other Western countries. We have not the system of close local control",78,Social Services Bill 1961
256,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Luchetti).,,80,Social Services Bill 1961
257,Mr Drummond (New England),"that applies in America where even villages control their own education system. We have not the age old systems of Scotland, Great Britain or Northern Ireland. In 1936, 1 made a private inquiry into this subject in Great Britain and I found that in the Republic of Eire and in Scotland acts of Parliament had been brought down which made possible the working out of a mutually satisfactory system. I do not want to go fully into that, Sir. WhatI want to emphasize this evening is that, as another honourable member said, when you discuss social services you discuss something that is tied up with the fact that nearly the States had to bear the cost, there would one-third of the children of this country attend non-State schools. Their parents maintain them and educate them at those schools with practically no assistance, except for minor relief in the form of tax deductions. That relief certainly amounts to very little in the way of assistance. Those parents face increasing problems in modern education, which is already very costly and is becoming increasingly costly. We have before us documentary evidence that the Premiers of the States have said to the Commonwealth, "" We find it almost impossible to continue to carry the burden of education with which we are loaded."" The Premiers have the whole resources of the States behind them in meeting the needs of education; in certain respects, they have the backing, indirectly, of Commonwealth resources. But the parents of the one-third of our children who are in private schools, both those of the various denominations and the non-denominational ones, pay their share in taxes and train their children witheducation to the whole burden of cost out any call on tax revenue for education. Those parents render a magnificent service to the country by providing a second stream of education parallel to the system of State schools. ask the honourable gentleman to relate his remarks to child endowment. have transgressed, Sir. It is quite obvious that this burden carried by the parents of children at private schools must be offset in some way. Here is something that is interwoven with the whole system of social services. In many countries, education is regarded as one of the social services and, in this country, education can be said to be related to social services. You have asked me to relate my remarks on the subject to child endowment, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is quite obvious that families, especially the larger ones, who have their children taught in the independent schools, are carrying a burden the weight of which should be effectively recognized by the Commonwealth or the States. If the one-third of Australia's children who are being so educated were suddenly thrown on the State schools for their education and the Commonwealth or be tremendous inroads on the funds available for social services or other services. The enormous cost of education in the State schools generally shows that. SoI suggest that there is a case here for consideration by the Commonwealth and the States in order not only to extend a measure of justice to people who educate their children in non-State schools but also to preserve the freedom of education in Australia. I know that I have opened up a very big question. I did so deliberately. The party to which 1 belong opened it up ask the honourable gentleman to relate his remarks to the Social Services Bill which is now before the House. have transgressed once more, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was merely trying to relate imposed on families. Apart altogether from that question which I have raised, I want to suggest something that may not be as acceptable to some people who are listening to me. This matter concerns the basic wage. At the present time, under our arbitration system the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission implicitly takes into account the needs of the family unit in determining the economic capacity of the country to pay and fixes the basic wage accordingly. Wages are related to those matters. WhatI am coming to, Sir, is that, as we get nearer to the stage at which we will give men and women equal pay for work of equal value, obviously we",80,Social Services Bill 1961

In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you and the House for the tolerance with which my views on this subject have that point later. The point that I am been heard. I leave the matter there. Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond), who has just delivered a most interesting address, made one or two suggestions which I believe must be considered by the Parliaments of the nation in the very near future. At the close of his speech, he dealt with that the present basic wage is not sufficient the structure of the basic wage, and 1 to provide for the larger than average intend to relate my remarks on this social family. The Government has failed to do services bill to the basic wage and child anything about child endowment since endowment. Those honourable members 1950, and the indication given by the who have young families, especially those Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) the other day who have more than the average number was that the Government believes that beof children, know only too well that child cause the basic wage was fixed according endowment is not nearly sufficient to meet to the maximum amount that industry could the needs of families. I do not wish it to afford to pay, those people with families be thought for a moment that I mean that were already well covered because, with members of this Parliament find that they the child endowment, they were receiving cannot support their families. But1 am more than the basic wage. The point to be sure that their experience with their own remembered is that the same basic wage is families makes them realize that people whose income is less than the average the standard of living enjoyed by the single weekly wage and who have families larger adult male worker is much higher than than the average are in dire straits in many that enjoyed by families. ways in the struggle to provide for the needs of their children. Parents in these days are most anxious for an adult female is 75 per cent, of that to purchase their own homes and to give for an adult male-the standard of living to their children the very best education set for the family unit is not as high as it that they can afford. I think that most should be. When introducing the Child parents adopt the attitude that their children Endowment BiU in 1941 Mr Harold Holt, ought to have a better education than they who was then Minister for Labour and themselves had.

265,Mr Stewart,"It is quite obviousincentive for investment in persons as compared with things. This is because it is rarely possible for people who make investment in persons to profit from it. For this reason governments subsidized education. For this reason also the investment of the Commonwealth Government in child endowment can be expected to make a high return in human happiness. Various other Government members spoke on that occasion in 1941, but I shall refer only to the speech of one. The then honourable member for New England, Mr Abbott, said thisThe bill represents the first attempt yet made to remove an undesirable feature of our wage structure, namely, the injustice suffered by large families under our present wage-fixing system, which places a penalty upon paternity, and, at the same time, pays a bounty on bachelorhood. To some degree the bill will remedy that position. At various times since 1941 other Government members, including the present Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick), have made references to the family unit. For instance, when introducing the Matrimonial Causes Bill, in 1959, the Attorney General saidOne of the great foundations of our national life is the family, and in turn the family is founded on marriage. National interest is best served and family life is best nurtured when marriage is truly lifelong. In 1955, the present Minister for Labour saidWe must recognize the needs and claims of our children. He went on to sayWe have a duty to the old, the sick and the family unit. Surely a government, the members of which have made such statements over the years, should face up to the problem that confronts the family at the present time. It is no good just passing the matter off with the bare statement that the basic wage is fixed at the highest rate that the economy can afford. It cannot be argued that a great number of people in the community are not getting more than the basic wage; but, in many of its judgments, the arbitration tribunal has indicated that it no longer regards its duty as being to set a basic wage which is sufficient to maintain a family. For instance, when delivering the 1950 basic wage judgment, Mr Justice Foster saidSocial benefits are the Government's policy for so long as it took into account the family which the re-distribution of Australian income after it is earned and of course may be modified at Parliament's will. The Court's task is now to settle disputes about wages which are earned in tbe production of that income out of which Parliament distributes its bounties. When delivering its decision after the 1952-53 basic wage and standard hours inquiry, the court saidSo far as this Court is concerned, no evidence was presented to enable it to assess the reasonable needs either of a family group, typically average or appropriate. When delivering his judgment on the basic wage in 1959, Mr Justice Foster saidSince about 1920 by the order of the Arbitration Court the basic wage has been adjustable, first as a "" needs"" basic wage and then, since 1934, as a capacity wage. In 1941 and 1943, it was stated that the basic wage was sufficient to maintain only three people. Perhaps the best-remembered of all these statements is one by Chief Judge O'Mara, who saidOn our accepted standard of living, looking at it from the needs point of view only, 1 regard the present basic wage as adequate for a family unit of three but think it offers only a meagre existence for a family unit of four. When the unit gets beyond four hardship is often experienced. Shortly after that, the Government introduced child endowment for the first time, but the payment was made only for children other than the first. In 1950, the Government amended the legislation to provide child endowment for the first child. If , in 1941 and 1943, the basic wage was based on what was only sufficient to meet the needs of a family of three, then surely it must be admitted that the basic wage of to-day is still only sufficient to maintain a family of three. As a single adult male worker is entitled to receive the same basic wage as a married adult male worker, and as the female adult worker is entitled to receive 75 per cent, of the adult male rate, it is quite obvious that the wage-earner who has a family is forced to exist on a lower standard of living than either the single adult male or the adult female. When speaking to the introduction of the Child Endowment Bill in 1941, Mr Curtin put the matter very clearly when he saidIt is necessary to deal with the problem of family allowances, regardless of the wage determined by any arbitral authority. Whether the authority should fix the basic wage high or low, is accepted as the standard, or determined upon",82,Social Services Bill 1961
266,And National Service ( Mr Mcmahon),"some special unit of its own selection, so long would it happen that families whose members were larger than the standard or the average, would suffer some disadvantage in their own households. Therefore, what we are faced with is not the problem of the minimum wage, or what is the status ot labour as a class, but what is the degree of disparity between the family life of this country, as we find it in many instances, and that of the standard or average family in receipt of the wage which the courts or other authorities declare That is the approach that the Government should take. It should recognize thai all people in industry, whether married or single, are entitled to receive whatever basic wage is determined as being the maximum amount that industry can afford. If the court family is a national investment, if the family and what is its function in dealing with cases such pays dividends to the community, then as the Basic Wage case now before us. For surely the family is entitled to be considered instance, in the 1952-53 Basic Wage and Standard when it comes to deciding upon social serHours vice payments. The needs concept that was said that the exercise of its powers had "" wideso often mentioned in the House when the spread social and economic results""; but that it basic wage and child endowment were menwas "" not the function of the court to aim at such tioned visualized a standard which I feel social was well below that which should have been aimed at. The standard was set down in The report went on, further, to quote an 1907 in the Harvester award. I think it extract from the 1959 metal trades margins was the Chief Judge, Mr Justice Higgins, case. The commission said this:who then said that if A were looking after B's horses, fair and reasonable treatment industrial disputes. In the settlement of disputes for the horses would be to provide proper involving payment of wages, such as this one in food and water and such shelter as they sion might need. He went on to use that missions made to it, including those about price criterion for setting a fair and reasonable rises and inflation; it will also bear in mind the wage for a family unit of five-a husband, fiscal and economic policies of the Government. a wife and three children. The amount that from he set was 7s. per day for a six-day week, situations which would need rectification by amounting in all to £2 2s. He allowed governmental action. It will not use its powers £1 12s. 5d. for food, 7s. for rent and 9s. 7d. for for extras. This is an extract from the in the event the decision it makes may have other 1907 judgmentThis expenditure does not cover light (some of the lists omitted light), clothes, boots, furniture, in the following words:utensils (being casual, not weekly expenditure), rates, life insurance, savings, accident or benefit societies, loss of employment, union pay, books and newspapers, tram and train fares, sewing machine, mangle, school requisites, amusements and holidays, intoxicating liquors, tobacco, sickness and death, domestic help, or any expenditure for unusual contingencies, religion, or charity. So, the needs standard which was maintained up to 1934 at the very least and probably is still, in some measure, observed in fixing the basic wage, did not include a lot of things that we have become accustomed to accept as the right of every citizen. Unless the Government is prepared to face up to the needs of the average family unit, the larger than average family will be forced to accept a lower standard of living than the rest of the community. It is quite apparent from the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's reports that the commission does not regard itself as being a social or economic legisto be the minimum. lature. In volume 6, No. 5 of the "" Industrial Information Bulletin"" the following report from the basic wage inquiry of 1961 appears:Role of the Commission. From time to time the commission and the before it have endeavoured to make clear what is the role of the Federal arbitral tribunal inquiry the Court pointed out that it was neither as?cial nor an economic legislature. It and economic changes as may seem to be desirable to the members of the tribunal"". The true function of the Commission is to settle which such issues have been raised, the commiswill bear in mind the various economic subIt will not ignore the consequences to be expected its actions but it will not deliberately create the purposes of causing any particular economic result apart from altered wages although economic consequences. The commission went on to state its views We are not national economic policy makers or planners. We are confined to the legislation under which we act and, in particular, in basic wage cases we have the function of deciding only what is a just and reasonable basic wage. This does not mean, of course, that we have not to consider seriously the probable effects of our decision on the economy. So, the commission completely wipes its hands of any social import in its decisions. It says that the Government should face these social problems. I feel that the Government has completely jettisoned child endowment. It has cast it overboard because the opinion seems to be held among members of the Government that the basic wage provides for the family unit. The Minister for Labour and National Service believed that the basic wage these days was more than sufficient to provide for husband and wife and more than two or three children. Holt) recently indicated in the House that he felt that it was still sufficient only for a husband, a wife and one child. employer of a man with a larger family than this still has to pay him only the basic wage. At the same time, the employer is compelled to pay the basic wage to the single adult male worker. Consequently, the standard of living of the family unit is being lowered. It is time that the Government faced up that to the Government. So it is no good to its responsibilities in this regard.

269,The Mr Stewart,"As I have said, theintroduced in order to give some benefit to the family, surely the same degree of benefit should apply now! It does not matter at all what the cost is. The argument we must examine is that in 1941 the Menzies Government introduced child endowment and up to 1948 the Labour Government increased it. In 1950 this Government introduced child endowment for the first Ohild. If child endowment was necessary in 1950 it is necessary to-day, because the same conditions apply. We have a higher standard of living these days than we had in 1941 or 1950. Because of that fact and because the standard of living granted to basic wage earners has improved, surely those people with larger than average families deserve some consideration! Social problems are the prerogative of the Government and it should face up to them. Either the present Treasurer in 1941 was wrong when he said that child endowment was a national investment and that it could be expected to yield a huge harvest, or the Government is wrong now. The Labour Party says that the Government was right in 1941 but that it is wrong now. We contend that it is time the Government faced up to the fact that the standard of living of the family has not kept pace with the standard of living of either single male persons or single female persons in the community. If parents are prepared to have children, surely for the sake of the nation they deserve some repayment from the nation! There are many otfher matters which members of the Labour Party have spoken about in this House and among them are the miserable rates paid to age, invalid and widow pensioners. There is also the failure Of the Government to provide for increases in the funeral benefits. One amendment that is to be moved by the Opposition seeks to enable people who have come here from overseas to become eligible for the age pension after residence in Australia for only ten means test purposes and now income from years, instead of 20 years as at present. I believe that all the amendments to be moved by the Opposition during the committee stage are well worthy of consideration. I most strongly urge the Minister and the Government to look at the question of child endowment payments in Australia, because until such time as they are prepared to face up to their obligations child endowment will be a dead letter. At the moment the Government is trying to pass the buck to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which refuses to accept it. The Government will have to do something about child endowment, or family life in Australia will be materially affected. Government has a proud record in the field of social services. An examination of social services in Australia compared with those in other countries clearly shows that social services in Australia are better and more comprehensive than those in any other country. It is, therefore, astounding to notice that a member of the Opposition has submitted an amendment to the motion that the bill be now read a second time, purporting to condemn the Government for having, in the terms of the amendment, failed to increase the rates of payment of various social services to correspond with increases in prices. The amendment states further that purchasing power has halved since this Government assumed office in 1950. Of course, the assumption of the Opposition that the value of money has halved is not correct. But let us assume for one moment that it is correct. Let us look at social services as they were in 1949 under the Labour Government and as they are under this bill. In 1949, the age and invalid pension was 42s. 6d. and under this bill it is 105sconsiderably more than double. Permissible income-incom e which the pensioner can have without affecting his pension-wa s 30s. a week under the Labour Government and it is now 70s. a week. While Labour was in office not only were the thrifty penalized in respect of the assets they possessed, but they were penalized a second time because of the income they received from those assets. This Government has removed income from assets entirely for property or assets is totally exempt under the means test. Exempt property-that is, the assets which are not taken into account for means test purposes-amounte d to £100 under the Labour Government and it is now £200. Under the Labour Government, if a person had £750 in assets he was not entitled to an age or invalid pension",85,Social Services Bill 1961
270,Mr Wilson (Sturt) [12.25 A.m.],"Th eat all. This Government has entirely removed that ceiling. Under the merged means test it does not matter how much assets a person has, until the formula works itself out. So until a single person has assets worth £4,750 or a married couple has assets worth £9,500 part pensions are payable. Under the Labour Government the blind were subject to the means test; but this Government has exempted blind persons entirely from the operations of the means test. Under the Labour Government war pensioners and age pensioners were subject to a ceiling and could not benefit if they went above that ceiling. This Government has removed the ceiling on age and war pensioners. Under Labour there was no supplemental pension for hardship cases -no t one penny. Under this Government a supplemental pension of 10s. a week is payable to single persons who have no income other than their pensions and who have to pay rent. Under Labour aboriginal natives did not receive pensions. Undec this Government aboriginal natives, except those in the nomadic state, receive pensions just as other eligible people do. Then, under the merged means test provisions, the £750 limit which applied under Labour has been removed and now, as I said earlier, a single pensioner may have property to the value of £4,750 and a married pensioner couple property to the value of £9,500 and still benefit from pensions if they have no other income. In addition to those tremendous increases, all of which are increases of more than 100 per cent, on the rates under Labour, and many of them increases of as much as 200 and 300 per cent., there is the liberalization of the means test which was introduced by this Government, and there are other additional benefits. The Menzies Liberal-Country Party Government was the first government in the world to introduce such an act as the Aged Persons Homes Act whereby churches and charitable organizations are subsidized in the provision of homes for the aged. Under that act 10,000 aged people have been found superb accommodation at rents or boarding charges that they are able to stand. Under Labour there was no free penare. We know that Labour had no intensioner medical scheme. The present Gotion of introducing the merged means test. vernment introduced the free pensioner Even if Labour members ever thought of F.7613/61 -R -[42 ] medical scheme, from which 88 per cent, of all pensioners benefit in free medical attention. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds) in trying to justify Labour's extremely poor record in social services, said, first, that the value of money had halved, and then tried to show that, under this Government, benefits had not doubled. The facts that I have just given to the House prove conclusively not only that all the benefits that I have mentioned have doubled in value but that in most cases they have considerably more than doubled. One extraordinary feature of the attack by members of the Opposition is their attempt to claim some credit for the introduction of the merged means test. Realizing that this is the most popular social reform ever introduced by any government and knowing that it was introduced by the Menzies Government, Labour members are now trying to get on to the bandwagon and claim some credit for the merged means test. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) has told the House that he thought of it, and that he wrote a letter to Mr Chifley, Prime Minister and Treasurer in the last Labour Government, setting out the plan and asking the Department of Social Services to estimate the cost of introducing it at that time. He was told that the cost would be £22,000,000 a year. The honourable member for Port Adelaide said that he then put the proposition for the introduction of the merged means test to Mr Chifley, and that Mr Chifley refused to implement the plan because, he said, the Labour Government could not afford £22,000,000. Then we had the honourable member for Barton saying a little while ago that Mr Chifley built up a reserve of £200,000,000 in the National Welfare Fund. If the honourable member for Barton is correct, and the Labour Government had £200,000,000 in the National Welfare Fund, why could it not afford £22,000,000 for the introduction of the merged means test, which the honourable member for Port Adelaide has told us would have been the cost of introducing it at that time? Of course, we know what the facts really the merged means test, they had not the Australia is qualified by residence to slightest intention of introducing it, and receive an age pension as soon as he reaches would not have introduced it if they had the prescribed age. Similarly, as a result continued in office. According to the state of the reciprocal arrangement with the ments of the honourable members for Port United Kingdom, now that residence in Adelaide and Barton the Labour Governthe United Kingdom counts as residence in ment had the opportunity to introduce the Australia, it virtually means that every one merged means test, and the money to finance born in the United Kingdom also qualifies. its introduction, but did not do so.

In every year that it injustice to deny him a pension when he has been in office it has introduced reforms reaches pensionable age. Therefore, I hope in the social services legislation. It has that next year the Government will introincreased pensions and other benefits, it duce this necessary reform. has liberalized the means test, it has brought in all sorts of other social service benefits Act gives rise to the belief that there is no that were never introduced before. I believe better way that the Government can help that the Government will go on making the community than by assisting Churches, reforms year after year wherever anomalies charitable organizations and welfare socieor injustices occur. I am disappointed that on this occasion the Government did not feel itself able to success and I would like to see the same widen the terms of eligibility for the special pattern of legislation to help invalid hardship pension. I believe they should be pensioners and sick people during periods of widened to cover all single persons, widows rehabilitation. There have been suggestions, and widowers, who have no income other and I would support them, that charitable than their pensions, and that the benefit organizations which are providing rehabilishould be payable whether or not these tation centres and accommodation for dispeople have to pay rent. We know that abled people should be entitled to assistance there are many single persons who live in of the kind that is provided under the Aged homes of their own and have to pay interest Persons Homes Act. Therefore, I do hopeon big mortgages, as well as rates, taxes that the Government will continue in future and the cost of repairs, all of which very years its magnificent record of removing often come to more than the cost of paying these anomalies year by year as the economy rent. 1 feel confident that when the circumof the country permits. stances of the nation's economy permit the Government will consider widening the continue to give consideration to a proterms of eligibility for that very beneficial posal for national superannuation which, supplemental pension so as to make other I believe, must eventually come to meet the people in need besides those who have to growing needs of social services.

In conclusion, I congratulate the Government on another splendid bill in relation to social services. for Social Services) [12.43 a.m.] -in reply Mr Speaker, I think I should offer my congratulations to the honourable members who have addressed themselves to the subject under discussion. There were perhaps -one or two indifferent speeches, to which I might make reference, but in the main all the speeches were good; some of them were excellent and without exception in that category they were all most helpful to me. I can only say, as I have said before, that as the field of social services is now -.so vast and every aspect of social services lends itself to critical examination by those who are interested in the general question -of social services, we reach conclusions as to what ought to be done, but because -everything cannot be done at the same time there has got to be a measure of judgment applied before decisions are reached. And after that judgment is made there is, of -course, always cause for conflict of opinion .and disputation as to whether it was the right judgment or whether something better might have been done. I offer my congratulations to those who have taken part in this debate and I want 'to assure them that all they have said of a constructive character will be taken into consideration. Briefly, may I refer to the impassioned speech on child endowment by the honourable member for Lang( Mr first child. For nine years it resisted the sugStewart). He, of course, has been interested -in the question of child endowment and family allowances generally for a long time. He put up a very convincing case, but he -omitted to mention two important factors. He did mention, of course, that it was -this Government which introduced child endowment for the first child; and that is the most expensive item in the field of child -endowment. But he omitted to mention that under the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Act the concessional .allowances for children have been increased during the last twelve years from £78 for one child to £91 to-day, an increase of £13. That, of course, is of material advantage to those who are liable to pay income tax and who have one child. For each child after the first, the increase has been from £52 to £65, another increase of £13. These are material advantages to the father and mother of a family struggling valiantly to make adequate social and educational provision for their children. Then the allowance for each student child rose from £78 again to £91, an increase of £13. And for the first time in the history of our country, this Government introduced an education allowance. It began at £50 for each child, and to-day it is £100 per child. These have all been advantages to the family man, all designed to help the fathers and mothers and the children of our families, and I believe they have been of very great assistance. 1 know that as far as country people in particular are concerned the education allowance has been the finest form of family assistance that our people have ever had. Now, I want to make brief and passing reference to the grim and terrible honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser), who led for the Opposition on this occasion. He shed tears of anguish for the family,Mr Speaker, but I venture to suggest that those tears were devoid completely of compassion; they were shed in shame. You must remember, Mr Speaker, that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro gave unswerving loyalty and support to the lastI say this prophetically -socialis t government. And it was that government that consistently during nearly nine years of office said that it was utterly impossible to pay child endowment for the gestion and said that it was utterly impossible to pay child endowment for the first child. That, of course, is paid to-day in respect of 1,500,000 children at a cost to the Australian taxpayers of £19,650,000 per annum. It was the same government and the same honourable member for Eden-Monaro who said at the previous elections and during the period of the last socialist government that it was financially impossible for this country to meet the position of the civilian widow with more than one child. The previous government paid to an A class civilian widow with one child or more than one child the magnificent sum of £2 7s. 6d. a week.",86,Social Services Bill 1961
271,Mr Roberton (Riverina,"Ministe rIf she had two children, her pension was £2 7s. 6d. a week; if she had ten children, her pension was £2 7s. 6d. a week. The government that the member for Eden Monaro supported during all his years of service in the previous government said that it could not be improved, not by a single halfpenny. It was the same government that said it was financially impossible to improve the position of the civilian widow who committed the folly of allowing her youngest child to reach the age of sixteen years before she reached the age of 50 years. For nine years, the previous socialist government said to that civilian widow: "" If your youngest child reaches the age of sixteen years before you are 50 years old and eligible for a B class widow's pension, you must go to work. You lose your pension absolutely and completely, and it remains lost to you until you reach 50 years of age."" When it was pointed out to the socialist government that there were hundreds and perhaps thousands of B class widows who had devoted their entire adult lives to the rearing £1 10s., the pension was automatically of their children and who had reached the age of 45, 46, 47, 48 or. 49, the socialist government could do nothing to help them except to say: "" Go to work and remain at work until you are 50 years of age. Then come back to us and we will pay you £1 17s. a week."" It was the same government, supported by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, that said it was utterly impossible to improve the position of the D class widow. She was condemned to live with her shame, visited on her by her husband and her children, on £1 17s. regardless of the number of children. It remained for this Government to eliminate that category of widow. To-day she qualifies, if she has a dependent child, for an A class widow's pension and escapes the ignominy of the D class widow's pension. The same government said it was beyond the means of the Australian community to improve the position of the single pensioner or a married couple who, because of the variation in their ages, were required to live on a single pension. The socialist government said that it could not be done, that there was no known way of improving the position of a single pensioner living on a single pension or a married couple living on one pension only when they had to pay rent. For nine years, the government that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro supported said that there was no known way of effecting that most urgent social need. Again it remained for this Government to devise and introduce supplementary assistance for the first time in our history. The same government and the same honourable member for Eden-Monaro said there was nothing to be done to improve the position of the blind pensioner with children, who had to live on a means test pension of £2 2s. 6d. It remained for this Government to remove the means test for the blind pensioner and to pay the additional allowance for the dependent children. It was the same government, supported by the honourable member for Eden Monaro with all that he has and had at that time, that said the income means test could not be eased beyond £1 10s. a week. For nine years, it said that £1 10s. was the maximum income that a person could have,, and if a person had income in excess of reduced. There was no known way to solve that problem, not during the whole of the period that the socialist government was in office. The socialist government said it was impossible to ease the property means test in excess of £750. If a pensioner had more than £750, then no pension was payable at that time. The same government despite all that has been said to the contrary, said that it was financially impossible to do anything to merge the property means test and the income means test. I know that various people claim to have devised the scheme to merge the means tests, but I went through the travail in the Department of Social Services when the system was being devised. I went through the struggles that were inseparable from the introduction of such a proposal for the first time in our social service history. I know just what it has meant to the people and to the Government. With very great respect, I suggest that if the Opposition does not want to be generous to the Minister for Social Services, whoever he may be, they might consider being a little generous to those who have served him and the people of Australia so faithfully and so well during the last six years. It was the same honourable member for Eden-Monaro, still shedding his tears of chagrin, who said during the nine years of the socialist government that there was no known way to remove the traditional discrimination aboriginal natives of our own country. For 50 years, it was beyond the capacity of the Opposition to devise a simple means that would remove what could only be interpreted as a shame on the Government and the Opposition during these 50 years. It remained for this Government to remove that discrimination for ever. The same honourable member for Eden-Monaro, weeping his tears when he was addressing himself to this bill, said it was impossible to enter into a reciprocal agreement with the United Kingdom. No formula could be devised that would be acceptable to the Australian Government and the United Kingdom Government. It remained for this Government to enter into that reciprocal agreement, which, as I said in the House yesterday, has worked admirably. I think I am justified in mentioning one or two other matters to solve the anguish of the honourable member for Eden Monaro. He said that to grant adequate taxation concessions for women over 60 years of age and men over 65 years of age was utterly impossible; it could not be done. This Government did it. This Government has increased these concessions consistent and commensurate with every increase in social service benefits for which these people qualify. The honourable member for Eden Monaro and the government he supported said there was no financial way to grant allowances and deductions from income tax for education expenses. As I said in reply to the honourable member for Lang, it was this Government that devised that provision. It was the honourable member for Eden-Monaro who said that there was no known way to introduce medical and pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners and their dependants. Those of us who can remember back to 1947, 1948 and that fateful year, 1949, know that when the socialist government tried valiantly to introduce socialistic schemes of hospitalization, medical benefits, none of the reputable medical and pharmaceutical people would co-operate in any way with it in proposals of that kind; and so our aged men and women and their dependent children were deprived of these services during the whole of the period of the socialist government. It was the honourable member for Edenlevelled against the Monaro, still shedding these tears, who said that it was impossible to conceive the idea of assisting churches and charitable organizations to provide homes for our aged men and women. These organizations were engaged in that kind of work and had been engaged in it from time immemorial. They were deserving, and they sought practical assistance from the socialist government to expand their operations, to extend their accommodation, and to provide for greater numbers of people. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, in effect, that it could not be done; there was no known way of assisting the churches and charitable organizations to provide additional accommodation. The same honourable gentleman said, in effect-no t in so many words-that to remove the sales tax on motor vehicles used by qualified disabled persons in the course of their employment was an impossibility; it was too difficult; there was no way of doing it. It has been done and it is being done from day to day. These, without exception, are all matters of family importance and they are the only matters to which I want to refer in my reply this evening. They have all been dealt with, and satisfactorily dealt with, by the present Government. With the confidence of the electors of our country, the social service policy of the Government will be advanced still further in the next few years. I have no objection to members like the honourable member for Lang and other honourable members of the Opposition who take the same kind of line as he took and who spoke about genuine grievances in an informed way, but I suggest to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that if he wants to assist the sociological progress of our country there is no need to indulge in the whinings and recriminations that pervaded his speech last night. There is plenty of scope for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, services and pharmaceutical and Opposition members generally, to engage in social welfare work where they are immediately in a position to put their ideas into practical effect. A socialist government has been in office in New South Wales for more than twenty years. The honourable member for Eden Monaro, a New South Wales member of this Parliament, has never in any of his speeches on social services mentioned the deplorable circumstances in which the mentally sick of that State are condemned to live. Not a single word! When their conditions descended to a level where a royal commission was required to correct that most grievous situation, there was not a syllable from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. There was not a word to the State Government on what might be done to help the retarded children under the age of sixteen years, at which age in the normal course of events they would qualify for an invalid pension. There was not a word as to what might be done for the children stricken by poliomyelitis, palsy, or any of the other cerebral diseases. Yet there is an illimitable scope for assistance of a variety of kinds. Nothing has been said by honourable members opposite as to what ought to be done to help the physically handicapped in New South Wales to recover their place in normal society and to discharge their social responsibility in full. Yet there is a field of exploration that ought to commend itself to men who claim to represent the Australian people. These strata, where the children are too young to qualify for Commonwealth social services are, so far as honourable members of the Opposition are sonal explanation. concerned, barren fields. There are no votes to be produced in any of them. Honourable members opposite would rather muck member claim to have been misrepresented? around with the paddocks of social services that have been farmed out for years and years. So it is that I have very little to answer, Mr Speaker. I should now like to give some authoriginning, "" The honourable member for Edentative estimates of the cost of the OpposiMonaro said "". In case anybody might be tion's proposals, which are included in its innocent enough to believe him, I had better policy for the ensuing general election. The put it on record that every one of those cost of increasing age and invalid pensions statements of the Minister is without any by 5s. a week, as those of us who have basis whatever. studied this bill know, would be £8,700,000; of paying a domestic allowance of £3 10s. to class A widows only, £4,550,000; of paying class B widows an extra 17s. 6d. a Allan week, £1,370,000; of increasing supplementary assistance by 20s. a week, £5,000,000; of increasing the wife's allowance by £3 2s. 6d. a week, £2,400,000; of increasing child endowment on the scale proposed in the Opposition's policy, £60,700,000; of increasing maternity allowance-allowances , as I understand the proposal-£4,000,000 ; of increasing funeral benefits to £20, £780,000; of reducing to ten years the residential qualification for an age pension, £2,500,000. The total cost of these proposals to-day would be £90,000,000. The increase in our population, at the level of children, adolescents, and mature men and women, is so rapid that by the time the general election is here the cost of those proposals will approximate £100,000,000. If the cost of the Opposition's other proposals is added to that, the people of our country will be laden with a taxation burden that can only be described at this stage as insuperable. However, that is for the future to determine. I want to end on the note upon which I began. I congratulate honourable members who have applied themselves to a study of social services in any form and who have attempted to make a contribution to the solution of the problem as it confronts us to-day and as it is likely to confront us in the future. As the standard of life and living rises in the general community, so does the need for increasing benefits within the ambit of social services as we know ' them.

Was the Anglo-Kuwait Agreement of 1899 cancelled by the exchange of noies between the United Kingdom and Kuwait on 25th June, 1961? 2. Has Iraq now withdrawn its claim to Kuwait? 3. Were the oil concessions granted by Kuwait to British and United States companies granted for an indefinite period? able member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. The Anglo-Kuwait Agreement of 23rd January, 1899, was in fact cancelled by an exchange of notes between the United Kingdom ""Government and the Ruler of Kuwait on 19th -June, 1961. 2. No. The Iraqi claim has been re-stated 'officially on a number of occasions since it was announced publicly by the Prime Minister, -General Kassem, on 25th June this year. As recently as 4th September, General Kassem is reported in a newspaper interview to have reiterated that Kuwait is an inseparable part of Iraq. 3. The concession held jointly by the British Petroleum Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America extends to the year 2032. Universities. Mr L. R. Johnson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. Is it a fact that the Sydney University Senate has decided (a) that in 1962 it will be necessary to limit first year medical student enrolments to 365 compared with enrolments this year of 575 and (b) that in 1963 it will limit first year enrolments for all faculties to 4,600 although more than 5,500 applications are expected? 2. Has his attention been drawn to the statement of the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Emeritus Professor S. H. Roberts, on 30th July that, with unrestricted enrolments in first year, the number of students would increase to 20,000 in 1966 although accommodation could only be made available for a student population of approximately 16,000? 3. If so, are plans in hand to overcome these anticipated difficulties either by expanding existing facilities of Sydney universities or by establishing a third university in the Sydney metropolitan area? able member's questions are as follows:1. I understand the Senate of the University of Sydney has made such an announcement. 2. Yes. 3. A few days ago I announced the establishment of a committee to advise the Australian Universities Commission on the future development of tertiary education in Australia. This committee has a wide charter and I am sure that, as part of its work, it will spend time considering the difficulties associated with expanding the existing facilities of the Sydney universities and the need to establish additional facilities at the tertiary level. Mr Swartz asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. Has the committee to investigate and report on the expansion problems of universities in Australia yet been'appointed? 2. If so, when will the first meetings of this committee be held? 3. Will the committee visit all States; if so, could visits to provincial areas, such as the Darling Downs, be included in the itinerary? 4. Will the committee consider at an early date the submission made on behalf of the Darling Downs University Establishment Association? 5. Will this submission be considered separately or in the course of an Australia-wide survey? 6. As copies of the association's submission were also forwarded to the Universities Commission, will the matter receive consideration by the commission at an early date or will it be deferred until the report is received from the special committee? able member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. The date for the first meeting has not yet been set, but I believe that it will be in October. 3. Whilst the itinerary is of course a matter for the committee itself, I would think that it would certainly visit various States to assess their problems atfirsthand. 4. The Australian Universities Commission will refer to the committee the submission of the Darling Downs University Establishment Association, but, once again, the date of its consideration is for the committee to decide. 5. It would seem appropriate for the committee to consider the submission not only in relation to the problems peculiar to Queensland, but also as part of its Australia-wide survey. 6. It seems unlikely that the Australian Universities Commission would make any judgment on the needs of the Darling Downs area until it has considered the committee's report and seen the problems of tertiary education as a whole. Commonwealth and State Financial Relations. Mr Ward asked the Acting Treasurer, upon noticeWhy does the Government charge interest upon loans to State governments made from funds obtained by the levying of taxation on Australian citizens when the only expense involved by the Commonwealth is the cost of collection?",97,Adjournment
335,Mr Menzies,The answers to the honor,98,Adjournment
336,Mr Menzies,The answers to the honor,98,Adjournment
337,Mr Menzies,"The answers to the honourable member's question is as follows:In each year since 1951-52, the State governfollows:ments have submitted for the consideration of the Australian Loan Council proposed loan programmes for State works and housing purposes which the council finally decided were in excess of the amounts that could be borrowed on reasonable terms and conditions. The Loan Council has accordingly approved a borrowing programme each year somewhat less than the total of the programmes submitted by the States. By agreeing to these reduced programmes, the States have on each occasion clearly signified their willingness to borrow the total amount of the approved programme on the market, and to pay market rates of interest. In order to enable the States to plan their works and housing programmes on a firm basis, the Commonwealth has, in each of the years from 1951-52 to date, undertaken to find from its own resources amounts sufficient to enable the borrowing programme for the year to be completed, should the market not yield the amount desired. In each of the last ten years it has been necessary for the Commonwealth, in pursuance of its undertaking, to support the approved borrowing programme by subscribing from its own resources to a special loan, and the Budget proposals submitted to Parliament for this financial year also envisage the probability that a special loan will be required. The resources from which the Commonwealth has subscribed to the special loans have included funds available from oversea borrowings by the Commonwealth, and amounts appropriated to the Trust Fund from the general revenues of the Commonwealth. The terms of the annual special loan have been based on those for loans floated in Australia earlier in the year. As the States were prepared to borrow the full amount of the approved programme at current market rates, it does not seem unreasonable that they should pay market rates on funds subscribed by the Commonwealth. Moreover, a substantial proportion of State loan monevs are either invested in a productive manner and produce revenues for the States, or are advanced and subsequently repaid to the State with interest. In the circumstances, the Commonwealth has considered that it would not be inequitable for the States to pay interest for the contributions which the Commonwealth has made through special loans to the annual governmental borrowing programmes approved by the Loan Council. Broadcasting and Television. Mr Whitlam asked the Postmasterwithin a few hundred pounds of the General, upon noticeWhat steps has he taken to amend section ties were the only ones which did not suc100 (6.) of the Broadcasting and Television Act ceed in borrowing virtually the whole of relating to the broadcasting and televising of meditheir programmes during 1960-61.

My colleague informed me that whilst he was not, at the time, prepared to endorse the council recommendation that section 100 of the Broadcasting and Television Act should be amended, he felt that there was considerable merit in its recommendation that an Australian national advertising code should be drawn up for the guidance of advertisers of patent medicines and appliances. I am informed that considerable progress has been made in this direction, with the support of the industrial organizations concerned with such matters. Although such a code would have no legislative sanction, but would depend on the voluntary co-operation of all concerned, I understand that the Commonwealth health authorities regard it as likely to be of considerable value in establishing a uniform and acceptable approach to the advertising of medicines and associated products. Local Government Finance. honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) asked the Treasurer whether Victoria was included among the five States which he said had borrowed every £1 of their 1960-61 semi-government and local authority borrowing programmes. The Treasurer said that his recollection was that Victoria was one of these five States, but undertook to check the position. The 1960-61 borrowing programme for Victorian semi-government and local authorities was £38,740,000. Victorian authorities fell short of borrowing the full amount of their programmes by only £6,000, or less than 0.02 per cent. Queensland authorities reported borrowings to the full amount of their approved programmes. Authorities in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia all borrowed approved programmes.

340,Mr Menzies,"On 5th September, theHaving in mind the borrowing difficulties experienced by governmental authorities during last year, the fact that authorities in all the six States managed to borrow within £200,000 of programmes totalling £106,000,000 is an extremely good record. The facts I have mentioned seem adequately to justify the general comment that semi-government and local authorities in five States raised virtually every £1 of their borrowing programmes last year.
