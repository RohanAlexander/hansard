Yesterday it was announced that the Telstra call centre in Rockhampton will close on 19 July, throwing 23 people-21 of them full-time employees-out of work. This is terrible news for Rockhampton and, of course, for those employees themselves, when the city is just getting back on its feet after the five-month lockout at Consolidated Meat Group, one of the city’s largest employers. We have had 1,350 of the city’s meat workers out of work since November last year-a huge blow to those workers, as well as to businesses in Rockhampton. The meat workers are only just back at work and now we get this latest blow from a privatised Telstra. The Howard government has to take responsibility for what its policies have done to contribute to unemployment in Rockhampton. First of all, under the government’s industrial relations legislation, the dispute at CMG was allowed to drag on for months. How can anyone pretend that a system that produces that kind of stalemate is working for either employers or employees? Now, finally, the workers are back in the gates, but they are working under the federal meat industry award, earning barely more than the unemployment benefit. Every one of those meat workers knows that they have Peter Reith to thank for that. His Workplace Relations Act allowed for the meat award to be stripped back to basic levels, even though these are skilled workers in a profitable company. As a result, less money is going to those families and less money is flowing through the businesses of Rockhampton. A great employment strategy! The Telstra story in Rockhampton is much worse than just that of the 23 call centre employees who are now facing redundancy. Since the Howard government was elected in 1996, well over 100 full-time Telstra jobs have disappeared from Rockhampton. Does John Howard have any idea what that does to a regional city of 60,000 people? The pay packets of 23 full time workers go a long way in our city, let alone the accumulated impact of over 100 jobs that have been lost in the past five years. Clearly, the government’s policy of selling off Telstra has had a huge impact on employment in my electorate over the past six years and people are rightly angry. I wish those Telstra employees at the call centre well as they try to deal with an uncertain future. I know they have a lot of support in the community of Rockhampton. Of course, we are still trying to overcome the blow that hit last year when Ansett collapsed, taking at least 30 jobs away from Rockhampton and reducing us to the status of a small country town with only one airline. That is still to be addressed by this government. This government has let Rockhampton down very badly through its policies that have chipped away at our infrastructure and services, all the time reducing our capacity to make the most of our opportunities. I say to John Howard: even if he cannot come up with a positive plan for jobs in Central Queensland, at least stop attacking the ones that we have got. ing some photographs this morning to update some advertising literature for the parliament.

250,Mr Ross Cameron (Parramatta,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for FamilyWednesday, 15 May 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 2269 agree that government needs to move in many cases out of the area of welfare and into the area of community capacity building. I want to report to the House on a local project in that regard by the name of Pay It Forward Parramatta. The initiative takes its name from a movie of the same title starring Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osment and Kevin Spacey, in which a social studies teacher asks his pupils to come up with an idea that will change the world. The 12year-old boy comes back with a simple but very powerful thought: that he would take a personal, private initiative of kindness towards three people he meets-something big, something they could not do for themselves. Instead of asking them to pay it back, he would ask all of them to pay it forward to someone else in a similar act of kindness. It draws on the old idea that it is more blessed to give than to receive, but it is a powerful engine of community capacity building. A group of students from the National Student Leadership Forum approached me about a year ago and said, ‘We want to pilot this; we want to do this in some members’ electorates around the country.’ I was grateful that they chose Parramatta. We teamed up with the Burnside Family Learning Centre in Ermington. We found a dozen single mums in Housing Commission dwellings in my electorate. We put together a team of 25 volunteers, with whipper snippers, lawnmowers, ladders and paint brushes, and we went to a dozen homes with the desire simply to do something that perhaps they were not in a position to do for themselves. We had a massive backyard blitz in the electorate of Parramatta. It was not just the physical work that got done but the relationships that got built and the sense of hope that was infused. So we continued with that initiative. We then teamed up with Homecare, the New South Wales government agency that specifically looks after the frail aged and people with disabilities, and which tries to help them stay in their homes. I note a welcome measure in this budget to provide more resources for that effort. Homecare gave us the names of a dozen frail aged in my electorate. There are about 700 on the books of Homecare in my electorate, so we are just making a start. Again, we put together a posse of Parramatta Pay It Forward volunteers. On one Saturday, we turned up in the morning, we had breakfast and we visited each of those homes and made a very significant impact. I then borrowed the movie from the Village Roadshow, hired the auditorium at the Parramatta Leagues Club and invited 250 of the local community leaders to come and share the vision of Pay it Forward, and share it they did. Just two weeks ago we had our third local initiative, again with a group of frail aged and people with disabilities, and we have another one planned for six weeks time. There is this great community movement of volunteers, who are standing up and saying, ‘Yes, I care about my neighbour. I want to make a difference. I am not sitting around waiting for the government to act. We in our own community have the capacity to care for one another and help solve these problems.’ I think it is an important pilot as a direction for the whole nation. Education: Equality education has gone missing in this particular Howard-Costello government. Under the stewardship of this government over the last six years, half of the possible education debate has simply fallen off the agenda. Education is the balancing of differences: it includes; it does not exclude. But exclusion has ruled the debate of the past six years. There should be a range of views; there is not. There ought to be diversity; there is not. There should be an inclusive balancing of differences; there is not. Take, for example, the concept of how different countries achieve quality of education in the OECD. Scandinavian countries and countries like France are committed to supporting education by equalising resource inputs to achieve quality. English speaking countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the USA focus on policies that deregulate education systems on the assumption that choice improves quality. Which one is",126,Representatives Main Committee
251,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (9.45 A.m.),"Last night’s budget confirmed one thing:2270 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 correct? Neither. A balanced education system would show evidence of a continuum of both resource inputs and choice. Take, for example, another aspect of the education debate-teacher quality. Nearly 70 per cent of teachers in this country are employed by the government; over 30 per cent of teachers are employed by non-government authorities. But the fact remains that neither employer has any say over the training of teachers, the supply of teachers or the future needs of education. It is just bizarre. Education not only deserves bipartisanship; it can only grow if it occurs. The instability of education caused by different, opposing and changing ideologies of political parties is simply destructive. The Australian community, if it is to get an edge over our trading partners, requires a bipartisan or a non-partisan approach to education policy. Take as a third example the collapse over the last 10 years of the education curriculum framework in this country. No-one can structure good education outcomes if one aspect of education is favoured over another, yet that is what happens in this country. Nor can it be achieved if there is an overreliance on qualitative research at the expense of quantitative research, but that is also the case. In this country, if you look at a curriculum, we favour synthesis over analysis, intuition over insight, description over comprehension, presentation over organisation, cooperation over competition, nurture over nature, passivity over activity, unstructured over structured, fine motor skills over gross motor skills, continuous assessment over examination and so on. Education is the balancing of differences along the whole continuum, not just half of it as at present. Whilst this appalling situation continues to be the case, education in this country will be diminished while denial of the problem at a government and a bureaucratic level continues. Who in this government will play the substantive and not just the symbolic card-who indeed? In the current situation all Australians, young and old, lose. The government contents itself with illusion, delusion and confusion. That is not a great base for the future. Hinkler Electorate: Boyne Smelters Ltd reaching its 20th anniversary of operations in Gladstone in March of this year. As the city’s federal representative, it is a pleasure to be able to say, ‘Yes, our regional areas do prosper and grow alongside strong industry, and here is living proof of that.’ Over this 20 years the company has set international benchmarks for smelting, but this milestone is only the opening act of a new performance by the company. In 1997, Boyne Smelters demonstrated its commitment to the district with a $1 billion expansion program to add a third pot line to its aluminium operations. That investment almost doubled annual production, lifting output from 260,000 tonnes to 510,000 tonnes, and was a strong vote of confidence in the future of both the region and the smelter itself. The community now eagerly awaits the next major stage, yet another expansion of the Boyne Smelters operation, which hinges on an EIS currently out for comment. If this proceeds, the capital investment will be some $700 million to $800 million, and the work force will increase to 650 during the construction phase. The permanent work force should rise from 1,300 to 1,400 people, while the capacity of the plant would lift to 708,000 tonnes. However, the company’s true worth may be more accurately gauged by Gladstone’s sustained growth and the number of local families which have grown up in the same community as Boyne Smelters and other focused industries in the light metals sector. The company contributes to the city and its surrounds-and that cannot be underestimated-with its generous investment in employment, community and environmental programs. This complements Gladstone’s enviable lifestyle, thanks to its impressive parks, gardens, recreational facilitiesall hallmarks of the city and its adjoining Calliope shire.

I am pleased to say that this wealth generation assists not only the town but also the state and the country, and will continue well into the future as Gladstone develops as the capital of light metals technology in Australia. The company’s 20th anniversary is indeed an occasion for the community and the company to celebrate together to mark a most productive past and to look forward to the future that holds great promise for wealth creation affecting the city, the state and the nation alike. Braddon Electorate: Infrastructure to talk about some positive news in my home state of Tasmania and particularly news that will affect my electorate of Braddon on the north-west coast in relation to infrastructure. In total, there is investment of something like $1.4 billion in infrastructure. We have had the announcement of our two new super fast ferries, which I hope you might avail yourselves of the opportunity to use to come to Tasmania and into my home port of Devonport. The investment there is of the order of $290 million, greatly increasing our capacity to bring people across the strait and to offer them options in how they travel. That is great news and we look forward to that. I was glad, too, that the federal government honoured its promises to Tasmania in the passenger equalisation scheme in the budget last night. If you come into my electorate you can go further west, up into what we call Woolnorth or Cape Grim, where we have the cleanest air in Australia, and you will see massive wind energy developments taking place there, with a capacity of something like 130 megawatts. Further development is planned in Tasmania for a capacity of something like 300 megawatts and, I believe, for a further 1,000 megawatts in the future. With that comes the possibility of developing the blade technology and blade manufacture for these massive turbines from Vestas. That could create something like 250 jobs, with massive IT involvement and technology transfer. That is great news. But there is not just wind in north-west Tasmania; part and parcel of that is Basslink, a very important investment in the national grid and valued at something like $500 million. That will see Tasmania’s renewable energy capacity being able to be transferred through our batteries-which is our hydro scheme, effectively-into the national grid, where we can play an important part. The idea of renewable credit transfers in the future makes this a very important industry. On top of that, we have the natural gas pipeline coming through from Duke Energy which is valued at something like $400 million. There we have a total of $1.4 billion in infrastructure, and in particular in energy infrastructure, where once Tasmania was deficient, strangely enough, even with our massive hydro-electricity schemes. Tasmania should develop an energy surplus, which means that we are open for business in the future. So what have we got? We have got important and massive infrastructure, very good facilities in Tasmania and a lifestyle unequalled in Australia. I suggest the future in Tasmania is very bright. Many more mainlanders are looking to Tasmania to have their future there as well. I will be very pleased see them in Braddon. Budget: Rural and Regional Australia Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.54 a.m.)-As there is a continuing anthrax concern in my electorate of Murray, I am very pleased to say that in the budget yesterday an extra $10 million was allocated for a national animal disease emergency response. We have been so fortunate in this country that we have not had the BSE experience, or foot-and-mouth, but certainly we are very vulnerable.

253,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (9.51 A.m.),"In light of the pretty dull budget, I would like2272 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 fact that we depend very much on the well-being of our livestock industry and also on our fruit crops and cereal crops, in terms of disease being kept in check. Extra funding also will be spent on epidemiology and emergency management, new information systems and the automation of Animal Health Laboratories diagnostic systems to help identify diseases more quickly. Scholarships to encourage rural vets into country areas also represent dollars very well spent. It is a tragedy that during the years when Labor was in government we saw vets not going into rural practice because there was not the funding to support their extra costs so that they could work in those places. There is $2 million for that budget initiative to help our country vets. It is tragic, though, when you look at a state like Victoria, to see that, while the Commonwealth is doing its best to try to fill gaps, there are so many left by the Victorian Bracks government in terms of understanding the needs of rural Victoria. At the moment, as people would know, there is a real effort on the part of the national government in terms of environmental spending. In this budget we saw the biggest expenditure in the history of Australia in terms of the environment-some $1.8 billion. Even though we have repaid $61 billion of the $96 billion debt left by Labor, we are able to record the biggest expenditure on the environment in the history of this country. That is extraordinary. At the same time, in Victoria, the irrigation infrastructure is ageing, particularly in my electorate of Murray. Millions of dollars are required to at least bring structures to a point where people are not banned from operating them because of occupational health and safety issues. We have allocated over $400 million in national competition payments to the state government for things like water law reform. We cannot find one cent of those dollars going to very important projects like rebuilding the irrigation infrastructure, which would in turn deliver some of the best foods to the world via export markets. I call on the Bracks government to become a little more astute and fair and to put those competition dollars where they were intended-into the sectors where pain has been experienced in terms of the reforms. We would then see the Victorian government thriving like it once did under the coalition leadership, particularly during the Kennett days. 275A, the time for members’ statements has concluded. BILL 2002 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (9.57 a.m.)-I am pleased to support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2002, although it does not go far enough. These amendments follow recommendations from the 1997 and 1998 reviews of the operation of the ATSIC electoral systems and boundaries and the general operation of the ATSIC Act. The amendments contained in the bill relate largely to provisions in the ATSIC Act which affect the elected statutory office holders of ATSIC. The amendments that are proposed will permit greater certainty in regard to the position of the current office holders and their eligibility for election, and are therefore welcome. However, I note that the government has failed to schedule sufficient sitting time to deal with the business of the House, and the late introduction of these changes following these reviews has meant that this bill will only just pass through the parliament in time for the ATSIC elections in the second half of this year. It is only possible for these amendments to pass in time for these elections because of our willingness to move this legislation quickly through",129,Representatives Main Committee
254,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),"Order! In according with standing orderWednesday, 15 May 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 2273 the parliament. The government has had since 1998, following the ATSIC election review, to submit these amendments to the parliament but chose to do so only this year. As many members will know, ATSIC elections are due to be held in the second half of the year, so it is important for this legislation to proceed. ATSIC, as I hope people understand, is Australia’s principal democratically elected indigenous organisation. The adequacy of its electoral procedures is important to its role as an adviser to government and, indeed, to its credibility in that role. The ATSIC board of commissioners, of course, also supports the bill. As described by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the bill amends the ATSIC Act to make minor changes in areas such as the composition of review panels, disqualifications from the office of regional councillor and zone commissioner, continuity of terms between election cycles, the availability of review of commission decisions, and the consistency of terminology in financial provisions. BeforeI continue I would like to point out that there appears to be a technical flaw within the bill and consequently I think the bill will need to be amended in the Senate. I would certainly like to draw it to the minister’s attention. This arises within amendments to the appointment of the ATSIC chairperson as chairperson of the Electoral Review Panel. Before the present ATSIC chair, the government appointed the chairperson of the commission. The boundaries and other electoral matters. The amendments aim to remedy this. Items 43 and 45 amend the act to ensure that the chairperson of a review panel or an augmented review panel is no longer the commission chairperson, as is appropriate, but is instead an indigenous person who is not an elected ATSIC or TSRA office-holder. However, a drafting error in the bill means that the counterpart consequential amendment to item 45 is missing. An amendment to the bill to require the repeal of section 141T is necessary to avoid an internal contradiction in this legislation. As stated, several of the amendments within this bill arise from a review conducted under section 26 of the ATSIC Act in 1997-98. The bill deals with essentially minor and technical amendments. Labor believes that in limiting the scope of this bill the government has passed up an opportunity to tackle a wide range of matters which were the subject of recommendations made in the section 26 review more than four years ago. The government has been very tardy about this and the response is incomplete. The government has promoted this bill as giving effect to the recommendations arising from the section 26 review it received in 1998 but, in reality, most of the recommendations for legislative change have not been implemented in this legislation-or anywhere else, for that matter. This includes a long list of changes which the section 26 review characterised as ‘administrative and legal problems’ as well as a suite of proposals which the review authors called ‘substantive changes to the act to improve its operation and to strengthen ATSIC’s capacity to address the aspirations and needs of indigenous people over the next five years and beyond.’ We have the shortest of short-term amendments in this legislation. The substantive changes they are talking about include the explicit capacity of regional councils to make regional agreements, direct election of commissioners and facilitating greater regional autonomy or regional authorities. The review recommended that the act be amended so that regional councils were specifically empowered to conclude regional agreements with governments, agencies and other organisations to achieve coordinated service provision in their region, and that provision be made in the act for the establishment of regional authorities after the commission has considered and reported on the outcomes of the studies. As a result, in September 1999 the then minister Herron and chairperson Djerrkura released a discussion paper. A consultation exercise followed and the Report on greater regional autonomy was endorsed by the ATSIC board in June 2000 and forwarded to the min2274 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 ister. The report first of all supported the right of indigenous communities to establish regional authorities. It authorised further work to be done on the criteria that such authorities would have to meet. It recommended to the minister that ‘the necessary legislative approval be obtained to enable the establishment of a regional authority in any given case that meets the criteria.’ As the minister pointed out in his second reading speech, the current bill implements recommendations from the section 26 review of 1997-98. It does not, however, address the issues of greater regional autonomy, regional agreements by regional councils or regional authorities. It is very important to improve the standing of Aboriginal communities. Interest in establishing such authorities has been particularly strong-this is not academic-in remote areas such as the Northern Territory and in the western New South Wales Murdi Paaki region. The Cape York Partnerships Plan also involves such regional agreements, and they are being hamstrung at the moment. Regional governance and regional agreements have been the subject of much focus and discussion over the past couple of years, and the government has yet to respond to that. This was highlighted last month by the Indigenous Governance Conference-Understanding and Implementing Good Governance for Indigenous Communities and Regions, which was held in Canberra and hosted by ATSIC, Reconciliation Australia and the National Institute for Governance at the University of Canberra. These are very important discussions and require a response from government. Most participants were very enthusiastic in their support for self determination through management of their broader communities and the provision of services. The autonomy report pointed to the use of regional agreements in Canada to achieve comprehensive settlements of outstanding land claims and noted past advocacy in Australia of such agreements to achieve coordinated service delivery and a framework for settling social justice issues and ‘unfinished business’. International advocates at the indigenous governance conference spoke on many of these examples, and successful ones they are too. Last year’s inquiry into indigenous funding by the Commonwealth Grants Commission found that indigenous people did not have equitable access to mainstream services provided by government. It said that effective partnerships should be developed and called for: ... indigenous control of, or strong influence over, service delivery expenditure and regional or local service delivery arrangements that emphasise community development, interagency cooperation and general effectiveness. So we have calls coming from all quarters and still no response to them from the government. There has been no government response to this report either. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Dr Bill Jonas, in his Social justice report of 2000 stated: The development of governance structures and regional autonomy provides the potential for a successful meeting place to integrate the various strands of reconciliation. In particular, it is able to tie together the aims of promoting recognition of indigenous rights, with the related aims of overcoming disadvantage and achieving economic independence. However, in the 2001 Social justice report released yesterday-interestingly under the shadow of the budget and I think designed to disappear-he stated that, although government initiatives have been introduced following the Indigenous Community Capacity Building Roundtable held in October 2000 and as part of the welfare reform package in the 2001 federal budget, the commitments have been short term and minimal in terms of funding support. I quote from his most recent report: While these initiatives are to be welcomed, they only hint at the potential for reconfiguring and transforming the relationship of indigenous communities with the mainstream society. Indigenous commuWednesday, 15 May 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 2275 nity capacity and governance mechanisms could be furthered through facilitating more effective forms of financial and administrative self-government. Clearly, most people and organisations with a stake in addressing indigenous disadvantage recognise that changes do need to be made to government institutions, including ATSIC, in order to enable these institutions to perform better. The government has let the past years drift by without providing legislative amendment to facilitate this. The bill does little to address these bigger issues and there is no sign of them being addressed anywhere else either. In the 2001 budget the government announced its commitment to reconciliation and reducing indigenous disadvantage through a boost of more than $327 million to spending on indigenous affairs. A proud boast, you might think, but it is pretty hollow when you look beyond the rhetoric. Labor has stated before that the definition, for instance, of indigenousspecific funding incorporated in that figure is extremely broad and actually encompasses all expenditure that relates in any way to indigenous people and communities. For example, so called indigenous-specific funding in the 2001 federal budget included $1 million to the Department of Defence, $266,000 to Foreign Affairs and Trade and $210,000 to Australian Customs for indigenous cultural education and recruitment programs. The overall amount also includes $6.1 million for the collection of data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These are essentially the rights of citizens. These are not indigenous-specific programs; it just happens that they go in some cases toward providing data, for instance, and recruitment. This year’s federal budget does the same thing. It also includes $2.2 million to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio for pest and diseases monitoring and surveillance in North Queensland under the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy. Why is that considered indigenous-specific funding? It benefits the whole community, and indeed the whole nation. Quite clearly indigenous-specific funding is funding that will contribute to overcoming disadvantage. Why is this $2.2 million seen as relating only to indigenous people? Labor and others have also pointed out that some of the funding identified as indigenous specific is actually against indigenous people’s interests. This is a more serious problem. It is clear, for instance, that 47 per cent of the budget of the Department of Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the last financial year was expended on litigation against the interest of indigenous people, in cases such as the Gunner and Cubillo stolen generations case. That can hardly be considered in any meaningful sense as indigenousspecific funding designed to reduce disadvantage. In this year’s budget we discover that 30 per cent of this year’s funding to the Office of Indigenous Affairs is allocated to litigation. Likewise, how is that going to help indigenous people? This use of funds seems decidedly against the core function of the department, which is said to be to provide ‘advice which acknowledges and values the cultures, heritage, rights and aspirations of indigenous people, and supports the creation and nurturing of opportunities for indigenous people to meet their aspirations, thus contributing to social justice and equity in Australia.’ I will leave that hanging out there-I do not think so. Again this year we have a massive amount spent on litigation above and beyond the funds for litigation just mentioned, with $16.6 million allocated to the Attorney-General’s Department and to the states for litigation against native title claimants, nearly $13 million to the Federal Court to hear these cases-cases that indigenous communities would rather not reach this point. Why are they considered to the advantage of indigenous people? And $33.5 million has been allocated to the Native Title Tribunal to mediate these cases. Again, these are cases that could be managed by agreement. The government this year has already begun to trumpet its record spending on indigenous affairs. However, if you look clearly at that spending, there are no new funding initiatives despite the ever-increasing need for indigenous-specific projects and services. Only $1.1 billion of this goes to ATSIC; it is no increase in real terms. That is the reality-there is no increase, 2276 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 in real terms, to the ATSIC budget. The additional $28.3 million for ATSIC described in the budget flows from the increase which was announced in last year’s federal budget. There are no new initiatives here at all. This means that there has been no appreciable increase in ing from the $470 million cut to ATSIC in the coalition’s first budget, so we are not even back to square one-and this is for the most disadvantaged community in our midst. As we know, expenditure of ATSIC’s budget is not entirely at the discretion of the elected representatives, as is sometimes claimed. The federal government asks ATSIC to guarantee minimum levels of expenditure on its three largest programs: CDEP, CHIP and native title. About two-thirds of ATSIC’s budget is subject to these requirements. They have very little flexibility themselves. This leaves ATSIC with less room to move in funding programs such as indigenous family violence and substance abuse programs, programs which the Howard government has clearly declined to fund despite the increased attention to and need for these funds. We have heard a lot of talk about it. There have been many letters to the newspapers, and successive ministers have talked about the importance of these programs. But the energy and resources going to these areas is small and vanishing compared to the size of the problem-and, not surprisingly, they have no effect. In the last budget only $2 million was allocated to indigenous family violence. This follows cuts to the ATSIC funding in 1996 that led to the termination of family violence programs. I note that, in this year’s budget, only $1.4 million has been allocated for this pressing problem nationally. So we actually have a decline in the allocation this year despite all the publicity that has been given to these problems and the calls from both the wider community and the indigenous community for attention to these matters. I also note that only $470,000 has been allocated to indigenous substance abuse programs through a petrol sniffing diversion pilot project. This is clearly not enough, given the scale of the problem. A series of media reports about petrol sniffing in 2000 initially prompted the federal government to commit a million dollars to address the problem. This money, as is often the case in this area, was not new money. It was reallocated from existing funds that had been given to the Northern Territory government in a deal that allowed the former Country Liberal Party government to keep mandatory sentencing. However, it is feared that even this pitiful amount of money has not been effectively allocated to date. The government put on no pressure to get that allocation. In the Darwin Supreme Court late last week, Justice Steven Bailey pointed out that there are no approved rehabilitation projects operating in the Territory, and no help is available for petrol sniffers who end up in prison. He made the comments while imposing a suspended sentence on an 18-year-old who had committed property offences after petrol sniffing. The young man was directed to attend an unofficial program in his community that, Justice Bailey noted, had mixed success. He was obviously reluctant to do what he had to do. This lack of funds and the demonstrable failure to deal with the huge and growing problems in many communities clearly show that the government, despite its rhetoric, and despite increased calls from all sections of the community, has not given attention and energy to working on reducing these problems. Dysfunctional communities continue to be dysfunctional. There are some suggestions that, in some areas, they are actually getting worse. There is no real remedy in prospect either in this legislation or in the budget that was brought down last night. I note that the minister responsible has devoted very little energy and attention to this section of his portfolio for some time. Indeed, he said to a recent group of lobbyists who attended a meeting with him that he now regarded indigenous affairs as his recreation. It is time for the minister to come back from holidays, if that is the way he sees it, and do some serious work. Wednesday, 15 May 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 2277 If we look closely at this year’s federal budget in other areas of ‘practical reconciliation’the government’s favourite phrase-we can see that there is actually a decrease in funding for indigenous education. That is really a scandal. The Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, which provides funding to education providers for indigenous students, will suffer a decrease of funding in the Northern Territory, for example-we have had recent reports on this problem-of 13.4 per cent. That is a cut of 13.4 per cent to the most disadvantaged group in our community. Nationwide, the decrease is even worse: a staggering 27 per cent cut. So much for practical reconciliation. What is one of the most important areas of service delivery to improve disadvantage? Education. What is the one area the government has cut substantially? Education. Make sense of that. I cannot. This follows a critical report by the Auditor General released late last month which detailed problems in the management of the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program. So the response to those problems is to cut the funds, not to fix the program. The government’s 2001 changes to the program guidelines caused a six-month delay in finalising agreements with some education providers and meant that last year some indigenous students missed out on basic education. So there has been a mismanagement of this program as well. The six-month delay caused a lack of education services to indigenous communities in some parts of the country-indeed, the most remote, the most disadvantaged parts of the country. This information also follows information revealed last year that there was an 8.1 per cent fall in indigenous participation in tertiary education arising from the Howard government’s changes to Abstudy. So across the board we have seen an assault on education at a time when funding is most needed and results should be demanded by the community. It also follows revelations that in 2002 there was a failure of Centrelink to deliver children’s Abstudy, meaning that, for instance, at least 50 teenagers from Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait missed out on the first term of the 2002 school year as they could not travel from their communities to the school. There really is a lack of attention to these matters by the government. The Howard government have now spent six years talking about their commitment to ‘practical reconciliation’-and I put that very much in inverted commas-and continue to trumpet their ‘record spending on indigenous people’. Yet a closer look at the federal budget and, more importantly, the results on the ground show that very little of this money goes directly to assisting indigenous people overcome disadvantages in key areas. In the Social justice report that Bill Jonas released yesterday, he pointed out: The lack of priority and urgency with which governments have pursued indigenous disadvantage ... As he put it-and I think this is an absolutely critical message for this government and others: Redressing indigenous disadvantage is not merely something that is desirable, but is a matter of obligation in order to guarantee a free and equal society. Governments must take deliberate, concrete steps which are targeted as clearly as possible to reducing inequalities as quickly and efficiently as possible through the adoption of benchmarks and targets. We do not know where this government thinks it is headed. We do not know what it hopes to achieve. Little bits of money here and there are dropped into programs which disappear at the end of a pilot program-that is typical, for instance, of the domestic violence programs. And in education there is a winding back funds, and poorer results. So the absence of benchmarks and targets is critical. Dr Jonas goes on to say: Adequate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are necessary in order that governments will be held accountable to do more than simply manage the existing inequalities in society. I think it is instructive that in last night’s budget there was not one word about indigenous people, not one word about the most disadvantaged group in our society, not one word about the first peoples of this nation, not one word about the problems they confront. I think that is shameful for any government. 2278 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 Dr Jonas goes on to talk about these existing inequalities. He says that it is particularly important that we should be reducing these inequalities, setting targets, developing strategies and paying attention, putting some energy into it-Minister, please-where the disadvantage that exists is the consequence of historic, systemic discrimination against a particular group. Until this government gets serious about indigenous affairs and puts in substantial effort-and I mean not just money but energy, motivation, intelligence and creativity, working in partnership with indigenous people and giving effect to its commitment to practical reconciliationthose inequalities will not only continue to exist-they will be ‘managed’, as Bill Jonas puts it-but they will get worse. That is clearly happening around this country. I do not believe that any right-minded Australian can stand by and watch as the first peoples of our country are allowed to slide further and further into despair and dysfunction. That is not to say that there are not indigenous people doing extremely well in Australia today. I welcome that; I applaud that. But that is not sufficient to overshadow the very serious problems that we confront as a nation. Not talking about them is not going to make them go away. I call on the minister and this government to take indigenous affairs seriously. Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2002. The amendments have been well defined. They include adjustments to the term of office of the commission chair and the regional council chair, a provision for the appointment of an additional regional councillor to a regional council from which a commissioner has been elected, a provision to guarantee the appointment of an independent chair of the review panel-and I heard the concerns raised by the member for Fremantle about that. The amendments clarify that the effect of penalties for multiple criminal convictions on eligibility for, and termination of, office holder positions is the same as penalties for single convictions; they allow the outgoing commissioner to stand for election as an incoming regional council chair without having to resign as commissioner. There are a number of other issues which seem practical and reasonable in terms of the progression of ATSIC so that it can function as well as it can. In terms of the focus of this government on health, housing, education and employment issues, I believe there has been significant progress for Aboriginal people and for the country as a whole. When this government came to office, we had a totally confused mess with native title. Through the efforts of this government, we have been able to create a balance. We no longer see these emotive, chaotic situations in the media and with a number of Aboriginal groups. Let us remember that it was competition between Aboriginal groups that was at the heart of much of the problem with native title. The program that this government introduced did bring order and some common sense for all parties. If there is still some difficulty with legal issues, much of it must rest with the Labor Party and the Senate. There were opportunities to reduce the problems with much of the legal situation, had at least two of the points that were disallowed at that time been allowed to go through. If it is costing $33 million in native title litigation, let the opposition carry much of the responsibility for that. It is all very well to talk about mediation. It is all very well to talk about the well-being of Aboriginal people. But in this place we have a responsibility to be practical, to face the reality, and know that there has not been sufficient progress, for a whole lot of reasons, on the general issue of Aboriginal well-being. I bring to the attention of the Main Committee, for those who may not have seen it, an article in the Australian of Thursday, 9 May 2002, headed ‘Pearson puts the challenge to Labor’. He talks about a number of issues. He refers to Don Watson’s book, Recollections of a Bleeding Heart: A Portrait of Paul Keating PM. The writer endeavours to come forward with some of the Pearson commentary on our contemporary situation. I think it should be compulsory reading for every member of this parliament.

A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.25 a.m. to 10.42 a.m. welfare and for not confronting the real issues of addiction. These are the very sad and real circumstances of too many people in Aboriginal communities and these things should be the main purpose of this parliament’s focus in the immediate future. Academic debate about the past and about the general indiscretions of one side of politics or the other will not advance this issue at the rate at which it should be advancing. This Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill is just another small contribution to the improvements in the various structures that are there and which in all good faith have been set up for Aboriginal people. As the member for Werriwa said not so many weeks ago, I hope in the future in this place that we stand aside from our partisan differences and focus on those things that we really must do to advance this issue. his contribution, and also acknowledge the contribution made by the shadow minister, the member for Fremantle-and I will refer to that in detail in a moment. I was hoping the member for Grey would speak for a bit longer, to allow me to organise myself. You will have to excuse me while I do so on the run. As others have pointed out, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2002 will implement some of the recommendations of the 1998 review of the operation of the ATSIC Act that was conducted in accordance with section 26 of the actnamely, to ensure that a commission chair remains in place between the appointment of new commissioners, following a round of regional council elections and the first meeting of a new board; to enable an additional regional councillor to be appointed to a regional council from which a commissioner is elected; to allow an outgoing commissioner to stand for election as an incoming regional council chair without having to resign as commissioner; to allow for an independent chair of the section 141 review panel and the augmented review panel; and to clarify that a person who has been given one sentence for multiple criminal offences can be suspended from office and disqualified from standing for election as a regional councillor or The bill seeks to implement a number of recommendations of the 1997 review panel report made under section 141 of the ATSIC Act on the ATSIC electoral system and boundaries. I will not repeat them, because they were mentioned earlier. It allows for the clarification and enhancement of the commissioner’s processes for internal review of certain decisions, and it outlines three major points. It prevents a commissioner or regional councillor who has been removed from office for misbehaviour from standing for the next round of regional council elections, and it makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the ATSIC Act. These include amending relevant financial provisions to ensure consistency with the Commonwealth accrual budgeting system, the removal of references to appropriations by the commission to Indigenous Business Australia and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, as money is now directly appropriated to these organisations; and repealing redundant provisions of the ATSIC Act. I want to concentrate on one element of this bill-issues dealing with governance. As the shadow minister said, this government has promoted this bill as giving effect to recommendations arising from the section 26 review that it received in 1998. The fact is, as the shadow minister pointed out, that most of these recommendations for legislative change remain unimplemented. They include a long list of changes which the section 26 review characterised as administrative and legal problems, as well as a suite of proposals which the review authors",136,Representatives Main Committee

257,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (10.44 A.m.),"I thank my colleague the member for Grey for2280 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 called ‘substantive changes to the act to improve its operation to strengthen ATSIC’s capacity to address the aspirations and needs of indigenous people over the next five years and beyond’. These substantive issues include the explicit capacity of regional councils to make regional agreements, direct election of commissioners and facilitating greater regional autonomy for regional authorities. It is that issue that I want to talk about. We have heard a lot in recent times about the issue of passive welfare. Indeed, we have heard the government at various times rail against the inadequacy of service provisions to Aboriginal communities. We have seen them shift the way in which welfare has been provided and continue in a direction to make individuals much more responsible for their actions in terms of receiving government benefits of one type or another. It is worthwhile also to point out that much has been said about issues dealing with family violence, substance abuse and other matters to do with indigenous affairs. We know that in this budget very limited attempts have been made to address these issues, despite the issues to do with passive welfare, the indicators of alienation and anomie in Aboriginal communities which are so explicit in terms of the justice system, the expressions of discontent which are clearly obvious in the way in which communities in some areas are malfunctioning, and the problems which are evident in terms of domestic violence and substance abuse. Under those circumstances, and given the criticism which has been railed against indigenous Australians and Torres Strait Islanders generally, you would expect that something substantial would have been done by this government in this recent budget. In fact, very little has been done in the budget to express the government’s will-as we often hear it-to address these issues of major concern. In the budget only $2 million was allocated to deal with the problem of indigenous family violence. That $2 million was allocated last year; this year only $1.4 million has been allocated to this pressing problem. It is acknowledged by people in indigenous communities around Australia, acknowledged by state and territory governments and reported on by the government when it sees fit to demonise Aboriginal communities, yet all the government can bring itself to provide to address this issue in this budget is $1.4 million. I ask the government to tell us explicitly where this money will be used and how it will be used. What are the issues it will seek to address? I then look to the issue of substance abuse. Bear in mind that I have had a lot of experience in indigenous communities across Australia for over 25 years. I have a very good idea about the level of concern in relation to substance abuse which is expressed in indigenous communities. You need to be very careful because you would be led to believe, if you listened to some commentators, that substance abuse was endemic in every Aboriginal community across Australia, which of course is not the case. Indeed, we ought to understand that, in terms of per capita alcohol consumption in the Northern Territory, Aboriginal Territorians consume less alcohol than non-indigenous Territorians do. We also need to understand is that a far greater proportion of Aboriginal Territorians, Aboriginal Australians, do not drink, as opposed to their non-indigenous counterparts. That is not often said, but it is a fact. Then there is the issue of other substances which are being abused. Marijuana abuse, kava abuse and petrol sniffing are issues which are now chronic across some parts of northern Australia. They are all real problems, but petrol sniffing is a significant issue for juvenile indigenous Australians. It is endemic in some Aboriginal communities. We have heard the government say that this is something which we must address, something we are gravely concerned about, an issue which we must do something about, yet all the government can bring itself to offer in this budget to address this issue is $470,000. What will that do to address the issue of substance abuse generally, but petrol sniffing in particular? The answer is not a lot. We also need to comprehend, and I want to raise, this issue of passive welfare receipt in indigenous communities. I have heard some indigenous commentators talk about this as though indigenous communities across Australia are not aware of the concerns of those in their comWednesday, 15 May 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 2281 munities about domestic violence, substance abuse and issues to do with the justice system generally. That is not the case. There are many examples where indigenous communities, particularly in the Northern Territory, are seeking to address the issue of substance abuse through actions which they are taking. I was privileged to attend the recent conference on indigenous governance held in Canberra under the auspices of, I think, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and it was a very important and good conference. One of the contributions made at that conference was from two women from Ali Curung. Most people in the House will not know where Ali Curung is. Ali Curung is a community to the north of Alice Springs. These women demonstrated how their community had come to terms with the dysfunction caused by domestic violence and alcohol and other substance abuse. They demonstrated how they had developed their own mechanisms for community operations, in conjunction with the Western legal system, to address these issues. Those two women are now able to proselytise. They can show other people around the Northern Territory and, indeed, around Australia-as was the case at the conference on governance-that there are remedies which can be developed, within Aboriginal community structures and traditional frameworks, to address the imposition that is put on indigenous communities by substance abuse, domestic violence and other abuses of the justice system. It is worth noting that the system of night patrols was developed by indigenous people, not imposed from outside, as a response to the concerns about the social dysfunction being caused by alcohol abuse and violence. The remedies are being developed by Aboriginal communities; they are not passive welfare recipients. They are actively engaged in trying to find remedies for the problems which they have in their communities, which are observed by outsiders such as ourselves and which are commented on from time to time by the government and demonised by particular sections of the community. We have to understand that, if we are prepared to sit down and work with communities, wherever they might be, we can develop solutions, but such solutions do require resources. Last night’s budget did little in terms of the provision of resources for these issues across Australia. I will give you another example of how communities in Central Australia are responding to the issue of alcohol. The Central Australian Football League-the AFL based in Alice Springs-recently had a day when they sat down and talked about their future. They got Aboriginal communities from around Central Australia to come in, participate in a discussion and give their views on what the way forward might be. As a result of this discussion, two subcommittees have been set up-I am a member of one-to deal with alcohol. There is a proposal now which has come from these communities to ban the sale of alcohol at football games. This proposal has not been imposed; it is action which has come from within these communities. I want to commend the Central Australian Football League for having the guts to sit down and say, ‘How can we address what is a severe problem for us during weekend football?’ They have come up with a proposition that says, ‘We are prepared to ban alcohol at the request of these communities.’ We do not get a lot of acknowledgment from government for those sorts of actions that have come from within the community. The other issue that I want to briefly address is that of governance generally. I referred earlier to the failure of the government to pick up on the issue to do with regional agreements and regional authorities. It is worthwhile noting that, in the background paper for the indigenous governance conference in April of this year, the following was said: Good governance involves four main attributes: legitimacy, power, resources and accountability. The importance of indigenous governance is highlighted by the growing community dysfunction, domestic violence, welfare dependence and economic marginalisation. 2282 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 That is all true. But what we need to understand is that communities have responded. And because the government has failed to come up with any appropriate responses to the recommendations on regional authorities and regional structures, indigenous communities are doing it themselves. They are coming together and saying, ‘We want to express the service delivery to us in a different manner. We want to take control of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.’ In the western MacDonnell region of Central Australia, the communities have come together and said that they want to start making agreements with government on the delivery of services such as education, health, housing, roads and other government services. They are doing this independently of government support. They are doing this because they see it as important. They are developing these models despite government. Mr Deputy Speaker, I want you to understand that I have been an active promoter of these agreements and ideas since the early 1990s. Indeed, I have written a couple of publications on the issue of regional governance and regional agreements. What comes out of it is the inherent need to recognise that, despite the rhetoric about indigenous Australians being passive welfare recipients, there are many examples of indigenous communities around Australia coming together and saying, ‘We want to do things differently and you, government, need to deal with us differently. What we want to do is set up agreements with you about the provision of services.’ This has provided some difficulty for some organisations; indeed, the previous Northern Territory government found it very difficult to come to terms with the aspirations of indigenous Australians in this way. While I did say a moment ago that government was not involved, there are in fact a couple of examples where government has been involved, where models of governance have been set up as a result of initiatives for the delivery of certain services. The most obvious example is the delivery of health services. To the west of Katherine there has been the development of the Katherine West Health Board, which arose out of the coordinated care trials introduced by the Keating government in 1995-96. The delivery of all health services in the Katherine West region now go through an Aboriginal controlled board, and it works very well. I want to acknowledge the previous federal minister for health for his continued support for this proposal. The Tiwi Health Board is another example. But this initiative has not broadened in the way in which we need it to broaden. It has not broadened in such a way that other agencies, such as education departments, see it as their responsibility to bring communities together and discuss with them ownership of the service delivery which they provide. I also make this observation: in the context of indigenous communities, it is easy to take a cheap shot, but the bottom line is that unless we provide people with appropriate resources and infrastructure, they will not be able to achieve the objectives that we set for them. As well as people having aspirations for more control over their services, we need to ensure that they have got the capacity to exercise that control. That brings us back to the fundamental issue of education. What we have seen historically in Australia is an abysmal failure by governments collectively, Labor and non-Labor governments, across Australia, to deal effectively with indigenous education. People are not going to be able, fruitfully and appropriately, to accord with our requirements in terms of responsibility and accountability unless we provide them with the capacity to do so. There is a fundamental issue there-that is, the question of education. I note that in last night’s budget there were no additional resources made available for indigenous education across Australia. Indeed, in the area of the Northern Territory, we saw an effective 13.4 per cent cut to the ISIP program for Aboriginal Australians in the Northern Territory. Part of the reason for that, I am told, was the incapacity of the previous CLP government to be able to come to an agreement with the Howard government over the requirements for reporting on that issue. But instead of lambasting Aboriginal communities, we should be acting responsibly and accepting our need to be partners. (Time expired) Wednesday, 15 May 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 2283 Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (11.04 a.m.)-I would like to sum up the debate that has taken place on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2002. This bill contains a series of technical amendments that we believe need to be put in place, but behind those technical amendments is this government’s most urgent desire to see our indigenous communities significantly advance beyond their experience of the last 200 years. Mr Deputy Speaker, when I elaborate on some of the points that have been made by the member for Lingiari and the member for Fremantle, you will see that we have heard a lot of unfortunate misunderstandings, or perhaps it was just misleading information, about what was contained in the budget last night. In particular, I will refer to some of the very significant advances we have made in trying to support and work with indigenous communities across Australia. Let me begin by revisiting exactly what this amendment bill chooses to do. The amendments follow a number of recommendations from the 1997 and 1998 reviews, conducted under sections 26 and 141 of the ATSIC Act, in regard to the electoral systems and boundaries and the general operation of the ATSIC Act. The bill was developed in close consultation with portant point. The amendments contained in the bill relate largely to provisions in the ATSIC Act affecting the elected statutory office holders of ATSIC. ATSIC regional council and office holder elections must take place in the second half of 2002. The amendments that are proposed in the bill would permit greater certainty in regard to the position of the current office holders and eligibility for election. These amendments include: adjustments to the term of office of the commission chair and the regional council chair to provide for continuity in these offices throughout an election period; a provision for the appointment of an additional regional councillor to a regional council from which a commissioner has been elected; a provision to guarantee the appointment of an independent chair of the review panel and the augmented review panel to clarify that the effective penalties for multiple criminal convictions on eligibility for and termination of office holder positions is the same as for single convictions; allowing an outgoing commissioner to stand for election as an incoming regional council chair without having to resign as commissioner; providing for the payment of nomination fees by candidates to be included as matters dealt with in the regional council election rules; and preventing a commissioner or regional councillor who has been removed from office for misbehaviour from standing for the next round of regional council elections. In addition, the bill seeks to amend certain provisions of the ATSIC Act relating to financial management within the commission. Accrual accounting has been introduced in accordance with government policy, and a number of amendments are required to make the ATSIC Act consistent with current practice. The bill aligns the terminology of the ATSIC Act with the Commonwealth accrual based outcomes and outputs framework. In addition, with the introduction of accrual budgeting, each agency is appropriated its own money. As such, the bill removes references to appropriations by ATSIC to Indigenous Business Australia and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. The bill also repeals certain provisions of the ATSIC Act which are no longer required. Finally, the bill will allow clarification and enhancement of the internal review process. Amendments will entitle a body corporate or an unincorporated body to request review by the commission and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision to refuse a loan or guarantee made under the ATSIC Act. At present the ATSIC Act only allows for review of decisions in relation to an individual. The bill will enable the commission to delegate its power to review delegates’ decisions, allowing for a more efficient reconsideration of refusal to provide a loan or guarantee within ATSIC. In order to allow a comprehensive internal review process, 2284 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 the bill will require internal review processes to be exhausted before access to review by the AAT of the merits of a decision to refuse a loan or guarantee. The member for Fremantle did, in fact, raise an issue requiring us to make a consequential amendment. She referred to section 141T, which relates to the commission chairperson to be chairperson of an augmented review panel. We undertake to arrange for an appropriate amendment for consideration by the Senate to clear up that particular point. The member for Fremantle-who is also shadow spokesperson for indigenous affairshowever, made a series of allegations about the Howard government’s commitment to indigenous program expenditure. Contrary to what the member for Fremantle actually claims, there is an additional $67 million in funding for 2002-03, and this includes over $20 million for shadow spokesperson had not gone beyond listening to the budget speech last night-which, of course, is always skeletal in its coverage of details-or whether her calculator batteries are flat, we cannot be sure. It seems that the same problem has afflicted the member for Lingiari, who went on at length about his perception of reduced expenditure commitment to indigenous affairs in this country. Our government absolutely does not believe that dollars are everything when it comes to improving the circumstances of indigenous peoples in this country. It will require much more than simply dollars for programs. We are working on a number of fronts-for example, our objective of reconciliation plans for every government agency that the Commonwealth manages. This is a first for the nation of Australia. Our government is insisting that every government agency each year reflect on how its programs have assisted our indigenous Australians. But, of course, dollars are significant. There has been $2.5 billion of specific funding provided for indigenous programs in 200203. We will publish a detailed breakdown of that funding. The bulk of this goes to health, housing, education and employment. We are absolutely concerned that indigenous Australians are not hooked into a life of welfare and an intergenerational succession of unemployed, leading to children and grandchildren who never know the dignity of paid employment. We are determined to assist our Aboriginal communities to break out of their poverty traps. Unfortunately, what we inherited in 1996 was a hugely unproductive set of programs for indigenous Australia. You just have to compare the education outcomes of indigenous peoples with those of mainstream Australia to see how we have improved those. We were entangled in a very destructive native title debate in 1995-96 which took a lot of work. There have been significant dollars associated with the legal costs in untangling that mess. When the Keating government lost power it had a series of reforms and amendments in train in terms of reviewing the native title law in this country, and it understood what we had to do. The shadow minister said that indigenous education funding, in particular, had been cut. I take great exception to that as someone who has worked with indigenous communities most of my life, especially in Aboriginal education. Let me stress that we have increased indigenous education funding from $438 million in 2001-02 to over $445 million in 2002-03. The member for Lingiari went on at some length about domestic violence in indigenous communities. Of course, that is an extraordinary concern for women and children and all members of indigenous communities as much as for other families in Australian society when there is anyone subjected to domestic violence. This is a priority for our government, which provided for Partnerships Against Domestic Violence, a special national program; $10 million is specifically dedicated to Aboriginal projects. There are also funds for related projects. There is $20 million for the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy and $23 million for alcohol related projects specifically for indigenous communities who have substance abuse problems in their local populations. We are Wednesday, 15 May 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 2285 making headway. Unlike the previous government, which was satisfied simply with rhetoric, we also measure our performance. We look to see if our programs work. We evaluate what we are doing to see if we have got it right and if there are better ways to achieve outcomes. We talk to the communities and ask them what they feel is the best way to deliver programs. Let me give the statistics. The proportion of students going on to year 12 has increased from 29 per cent in 1996, after all of our efforts, to over 36 per cent in the year 2001. We know that the basis of breaking the poverty trap in Australia is education, so that is probably one of the most significant statistics for indigenous communities that this nation has seen. I am proud that our government has presided over that change. The numbers of indigenous people in vocational education have doubled since 1995. In the year 2000, over 7,000 indigenous people were in higher education compared to only 2,000 in 1987. In the year 2001, 6,000 were in new apprenticeships. That is a very substantial number. Compare that with only 800 in 1994-unfortunately the time when Labor was supposedly doing something for the indigenous communities, but obviously not enough. There are so many other positive results, but to me one of the most significant is that we have a strong partnership with indigenous communities. The member for Fremantle appeared to be amazed that there was a budget item against the defence forces referring to indigenous expenditure, showing that there was some Defence Force expenditure on indigenous programs. I seem to remember that the member for Fremantle was most concerned that the Army was going to assist indigenous communities. We now know that that has been one of the most successful programs ever. Australian Defence Force personnel go out into indigenous communities, sit down beside the elders and work out what needs to be done to improve infrastructure-whether it is dust supression, building sewerage systems or roads. The program picks up the young members of those communities to work in trades with members of the armed forces. At the end of the day you have trained people, and great friendships are formed-networks which last for life-which is an extraordinarily good outcome. SoI remind the shadow minister that she needs to look beyond the headlines. I would have thought better of her after her many years in parliament but it seems that she is still very much hooked on what she can get in terms of a quick political grab rather than on the substance of what is going on in indigenous Australia today. The Howard government has particularly requested the conduct of a Commonwealth Grants Commission inquiry into indigenous-specific funding. That goes back to the comment I made before about how we do not simply have rhetorical debate about the indigenous situation in Australia; we actually want to know if our programs work. We want to know where the best place is to put funding. We are now considering the commission’s response to that report, and we will respond soon. I urge the opposition to have a good, hard look at that. They might learn where they went wrong for all those years when conditions for indigenous Australians were deteriorating, not improving, across this huge country. I have already referred to the problem of family violence for some indigenous communities. I am very pleased that the member for Lingiari had a good experience and gained a better understanding of family violence when he attended the Reconciliation Australia conference on governance, which was held here. That conference was put together and strongly supported by the Commonwealth government. I am pleased that he learned a little from it. The issue of violence against indigenous women and children is of the utmost concern to our government. We have allocated approximately $10 million since 1997 for a range of indigenous projects as part of our national Partnerships Against Domestic Violence programs. We are establishing an Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation, with funding of $115 million over four years, and $23 million of that funding is specifically for indigenous Australians. The member for Lingiari makes a pertinent point that there are more dry communities and less alcohol consumption amongst Northern Territory indigenous communities and 2286 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 individuals than amongst non-indigenous communities. He often makes that statement, and that is where he leaves it. Our government knows that substance abuse and alcohol consumption are a major concern in many indigenous communities. We have specifically targeted $253 million-a significant amount-at indigenous communities so they can look at programs to help themselves. So despite the fact that addressing domestic violence is a state and territory government responsibility-that is what the Constitution determined 100 years ago-the federal government is committed to assisting indigenous Australians break out of the cycle of violence which afflicts them. This includes providing preventative services to address problems of alcohol and substance abuse, and assisting people to maintain healthy and constructive family relationships. I will end by saying again that the amendments to this act are urgent. They are technical amendments, but behind them lie the heart and soul of a government determined to see that our indigenous Australians have a better life experience than they had in the first 200 years after we colonised this country. No-one is more determined than the Howard government to try and recognise, both in a symbolic way and in a practical way, what needs to be done so that every young Australian, whether they are born to an indigenous or a non-indigenous family, reaches their full potential, stands proud as an Australian and if they need extra support will receive that support in a way that is absolutely right for their cultural perspective and where they live in our great Australian landscape. I commend these amendments and this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed. Second Reading stration) (11.21 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I rise today to introduce a bill that has already passed through the other place.

The extension of the sunset clause was announced by the then Minister for Financial Services and Regulation in August last year. The existing concession is provided for in the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993; however this concession expired on 30 June 2001. The extension will apply from 1 July 2001 to maintain continuity in the application of the sunset clause and to prevent ambiguity in interpreting the status of transfers since 30 June 2001. Passage of the bill will also extend the deadline to effect any subsequent transfer of assets and liabilities from 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2006.

There is strong support from the banking industry-including the International Banks and Securities Association of Australia, IBSA, and Australian Banking Association, ABA, members-for the bill to be passed as soon as possible in order to give foreign banks comfort in arranging their regulatory status following introduction of the thin capitalisation regime from 1 July this year.

Passage of the bill is consistent with promoting Australia as a centre for global financial services and will enhance its standing amongst the international business community. I commend the bill to the chamber and present the related explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for a second reading debate to continue forthwith. (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Amendment Bill 2002. The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 allows foreign banks obtaining a banking authority to be eligible for concessional tax treatment when transferring assets and liabilities. This bill amends to extend the sunset clause contained in the act from 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2003. The bill also extends the deadline to affect any subsequent transfer of assets and liabilities from 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2006. Labor supports the bill. The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 was enacted under the Keating Labor government to remove disincentives to foreign banks restructuring their operations in Australia. This reflected the then government’s decision to liberalise foreign bank entry into Australia and to allow foreign banks to apply to establish an authorised branch in Australia to conduct wholesale banking business. Labor’s deregulation of financial markets at that time greatly benefited the development of Australia’s financial market and the modern economy. The act helped foreign banks to restructure their operations by enabling certain taxes and charges to be waived on the transfer of assets and liabilities, including tax losses, when a foreign bank subsidiary changed to a branch structure. The changes were also designed to ensure that foreign bank subsidiaries which set up before 18 June 1993 and which wanted to convert to a branch structure were not disadvantaged compared with new foreign bank branches. A deadline of three years was initially provided in order to be eligible for concessional tax treatment when transferring assets and liabilities. That deadline has already been extended and the existing deadline expired on 30 June 2001. The further extension proposed in this bill will apply from 1 July 2001 to maintain continuity in the application of the sunset clause and to prevent ambiguity in interpreting the status of transfers since 30 June 2001. Labor understands that when the sunset clause expired on 30 June 2001 there was confusion in the industry due to the uncertain impact of unresolved tax issues relating to thin capitalisation legislation and consolidation legislation. This resulted in foreign banks being uncertain about the appropriate structure for their operations in Australia. Passage of this bill will enable foreign banks to structure their operations with a clearer understanding of the tax regime. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration mentioned, the International Banks and Securities Association of Australia, the Australian Banking Association and APRA support the bill. Labor has always supported allowing financial institutions to restructure to more appropriate structures, as this should provide lower cost banking services to Australian firms.

259,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (11.25 A.m.),"I rise to speak today on the Financial Corporations2288 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 opened up the economy in the 1980s. Labor specifically provided for the entry of foreign banks into Australia. Labor introduced the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill in 1993. Labor continues to support that initiative. While the opposition supports the policy intent of this bill, we are concerned at the lack of transparency regarding the costings accompanying the bill. The explanatory memorandum provides only a single line-‘It is not envisaged that the bill will have a financial impact on the operations of government’-which is far from clear. As I indicated earlier, the significant economic and financial reforms undertaken in the 1980s-the floating of the dollar, the deregulation of the financial market and the simplification of the Corporations Law-have established the framework for the Australian economy and financial market to be internationally competitive. They have led to a more responsive economy and a more vibrant financial sector. Labor remains totally committed to that position. Accordingly, we support this bill, and I commend it to the House. wrote: Bankers are just like anybody else, except richer. Perhaps that is because, as Robert Frost said, a bank is a place where they lend you an umbrella in fair weather and ask for it back again when it begins to rain. The legislation that is currently before the committee, the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Amendment Bill 2002, is important because it reinforces the beneficial impact of the 1993 legislation referred to by the parliamentary secretary in introducing the legislation and because our banking system is essential to our neo-capitalist system and those who operate business and domestic accounts. Although banks are not everybody’s favourite organisations at the moment, the fact is that competition can only increase the better delivery of services and the better performance by the banks that are in the marketplace. This bill amends the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 to extend the sunset clause from 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2003 for foreign banks obtaining a banking authority in order to be eligible for concesssional tax treatment when transferring assets and liabilities. It also extends the deadline to affect any subsequent transfer of assets and liabilities from 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2006. The foreign banks operating in Australia will benefit from the amendment. On the face of it, the amendment extends the sunset clause in an uncontroversial way. In effect, it continues the operation of law as it is generally understood. It will give comfort to the foreign investment banking community by allowing continuity of business activities and it will result in positive flow-on effects to the Australian economy and employment levels. It is, as we have already heard, receiving the full support of the opposition, and industry as well supports the amendments. Amongst others, the Australian Bankers Association has indicated support, as has the International Banks and Securities Association of Australia, some of whose representatives I was pleased to meet here in the House last night following the delivery of the budget by the Treasurer. The passage of the bill is also supported by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the prudential regulator of banking in Australia. When the Hawke government allowed the entry of foreign banks in 1985 it required them to be established as locally incorporated subsidiaries rather than as branches of the parent bank. In 1991, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration recommended that, subject to meeting certain matters, including prudential requirements, foreign banks should be allowed to operate in Australia as branches. The prime benefit of such a move was said to be the possibility of increased competition in the banking industry. The committee, at that time, was reported to have stated:",145,Representatives Main Committee
260,Mr King (Wentworth) (11.29 A.m.),"In his poem I’m a Stranger Here Myself Ogden NashWednesday, 15 May 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 2289 By having a broader capital base and improved fund raising capabilities it is evident that a branch of a foreign bank would be in a far better position than a foreign bank subsidiary to compete against the incumbent domestic banks. In 1992, the previous government decided to allow foreign banks to operate as retail banks in the form of a branch. Following those decisions, foreign banks had to determine whether they wanted to change the structure of their operations in Australia by converting subsidiaries to branches and the transfer act was intended to facilitate the reorganisation of business by bestowing concessional tax treatment on the transfer of assets and liabilities from a subsidiary to a foreign corporation, known as an eligible foreign ADI or authorised deposit institution. One of the problems that arose was that ADIs had been authorised under the Banking Act to conduct banking business in Australia and had received authority from 1993 pursuant to an application made, so long as it was made under the previous legislation before 1 July 2001. The issue that arises is whether or not there is a strong case for the amendment. I strongly support the legislation. As at February 2002-indeed, my latest information, dated 15 April 2002, from a search of the APRA web site indicates this-there are 12 foreign subsidiary banks operating in Australia. There are 24 branches of foreign banks, whilst there are only some 17 Australian-owned banks authorised by APRA to utilise the name ‘bank’ in their title and to conduct banking operations pursuant to the Banking Act but in accordance with the authorities that only APRA can issue. In that context, it is obviously important, therefore, to ensure that the foreign banks have a relatively even playing field in terms of competing with a local bank so as to ensure that the best outcomes for the Australian community, both business and domestic, in respect of banking arrangements are available to it. The government introduced the bill to extend the deadline for concessional tax treatment. It stated at the time-and I am now referring to the second reading speech in the other placethat the extension was appropriate given that, when the eligibility period expired on 1 July 2001, there was uncertainty in the industry about changes to the thin capitalisation rules and the consolidation regime which made it difficult for foreign banks to determine the appropriate structure of their operations. New thin capitalisation rules were introduced by the New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Act 2001. It may be of some assistance and interest if I briefly refer to thin capitalisation rules. They were discussed in some detail in the Ralph report in July 1999. In effect, thin capitalisation refers to the rules which apply to limit the interest deductions available to an Australian entity which is foreign controlled and which has an overseas debt to equity ratio in excess of that permitted. A major function of the thin capitalisation rules is to prevent multinational corporations from so organising their debt to equity ratios that they may claim a maximum interest deduction in Australia in excess of what they would otherwise do if their capital was fairly allocated in respect of their Australian operations. Those rules were examined as part of the Ralph report and that report noted that a major function of them was to prevent multinational corporations from organising their financial affairs to exploit the Australian tax system. One of the comments in the report was this: Australia’s current thin capitalisation provisions are not fully effective at preventing an excessive allocation of debt to the Australian operations of multinationals because they refer only to foreign related party debt and foreign debt covered by a formal guarantee rather than total debt. Hence they do not restrict the proportion of third-party debt that can be allocated to the Australian operations. As a result of those findings, the Ralph report made certain recommendations regarding thin capitalisation rules which were subsequently incorporated in legislation, which has been referred to. The case for the amendment also relies to some extent upon the importance of a consolidation regime being brought down in due course. The Treasurer has stated that that will commence on 1 July 2002, although it does not appear that legislation to that effect facilitating 2290 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 May 2002 those changes has yet been fully brought forward. It is likely, however, that foreign banks will continue to be uncertain about their appropriate structure until that regime is finalised, but it can be anticipated that this legislation is an important and significant advance in that whole process. It is important to the whole community that we have a strong banking system and that it is competitive. Australian taxpayers, consumers and banking customers want a strong banking system. They want a competitive banking system. They want to be sure that we have not only a strong banking system-which we clearly have at the moment and our big four appear to be doing better than ever-but that the big four are accountable, because we have a competitive environment to ensure that we get the best outcome for businesses and domestic customers in this country. I therefore support the legislation. stration) (11.40 a.m.)-in reply-The government does quite sincerely appreciate the support by the opposition for the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Amendment Bill 2002 and also the speeches made by the honourable member for Bruce and by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Wentworth. The passage of the bill that I have introduced today will provide lower transitional costs for those foreign bank subsidiaries that change to a branch structure. A change to a branch structure will allow these banks to conduct their business with a more efficient operating structure and will provide a consumer protection benefit because foreign banks operating with a branch structure will have to comply with a greater range of prudential requirements than does a subsidiary. There has been some speculation about concern in relation to the lack of quantification of the tax revenue impact. If foreign banks do not receive the concession, they are likely to not restructure and to be forced to keep an inefficient higher cost structure. This may then cause the foreign banks to leave this country, resulting in a loss of services, employment, economic benefits and competition. Having foreign banks here-and I mention this as an aside-also brings in much needed revenue. When the member for Bruce spoke, he highlighted certain economic reforms of the former Hawke and Keating governments. The government does in fact recognise that there were economic reforms. What is eminently regrettable, however, is that the opposition, under its current leadership, seems to be marching back to the past insofar as the flexibilities, which we saw with the former Hawke and Keating governments, seem to have evaporated with many of the policy announcements and stances being taken by the troglodytes who currently comprise the opposition in this place. The financial corporations bill will enable a smooth continuation of business activities, with beneficial effects to the Australian economy and employment levels. In addition, the bill is consistent with promoting this nation as a centre for global financial services and will enhance Australia’s standing amongst the international business community.

The Committee is required to take into account a number of criteria in evaluating applications for PBS subsidy, including the medical conditions for which a medicine has been approved for use in Australia and its medical effectiveness, cost effectiveness and safety compared with other treatments. SERC tablets have been marketed in Australia for many years. Inclusion of SERC on the PBS for the treatment of Meniere’s disease has been considered by the PBAC in the past and also more recently since the introduction of a higher strength SERC formulation.

Due to the non-specific nature of attendance items it is not possible to provide statistics on the number of Consultant Psychiatrist, GP and OMP services rendered for the treatment of (a) Depression in all its forms and (b) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as the items encompass all clinically relevant attendances in the treatment of a range of conditions including psychiatric consultations. The figures listed below include only those services that are performed by a registered provider who is a Consultant Physician in the specialty of Psychiatry, for services that qualify for Medicare benefit and for which a claim has been processed by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC). They do not include services provided by hospital doctors to public patients in public hospitals, services as a result of compensation or insurance claim, or services that qualify for a benefit under the Department of Veterans’ Affairs National Treatment Account.

(3) Medicare benefits are only payable for “clinically relevant” services as defined under Section3 of the Health Insurance Act 1973. A clinically relevant service is defined as a service rendered by a medical or dental practitioner or an optometrist that is generally accepted in the medical, dental or optometrical profession (as the case may be) as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient to whom it is rendered. Therefore, the HIC can only pay Medicare benefits on the basis of the doctor’s judgement that the service is a clinically relevant service and compliant with State/Territory regulations. Non-clinically relevant services might include medical treatments or non-medical treatments for psychiatric conditions that are yet to be proved efficacious. (4) The Medicare Benefits Consultative Committee (MBCC) is an informal advisory committee established by agreement between the Minister and the Australian Medical Association (AMA). The MBCC consists of representatives of the Department, the HIC, the AMA and relevant craft groups of the medical profession. The major function undertaken by the MBCC is the review of particular services or groups of services within the MBS, including consideration of appropriate fee levels. In addition, the Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) was established in April 1998 to advise the Minister on the strength of evidence relating to the safety, effectiveness and costeffectiveness of new and emerging medical services and technologies and under what circumstances public funding, including listing on the MBS, should be supported. Veterans: British Nuclear Tests (Question No. 68) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: Further to part (2) of the answer by the former Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to question No. 2548 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29189), has the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency obtained international research regarding the possible effects of exposure to ionising radiation and made this information available to those affected by the British nuclear tests; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) continually monitors international research and publications on the effects to humans of exposure to ionizing radiation. There have been no significant changes to the understanding of these effects since 1986 when a detailed review of the survivors of the atomic weapons tests in Japan was undertaken. The most recent review of the available research on the effects of ionizing radiation on humans is presented in detail in the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, UNSCEAR 2000 Report to the General Assembly, with Scientific Annexes. Australia, as this is the responsibility of the Department of Veterans Affairs. ARPANSA provides information regarding ionizing radiation effects to the Department of Veterans Affairs through participation on inter-departmental committees and through direct contact with officers of the Department.",150,Questions On Notice
265,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer toHealth: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Question No. 70) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) How many reviews has the pharmaceutical firm Schering-Plough Pty Limited submitted to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) for the therapeutic drug REMICADE, used in the treatment of Crohn’s disease, to be included on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). (2) How many Australians are diagnosed as suffering from Crohn’s disease. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether REMICADE is available in the US and members of the European Union. (4) Was REMICADE accorded priority review around the world by health authorities, including the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. (5) Was REMICADE awarded two awards in France in 2000. (6) Is the Minister able to say whether REMICADE is designated an orphan drug in the US. (7) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to reports in the Sydney Morning Herald of Monday, 22 October 2001, which reported that the Minister had overruled a PBAC decision to reimburse Herceptin, however, that same decision has not been forthcoming for REMICADE. (8) Why did the Minister not overrule the PBAC on its decision for REMICADE. (9) Will the Minister permit REMICADE to be covered by the PBS and implemented in similar fashion to that of Herceptin. (10) What is the cost of Herceptin per patient. (11) What is the estimated cost of REMICADE per patient. the honourable member’s question: (1) Three applications for listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) have been made for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in patients who have an inadequate response to conventional therapies (June 2000, December 2000 and September 2001). Two applications have been made for the treatment of draining enterocutaneous fistulising Crohn’s disease (December 2000 and September 2001). (2) Approximately 10, 000. About 10% of these would suffer the severity of the disease that would enable them to receive REMICADE (infliximab) in the indications approved by the Therapeutics Goods Administration for registration and the proposed restrictions for PBS listing. (3) REMICADE is approved for marketing in the US and the European Union. (4) Yes. (5) Yes. (6) Yes. REMICADE is designated as an orphan drug in the US. (7) Yes. The report is incorrect as the Minister did not overrule the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee’s (PBAC) recommendation. Herceptin is not listed on the PBS. See also answer to Question 8. The Government in its media release of 11 October 2001, emphasised that the PBAC had acted in accordance with long standing guidelines about its role in advising the Government on pharmaceutical listings and that the Government’s decision to create a separate program outside the PBS to make funding for Herceptin available was not bypassing the PBAC or its authority. (8) A drug is unable to be subsidised as a pharmaceutical benefit without a supporting recommendation from the PBAC as required by Section 101(4)(b) of the National Health Act 1953. There is no discretion for the Minister to overrule the PBAC and declare a drug as a pharmaceutical benefit in the absence of such a recommendation. (9) The Government is unable to list REMICADE or any other new drug on the PBS unless the PBAC has recommended that it do so.",152,Arpansa Generally Does Not Have Direct Contact With Those Who Participated In British Nuclear Tests In
266,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(10) The cost per patient for a course of treatment with Herceptin is around $60,000. Those patients who qualify for the separate funding program for Herceptin receive it free of charge. (11) The estimated cost of REMICADE for a single course of treatment ranges from about $3,000 to $4,000 per patient (depending on the weight of the patient) for the moderate to severe form of the disease, and from about $6,000 to $12,000 per patient (depending on the weight of the patient and whether 2 or 3 doses are administered) for the fistulising form of the disease. Health and Ageing: Childhood Learning Disabilities (Question No. 88) notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) What diagnostic services exist in the southern Sydney region for childhood learning disabilities such as autism. (2) What treatment services exist for such learning disabilities. (3) Does the Government provide funding in respect of any of those services; if so, what are the details. (4) What is the waiting list to access both diagnostic and treatment services for learning disabilities including autism. (5) What is the length of time for a child to be (a) diagnosed and (b) treated through those services. the honourable member’s question: The question you asked regarding diagnostic and treatment services in the southern Sydney region for childhood learning disabilities such as autism does not fall within my area of responsibility as Commonwealth Minister for Health and Ageing. Support for childhood learning disabilities in the southern Sydney region is provided through the New South Wales Department of Education and Training. I have been advised that the Department of Education and Training is also party to a joint program called the Early Intervention Coordination Program, which draws together a number of State departments involved with the range of issues raised in your question. You may wish to contact that Department for the details you require. Health: Public Hospital Accreditation (Question No. 89) notice, on 13 February 2002: Are there processes in place for the accreditation of public hospitals; if so, (a) what are the processes for that accreditation and (b) what standards does the accreditation process consider. the honourable member’s question: The accreditation of public hospitals is a matter for State and Territory Governments and individual hospitals. Health: Private Health Insurance Rebate (Question No. 100) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) What sum did the Government spend on the private health rebate advertising program during the previous Parliament. (2) Will the Minister provide copies of all advertising used to promote the private health rebate. (3) Will private health cover become 30 per cent cheaper for all Australians as claimed in the advertising.

270,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(5) Has the Government informed recipients of the Private Health Insurance Incentive Scheme that they will not receive the full private health rebate. (6) What sum did a pensioner couple receive in rebate if their private health insurance premium was $254.85 a quarter before 1 January 1999. (7) What actual percentage rebate is a pensioner couple receiving if they were paying $254.85 a quarter for private health insurance before 1 January 1999 and, after receiving the private health insurance rebate, were then paying $192.95. the honourable member’s question: (1) Total expenditure on the promotion of the 30 per cent Rebate was $5,491,355. (2) Yes, copies of the Commonwealth advertising material used in the campaign in 1999 are currently being retrieved from the archive record of the Department of Health and Ageing and will be provided as soon as possible. (3) All Australians who are eligible for Medicare and who are members of registered health funds are eligible for the 30 per cent Rebate which provides a net 30 per cent reduction on the price of private health insurance premiums. The Rebate is equal to 30 per cent of the listed premiums on hospital cover, ancillary cover and a combination on both. It is available irrespective of family type or income. (4) On 16 December 1998 a circular was sent to funds containing information on the 30 per cent Rebate. The information comprised: an executive summary of the key points relating to the Rebate; an information sheet on how the rebate will operate; frequently asked questions and answers; and a copy of the Private Health Insurance Incentive Bill 1998 Second Reading Speech On 31 December 1998 funds were sent a media release which announced the introduction of the Rebate on 27 January 1999. Information brochures were distributed to health funds on 11 January 1999, and a further distribution was made on 27 January 1999. On 25 January 1999 a letter from the former Minister for Health and Aged Care encouraging funds to devote particular attention to explaining the transition from the Private Health Insurance Incentive Scheme (PHIIS) to the 30 per cent Rebate was distributed to all health funds. Accompanying the letter was an ‘Alert’ which explained the transition in full, which was designed to be used by fund members dealing with clients. A circular emphasising PHIIS changes and options to claim the Rebate was distributed to all registered funds on 11 February 1999. (5) The promotion campaign for the Federal Government 30 per cent Rebate, of which mass advertising was only one component, comprised comprehensive material such as information kits, brochures and fact sheets which were distributed widely to private health fund members and to Medicare offices. The information was also made available through the Federal Government 30 per cent Rebate Information line that was heavily publicised through all TV and print advertising. The information clearly stated that the 30 per cent Rebate replaced the PHIIS. No one who was receiving PHIIS was worse off under the new scheme. The majority of PHIIS recipients are better off because they receive a full 30 per cent Rebate, whereas under the PHIIS the incentive payment was smaller in the majority of cases. (6) In the quarter before 1 January 1999, when the PHIIS was still operating, a pensioner couple with no dependents paying a premium of $254.85 per quarter ($1019.40 per annum), would have received either a $200 rebate per annum for hospital care, or a $250 rebate per annum for combined hospital and ancillary cover. (7) Before1 January 1999, the pensioner couple under the PHIIS received either 19.6 per cent (if the policy provided hospital cover only $200 for a premium of $1019.40) or 24.5 per cent in",154,Arpansa Generally Does Not Have Direct Contact With Those Who Participated In British Nuclear Tests In
271,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer toentitlements (if the policy provided combined hospital and ancillary cover $250 for a premium of $1019.40). Under the Federal Government 30 per cent Rebate on private health insurance, a policyholder will receive a 30 per cent rebate on their premium regardless of the amount of the premium. For example a policyholder, who paid $254.85 a quarter or $1019.40 per year as in the example above, would receive $305.82 per year regardless of the type of cover held. This is equivalent to a quarterly premium of $178.40 for that policyholder if they choose to receive the 30 per cent Rebate as a premium reduction. Insurance: Health Funds (Question No. 147) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 18 February 2002: Further to the answer to question No. 209 (Hansard, 11 May 1999, page 4165 and 23 June 1999, page 5736), what proportion of (a) total health expenditure in Australia was funded by health insurance funds in each year since 1996-97 and (b) recurrent health expenditure was funded by health insurance funds for (i) public acute care hospitals, (ii) private hospitals, (iii) medical services, (iv) dental services, (v) other professional services and (vi) all other services in each year since 1996-97. the honourable member’s question: The data below show the proportion of total health expenditure and total recurrent health expenditure funded by private health insurance funds for 1996-97 to 1998-99. Proportion of total health expenditure met by private health insurance, by area of expenditure, 1996–97 to 1998–99 (per cent) Area of expenditure 1996-97 1,2 1997-98 1 1998-99 Public acute care hospitals 3.0 2.6 2.1 Private hospitals 69.8 66.3 63.8 Medical services 2.8 2.7 2.8 Dental services 23.4 23.2 23.5 Other professional services 14.0 13.7 12.6 Other health services (including Admin) 5.9 5.7 5.7 Proportion of total recurrent health expenditure 11.1 10.5 10.2 Proportion of total health expenditure 10.5 9.8 9.5 Source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), “Health Expenditure Bulletin” series. The latest detailed data available is for 1998-99 (Health Expenditure Bulletin 17, September, 2001). 1 The figures for the proportion of total health expenditure and proportion of total recurrent health expenditure for 1996-97 and 1997-98 vary slightly from those previously provided to the answer to Question 209. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) advises that the figures previously supplied were preliminary. 2 It should be noted that the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1997, which came into effect on 1 July 1997, made provision for the subsidisation of health insurance premiums for low income earners. That subsidy was replaced by the 30% rebate, which is available to all members with private health insurance cover. The effect of the subsidy and the rebate is to reduce the amount of health expenditure that is funded through premiums and other earnings generated by the funds. It is regarded by the AIHW, therefore, as Commonwealth Government funding for the types of health services that attract payments by private health insurance funds. This has been the case since 1997-98. The subsidy and the rebate that replaced it could be claimed as either a reduced premium (in which case the Commonwealth Government reimbursed the health insurance funds) or as a taxation rebate (in which case members paid the full premium to the health insurance funds and claimed the subsidy/rebate through their taxation return after the end of that year). Where the subsidy/rebate results in a reimbursement to the health insurance funds, it is treated by the AIHW as health expenditure that was funded by the Commonwealth Government.",155,Arpansa Generally Does Not Have Direct Contact With Those Who Participated In British Nuclear Tests In
272,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer toThis means that the proportion of health expenditure funded by premiums and other earnings of the health insurance funds is lower than the proportion of health expenditure funded through the health insurance funds. In the case of subsidies or rebates claimed by members through their taxation return, this also could be regarded as funding that is ultimately sourced from the Commonwealth Government. However, because that funding does not flow back through the funds, but goes directly to fund members, it has not been treated by the Institute as funding by the Commonwealth in its analyses of expenditure by ‘area of expenditure’. The AIHW has in recent publications adjusted the way it presents its detailed health expenditure analyses. This makes it now possible to extract data according to whether the expenditure was funded by the health insurance funds or through the health insurance funds. In preparing the figures for this table, the AIHW’s estimates of expenditure funded through the private health insurers have been used to give a more relevant answer to this question on notice. Egypt: Coptic Christians (Question No. 171) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 21 February 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article published by the US Copts Association from the Coptic Information Centre, titled Coptic Priest blamed for the Muslim violent hate crimes in Bani Wellmes dated 12 February 2002. (2) Is he able to say whether, at the consecration of the Church of the Virgin Mary in the town of Bani Wellmes of Al Minya, Egypt, the new church was stormed by tens of armed Muslims who set it on fire along with five houses and three cars, leaving 10 Copts wounded. (3) Were two buses carrying parish (sic) from the Church of St George (Heliopolis, Cairo) to the consecration ceremony also attacked by the villagers. (4) Did it take the local police over four hours to arrive at the scene and were Muslim villagers seen preventing the fire trucks from entering the village to extinguish the fire inside the Church. (5) Did the necessary process of obtaining a construction permit from the president take over 20 years and does the Hamayoni Decree enable the Muslim public to destroy churches using the excuse that these churches were illegally built. (6) Is the priest, Fr Luka Ibrahim Sargious, under arrest and being questioned on the charge of firing a hunting rifle; if so, (a) can he verify with the Egyptian Government whether Fr Sargious has been charged, (b) under what provision of what criminal code is Fr Sargious charged and (c) has the charge gone to trial; if not, when can the Egyptian Government reasonably expect the matter to go to trial. (1) No, I have not seen this article. My Department, however, has obtained media reports of the incidents in Bani Wellmes. The Australian Ambassador in Cairo was asked to seek official Egyptian Government and other comment on the incidents, including the points raised in the honourable member’s question. The Egyptian Government spokesman’s account of the incidents was broadly similar to the reports of reliable media outlets and other Embassy contacts, although there were differences on some points. Given current restrictions on access to Bani Wellmes our Embassy is unable to assess or confirm the particular reports at first hand. According to the Government spokesman, the incidents were not so much symptomatic of systemic prejudice against Copts in Egypt as the result of a combination of “ignorance and lack of understanding” of the villagers involved and provocative actions by members of the local Coptic Church. (2) At the reconsecration of the Church of the Virgin Mary in Bani Wellmes, a group of Muslim villagers attacked and set fire to the Church. Eleven people (including two police officers) received minor, superficial injuries. Five houses and three vehicles were set on fire. (3) There are conflicting reports as to whether two buses carrying parish members from Cairo to attend the reconsecration ceremony were attacked. The Egyptian Government spokesman denies that this happened, but at least one other source whom our Embassy considers reliable maintains that it did. (4) According to the Egyptian Government spokesman, three commissioned officers were on the scene at the time the attack on the Church took place. They immediately called for back-up and within 90 minutes the situation was under control. The spokesman denied that Muslim villagers sought to",156,Arpansa Generally Does Not Have Direct Contact With Those Who Participated In British Nuclear Tests In
273,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:prevent fire trucks from entering the village to extinguish the fire in the Church. Another Embassy contact, however, advised that some villagers had told him that police forces arrived two hours after the event and also that villagers tried to stop fire trucks from entering the village. (5) The Government spokesman confirmed that administrative rules apply to the construction and renovation of churches and that government permission is required. In the case of the Church of the Virgin Mary in Bani Wellmes, renovation of the church had commenced without the finalisation of permits, but this had not been a problem. The renovation had proceeded, yet the Government had not intervened. The Hamayouni Decree bans the building or renovation of churches without the permission of the President of Egypt. According to the decree, police can stop by force any religious rites by Christians if a construction or renovation permit for the church was not obtained. It is not clear whether the Decree bestows commensurate powers on the Muslim public. In November 1998, Copts challenged the decree in the constitutional court, but a verdict has not yet been returned. President Mubarak recently devolved his powers under the decree to district governors, a move reported to have been received favourably by Pope Shenouda and many Copts. (6) Fr Sargious has been arrested and is in detention. Fr Sargious has admitted to firing the shotgun, but claims his actions were in self-defence. His case – including charges of being armed with a shotgun and pistol, and endangering life – have been referred to the public prosecutor, and is under investigation. The public prosecutor will determine when the case will go to trial. The trial date will be set when the public prosecutor has finalised investigations and the matter has been referred to an appropriate court. United Nations Conventions and Protocols (Question No. 184) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 11 March 2002: (1) Did Australia accede with reservations to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees in 1954 and withdraw the reservations in 1967 and 1971. (2) Did Australia on 13 December 1973 accede to the (a) 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, (b) 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and (c) 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. (3) Which countries on or near the sea and air routes between the Mediterranean and Australia are parties to the (a) 1951 Convention and (b) 1967 Protocol. (4) Which of the other countries on or near the sea and air routes between the Mediterranean and Australia has the Government asked to become parties to the Convention and Protocol and on what dates, in what circumstances and with what results has the Government asked them to do so. (5) Which of the countries referred to in parts (3) and (4) are members of the Executive Committee of the UNHCR’s Program. (6) What are the names, positions and qualifications of the persons who represented Australia at the 52nd session of the Executive Committee held between 1 October and 5 October 2001. (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The countries on or near the sea and air routes between the Mediterranean and Australia which are parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol are: Cambodia, China, Cyprus, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Greece, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Yemen. (4) Australia has a long record of encouraging accession to the Refugees Convention and Protocol in its dealings with non-signatory states both bilaterally and in a variety of international forums. It is not possible to itemise all the occasions since the Convention was signed in 1951 on which Australia has advocated accession.

Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal (Question No. 189) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 11 March 2002: (1) What is the estimated waiting time from filing of applications for appellants to the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) to the dates the applications are heard. (2) How many cases are waiting to be heard in the MRT and RRT. (3) What steps are being taken to reduce the waiting time from date of lodgement to date of hearing in the MRT and RRT. (4) If he is unable to answer any of parts (1) to (3), why. (1) MRT The MRT does not presently maintain statistics on the time taken from the lodgement of a review application to its hearing by a member. Rather, it keeps statistics on the average total time taken to finalise an application for review, which takes the application from its lodgement, through its hearing, to its finalisation with a decision. The time taken to finalise cases varies according to the nature of the case and the priority assigned to it. As the MRT cannot commence work on all cases immediately they are received, the Principal Member has given directions as to the order in which cases are to be allocated. Highest priority (Priority Group 1) is given to cases to which the Tribunal is required to give priority by law. These include cases involving persons held in immigration detention and visa cancellation cases. Also included are certain visitor visa cases. Work commences on these cases immediately. Priority Group2 includes cases remitted from the Federal Court to the Tribunal for reconsideration. It also includes cases that are considered to warrant priority processing because of special circumstances of a compelling or compassionate nature. Such circumstances may include where further delay would result in the continuing separation of a child from a parent, or of a carer, and cases where domestic violence is involved. Work usually commences on these cases shortly after receipt or upon their being identified as warranting inclusion in this group.",158,Arpansa Generally Does Not Have Direct Contact With Those Who Participated In British Nuclear Tests In
275,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Priority Group3 includes applications relating to: temporary ‘onshore’ visa cases where the visa applicant is in Australia and the period sought for the visa would otherwise expire before the Tribunal completed its review; cases identified as being able to be finalised quickly with minimal impact on delays experienced by other review applicants (e.g. where a case can be resolved quickly on the available evidence or because significant new evidence becomes available); cases that are identified for processing through a taskforce or targeted approach (e.g. arrangements to deal with enrolment peaks for student visas, assigning case teams or members to deal with a batch of cases that require specialised knowledge). Priority Group4 (lowest priority), includes applications relating to: an application for a visa that, if granted, would be granted within Australia in order of the date of lodgement of the review application, and an application for a visa that, if granted, would be granted outside Australia in order of the date of lodgement of the review application, less than 6 months (180 days). The following table indicates the mean time taken for a case to be finalised by the MRT by case type, based on data for the financial year 2001-02 to 31 March 2002. Visa type and Category Mean Time Taken to Number of cases finalised finalise (months) Visa Refusal– Bridging 1.0 529 Visa Refusal– Visitor 6.0 393 Visa Refusal– Student 9.0 820 Visa Refusal Temp Business 16.6 710 Visa Refusal Perm Business 17.4 88 Visa Refusal Skill Linked 28.8 487 Visa Refusal– Partner 14.7 1056 Visa Refusal– Family 17.6 936 Visa Refusal– Other 13.5 184 Cancellation – Bridging 1.3 92 Cancellation – Visitor 3.3 12 Cancellation – Student 4.3 335 Cancellation Temp Business 5.1 38 Cancellation – Partner 8.6 7 Cancellation – Family 12.4 3 Cancellation – Other 2.0 7 Non Revocation of automatic 1.0 6 cancellation of student visa Employer Nomination 13.5 12 Temp Business Sponsorship 15.6 170 Other Total 5948 RRT For the period 1 July 2001 to 31 March 2002, the median time from lodgement of an application in the RRT to the hearing was 209 days. In relation to detention cases, the timelines are much shorter. In those cases, the median average time from lodgement of an application in the RRT to hearing was 44 days. While the RRT seeks to resolve cases as quickly as possible, some delays are out of its hands. For instance, the review process can be slowed by the need to finalise a Freedom of Information request after the review application is lodged with the Tribunal. (2) MRT As at 31 March 2002, the MRT had 8,272 cases on hand (compared to 8,184 on 30 June 2001). Of these, 2,670 had been allocated to members, with a further 404 cases being worked on by case officers preparatory to the case being allocated to a member. The on hand caseload is made up of the following categories of cases as at 31 March 2002: Visa type and Category Number of cases Visa Refusal– Bridging 47 Visa Refusal– Visitor 241 Visa Refusal– Student 487 Visa Refusal– Temp Business 1067 Visa Refusal– Perm Business 419 Visa Refusal– Skill Linked 970 Visa Refusal– Partner 2374 Visa Refusal– Family 1473 Visa Refusal– Other 254 Cancellation – Bridging 12 Cancellation – Student 293 Cancellation – Other 58 Temp Business Sponsorship 446 Other 131 Total 8272 RRT As at 31 March 2002, the RRT had 5,392 cases on hand (compared to 5,960 on 30 June 2001). Of these, 1,562 had been allocated to members and 3,830 cases were awaiting allocation to a member. Of those allocated cases, 486 had been heard, 820 had been set down for hearing and 256 were yet to be set down for hearing. (3) MRT The MRT’s capacity to reduce waiting times has been significantly impacted on by the increased number of applications for review lodged with the MRT. In 1999-2000 the MRT received 6,480 new cases and 7,211 in 2000-01. It is estimated that in 2001-02, the MRT will receive at least 8,100 new cases and possibly as many as 8,500. This growth in the number of applications lodged has meant that despite substantially increasing the number of cases finalised, there has been limited capacity to reduce waiting times. The MRT is undertaking a wide range of actions with the aim of reducing the waiting time from time of lodgement to date of hearing and subsequent finalisation: liaison with DIMIA There is little direct influence that the MRT can exert in respect of the number of applications being lodged with it. However, the MRT provides input to DIMIA in order to assist it identify areas where it can achieve better quality decision making and where its procedures may be able to be modified to avoid applicants having to apply to the MRT. For example, the MRT has worked with DIMIA to facilitate the placement of a DIMIA officer in its registries to undertake a quality assurance audit of DIMIA decision making and procedures. This arrangement has proved successful in Sydney and is now being repeated in the Melbourne and Canberra registries of the MRT. continuous improvement of MRT procedures and work practices The MRT is constantly working towards making its procedures and work practices more effective. The MRT has in place or is about to embark on a range of initiatives aimed at improving its effectiveness as an organisation: it has established a number of change management committees including: a Best Practice Committee to identify priorities for reviewing aspects of the Tribunal’s operations and to oversight the establishment, framework, resourcing and progress of reviews, and consultative arrangements. a Case Review Model Committee to oversee a review of the Tribunal’s Case Review Model to identify areas where the MRT’s case management related work practices can be improved. a Member Performance and Development Committee to develop proposals for performance appraisal and training and development arrangements for members. an Activity-Based Costing Committee to oversight the current activity-based costing exercise. Activity-based costing is a means of measuring the cost of doing business by breaking down the work into a series of activities. This will give the MRT a better understanding of how resources are utilised. Other reviews or projects that are being progressed or considered include: a review of telecommunication strategies internal and external. the development of an innovation scheme. a review of the Client Service Charter. expansion of the MRT The MRT has grown in size since it was initially set up in response to its increasing caseload. The extent of any further growth is currently being considered taking into account anticipated productivity improvements, estimated future application rates (ie an application rate of 8,000 cases per year in future years) and the likely make up of this caseload. Current indications are that with some limited growth in the number of members and case officers from 2002-03, the MRT should be able to achieve significant reductions in waiting times over the next two years. RRT The RRT’s caseload management strategy is focussed on resolving cases (particularly detention cases) as quickly as possible, and reducing the backlog. This has been made more difficult in recent years by the increase in the number of applications, particularly from applicants in detention. The number of detention applications lodged rose from 334 in 1996-97 to 1,054 in 2000-01. The RRT has in place a number of measures to increase its efficiency. In the most recent financial year, it continued its policy of allocating detention cases immediately to a member, and requiring members to finalise such cases within 70 days of allocation targeted cases from the two largest source countries the People’s Republic of China and Indonesia concentrated on cases which represented a significant proportion of the backlog including India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan, the CIS, Nepal, Colombia, Egypt, Lebanon and former Yugoslavia. identified and allocated cases from countries where applicants rarely attend hearings principally Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and South Korea continued to identify cases with similar claims within the caseload to reduce the need to research afresh country information in a diverse caseload and enable quicker finalisation of cases Measures the RRT is currently undertaking to expedite processing times and reduce waiting times include: a major ‘Streamlining’ exercise to see what activities by members and staff can be undertaken more expeditiously continued focus on quickly finalising detention cases and reducing the backlog of other cases providing improved reports to members on their caseload to assist them manage their individual caseloads more efficiently and identify their progress to meeting their individual allocation continued training and focus group discussions for members on legal and country information developments to ensure all members are fully acquainted with current information to facilitate decision making the addition of new members to increase the number of decisions undertaken by the RRT. While the size of the backlog is an issue of concern to the RRT, it needs to be seen in context. The RRT has seen a substantial increase in the number of applicants, particularly applicants in detention, over the last couple of years. Through the measures outlined above and other factors, the size of the backlog is beginning to reduce. As at 1 July 2001, the total number of cases not allocated to a member was 4,550; in the course of the last eight months, that has been reduced to 3,830, a reduction of 16%.

Local Government: Grants (Question No. 209) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 12 March 2002: What sums were allocated in local government financial assistance grants in (a) 1998-99, (b) 1999-2000 and (c) 2000-2001 to the (i) City of Hume, (ii) City of Brimbank, (iii) Shire of Moreland and (iv) Shire of Nillumbik. The allocations of local government financial assistance grants to the named local government areas (LGAs) are as follows: LGA 1998/99 1999/00 2000/01 (i) City of Hume $4,613,966 $5,217,809 $6,120,053 (ii) City of Brimbank $8,265,896 $8,930,030 $9,786,227 (iii) Shire of Moreland $8,192,285 $8,278,552 $7,857,343 (iv) Shire of Nillumbik $2,944,776 $2,837,547 $2,735,384 Health: Cochlear Implants (Question No. 213) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 13 March 2002: Has the Government withdrawn, or does it intend to withdraw, the requirement for private health funds to reimburse Cochlear implants for the cost of speech processor upgrades or replacements; if so, why. Mr AndrewsThe Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The Government has not withdrawn the requirement for private health funds to pay for replacement Cochlear speech processors or upgrades under hospital tables, but does intend to withdraw this requirement in future. This is in line with a recommendation by the Private Health Industry Medical Devices Expert Committee, which advises the Government on items for inclusion on Schedule5 (the Prostheses Schedule) under the National Health Act 1953 (the Act). This Schedule is set out under paragraph (bj) of the Act, which refers to ‘hospital treatment’. Cochlear replacement speech processors and a range of other items on the Prostheses Schedule were reviewed by the Committee. The Committee found that the replacement speech processors are not provided during an episode of hospital treatment. The Committee recognised the beneficial outcomes of Cochlear replacement speech processors and recommended that health funds consider funding these devices under their ancillary tables. Some",159,Arpansa Generally Does Not Have Direct Contact With Those Who Participated In British Nuclear Tests In
276,Mr Tuckey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:health funds have now advised their intention to provide cover for these devices under their ancillary tables. The withdrawal of Cochlear replacement speech processors from the Prostheses Schedule has been deferred pending further advice from the remaining private health funds as to the inclusion of these items on ancillary tables and discussion with health funds about notifying affected members of this change. Therefore, as at March 2002 these items remain on the Prostheses Schedule as notified in the Commonwealth Gazette S59 on 27 February 2002. Australia Council: Funding (Question No. 234) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 14 March 2002: What projects did the Australia Council fund in the Melbourne metropolitan area in (a) 1998-99, (b) 1999-2000 and (c) 2000-01 and what was the (i) expenditure on, (ii) location of, and (iii) purpose of, each project. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The Australia Council has provided details of the projects it funded in 24 Federal electorates covering the Melbourne metropolitan area during 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-01.

The allocations of local government financial assistance grants to the named local government areas (LGAs) were as follows: LGA 1998/99 1999/00 2000/01 (i) City of Whittlesea $4,789,533 $5,443,781 $6,411,296 (ii) City of Banyule $5,230,092 $5,436,686 $5,195,102 (iii) Shire of Nillumbik $2,944,776 $2,837,547 $2,735,384 (iv) City of Darebin $7,714,902 $7,336,153 $7,178,964 Chinese Embassy: Falun Gong Protest (Question No. 264) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 19 March 2002: (1) What steps were taken to restrict Australian Falun Gong supporters outside the Chinese Embassy from expressing their concern and anger about the suppression of Falun Gong adherents by the Chinese Government. (2) Who asked that these actions be taken. (3) Was the Minister or any of the Ministers staff involved in the decision or made aware of the decision to crack down on the protest before that action was taken. (4) Who decided it was necessary to take such actions and what reasons were given. (5) Had the Falun Gong done anything beyond exercising their right to peaceful civil protest. (1) On 16 March 2002, I ( Mr Downer) signed certificates, provided for under regulations made pursuant to the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities (DPI) Act 1967, that certified – in part that the presence of certain prescribed objects – namely banners erected as part of a protest conducted by members of the Falun Gong and instrument used to make amplified noise as part of the same protest – on land opposite or near the Chinese Embassy impaired the dignity of the mission. The certificates further provided that the removal of the prescribed objects would be an appropriate step to prevent the impairment or the continuation of the impairment of the dignity of the Chinese Embassy. (2) The Minister for Foreign Affairs. (3) Yes. See Question Two. (4) The Minister for Foreign Affairs. As described in the Certificates, which will be tabled in Parliament, the prescribed objects referred to in Question One were considered to impair the dignity of the Chinese Embassy. Removal of the objects was necessary to restore the dignity of the Embassy. (4) Yes. The nature of the protest was impairing the dignity of the Chinese Embassy. The long standing Canberra picket had involved a range of large, staked, banners that had been set up without a permit and were in breach of Commonwealth and ACT laws. The behaviour of Falun Gong protesters in Melbourne on 8 March 2002 – in which they protested inside the grounds of the Chinese Consulate – was also unacceptable. It was a clear breach of the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971. The Act implements Australia’s obligations under the Vienna Conventions, including protecting foreign missions against intrusion or damage and to prevent disturbance of the peace, or impairment of the dignity of the mission.",164,Arpansa Generally Does Not Have Direct Contact With Those Who Participated In British Nuclear Tests In
