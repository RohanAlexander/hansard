We were all part of the last government that Australians knew was competent and trustworthy. Unlike the current government, which never makes an announcement that is not supposed to be the most important thing ever, what I am proposing is not unprecedented and should not even be remarkable. I am offering what should be normal: careful, collegial, consultative, straightforward government that says what it means and does what it says. That would be change for the better. The next election, to which this budget is a mere prelude, should not be about who becomes prime minister. It should be about who can do more for our country-because our country is more important than any of us in this parliament. My colleagues and I have a plan to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. It is not about us. It is about you, the Australian people. We pledge ourselves to your service. Debate adjourned. House adjourned at 20:00 Thursday, 16 May 2013 Adoption Year ceremony in WA. There were three finalists: three ladies with impressive stories and impressive characters. All have done great things for their families and embody in every way the very best of motherhood in our community. On this occasion I would like to speak of the runner-up, Tennille McConkey. Tennille is 37 years old, she is single and she has seven children. She is the mother of two and the foster parent of five. A couple of weeks ago I visited Tennille because I wanted to know more about her and why she is a foster parent. I learned a lot and she is without doubt an inspiration. Tennille McConkey comes from a dysfunctional family. She has faced many problems since she left home at 16. She had her daughter around then, and she also left her church. She describes herself a bit of a wild child. At the age of 23 she decided that she wanted more children and decided that she would do foster parenting. In the last 14 years she has fostered more than 30 children. Often they have been Indigenous, and four of her five current children are Indigenous. She is now the legal guardian of almost all the children. When we spoke about the issue of adoption, Tennille made an interesting comment. She said that she would like to adopt the children; however, the trouble with the Australian past history of forced adoptions is that 'this country now hates adoption'. Given the clear failure of so many actual parents to raise their children safely and positively, it is a shame that adoption of Australian children is now practically impossible. Many children would have a far better future, I am sure of it. As Tennille often says, too many children live in limbo because even now case officers seem to be trying to get children back to their parents despite there being clearly better options. It is true to say that financially Tennille struggles. One of Tennille's children has intellectual problems due to foetal alcohol syndrome. She has seven children aged between two and 16 and it is a big load. She is in a private rental as well. Yet the children are very polite and have been well cared for. It is a highly positive home and so therefore I pay tribute to Tennille McConkey for what she does. She has a great attitude and I would like to quote her again because this is something we should all do. She says, 'I do not allow my children to use their circumstances as an excuse for behaving badly.' Tennille does not just say that, she lives it as well. In the recent past she has had breast cancer and has lost one brother to a traffic accident and another to a heart attack in the last couple of years. In amongst all that she has been studying to become a midwife. When I think about what Tennille has achieved with her seven children and what she has overcome, I can only say that she is amazing. If everyone had an attitude like hers, this country would be an even better place to live.",154,Bills Day No 15 Government Business Be Postponed

212,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (09:43,"On 15 AprilI attended the Barnardos Mother of theFire Services opposition leader, John Robertson, at Revesby Fire Station in the electorate of Banks. That day the fire station was closed. On 26 AprilI noticed that the fire station was also closed and posted a photo of the sign on my Facebook page. What is interesting is that the photo had the largest number of hits of any posted. This indicates to me that the decisions of the O'Farrell government in relation to staffing are of vital importance to many people. The New South Wales government is closing down fire stations and not replacing firefighters who are sick or on leave. In fact, Revesby joins Riverwood and Mortdale fire stations, also in my electorate, with other fire stations that have been closed arbitrarily. If a house is burning and the fire truck takes 30 minutes to arrive instead of 10 because the nearby station is shut, it may mean the difference between life and death. This is totally unacceptable to my community and to the broader community of New South Wales. Cuts have also been made to the Rural Fire Service. In late 2012 it was revealed the O'Farrell government planned to slash $12 million from employee expenses at the RFS and cut 120 jobs. These cuts come on top of $64 million cut from the New South Wales Fire Brigade, forcing local fire stations to temporarily close their doors when firefighters call in sick. These cuts to firefighters come on top of 3,600 jobs to go from hospitals and ambulance stations 2,400 jobs cut from schools and TAFE colleges and almost 1,000 job cuts in community services. This is in addition to job cuts at Sydney Water, Roads and Maritime Services, Office of Environment and Heritage, Forests NSW, RailCorp and in many other government departments further job losses are anticipated. Since the O'Farrell government came to office in March 2011, there are 19,873 more unemployed people in New South Wales. This is what the future holds for the Australian people if an Abbott government is elected. This is in stark contrast to the record of the Labor federal government, which has created in excess of 950,000 jobs. These are 950,000 jobs created in spite of the Queensland government, the New South Wales government and the Victorian government shedding jobs. If you have got a job you can send your kids to school, you can pay a mortgage, you can pay your hospital fees. Jobs are more important than any other matter in the community. Without a job, you crush families' hopes. That is what an Abbott government will do if it is elected. People are insecure because of that. National Volunteer WeekI would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge some of the hard working volunteers in my electorate. In the lead up to National Volunteer Week, I visited several community groups in Macarthur that rely on their hard working volunteers to make a difference in our community. I have said many times in this place that volunteers are the backbone of many organisations in my electorate. Our local volunteers hold a very special place in so many of our community groups and organisations in Macarthur. This week I was honoured to attend the Macarthur Diversity Services Initiative 2013 Volunteer of the Year awards in Campbelltown. MDSI is a community based charity organisation that provides a wide range of fantastic services for residents of Macarthur, particularly to those from different cultural backgrounds. MDSI has more than 100 volunteers",162,Constituency Statements

214,Mr Matheson (Macarthur) (09:49,"This week is National Volunteer Week and todaywho give their time tirelessly working on a variety of programs such as playgroups, youth groups and aged-care programs to help local families connect with the community. This year MDSI recognised its volunteers with a continuous commitment to support the great services that MDSI provides in Macarthur. One of these volunteers was Lynn Moore, a compassionate lady who has devoted 30 years of volunteering in Macarthur. During this time Lynn has had various roles assisting frail aged people. Thirty years of volunteering is an outstanding achievement and is something Lynn should be very, very proud of. Jacquelyn Perales was named the 2013 MDSI Volunteer of the Year. Jacquelyn has been a volunteer for MDSI since 2007 and was nominated by the staff for her compassion, understanding and commitment to volunteering for the organisation. She is a lovely young lady who is dedicated to helping others in the Macarthur community. Last week I also attended the Campbelltown Jubilee Awards organised by Campbelltown Council and hosted by Mayor Sue Dobson. The jubilee awards recognise individuals who live in Campbelltown and who have contributed to the community for 50 years or more. The award also recognises members of Campbelltown's Indigenous community who have volunteered for more than 30 years. I felt very proud to see 23 recipients of the jubilee award this year-a mighty achievement by these outstanding people. This week I also had the pleasure of attending another fantastic community organisation, Camden Community Connections, at its Bunnings fundraising barbecue. Camden Community Connections runs many services and activities in my electorate, including playgroups, youth drop-in services, seniors groups and young mothers' groups. In the lead-up to Volunteers Week a number of volunteers wrapped Mother's Day gifts at local shopping centres to raise money for Lifeline Macarthur. As a Lifeline ambassador, I am always impressed by the ongoing dedication of its amazing volunteers. I take this opportunity to commend the dedicated staff and volunteers from all of the charity groups across Macarthur. All of our volunteers have a special place in my community. The people of Macarthur appreciate our volunteers' generosity, dedication, compassion, reliability and tolerance when assisting those with special needs in our community. I look forward to recognising some of those wonderful volunteers in the 2013 Volunteer of the Year awards in December. To all our volunteers in Macarthur, thanks a million. Live Animal Exports Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare) (09:52): I rise on the issue of live animal exports, an issue that I first raised concerns about in this place some seven years ago. It is an issue that I have continued to advocate both within the government and more broadly and an issue that so many in the Adelaide electorate are fiercely passionate about. After the latest horrific incidents of abuse were televised, many people have again spoken out. It is their words that I seek to use today, putting them publicly and permanently on the record and again pledging to be their voice in this place and to fight on the issues for which they are passionate. Voices like Ella's, from Prospect, who wrote to me saying: I am only 15 years old, from Adelaide, and although it may not seem like that much of a problem coming from me, I saw it the footage on the news the other night. I have never been so ashamed of being human. I didn't even think it was humanly possible to be so heartless.' Or, from Joan in Norwood who wrote: I have been intensely disturbed for day after watching the video footage of the cruelty to live animals sent to Egyptian 'state-of-the-art' abattoirs. These practices are disgusting. They're unnecessary and they are totally cruel. I heard from Maureen in Adelaide who said: I have watched and heard about with absolute horror and disgust at the dreadful acts of cruelty to animals, namely Australian livestock, over in other countries. Such brutality and downright torture-it is time for it to stop immediately. I have heard from so many of the constituents in my local area that I could speak here for hours raising their concerns. Fortunately for all of you, I will not do that, but I will share some of the others. Michelle, from Parkside, wrote: I am appalled that we are still sending our animals overseas to be treated like this. This is not okay. Please do what you can to prevent this terrible cruelty happening to our cattle. We wouldn't allow it to happen to pets--owners would be prosecuted. Our farmers don't want to see their animals treated like this either. Ana, from Adelaide, said: I am astonished and deeply concerned having heard about the dreadful conditions with animals and livestock in Egypt. I also heard on the ABC this morning that graziers in Queensland are pressuring government to relax on live animal export trade to those countries that have deplorable slaughtering processes. Please, I ask that you do not go back on your word to the Australian people and please, if there is anything humanitarian that you can do to influence for the better the terrible situation. Christina, in Unley Park, says: Please, can I ask that you redouble your efforts to keep this issue alive in Canberra. To all of these, and to so many more who have written, who have rung, who have spoken out, I know how much you care about this. I know how sickened and appalled you are every time you see such footage, and I will continue to advocate within the government, within the parliament and within the community to see an end to these acts of extreme cruelty.

It is an opportunity to take the time to pause and remember those who have given their lives so that we can enjoy the freedoms today that we so often take for granted. ANZAC Day is always a special time for the residents of Ryan, particularly for those who have friends and family based at the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera. Thousands of local residents attended dawn services, ceremonies and marches across the electorate on ANZAC Day to pay tribute to the service men and women who have served overseas. As the daughter of a serviceman and the mother of a soldier who was serving overseas-he returned home early this morning-I was honoured to be invited to take part in and attend a number of local services. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many schools, veterans",163,Constituency Statements

216,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (09:55,"ANZAC Day has a significant place in the hearts andorganisations, aged-care homes and especially the RSLs in the electorate who held such special ceremonies this year. ANZAC Day is a particularly important day for so many Australians and our military history would not be complete without remembering the veterans of the Boer War. The Boer War was fought between 1899 and 1902 and ranks third behind the two world wars for the most Australian casualties. Sadly, to this day, there is still no national memorial to honour those who fought so courageously in this battle which marks the birth of the Australian Defence Force, which has served this country so well these past 110 years. As a member of parliament, I regularly receive petitions on a range of subjects. However, I must confess that last Tuesday, 14 May, was the first time that a petition was delivered to me on horseback. My colleague Senator Ronaldson, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, and I were the recipients of a petition with 10,200 signatures calling on the federal government to support a national Boer War Memorial on ANZAC Parade in Canberra to honour the 23,000 men and women of Australia who served our country in the Boer War, some 1,000 of whom gave their lives. I particularly want to pay tribute to the Vietnam veteran and Boer War veteran descendant, retired Lieutenant Colonel Miles Farmer OAM from Queensland and Captain Mike Fitzgerald, in Boer War mounted light horse uniform, and his horse, Boy, who came from Sydney especially to present the position. Like many other families, I have a special interest as my great uncle, Major Edmund Righetti, volunteered as a private to join the Victorian first contingent to go to the Boer War in 1899. He was severely wounded, invalided home and after convalescence returned to South Africa and rose through the ranks. The men and women involved in this conflict deserve to be remembered with a lasting and fitting memorial, and I urge everyone to support this significant project. Personal Helpers and Mentors Program Australian government, the Australian government Personal Helpers and Mentors programPHaMs. Last month, I had the pleasure of catching up with John Bateup, the CEO of WISE Employment at the WISE Employment office in Cranbourne to announce that WISE Employment had received $1.4 million over three years under this program to assist people with mental illness lead fulfilling and complete lives. The most inspiring bit about this program was hearing about the positive impact it had on people's lives, in particular one participant, Megan Powell. Megan's story was quite powerful and she actually related it at this launch. I will give you an abridged version of it. In effect, her testimony is a testament to the effectiveness of the program. Her story starts on 16 January 2010 when her life with her partner, as she said, was a good one. Her partner would stay at home and look after the son who was going extremely well. She was allowed to work as a self-employed market research interviewer. For a little boy, what better life was there than staying home with dad or travelling around camping and fishing. Relaxing one evening, however, Megan had a knock at the door. It was a police officer. They had come to inform her that her partner had passed away while camping earlier that day. This news quite understandably shell-shocked Megan. She tried to move on but she could not. In the next 18 months, the thoughts and depression started to consume her and she basically began to struggle to do the simple things in life-not being able to get up to take her son to school, not being able to work. Megan was down on the",165,Constituency Statements
217,Mr Byrne (Holt) (09:58,"I rise today to speak about a great program funded by the world and angry, and she could not see any light at the end of the tunnel. She was now a single mum, unemployed and living in a housing commission home. For six months, Megan could see no point to life. However, in January 2012, Megan came across the PHaMS program after it was referred to her by a friend. She originally approached PHaMS for help to establish a routine, but that program became much more significant in her life, particularly an individual called Chris Browning, who brought her into the program, where she was able to discuss her concerns. One of the terrible things when tragedies of this nature happen is that you are not able to describe in a group what you are experiencing and what you are feeling. This program enabled Megan to do that and to seek the treatment and the help she needed. That gave her the confidence to change careers and she enrolled in a Certificate IV in Community Services Work. She has had her challenges, there is absolutely no doubt about that; but I think Megan's story, the way her life is moving forward and the way she has overcome her struggles, is a great testament to the program, to Chris Browning and to all those people at the Cranbourne WISE. I want to praise the program and the great help it gives to people in their lives. O'Connor Electorate: Hockeyroos and Jillaroos by the Australian Ausdrill Hockeyroos and Jillaroos side. They visited Kalgoorlie last Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I would like to congratulate the Eastern Goldfields Hockey Association, particularly Andrew Hoare as president of the association, for the outstanding job they did in getting the Hockeyroos to Kalgoorlie-Boulder and also for the great event they put on when the players were there. They also played a game against a Goldfields all-star team made up of men and women. My congratulation to Mel Woods, who was the goalie. Although the Hockeyroos won 8-0, as you would expect, our Goldfields side put up an outstanding fight against them. Mel Woods, our goalie, was adjudged best on field for the Goldfields side, which was no mean feat; considering the Hockeyroos kept firing shot after shot, it was an outstanding effort from her. Young Nicolas Lavery, an outstanding Goldfields player, was another prominent player for us. Congratulations to Holly Creedan, a 14-year-old girl who made the side, and also to Sarah Zapelli, who was the oldest member-and I will not declare Sarah's age in the chamber! I would like to sincerely thank Ausdrill for facilitating the trip. Peter Chisholm and Brad Loane from Ausdrill went all out in ensuring that it was a great visit. The Hockeyroos and Jillaroos held school clinics, umpiring clinics, hockey clinics, and clinics for general fitness and well-being. I had the pleasure of attending a civic reception put on by the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder on Thursday night where we got to meet all the girls and the support staff. It was a particular pleasure to meet a young lady called Tennille Attard, who has endured three knee reconstructions and is still an integral member of the Australian Hockeyroos side. It is testament not only to her resilience but to the resilience of the Hockeyroos. The Hockeyroos are arguably one of Australia's most outstanding sporting teams. They are a credit to Australia, they are a credit to their sport and they are a credit to women. On the Friday night of the game, over 1,000 people attended the Eastern Goldfields hockey stadium. Entry was by a gold coin donation to the Breast Cancer Foundation. I have got no idea what they raised but it was an outstanding evening. As I said, the score was 8-0 but our Goldfields side put in an outstanding effort.",166,Constituency Statements

I sincerely thank the Australian Ausdrill Hockeyroos. Tasmanian Forests Agreement DisabilityCare Australia Forestry) (10:04): Good morning, colleagues. Lots of things have been happening in Tassie since we were here last, particularly in my region. First and foremost, the Tasmanian forests agreement has finally been signed. I congratulate all the signatories. It was three years of hard work to arrive at a consensus. We hope the forest industry will be able to continue in a very sustainable footing in Tassie and that we can protect those areas that we have pride in and that need protection. At the same time we can develop a future for that industry as well. SoI congratulate all those signatories. The federal government stands ready, willing and able to assist that process, as we always have been. There is $300 million now to roll out to support those who are going to be affected by this serious structural change. Unfortunately it is change that is necessary. I congratulate the mainstream green movement for supporting this. But I would ask Bob Brown, Christine Milne, Peg Putt and the extreme green organisations and individuals to cease now their old green politics and to support consensus and compromise; to allow this to happen, to give it a future. Instead, what we have is their old policy of no compromise and all conflict. I ask them again to cease their deliberate confrontational actions both in our forests, our forest industries and in the Tarkine-and most especially in their attempts to destabilise the responsible economic development in the region of west and north-west of Tasmania. The Prime Minister came to visit and wanted to congratulate Fonterra at Wynyard on their successful program from the Clean Technology Investments Program to install eight new cheese vats and reduce their heating. They carved emissions, saving up to $140,000 in their energy costs per year. They also receive $434,000 to boost their extension program to help farmers to reduce nitrous oxide emissions. Whilst the Prime Minister was visiting, she also announced $125,000 for the Darrel Baldock memorial project at Latrobe, and I am very grateful to her. I also had the privilege of attending the trail bike project at Penguin, which we put $53,000 into with support from DEEWR and Equity Labour Services and with the work of Ian Faulkner, James McCormick and DEEWR officers. This is a 12-week program to support seven young local people to build a world-class trail bike project. That was one of many.

220,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (10:07,"I rise today to raise awareness, as some of mygoing since 1986. About 36 per cent of Australian people, or just over six million people, volunteer every year in some way or another. They contribute about 713 million hours of unpaid work. It was interesting to find out that the typical age group of volunteers is around 35 to 44, and 65 to 74. But in my electorate, where the median age is about 33, we have a lot of young people who do volunteer work in our community and that is really pleasing. I would like to pay tribute to all of the volunteers in Darwin and Palmerston for the outstanding work they do in our community. From me to them: thanks a million for the work that you do. We all know that volunteers are the backbone of many organisations and the community; we would not be able to carry out the work we do if it were not for our volunteers. Volunteers are people who coach kids' sports teams. They deliver Meals on Wheels and provide things like the Northern Territory Field and Game, which is a conservation organisation. They do community work. Sids and Kids, of which I am the patron, has many volunteers, particularly Fiona Peters, who has given up so much of her time. We had the Mother's Day Classic on the weekend where so many volunteers were involved in the event. They helped to organise the getting of about 2,000 people into Darwin, walking and raising awareness of breast cancer. I would also like to acknowledge Carolyn Reynolds in our community, who is very active and who volunteers in so many different organisations. Bill Miller volunteers for the Palmerston Football Club. Penny Lasette is actively involved in a number of organisations. We have the Kiwanis Group and the Rotarians. Celina Hodge volunteers with Camp Quality and is in the middle of organising a big fundraising event. Elena Gomatos is very active in the Greek community. She was integral in organising Australia's Biggest Morning Tea. Thanks a million to all those many volunteers. (Time expired) Saluting Their Service Certificates local veterans with 'Saluting Their Service' certificates. It is important that we recognise these veterans for the work that they have done overseas in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping. First was John Sharley. He served in Australia's commitment to the war in Vietnam in the sixties and early seventies as a leading aircraftman with the RAAF. He went to South Vietnam between 1970 and 1971. John worked on the Caribous and many other types of aircraft during the time he was in South Vietnam. The story of our involvement in Vietnam is close to my heart. I have visited the country and seen where Australians have fought and died. I have also strongly supported the building of the Vietnam Veterans Commemorative Walk in Seymour and I look forward to a very positive announcement from Minister King, hopefully, later this week. There was also Ted Daniell. Ted is a proud Darwin defender. He was only 13 when the war started but, as soon as he turned 18, he joined up and headed to Darwin as part of the RAAF. He spent the last years of the war protecting our important northern communications bases and seaports from enemy attack, especially from the air. There was Herbert O'Brien, who, according to Herbert's records, joined just days before the imperial Japanese launched their offensive, in December 1941, on Pearl Harbor. He joined the",168,Constituency Statements
221,Mr Mitchell (Mcewen) (10:11,"It was on honour for me on 26 April to present someRAAF and served until several months after the end of the war, leaving his service as a leading aircraftman. His service saw him sent to New Guinea, Europe and the Pacific. There was also Basil Penrose. Basil served in the Royal Australian Navy in both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. His service is listed on the World War II Nominal Roll, from January 1943 through to March 1946. His service included being a stoker on HMAS Quiberon, a Q-class British-built destroyer, where he served most of his time. Posthumously, we presented Jack Sheehan his certificate. Jack passed away just a couple of weeks before ANZAC Day, at the age of 93. I had the pleasure of meeting Jack when he was selling poppies at Kilmore Coles last year and he kept me there for an hour as we talked about the stories that he had from the war. Jack joined up at the age of 18, in 1939, shortly after war was declared, at the Shepparton Drill Hall, being placed with one of the earliest formed battalions in the AIF from the Victorian 2/7th. With them, he went off in early 1940 by ship to the Middle East, North Africa and eventually to the ill-fated Greece and Crete campaigns in spring 1941. Jack's story is amazing. He was captured as a prisoner of war where he recalled the poor conditions of the camp. He described one as 'dirty, with plenty of lice and slit trenches for latrines,' and he described a camp in Greece that was made up of 'fleaand bug-ridden huts'. He further stated, 'Most of us had lost weight during the time through dysentery, with very little food.' He recalled how it was a harrowing experience. Jack was able to escape and, eventually, he walked from Germany all the way to England before coming back to Australia where he lived a fulfilling life. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Forced Adoption Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Dreyfus: That the House support the apology given by the Prime Minister to people affected by forced adoption and removal policies and practices in the following terms: Today, this Parliament, on behalf of the Australian people, takes responsibility and apologises for the policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies, which created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering. We acknowledge the profound effects of these policies and practices on fathers. And we recognise the hurt these actions caused to brothers and sisters, grandparents, partners and extended family members. We deplore the shameful practices that denied you, the mothers, your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children. You were not legally or socially acknowledged as their mothers. And you were yourselves deprived of care and support. To you, the mothers who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice, we apologise. We say sorry to you, the mothers who were denied knowledge of your rights, which meant you could not provide informed consent. You were given false assurances. You were forced to endure the coercion and brutality of practices that were unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal.",169,Constituency Statements
222,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,"Order! In accordance with standing orderWe know you have suffered enduring effects from these practices forced upon you by others. For the loss, the grief, the disempowerment, the stigmatisation and the guilt, we say sorry. To each of you who were adopted or removed, who were led to believe your mother had rejected you and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with your family and community of origin and to connect with your culture, we say sorry. We apologise to the sons and daughters who grew up not knowing how much you were wanted and loved. We acknowledge that many of you still experience a constant struggle with identity, uncertainty and loss, and feel a persistent tension between loyalty to one family and yearning for another. To you, the fathers, who were excluded from the lives of your children and deprived of the dignity of recognition on your children's birth records, we say sorry. We acknowledge your loss and grief. We recognise that the consequences of forced adoption practices continue to resonate through many, many lives. To you, the siblings, grandparents, partners and other family members who have shared in the pain and suffering of your loved ones or who were unable to share their lives, we say sorry. Many are still grieving. Some families will be lost to one another forever. To those of you who face the difficulties of reconnecting with family and establishing on-going relationships, we say sorry. We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation's history. To those who have fought for the truth to be heard, we hear you now. We acknowledge that many of you have suffered in silence for far too long. We are saddened that many others are no longer here to share this moment. In particular, we remember those affected by these practices who took their own lives. Our profound sympathies go to their families. To redress the shameful mistakes of the past, we are committed to ensuring that all those affected get the help they need, including access to specialist counselling services and support, the ability to find the truth in freely available records and assistance in reconnecting with lost family. We resolve, as a nation, to do all in our power to make sure these practices are never repeated. In facing future challenges, we will remember the lessons of family separation. Our focus will be on protecting the fundamental rights of children and on the importance of the child's right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. With profound sadness and remorse, we offer you all our unreserved apology. Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, to be on the committee to draft the apology for forced adoption. It was a tough task. We were very ably led, but a number of people who had been the victims of forced adoption appeared before the committee. They were mainly the mothers forced to give up their babies for adoption, and even a father appeared before the committee. People like Paul Howes also appeared. It was quite an experience for me. I should stress that the reason I appeared on the committee drafting the national apology for forced adoptions is that my sister had had a child adopted when she was 14. She has never classed it as a forced adoption, although my mum was a single parent at the time. My dad had left and there were nine kids in the house. My sister gave as much content as a pregnant 14year-old child can give. However, that has been a fantastic story as far as adoptions go. My nephew Andrew Garvey was adopted by a wonderful family. He has had a magnificent relationship with the family who adopted him and my sister now has a great relationship with him.

223,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (10:15,"It was my honour to be asked by the previousfamily member. He fits in wonderfully, and it is great to have a new nephew. I think Andrew is a constituent of the member for Solomon, although I hope he does not support her! I will have to check with him next time. I catch up with him. However, not every person involved with forced adoptions has had such a wonderful experience. Being on the committee that drafted the national apology for forced adoption, we heard incredibly sad tales. In the consultations around Australia-not that I was involved in all of those as I went only to the ones in Brisbane-we heard horrific tale after horrific tale. I urge people to read the report of the Senate committee, chaired by the Greens Senator Rachel Siewert, that set up the process that led to the Prime Minister delivering the national apology for forced adoption on Thursday, 21 March this year. Unfortunately, democracy being what it is, that day was not a great day. It was also the day of the faux coup, and that took a lot of the attention of the nation from the forced adoption apology. However, those people who were in the Great Hall and heard the Prime Minister's apology were moved significantly, including the Leader of the Opposition since this was a bipartisan event. The apology from the Prime Minister was significant although it will not make up for past wrongs and it could never make up for the heartache of those who never got to see their mum or their families and who have never found out who their parents are. Not everyone has a magnificent story like Andrew Garvey, my nephew, not that that story does not have a heartache attached to it as well. However, the nation saying sorry was a significant gesture. My first day in parliament was the day the member for Griffith, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, delivered an apology to the stolen generation. That was the very first thing I did as a member of parliament in Canberra. There was a welcome to country first and then we had the apology. It was an incredibly moving moment. It was an apology that has been heard around the world and that gesture lifted the standing of this nation. Again, it was a bipartisan gesture from both sides of parliament. I remember Brendan Nelson, then Leader of the Opposition, delivering the apology on behalf of the opposition. These as well as the other national apology are significant gestures. As there is a Western Australian in the chamber, the deputy leader of the opposition, I particularly mention the contribution of the member for Swan, which was incredibly moving. He is surely one of the most significant gentlemen in this parliament. He is well liked on both sides of the chamber. The way he carried himself throughout his speech is a memory I will always have. I remember his first speech when he touched on some of these messages as well. It was incredibly moving. The national apology for forced adoptions is something that we should be proud of as a parliament. These chambers can be quite adversarial sometimes, but I remind the Australian people that we can step up and do things in the national interest and be united. Thursday, 21 March, when the Prime Minister delivered the national apology for forced adoptions, is a day that should be remembered, and I am particularly proud of it. I commend the apology to the House. debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",171,Motions
224,The Deputy Speaker,"Order! The debate is adjourned and the resumption of theMilitary Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, which extends the interim measures applicable to the military justice system following the invalidation of the act establishing the Australian Military Court in 2009. This is the second time. I will speak on an interim measures military justice bill-almost two years to the day that I spoke on the last interim justice bill. The interim measures are about the ability to actually pay the current judges who sit on the tribunals because we still do not have a military justice bill in the House to debate-staggering I know, unbelievable at best. A little history is always good. The Australian Military Court was established in 2007 in a bipartisan series of legislation following a number of Senate committees and other reports. On 26 August 2009, the High Court handed down a decision in Lanev Morrison that found the Australian Military Court unconstitutional. The High Court found unanimously that the provisions of the DFDA 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because it purported to exercise judicial power over the Commonwealth but did not meet the requirements of chapter III of the Constitution. Therefore, the interim measures bill was put into the parliament in 2009 to deal with the issues at hand and provide interim measures so that judges and other judicial officers could be paid. We were told by Minister Faulkner at the time, in 2009, that this was about rectifying the military legal problems and that it would be afforded the government's highest priority. Yet by 22 June 2011 we still had no bill in the House to deal with Australian military justice. So the first interim measures came in, and here we are two years later-four years after the Minister for Defence said, 'this will be afforded the government's highest priority'-and we are still passing interim measures bills so that justices can be paid, because this government cannot get a bill together to put in place a military court that satisfies the constitutional requirements. It is simply and utterly staggering. But when you look at the litany of this government's highest priorities, even in Defence, it is staggering. I will read a paragraph from my speech on 22 June 2011: Keeping military matters in mind, in 2007-I look at the member for Moretonand, surprise, surprise, here he is againwho came in in 2007-the government said in the election campaign that one of its highest priorities was to address the fairness of the indexation of defence pensions. Well, Member for Moreton, you came in on that platform, you came in spruiking the fairness of veterans' pensions. After six years, where are we? What have you done, sir, to ensure that military pensions for DFRDB are properly indexed? What has the member for Moreton done? The answer is: nothing. Mr Perrett interjecting-",172,Motions
225,Mr Robert (Fadden) (10:22,"I rise on behalf of the coalition to lead some commentsfind a way to explain to your constituents why, in six years, you have done nothing for the veterans of our country. In 2009, it was 'the highest priority to address the issue of military justice.' It was the highest priority to index military pensions. Nothing was done in six years. Do you know what another highest priority was, Mr Deputy Speaker? Defence of the realm and national security were the highest priority. Prime Minister Rudd issued the first national security statement and promised that every single year he would update that. He never updated it, and the current Prime Minister has done one. We have had two in six years-and national security is the 'highest priority'. In fact, national security is of such a high priority that the current Prime Minister would not attend the National Security Committee of cabinet; she would send her bodyguard. That is how much 'high priority' the Prime Minister puts on national security. An honourable member: One of the members of the National Security Committee told us. national security is so important, why has this government cumulatively cut $25 billion from defence-statement of fact? Why, if it was such a high priority? I am sick and tired of this government's 'highest priorities' when it comes to defence. We had the budget handed down on Tuesday. Defence apparently did well: a 2.25 per cent increase in the budget. So it kept up with CPI. But when you read through it-their great announcement that there would be $2.9 billion for electronic attack warfare Growlers, how much extra money did the government give for Growler attack? Was it $200 million? $2.7 billion is absorbed. Federation Chamber is the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013. I would just like to draw his attention to that and bring him back to the bill before the chamber. Minister for Defence said; we are onto our third in six years. He said it was the highest priority. To understand what the minister says when it comes to 'highest priority', a history lesson is also worthwhile. Let me conclude with another paragraph out of the last speech I gave on this bill-which was to provide interim measures-two years ago. I said: If it takes two years to move to reaffirm the interim measures bill, which was the highest priority, frankly I am not holding my breath on the government's capacity, capability, courage and conviction to actually get a proper bill before the House. That is what I said two years ago. I went on: It is 12 months since fundamental injustice day, 12 months since the government lost its way. The Prime Minister's three priorities are still nowhere. All we have learnt is that the Prime Minister's highest priorities simply do not get any priority and the Minister for Defence's highest priorities get zero priority. That is a fabulous analogy for this wretched governmentmoribund, rotten and incapable of actually setting an agenda or a vision for the nation; setting priorities it does not keep and setting agendas it has no hope of ever reaching.",173,Bills

Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, a piece of legislation that I know a lot about. I would have thought that the shadow Defence spokesperson would have looked at the legislation and made some contribution. Obviously he is not that familiar with military justice. However, perhaps he will make the time to look into it. Justice in the military is obviously a complicated issue. It is that classic intersection between the personal rights of a member of the ADF and the national interest. Historically, the justice meted out in the military has been quite severe. If you are a member of the ADF, something as simple as falling asleep at work-which could happen in this parliament and might involve ridicule-could result in a significant loss of life among your colleagues, and therefore the penalty for falling asleep on your watch is quite significant. So there are different standards of justice in the military, and appropriately so. Obviously, they have evolved over the years. Hopefully, we are at the last and most logical iteration and, in light of the High Court's decision, this additional bill will bring resolution. I should declare a slight interest in this because in my spare time-not that I have much-I am a legal officer, a flight lieutenant, in the RAAF. So it is an area of law that I am particularly interested in. And certainly the High Court challenge in the case of Lane and Morrison changed the approach to military justice. I would like to mention a couple of people from my electorate who are also legal officers in the RAAF-Uso Akari and Mike Nichols. They are two lawyers who give their time to go and work in the reserves. I mention them because they are from my electorate-I could mention many others. I should also mention our panel chair, David Montgomery, who does a great job. He has provided significant amounts of advice to me as to how this legislation should proceed-which I have done my best to pass on, I assure you, Monty. But getting it right does take a little bit of time. The history of this legislation, as stated earlier by the member for Moncrieff, is that there has been a bipartisan approach.

235,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (10:30,"I rise to speak on the Military Justice (Interimcomprising a chief military judge, two permanent military judges and a part-time reserve panel of judges-it is important to get that balance right. At the time, the Howard government hoped that the Australian Military Court would satisfy the principles of impartiality and judicial independence. I think there was advice about the implications under the Constitution and that it would actually have contravened chapter III of the Constitution, but people made the call at the time. I do not begrudge the Howard government, the defence minister of the time or the Attorney-General; it was a reasonable call to make. Obviously, in hindsight it was the wrong call. I do not fault the logic of the justices in the Lane and Morrison case. However, we do need to get it right and, despite all the bluff and bluster of the shadow spokesman for defence, we need to get it correct. Having a look at the type of people who will be able to step up is obviously one of the reasons there has been some delay in making sure that we get it right. This interim measure, hopefully, will not have effect for long but will be a precursor to a system of justice that will support the individual member of the ADF but also apply the military discipline that is so important in peacetime in places such as Amberley. But it has to be the same military justice system that is operating on the front line in Afghanistan. As we heard from the Minister for Defence this morning when he addressed the parliament, there can be incredible stress placed on our ADF personnel, whether they be on ships, in the air or at the front line. They have to make incredibly quick calls about the rules of engagement and how they will operate in certain circumstances-this is especially so in places like Afghanistan, where the Taliban are working alongside you, in secret, with the intent of doing you harm. So it is important to get the right legal advice and the right rules of engagement and to know how they will operate. The modern soldier is a very skilled operator. The standards that we see in the ADF are incredibly high. I first encountered the ADF through the parliamentary participation program, when I spent a week out at Amberley. I was blown away at how professional our ADF personnel were, particularly those in the RAAF-I say that because all of my cousins are in the RAAF. In fact, my cousin is in the media at the moment. I was speaking to her on Monday night. It is amazing because of the phone links. They are just going about their business in 51 degree heat with full body armour, but with modern communications they can just phone home as well. The modern world has particular challenges but the modern military justice still has to go back to the core basics of maintaining discipline while being fair, and of entitling people to the appropriate representation. I commend the legislation to the House. Measures) Amendment Bill 2013. Today's bill will extend the interim regime established by the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 following the High Court's invalidation of the original legislation establishing the Australian Military Court in Lanev Morrison in 2009. The Labor government previously announced details of the Military Court of Australia Bill 2012 as legislation to conclude the interim measures; however, as I understand it, the government has not yet adequately worked through the many unresolved legal issues in that bill. Therefore, the coalition supports these interim measures as drafted. The interim regime provides for the appointment and remuneration of the Chief Judge Advocate and other statutory office holders on a fixed tenure of four years, which will expire",175,Bills
236,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (10:38,"I rise to speak on the Military Justice (Interimin September 2013. The purpose of today's bill is to extend their tenure for an additional two years or such lesser period as the Minister for Defence specifies by legislative instrument. From my many engagements with the ADF I know that all Australian Defence Force members take their roles and the responsibility that comes with being in the ADF very seriously and act accordingly. It is true, however, that we have a criminal law system set up with courts to deal with transgressions against the law, and in the same way we have encoded in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 the transgressions against the law by servicemen and servicewomen which, in their conduct through the ADF, are not civilian in nature and should be dealt with by a specific military court, not just a federal magistrate. The concept of the Military Court of Australia is therefore a recognition that the role of Australia's military justice system is to support command in reinforcing discipline and enhancing operational effectiveness. In terms of serious service offences, it takes the adjudicatory role function away from the ADF chain of command, which I will touch on later, and may comprise judicial officers who have a genuine understanding of the nature of service in the ADF by reason of their experience or training. The establishment of an independent military court is not a new issue. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee conducted an inquiry into the effectiveness of the military justice system, and in that report it recommended that the Australian Military Court be established for serious service offences committed by ADF personnel. At the time, the committee recognised reforms that had been undertaken in other countries, including the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. It recognised that there is a lack of impartiality in courts martial and that there is a growing international trend towards independent military judicial officials in recognition of the fact that allowing service personnel access to independent and impartial tribunals makes for a more effective military justice system. The Howard government implemented 32 of the 40 recommendations and established the Australian Military Court on 1 October 2007. However, in August 2009, as a result of the Lanev Morrison case, the High Court of Australia unanimously found that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and provisions which created the Military Court were constitutionally invalid, as Commonwealth judicial power could only be exercised under chapter III of the Constitution. The Australian Military Court was therefore suspended, and a bipartisan approach was taken with the Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence to return serious service offences to the old approach-namely, the system of courts martial and Defence Force magistrate trials. During that process, given that all convictions recorded by the AMC between October 2007 and 26 August 2009 were consequentially invalid, legislation was passed to give effect to many of the punishments and orders made by the AMC, and punishment was reviewed for those convicted under the AMC practice. It has taken significant time to fully consider legislation that is in concordance with the use of Commonwealth judicial power under chapter III. The issue was sidelined, unfortunately, when the bill presented in June 2010 lapsed when parliament was dissolved on 19 July 2010, when the federal election was called. I would like to take this opportunity to comment on those lingering legal issues around the establishment of the Military Court of Australia. In the submissions that have been made over the years about this issue, there are two main concerns about the structure and function of the court. First, the Military Court of Australia, by design, will not feature a jury process, normally afforded to all Australian citizens in section 80 of the Constitution, which states: The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes. In particular, the Returned and Services League, or RSL, is concerned that a court with only one military judge acting alone would be in contravention of the rights normally afforded to all Australian citizens, and that includes our servicemen and servicewomen. The original explanatory memorandum to the Military Court of Australia Bill 2012 claimed that a Military Court of Australia would be 'compatible with the human rights and freedoms recognised or declared in the international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011' by engaging the following rights: the right to a fair trial, which means 'a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal'; freedom from arbitrary detention; the right to humane treatment in detention; and the right to privacy. In terms of establishing a competent, independent and impartial tribunal, the court was to be set up such that people serving presently in the ADF would not be eligible to be a judge or federal magistrate under the court, and furthermore that the Military Court would be independent from the military chain of command. Importantly, in line with the practices of the Federal Court of Australia, the court would involve procedures for making appeals from the Appellate and Superior Division of the Military Court for decisions in the General Division of the McA. Of course, following that process, appeals can be made to the High Court of Australia. There would be offences contained in schedule 1 which delimit the types of classes and the circumstances under which someone alleged to have committed an act is to be tried. Those are class 1 offences, including offences relating to operations against an enemy and desertion, as well as offences including murder, manslaughter and serious sexual offences, which must be heard and determined by the Appellate and Superior Division of the Military Court of Australia. This is in line with serious criminal offences at the civilian level, which are heard by judges of a superior court-that is, the Supreme Court, rather than a magistrate's court. Other offences, as the explanatory memorandum notes, relate to service offences that go to the very core of maintaining discipline and morale in the ADF: abandoning or surrendering a post, harbouring enemies, failing to carry out orders, mutiny, desertion and dangerous conduct. I note that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in 2012 advised that it would not conduct a parallel inquiry into this issue given that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee was also investigating the issue. I note that its report was published on 9 October 2012. During that process the coalition continued its deliberations and issued a dissenting report. The Liberal senators made three recommendations based on their concerns. They ultimately decided that all members of the ADF are entitled to the same rights and protections that other Australians receive in a chapter 3 court, and therefore recommended that the bill be amended to include the right to trial by jury for all offences which would customarily be listed on indictment in the civilian context. Therefore, the right to trial by jury should be afforded for service offences with a punishment of more than 12 months imprisonment. Secondly, they acknowledged the concerns of groups like the Australian Defence Association that permanent or active reservists would be ineligible for appointment to the Military Court, and as such recommended that, to the extent that chapter 3 of the Constitution would allow for permanent reservists and standby reservists to be appointed as judicial officers of the Military Court, as a consequence the available pool would be expanded to include people who have an understanding of military service and as such can make a meaningful contribution to the Military Court itself. I strongly agree that it is all very well for judicial officers to have an understanding of military service, but real experience of service and of battle provide an insight into the challenges of military decision making that a mere 'suitable understanding' cannot possibly achieve. The coalition senators noted that an important consequence of this recommendation would be to increase confidence in the court from both within the ADF and in the general public. I noted in my maiden speech my appreciation for the sacrifices that our troops make around the world. I also highlighted the fundamental importance of clear rules of engagement prior to entering any conflict. I said at the time: … if this nation fails to cloak our soldiers with the full protection of the law when they go into battle, we fail them all. The rules of engagement must be crystal clear and our support strong. If we put Australian troops into the heat of battle and expect them to take enormous risks on our behalf, we cannot expect them to be split-second lawyers as well. The ongoing consideration of the Military Court of Australia is an important part of that process of supporting and protecting our troops which, I have noted, is integral to the morale and well-being of ADF personnel. The coalition will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to ensure that all issues are resolved appropriately. More generally, and ultimately, it is up to the federal government to support its troops. This Labor government has cut more than $25 billion from Defence, which has crippled the Defence industry sector. In the last three years the industry has lost more than 5,000 jobs and will continue to shed jobs in light of this government's mismanagement of Defence. In 2009 the then Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner, predicted that the local workforce would be as high as 34,000 by 2013. Today, however, that figure stands between 24,000 and 25,000 local jobs according to the Defence Materiel Organisation. Clearly, the Labor government's savage cuts to Defence are translating into a struggling Australian industry. This is unacceptable for what is a vital strategic sector of our economy. We should be supporting the growth of a home-grown Defence industry, not continuing to pull the rug out from underneath it. The Defence community has, since 2007, being represented by a Labor government that does not listen or support it, nor even action its own 2009 Defence white paper. More recently, the Minister for Defence released the 2013 Defence white paper, which was full of impressive photo opportunities but had no plan, no schedule and no money. In a document that talks boldly of new ships, new submarines and new aircraft there is no dollar figure listed for their construction. At the next election Australians have a choice between the Labor Party, which offers empty rhetoric on defence issues and has no intention of even paying lip service to restoring more than $25 billion of cuts, and a new government with a proven track record, a coalition government that will restore hope, reward and opportunity for our defence forces. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Minister for Defence Materiel) (10:50): I thank the member for Ryan for her comments and I congratulate her son for his service. Please pass on our regards and thanks to him for that service, particularly having returned from the difficult environment of Afghanistan. I have had the opportunity to observe and understand the nature of that service. This obviously has been an issue that has been fraught for some time. There have been many attempts to navigate some of the vagaries of the issues thrown up by military justice. In reply to some of the comments that were made about our commitment to defence spending, as you have seen in this budget, that spending has actually increased. In my quarter of a century of involvement in security policy in this country and in the Defence Force, I have never seen a more significant delivery of capability to the Defence Force in that time. It is a very exciting time for the Defence Force. We have carefully balanced the challenges of defence capability planning and are delivering capability that is going to set this country up very well for its security needs and for its ability to respond to disasters both nationally and within the region as well. I congratulate our service personnel, our service chiefs and all of those within the Defence Materiel Organisation who have helped us manage that difficult challenge of juggling the delivery of that capability with our revenue needs. In summing up the debate on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, I would like to thank all of those who have taken an interest in this issue and who have contributed to the debate. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the High Court on 26 August 2009 found unanimously that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because they were not consistent with the requirements of chapter 3 of the Commonwealth Constitution. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 was subsequently passed by this parliament to reinstate the pre-2007 military justice arrangements. This act ensured that military discipline arrangements, in particular the system of court martial and Defence Force magistrate trials, continued to operate effectively. The reinstatement of the pre-2007 military justice system was also required to allow time for the consideration and development of options for a new military justice system consistent with the requirements of chapter 3 of the Constitution. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 provided for a tenure of up to two years for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocate's panel. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011 previously extended the appointment arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocate's panel for a two-year period. However, this tenure is due to expire in September. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013 will continue the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocate's panel for an additional two years or until the Minister for Defence declares by legislative instrument a specified day to be a termination day, whichever is sooner. The purpose of Australia's military discipline system is to support command in maintaining and enforcing service discipline in order to enhance operational effectiveness. A military discipline system that supports the authority and effectiveness of commanders is of vital importance in the operation of the Australian Defence Force. This bill is one contribution in support of an effective military discipline system. In closing, I would also like to say that both the coalition and the government have a bipartisan approach to the funding of the Defence Force. It is pleasing to see there is now certainty in that respect going forward. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (New Mandate and Other Measures) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10:55): I rise to speak on Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (New Mandate and Other Measures) Bill 2013. This is the second bill dealing with the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, EFIC, that has come before parliament this year. As I noted in my speech regarding the previous bill, according to its official website, EFIC provides finance and insurance solutions to help Australian exporters overcome the financial barriers they face when growing their businesses overseas. It is the Australian government's export credit agency and assists export trade or overseas investments where the private market is unable to do so. Specifically, EFIC works directly with exporters or with their banks to provide loans, guarantees, bonds and insurance products not otherwise able to be provided by the private sector. The previous bill sought to amend the financial arrangements of EFIC to provide for the payment of a special dividend of $200 million and any adjustments to EFIC's callable capital that may be necessary in future. The coalition did not oppose the bill at that time because we knew that this was just another aspect to Labor's failings when it comes to the management of its budget. It was part of the government's raid for every dollar of cash it could raise, and in fact it was surprising that EFIC had been untouched up until that time. This $200 million raid on EFIC came about because the government's finances are in a mess, and on Tuesday night we saw one of the most dishonest budgets presented since Federation. Labor's budget surplus promise is farcical, no-one believes it-I do not why they even bother to say it. The budget has plans for more and new taxes. reply from the opposition leader tonight and I will draw the deputy opposition leader back to the bill. Ms JULIE BISHOP: I am explaining why EFIC is now $200 million shorter than it had been. And this budget exposes the budget crisis that has engulfed Labor and has caused them to make this call on EFIC's reserves. This government stands for higher debt and more deficits and more taxes, and if the Treasurer had a shred of integrity, he would have stood aside as he",176,Bills
237,The Deputy Speaker (Ms K Livermore,"I think that this can be dealt with in theis unable to manage the nation's finances. He said he was going to take his medicine, and if he wants to take his medicineof the Opposition will not invite interjections. Please return to the bill. Ms JULIE BISHOP: If the Treasurer says that he wants to take his medicine he should be held accountable for the mess that the government's finances are in. On this present bill, we will not oppose it. Like the previous bill, it follows recommendations and findings of the 2012 Productivity Commission inquiry report into Australia's export credit arrangements. It will principally permit the provision of increased services to small and medium-sized businesses and will permit more of EFIC's resourcesreduced resources because of the $200 million raid on its callable reserves-to be directed to Australian small and medium-sized enterprises that face genuine barriers to accessing finance for export operations. EFIC will also be given a limited expansion of its guarantee powers so that it can better support Australian businesses and their integration into the global value chains. The bill also seeks to ensure that EFIC does not have a competitive advantage over other businesses in the private sector. In summary, the bill implements the Productivity Commission's recommendations that EFIC should be subjected to the government's competitive neutrality principles. Consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission and the 2003 Uhrig review, the bill will also remove the requirement to have a government member on EFIC's board of directors, and we welcome that, because this will increase the board's independence from government. It is expected that the market-failure test and the requirement to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises will reorient EFIC's operations on its commercial account towards supporting commercially viable-and I stress they must be commercially viable-export focused small and medium enterprises seeking to access export finance. The government notes that the bill is required to ensure EFIC's support in domestic supply chains can only be provided when it involves a contract that is integral to final exports of capital and non-capital goods and services. The government also states that the bill is required to broaden EFIC's guarantee powers to enable EFIC to guarantee loans of foreign based subsidiaries of Australian based small and medium enterprises, where the purpose of the guarantee is to support 'Australian export trade' and where the SME certifies that the guarantee will not result in a net reduction in the number of its employees in Australia during the term of EFIC's guarantee. This will require a new definition of 'Australian export trade' in the bill to ensure that EFIC support is linked to benefits to Australia including through increased exports, access to new markets or increased dividend flows to Australia. The coalition does not see any particular alarm bells ringing with these changes, and we will always support changes that will enhance EFIC's services to small and medium sized businesses. But I take the opportunity of noting that, like virtually everything this government does, there is always an alternative backstory. In the last EFIC bill, as I pointed out, Labor raided the coffers of EFIC, stripping $200 million out of the agency. Even with this raid the budget figures show that the government will breach the $300 billion debt ceiling limit it",181,Bills
238,Honourable Members Interjecting,,182,Bills
239,The Deputy Speaker,"Order! There will be no interjections and the Deputy Leaderproposed by legislation during the forward estimates period. Small businesses have every reason to be disgusted with the way they have been abandoned by this government, as evidenced in Tuesday night's budget. Labor is at war with small business and it is obvious that Labor never seems to appreciate the fact that small business employs around half of all employees in Australia today. The Treasurer might talk about his budget being about jobs and growth, but he forecast a rise in unemployment and a fall in the rate of economic growth, and small business bears the brunt of that. It will take a change of government for small business to have a government on its side. However, the small changes in this bill may provide some support for small and medium-sized enterprises that are seeking to enter export markets. The coalition will not oppose the bill. Insurance Corporation Amendment (New Mandate and Other Measures) Bill 2013. EFIC is a very important part of our economy assisting small businesses in their efforts to export to the world market. I agree with the principles of this bill. However, I am concerned by some of the detail. I do not oppose the bill, but some of the detail will need to be looked at very closely in practice to see how it works and to ensure that it does benefit small business. I have experience in this area as I have worked with EFIC to look for export finance and insurance for overseas projects and overseas contracts. The government in the explanatory memorandum sets out the purpose of this bill as giving 'new powers to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to better support Australian small and medium-sized businesses participating in global and regional value chains'. And don't small businesses need that assistance at the moment! The only way our small businesses can compete on the international playing field is if they have some type of competitive advantage. This government, with all its policies, seems to want to take away that competitive advantage. We have seen with the implementation of the carbon tax that the government is simply putting Australian exporters at a competitive disadvantage and making it harder for them to export to overseas markets. We have heard the government try and pretend that all other nations are having a carbon tax and that many other nations are putting on a carbon tax. The facts are that Australian exporters have to pay the world's highest carbon tax, which simply puts them at a competitive disadvantage. We are putting lead in our exporters' saddlebags, forcing them to compete on export markets overseas but placing them at a competitive disadvantage. That is the background. That is why anything we can do to assist our small and medium sized exporters is very important. The specific concern I have about this bill is changing what is known as the market gap test to the market failure test. In the explanatory memorandum it notes that the government accepts that competitive neutrality principles should apply to EFIC to ensure that it does not have a net competitive advantage over other business or potential competitors. What that means for small business is that EFIC does not have a competitive advantage over our four major banks, because the reality is that when our small businesses want to seek finance to assist them with their exports, here in Australia they only have a choice of the four big banks. When we talk about market failure and failure in markets, one thing that is often thrown up about small business when they ask for improvements in competition laws or they suggest",182,Bills
240,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (11:02,"I am pleased to speak on the Export Finance and that competition is not working is that competition harms competitors. If that is true, how is it possible that all four of our big banks are at the moment substantially increasing their profits at the same time? It simply defies the logic that competition harms competitors. So what we see is the Reserve Bank interest rates, the decline we have seen in the Reserve Bank cash rate, simply not being passed on to the interest rates that small business is paying. Why is that? Why are small businesses in Australia being denied those interest rate decreases that the RBA has mandated? Why are they not being passed on to small business? Again that places Australian small business at a competitive disadvantage. If a small business in Australia is working on a tender in the Middle East, in America, in Europe or somewhere in Asia and they are competing against firms from those countries, those companies have access to finance from their banking systems at much lower rates than Australian exporters do from our banking system here. Why is that? I suggest there are three reasons. Firstly, under this government there has been such a blowout in the risk and such a deterioration in the conditions for small business that the banks are factoring that in and charging small business high rates. The alternative is that the banks are simply gouging small businesses with higher interest rates. The third explanation is a combination of the above. Therefore I have great concern over the wording of this bill when it talks about a market failure test for small businesses seeking finance, especially for their export activities. There is already a very strong case that market failure exists at the moment for a small business seeking finance. When it comes to the principles of competitive neutrality, they are principles we should support, providing those markets are competitive. However, we have seen hypocrisy from the government in this respect, especially with what is known as the Community Energy Efficiency Program, because that program does not follow the principles of competitive neutrality. It is a program that is only available to local councils but it is not available to the small business community. One example of that is in the area of private swimming pools and swimming lessons. If a council owns a swimming pool at which it teaches kids to swim, it is entitled to seek to offset some of the higher electricity costs caused through the carbon tax by seeking a grant through the Community Energy Efficiency Program, but a small business competing against that locally run government institute cannot obtain that same grant. So here we have the government in this bill talking about the importance of competitive neutrality principles but doing the opposite in other directions. As I said previously, the coalition does not oppose this bill, but we must see how these changes affect it in principle. We must keep a very close eye on them because we do not want to see situations arise in this country where this government does a single thing more to place Australian small businesses at a greater competitive disadvantage than they already are with all the government's mistaken policies. members for their participation in this debate and I thank the opposition for its support of the legislation before us, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (New Mandate and Other Measures) Bill 2013. I wish to comment on the remarks made by the member for Hughes concerning the carbon price. He ran out the tired old chestnut of the world's highest carbon tax. Mr Craig Kelly interjecting-",183,Bills
241,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills,"Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (11:10): I thankreferring to the expression which you used, which is manifestly incorrect. In fact, the government has moved to link the carbon price with the carbon price being applied by close to 50 European countries. We will have exactly the same price as those 50 European countries, so it is simply absurd to run out the tired old chestnut that we are applying the world's highest carbon price. Mr Craig Kelly interjectingare indeed the engine room of job creation in this country and they will be the big winners following passage of this bill. In September 2011 the government commissioned the Productivity Commission to review Australia's export credit arrangements. Our response to the Productivity Commission's review, which was announced earlier this year, set out some adjustments to the mandate, the powers and the governance and financial arrangements of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. This bill implements those changes. The new mandate for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation will ensure that more of its resources are devoted to smalland medium-sized enterprises which face financial barriers to exporting. The bill also gives the EFIC new powers to enable it to better support Australian businesses participating in global and regional value change. Increasing participation in regional value change will result in increased specialisation and productivity as Australian companies move up the value chain focussing more on high value-added activities. This bill forms part of a commitment in the Australia in the Asian Century white paper to direct more of EFIC's resources to smalland medium-sized enterprises looking to expand into Asia and other emerging and frontier markets. EFIC already plays a valuable role in assisting exporters but these reforms will help it to keep pace with changes in the global economy, particularly through EFIC's improved ability to support Australian companies to integrate into regional value change. While EFIC's new focus will be on helping smalland medium-sized enterprises with their overseas endeavours, EFIC's mandate will not preclude it from supporting larger firms should they too face market failures, particularly when doing business in emerging and frontier markets. Through the introduction of a tax equivalent payment and debt neutrality charge or guarantee fee, the bill will also ensure that EFIC does not have a net competitive advantage over other businesses in the private sector. The bill will also remove the government member from EFIC's board. That will increase the board's independence from government. The amendments in this bill will reorient EFIC's operations towards those smalland medium-sized exporters who face genuine market failures in accessing finance, particularly those businesses operating in frontier and emerging markets. In getting around Australia in recent times I have been able to talk to a lot of smalland medium-sized enterprises who are doing well in terms of finding markets to which to export their products. They have been able to locate niche areas where quality counts for a great deal, where Australian branding counts for a great deal and is well received overseas, and they are doing well. You tend not to hear those stories. The stories that tend to make it onto the front pages of the media are about businesses closing their doors or laying off workers. Indeed,",184,Bills
242,Mr Kelvin Thomson,In fact it is not a tax. It is a price on carbon and I am simply,185,Bills
243,Mr Kelvin Thomson,"It is manifestly untrue. Smalland medium-sized enterprisesmembers of parliament often do not hear the good news stories because the businesses that are doing well do not have any cause to darken our doors, whereas those who are struggling may well seek to make contact with us. I can assure members here and people throughout the community more broadly that there are many Australian businesses that are doing extremely well with niche products, with high-end technology, with innovation and with good design, and they are taking advantage of Australia's reputation for quality and reliability. The bill demonstrates our strong commitment to delivering on the Australia in the Asian century white paper objectives, improving support to Australian businesses so that they can take advantage of the changes and opportunities occurring in our region. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. That the Federation Chamber do now adjourn. Agriculture Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (11:17): The south-west of Western Australia produces some of the best food and wine in the nation. Members already know of the iconic Margaret River and Geographe wine regions, but they should also be aware of the fruit and vegetables, dairy products and beef and lamb which mark the south-west of Western Australia as one of Australia's finest and most efficient food producing regions. If you are not aware, perhaps you should come along to my South-West Sensations Showcase, to be held here at Parliament House on 18 June, where you will receive a taste of what the region has to offer. To produce many of these products requires a workforce, and in many cases the workforce cannot be found locally. Agricultural areas in regional Australia might be areas of high production but they are not areas of high population. They often struggle to find workers in sufficient numbers. An obvious answer might seem to be to move Australians from areas of unemployment in our cities to the regions where the jobs are. But usually they will not go. So producers have for a generation had to source their workforce from overseas. There was no other choice. Many have sponsored workers on 457 visas in order to get their harvest done. Otherwise, you do not have a harvest. Backpackers have also contributed. They have filled fruit bins in Donnybrook, Manjimup, Busselton, Harvey and Margaret River for decades on their travels around Australia. However, backpackers alone are not the answer. Many arrive on farms unskilled and have to be taught the basics of picking. And then, having upskilled, they sometimes work for only a week or so before moving on. That is why a combination of shortand long-term workers is essential, and that is why access to 457 visa workers is vital to the rural industries. You only have to go out into my south-west to find out how vital they are. Talk to the growers. Ask them how they are able to actually get their crops. They will say to you it is only through a combination of backpackers and 457 visa holders.",185,Bills
244,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (11:17): I move:Recently there has been a surplus of backpacker workers in some areas, which, in conjunction with long-term staff, has assisted in taking some of the pressure off some producers. As soon as that happened, the Labor government jumped in-unfortunately-to make it harder again. Doubling the price of 457 visas from $450 to $900 is just another slap in the face for regional producers who feed the nation quality food. It is another example-as if we need it-of Labor's contempt, and I would say absolute contempt, for the farming, rural and regional communities. It is contempt. It is also another practical example-if we needed that-of budget mismanagement by the Gillard Labor government. We already have the example of gross debt reaching $356 billion, requiring another blowout in the nation's debt ceiling; and a net debt reaching $191 billion. We have a Labor Treasurer who promised a budget surplus this year but will deliver a $19 billion deficit. This Treasurer will never deliver a budget surplus. This was the Treasurer who promised that the budget last year would deliver a surplus this year on time, and surpluses the year after that, strengthening over time. The Treasurer also promised that the deficit years of the global recession were behind us and the surplus years were here. We are still waiting, Mr Treasurer. I look at all this debt, deficit and broken promises and I think: was there some funding in all of that for the completion of the Bunbury Outer Ring Road? It is nearly two-thirds built. It is unfinished. The final stage was originally budgeted at $260 million. It is probably now over $300 million. That is an urgently needed piece of infrastructure that deserves state and federal funding support. This is a practical way the government could have assisted in my part of the world, right throughout this process; instead, we have seen nothing but waste and mismanagement, and debt and deficit, which will be the signature of this Labor government and its legacy to this nation. Griffith Electorate: Playing Fields Party's plans to privatise a number of school playing fields on Brisbane's south side. Unilaterally, the Liberal National Party government has announced that playing fields at Balmoral State High School and Whites Hill College will be sold off. There was not a word of consultation with local P&Cs, who in previous decades have physically helped build these playing fields from nothing. There was not a word of consultation with the local community, whose local cricket teams and football teams use these fields regularly. There was not a word of consultation with the other local primary schools across Brisbane's south side, who also use these playing fields for their kids because in the inner southern suburbs there simply are not enough playing fields for the thousands of kids who use them and need to use them. Not only has there been no consultation but there is also no mandate from the people to flog off these playing fields at all. At no time prior to the last election did the Liberal National Party tell Brisbane south-side residents that they planned to privatise school playing fields. Not only is there no mandate, not only is there no consultation; there is no logic to this decision either. We all know when school populations go up and down. Local primary schools had small populations in my electorate 15 years ago. Now they are all bursting at the seams, without adequate playing fields. That is logical problem No. 1: school populations change. No. 2 is: once they are flogged off, no future government will ever be able to buy new playing fields in these inner-city suburbs because the real estate, nearly eight hectares in all, is just too expensive. Once they",186,Adjournment
245,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (11:22,"I rise today to inform the parliament of the Liberal Nationalare gone, they are gone. No. 3 is: it is utter madness to be flogging off scarce green space on Brisbane's south side, given community demand and the rising local populations occurring through urban consolidation. These fields are part of the lungs of our city of Brisbane. No. 4 is: what about child obesity? All governments go on and on and on about child obesity, encouraging kids to play sports. We are doing that on the one hand and flogging off their playing fields on the other, which will encourage them to retreat to their dens and play on the computer instead. I do not think that is smart. In fact, I think it is downright dumb. This decision lacks logic on all four counts. So far, more than 2,000 people have expressed their opposition to this heartless decision by signing my petition calling on the Liberal National Party government to reverse this short sighted approach. Take Bruce, one of the petitioners, for example, who said: 'I teach in a local Catholic school, and on a number of occasions we have had the pleasure of using the Balmoral High School oval for our sports days. It is a great community asset used by many outside the school. For this reason, I believe it needs to be protected.' So a Brisbane south-side community is up in arms about this. What has been the response from the Liberal National Party? One local P&C member wrote to the Liberal National Party member for Greenslopes. What was his response? 'Sorry, you have too much land.' That was it. What about the newly elected Liberal-National Party member for Bulimba? You would think he would be sympathetic. Don't bet on it! Mr Dillaway has told the Balmoral P&C he fully supports the sale but, on top of that, tried to convince the P&C that this decision had nothing to do with the government, it was an independent decision of the bureaucracy. Pigs might fly! I say this to the Liberal National Party: local people are not easily fooled at all. This has been a running insult to our local community. Anyone with half a brain knows that when school playing fields are sold off the sale must get the tick-off of the minister concerned. In fact, the Courier-Mail recently reported that the Liberal National Party member is one of many in the LNP party room who are staunch advocates of asset sales and think that the LNP government should go harder on asset sales. In fact, this local member does not think the LNP government has gone far enough. The Liberal National Party are treating Brisbane's south side with absolute contempt. They seem to think it is their land, not the community's land. Then there is the Liberal National Party candidate Mr Glasson. What is his position? The sounds of silence. Nothing. I love my local community. I have lived there for 25 years. I love its schools; I know each and every one of them-all 63 of them-and the great work they do with our local kids. I am angered beyond description by this appallingly short-sighted decision by the Liberal National Party, state and federal, deeply wedded to their ideological agenda of privatising anything they can. I have news for the Liberal National Party; together with the local community we will fight these decisions with one objective: to get them overturned to keep these playing fields for future generations. Centenary of ANZAC of the member for Griffith, whom I follow, in that I am going to commend the federal government for one of its programs. I stand here today on the cusp of retirement after 23 years",187,Adjournment
246,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (11:27,"My comments today are slightly different from those in federal parliament. I am grateful that one of the projects that will mark my final year in public life will be the facilitating of local commemorations for Australia's centenary of ANZAC. In Fairfax, as in every other electorate across the nation, local communities are being assembled to provide authentic, grassroots input into a milestone of exceptional historical significance. This community involvement is a tried and tested blueprint that follows the admirable Australia Remembers 1945-1995 campaign model, which I also had the opportunity to contribute to. That was an initiative of a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca. I know from my own experiences in my electorate that there is an increasing willingness by communities to engage in events and activities that commemorate our ANZAC past. I do not think Fairfax is unique in that regard. As the centenary of ANZAC draws closer, this community momentum will build right across Australia as we collectively mark this milestone in our history. It is a milestone that is transcending its military origins. It is a milestone that also symbolises the attributes that define us as a nation. In my electorate of Fairfax the centenary local grants committee brings together a dedicated group of community members who have willingly volunteered their time and energy. They have accepted their task with vigour and determination to ensure that sincere homage is paid to those who have served and sacrificed for our country and to those who continue to do so. I look forward to the outcomes of their efforts. Local resident the Reverend Ian Taylor, who is 86 years young with an exemplary military, missionary and chaplaincy record, is our committee chair. Time has not wearied his enthusiasm for community service. I have known Reverend Taylor for many years and have advocated for his selection in Gallipoli delegations, so far without success. But I am still hopeful for the future. It has been through my association with the reverend that another of my constituents, Marj Cheek, has sharpened my appreciation of ANZAC privileges. Marj shares not only a year of birth with the Reverend Taylor but also an aspiration to visit the shores of Gallipoli. For Marj, the motivation is highly personal and emotional. Her father served there. Marge's father is in a painting hanging in the War Memorial which depicts a scene from the trenches of Gallipoli. I hope both Reverend Taylor and Marj Cheek realise their Gallipoli goals. I also hope that many other direct descendants like Marj have the opportunity to attend the 2015 ceremony on the sacred site. The ANZAC legend was born from incredible human courage and sacrifice. I appreciate there has to be a process in place to best manage the ANZAC Day centenary commemoration at Gallipoli. But, generations on, I hope that those most deserving of their ticket for this once-in a-lifetime event do not become modern-day casualties of the ballot. I want to raise an issue that was covered by the budget which disappoints me greatly-that is, the decision by the government to close the Australian embassy in Budapest in Hungary. People here know that I was born in Hungary. There are 100,000 Hungarians living in Australia. They have a very active embassy in Budapest. When the member for Griffith was running around the world trying to get countries to support him in his endeavours for a seat on the Security Council for Australia, Hungary was one of only three European countries which supported Australia in that successful endeavour. I ask Senator Bob Carr, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to reconsider that decision. Downsize the embassy by all means if we need to save money but do not abandon the embassy in Hungary and those Hungarian people in Australia. Human Rights rights than that associated with the death penalty and the lives of our citizens. The right to life is a fundamental human right recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 as well as in the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights 1966. This year will be the 65th anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration, an occasion to acknowledge and recommit ourselves to the principles it stands for. At this time we should stand as a nation, particularly for the rights of Australian citizens Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, currently on death row in Bali, Indonesia. They have both been on death row for the last seven years and are just a stroke of a pen away from execution. Their situation was recently made worse with the Indonesian government's target of executing 10 condemned persons per year. In 2009 I was a part of setting up the cross-party working group on the death penalty, coconvened by my colleagues Senator Humphries and Senator Hanson-Young. The group was about promoting the abolitionist position in relation to capital punishment as well as specifically addressing matters involving Australian citizens on death row. I also undertook a study visit to Indonesia in 2011. I visited Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in Kerokoban prison along with Scott Rush, another young Australian who was at that stage on death row but who has fortunately had his sentence commuted since. While I was there, each of them spoke to me about their daily struggles and the prospect of being executed at any time. Whatever one might feel about the crimes Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran committed, it is impossible not to feel for them as human beings and also feel for their families. I would like to make it very clear that we all condemn the menacing world of drugrelated crime. I also note the difficult and commendable job that the Indonesian police do, along with their Australian counterparts, in doing everything they can to target not only drug crime but the effects that drugs have on our community. However, in a civil world the principle of punishment is that the punishment should fit the crime. After all, it is the heart of our judicial system and, as I understand it, it is also the central tenet of the Indonesian criminal justice system. My views against capital punishment became even stronger after a chance encounter with the parents of Scott Rush many years ago. As parents of three children, Bernadette and I really felt for Lee and Christine Rush in having not only a child on death row but the uncertainty of everything associated with that and simply relying on prayers and good conscience of all those who support their children. I speak today not just in pursuit of what I regard as a genuine human rights issue but also as a parent who holds the strong view that, regardless of what our children might do, nothing extinguishes the love and care we have for our kids. In concluding, I would like to leave you with words of former Chief Justice of the Constitution Court in South Africa, Ismail Mahomed, in speaking about the death penalty:",188,Adjournment
247,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (11:32,"There can be no more important public discourse on human… is the ultimate and the most incomparably extreme form of punishment … It is the last, the most devastating and the most irreversible recourse of the criminal law involving … the planned and calculated termination of life itself; the destruction of the greatest and most precious gift which is bestowed on all humankind. Justice Mahomed went on to say: It is not necessarily only the dignity of the person being executed that is invaded. Very arguably, the dignity of all of us in a caring civilisation must be compromised. I would encourage all members to take an interest in the current position in Indonesia in respect of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran and whatever efforts members can make to make their intentions known about the death penalty would be appreciated. Parkes Electorate: Life Skills Mudgee Slim Dusty issues in the debate this morning. Firstly, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the situation that the Life Skills organisation in Mudgee find themselves in. Life Skills is a day care and respite centre for disabled people in the Mudgee mid-western area. At the moment they are operating from a house in Mudgee. A couple of weeks ago the mayor of the mid-western council, Des Kennedy, along with the state member for Orange, Andrew Gee, and my neighbour Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, visited the Life Skills organisation. They were absolutely appalled at the conditions that they were operating under. Not only were the clients there working in very cramped and not very amenable conditions but the staff conditions were such that they were even using a portaloo in the backyard. In this day and age, caring for people with a disability in circumstances such as those is not acceptable. I will be working with my state colleague and, hopefully, with the assistance of the state minister Andrew Constance and the cooperation of the federal government, to try to reverse the situation that Life Skills Mudgee find themselves in. They have found another venue that they can move to-the ex-Harvey Norman premises in South Mudgee-which will be very suitable. I state now that I will be doing everything I can to make sure that they can make that move. I would like to remind the House that this year marks 10 years since country legend Slim Dusty passed away. It was a move afoot to make 13 June as the official National Slim Dusty Day and I endorse that. Quite a few A-list celebrities, including Keith Urban, Nicole Kidman, Kasey Chambers, Lee Kernaghan, Shane Nicholson, Ray Hadley, Dick Smith, Beccy Cole and Adam Harvey are all behind this proposal. Indeed, Slim Dusty's wife, Joy McKean, also supports the idea. This will be of great interest to the member opposite: on 13 June at the Rooty Hill RSL there will be a large concert to mark Slim's birthday and to start raising funds for the Slim Dusty museum at Kempsey. I raise the issue that Slim Dusty is an icon of legend in Australia, particularly for the people of the Parkes electorate. I represent one of the largest Aboriginal populations anywhere in Australia in this place. There is great affection in the Aboriginal community for Slim Dusty. Slim Dusty is one of the few top artists who took the time to travel to Aboriginal communities, to the regional areas, to deliver his brand of music to those people. I have been a Slim Dusty fan since I can remember. The very first record that our",190,Adjournment
248,Mr Coulton (Parkes,"The Nationals Chief Whip) (11:37): I would like to raise twofamily owned when we bought a radiogram prior to TV-and that is dating me a little-was a Slim Dusty record. As my family know, I have requested that when I pass from this earth there is a particular Slim Dusty song that I want played at my funeral. This might sound frivolous but it is not: Slim Dusty is by far the most prolific recording artist that this country has ever seen. I think he recorded something like 110 or so albums. He is without peer. More than anyone else, in his music he explained the psyche of the bush. He clearly understood what made people tick in Australia and his songs reflect that. Time prohibits me to go on to some of my favourite Slim Dusty songs, but I would encourage everyone to get behind the push to make 13 June national Slim Dusty Day and I would encourage my colleague opposite to attend the Rooty Hill RSL on 13 June to show his support for this wonderful cause. Beef Industry Ms SAFFIN (Page) (11:42): BeforeI start on the contribution I am here to make, I want to give my absolute support to the honourable member for Parkes's proposal to make 13 June national Slim Dusty Day. I wish to put on the record a statement. I have prepared on the state of the beef industry and specifically its representative bodies. I have called it 'Beef bodies fail farmers'. After a decade of stagnant farm gate prices, despite a billion dollars of farmers' and taxpayers' money being paid to industry bodies, beef producers are demanding a restructure of their industry to safeguard Australia's food security, secure better farm gate prices and to take advantage of growing demand from developing markets-and China is notably one. Beef producers, processors and exporters pay $5 per head to the Meat and Livestock Australia, MLA, every time an animal changes hands-totalling $96 million in revenue from members' levies-and received $44.5 million in 2010 alone from the federal government for R&D projects. That is more than $1 billion in compulsory levies paid in the last decade, yet producers feel the MLA and the Cattle Council of Australia, CCA, have failed to utilise the levies to their meaningful advantage. They highlight estimates that supermarkets increased retail beef prices by 50 per cent between 2000 and 2010, but cattle prices remained unchanged and margins eroded over the same time frame. Producers say MLA, the association that undertakes R&D and marketing on their behalf, does not effectively represent members' interests, their interests, and it lacks transparency and accountability in the way it apportions members' levies and inadequately reports R&D results. Producers also perceive that the Cattle Council of Australia, the peak council that is supposed to advise and in some way have some oversight of the MLA, is compromised because it relies in part on some MLA funding and lacks an effective executive board able to adequately advise on the strategic direction of R&D marketing. The fact that Australia has no adequate domestic meat-grading system in a climate of declining beef consumption suggests another obvious failure of the MLA and CCA to provide advantage to producers. According to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences, domestic consumption per capita declined from 41.3 kilograms in 1997 to under 33 kilograms in 2011. Industry sources estimate that 30 to 40 per cent of beef sold in Australian supermarkets comes from old cattle, and that consumer dissatisfaction with this poor-quality beef is a contributor to the decline. Since cattle producers receive little difference in price for old cows or young steers, there is currently little reward for producing top-quality meats: so says Norman Hunt from the Australian Meat Producers Group. With Chinese imports of Australian beef up 250 per cent in 2012 on the previous year, and set to keep rising, producers also lack the assurance that the MLA has sufficiently anticipated issues that could adversely affect market share. They recognise the MLA's weakness in this regard after its failure to work effectively with countries that import live Australian cattle to develop humanitarian approaches to slaughtering, despite millions of levy payers' dollars spent developing these markets: $25 million were spent developing the South-East Asian beef market from 2005 to 2011, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 November 2011. Many, including myself and the workers at the Northern Co-operative Meat Company in my electorate, believe live-trade animal abuse will continue despite Minister Ludwig's introduction of a systemic supply chain system-and this is the first time that has ever happened. This is also evidenced by the mistreatment of Australian cattle in Egypt recently. A shift from live exports to box-meat trade could prevent animal cruelty, save Australian owned country abattoirs-we have lost so many over the years(Time expired) Question agreed to. Federation Chamber adjourned at 11:48. Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (Question No. 1370) Ms O'Dwyer asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 13 March 2013: In respect of the Government's decision to remove from the 2012-13 Budget, funding for Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT) of non-diabetic, chronic wounds, (a) is it a fact that the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) misinterpreted the Hammarlund, C and Sundberg, T (1994), as indicated in submissions to the recent Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee Medicare funding for Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment Inquiry (and Dr Hammarlund and Professor Deeble), (b) will she, as a result of the Committee's conclusion (paragraph 2.77), revisit the Government's decision to remove funding for HBOT, (c) what is the Government's position on the Committee's conclusion (paragraph 2.78), that there is some likelihood that the costs from cutting the HBOT treatment option for non-diabetic wound patients may exceed any savings achieved, and (d) has the Government's response to the Committee's report been presented; if not, why not. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) No. (b to d) The Government response to the Report is currently under consideration. Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (Question No. 1371) Ms O'Dwyer asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 13 March 2013: Will the Government (a) consider the Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT) industry's proposal to adjust the Medicare rebate to ensure that until the current randomized control trial is completed, patients can receive treatment without costing the Government one extra cent beyond normal care without hyperbaric treatment; if not, why not, and (b) reconsider its position on removing the funding until the definitive study is completed. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) is an independent expert committee that advises me, as the Minister for Health, about whether a medical service should be publicly funded based on an assessment of its safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness, using the best available evidence. After considering the strength of the available evidence in relation to the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) for the treatment of non-diabetic chronic wounds, MSAC advised that HBOT was no more clinically effective than conventional wound care and recommended that continued public funding was not justified. The decision to remove funding for HBOT for chronic non-diabetic wounds from the Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) is consistent with the Government's commitment to evidence based decision making. The applicants for HBOT services have been provided with multiple opportunities spread over a decade, to meet the criteria for ongoing Medicare funding and have been unsuccessful on every occasion. HBOT continues to receive Medicare funding for a range of other indications, including soft tissue radionecrosis, diabetic wounds, and decompression illness. Medicare rebates are also available for attendance and surgery services for patients with chronic wounds. The applicants for HBOT services are able to resubmit an application to MSAC at any time. Medical Services Advisory Committee (Question No. 1375) Mr Alexander asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 14 March 2013: In respect of the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC), (a) how many positive deliberations are yet to receive finance review and/or ministerial approval for the release of the evaluation report, and of these, how many submissions have completed all the necessary steps aside from finance review and ministerial approval, (b) for the calendar years (i) 2005, (ii) 2006, (iii) 2007, (iv) 2008, (v) 2009, (vi) 2010, (vii) 2011, (viii) 2012, and (ix) 2013 (to date), what was the average length of time between the final MSAC meeting for approval of a submission and the release of the report, and (c) is she aware of any cases of MSAC approvals deferred on financial grounds; if so, can she provide a list containing each deferred item. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is not clear in this question what is meant by 'finance review' and 'ministerial approval'. The current MSAC process does not involve 'finance review' or 'ministerial approval' for the release of evaluation reports. The applicant is advised verbally of the outcomes of its submission within a fortnight, then provided with a written summary of each outcome approximately 10 weeks after the meeting. MSAC outcomes (in summary form) and full Public Summary Documents are published on the MSAC website as soon as they are available. There was no data collected prior to 2007. The average time across 2007 to 2013 was 180 days. In 2007 the average number of days was 282. In 2012 the average number of days was 64 – a 77% improvement. No. Medical Devices (Question No. 1378) Mr Alexander asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 14 March 2013: What is she doing to provide access to existing remote monitoring and follow up telehealth technology for implanted cardiac devices through the Medicare Benefits Schedule. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: An application has been made to the Medical Services Advisory Committee for Medicare funding of remote monitoring of implanted cardiac devices. This independent expert Committee advises me, as the Minister for Health, about whether a medical service should be publicly funded based on an assessment of its safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness, using the best available evidence. The proposed protocol for the assessment of remote monitoring was released for public consultation in 2012. The application will now be considered by the Committee. 457 Visa (Question Nos 1396-1417, 1419-1420, 1422-1426 and 1429-1442) Mr Briggs asked the Special Minister of State, in writing, on 19 March 2013: How many staff in the Minister's office are currently employed on a subclass 457 visa. Mr Dreyfus: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) supports the Special Minister of State in administering the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984. While Finance provides supporting personnel services for staff employed under the Act, it does not hold information on visa arrangements for individual staff.",191,Adjournment
