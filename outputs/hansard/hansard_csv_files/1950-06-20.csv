Is the Australian Capital Territory number plate shown when the car is being used in the Australian Capital Territory and the "" C "" number plate kept in a rack in the boot of the car?

Has the practice of providing government drivers for government vehicles, which was adhered to for a long period, heen departed from in any way? honourable members will be glad to know, is an attack upon my wife, I , myself, shall answer it. It is perfectly true that a Holden car that has already been used has been placed at the disposal of my wife to be driven when she is in Canberra. She, herself, as I think very properly, indicated that it seemed fantastic that when she had to go on relatively small errands a large car should have to be driven for that purpose and she indicated, therefore, that for the purposes of economy it would be desirable that a small car, if one were available, might be placed at her disposal so that she could use it when in Canberra on such occasional errands. done. The suggestion implicit in the honourable member's question-the foul suggestion-that the purpose of this matter is that some petrol may be obtained at the cost of the Government is an unworthy and a scandalous attack. It is without foundation and is entirely inconsistent with the approach of either my wife or myself to the privileges of office and our responsibilities for public money. explanation. honourable member been misrepresented? exception to the Prime Minister's statement that this was a foul attack. understatement. cerned about is that the Prime Minister has not answered my question. a matter for a personal explanation. caused the right honourable gentleman great personal embarrassment, has been designated as a foul attack.

28,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honorthe Ministerf o r Commerce and Agriculture relative to the rabbit menace, which has been the subject of a number of questions from time to time and which is now threatening the coastal areas of New South Wales, particularly those in the rnilk zone. W ill the Minister refer the problem to the Australian Agricultural Councilf o r consideration in the hope that that body may be able to develop Australia-wide proposals for an attack on this menace before tbe situation becomes more serious than it is at present? MrM o EWEN cussed this subject with officers 'of my department who, in turn, have discussed it with officers of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. The degree to which the Australian Government may assist in combating the rabbit, menace, nnd can lie devised on this matter between the Commonwealth and the States, and, perhaps, between the States themselves will be discussed, I hope, by a Cabinet sub-committee within the next 4S hours, and it w ill also be discussed within a few days by the standing committee of the Australian Agricultura l Council. I hope that some proposals will emerge from all of these discussions that will enable the matter to be considered by the next f u l l meeting of the council. the Prime Minister. Has the Government received an application fro m the Gosford Shire Councilf or urgent assistance in relation to the floods that took place in the Gosford area last week?

As the honourable I direct a question to member no doubt knows, we have dealt with certain representations by the New South Wales Government in relation to these floods and a few days ago we granted certain assistance on the same basis as that heretofore granted. I do not know whether an application for assistance has been made by the local governing body of any particular area. Minister state whether the Government will give assistance to the victims of the recent floods? W ill particularly sympathetic consideration be given to the claims of primary producers in the Hunter RiverI have recently disValley, many of whom have lost their crops six times in the last twelve months and bave also lost their homes, buildings and plant? The farmers concerned are not eligible to receive social services relief unless they are prepared to accept employment away from their farms. W ill the Government consider making relief funds what measure of co-operation available by way of direct grant rather than by meajis of loans, even at low interest rates, which would represent an added weight to farmers who are already overburdened ? the Government has already done in order to assist the victims of these most disastrous floods it w ill undoubtedly examine with very great sympathy all further claims for assistance which may arise for the relief of cases of hardship. stranger in the House? is deeply concerned about what has happened, particularly in the district to which the honourable member has referred, which has repeatedly suffered most grievous flood damage.

Commerce and Agriculture prepare a short statement of the reasons for the abolition of butter rationing in Australia in order to inform the public whether there was prior consultation with the British Government about the abolition, and also whether the loss of butter provided for B r i tain by our rationing, will actually affect the British butter ration? sidered the effect of this sharp decision upon trade relationships between Britain and Australia in regard to butter, having in mind the consistent Danish competition? Finally, will.the Minister provide the House with a table by which we can see how much butter and other fats, such as margarine, are still available to British people and what w ill be the equivalent loss caused by the cessation of butter rationing in Australia? MrM c EWEN I see no necessity to prepare a statement setting out consulaN o such request has tions that have taken place between this Government and the British Government on this matter. Butter rationing was imposed in this country by a government that the honourable member supported, and was so imposed, I understood, for I ask the Minister for the purpose of making available Australia's equitable contribution to Britain's butter requirements. Butter rationing was maintained by the present Government for that purpose only and was continued while the necessity existed. The United Kingdom knew that this Government was considering the abolition of butter rationing. The United Kingdom was acquainted with (ho decision wben it was made asked.

The position is quite simple. Until the end of butter rationing in Australia a few days ago the position bere was that the per capita ration of butter in Australia was 6 oz. a week. There was no per capita ration of margarine in this country, but the total quantity of margarine available here amounted to from 2-J oz. to Â£-Â£ oz. a person a week, on the average. An adequate amount was available. I might say that for all practical purposes unrestricted quantities of cooking fat were available. As against the availability to Australians of 6 oz. of rationed butter and a little more tban 2 oz. of unrationed margarine, the position in the United Kingdom was. and is, that the total ration of butter and margarine per person in that country is now 9 oz. a week, of which 5 oz. can be taken in butter and 4 oz. in margarine. I believe that, in addition, there is a ration of 2 oz. of cooking fat a week.

As honourable members have indicated, there is a considerable shortage of ammunition of this calibre which is needed, not only for sporting purposes, but also for use in the destruction of pests. fore I moveI have investigated the suggestion that the Department of Supply should set up a factory for the production of these cartridges, but I find that such a project would cost approximately Â£300,000. The department has not previously'manufactured these cartridges. In addition, it would be not less than two years before such a government factory could be in production. In those circumstances, and having regard to the fact that government factories are now fully occupied with the provision of normal defence requirements, I cannot recommend that any step of that kind should be taken. I have asked my departmental oflicers to consult with Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited, -which is a major manufacturer of ammunition of this type, with a view to inducing it to increase its production.

The Minister said that he would bring the matter to the attention of the Government and added, "" I have no doubt that it will be acceded to "". Unless honourable members make a study of the Senate amendments, including many consequential amendments, which would take considerable time, it will be practically impossible to consider the amendments properly unless they are shown at the appropriate places in the measure. However, I understand that the Government has refused to accede to the request that I made on Thursday last. I now ask the Prime Minister to reconsider the position so that honourable members, when they ;ome to examine the measure, will have before them a copy of the bill as passed by the House of Representatives and a cppy of the bill as amended by the Senate. In those circumstances they will find it much less difficult to understand the true significance and relationship of the amendments.

I /propose to deal with education and to some degree my remarks w ill be in line with those of both of those honourable gentlemen. .aware that the State governments are not able to do all they desire because of financial limitations. All States have .appealed to the Commonwealth for assistance in the extension of edu'cational facilities. For many years, the tralia has urged the Commonwealth to assist the Statesi n their educational programmes. The interest of that body in this matter is, of course, apparent. For many years teachers throughout the Commonwealth have looked forward to the establishment of parallel courses of -education and the provision of uniform conditions in the teaching services of the States. Since the establishment by tbe States of independent tribunals to -deal with teachers' wages and conditions a great improvement has taken place in the teaching profession, but as a consequence the cost of education has sharply risen and the difficulties of the State governments have been correspondingly ' increased. There has been a great demand in the community for the extension of -educational facilities, but State governments have found increasing difficulty in financing scholarships to enable pupils of outstanding capacity to undergo ""Courses universities. particularly the Government of Victoria, have indicated that they desire the school leaving age to be considerably extended, and with that objective in view they have laid down suitable postprimary courses which are now ready to be put into operation. Honourable members know that there is a very strong demand for the 'extension of the kindergarten system. The States are aware that tangible assistance w ill have to be rendered by the Commonwealth in the establishment of the kindergarten system on a full-scale basis. The time is now appropriate for this matter to be' considered by the Commonwealth. So that there may be no confusion in the minds of honourable members about this matter, let me say at once that, generally speaking, the establishment and maintenance of kindergarten schools fal l within the province not of the State Education Departments hut of the State Health Departments. Honourable members are Obviously, kindergartens cannot be brought within the compulsory education system. Having regard to these facts, it w ill be appreciated that a great deal of money w ill have to be provided for the extension of education services and that nothing can be done in the matter Teachers Federation of Auswithout substantial aid from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has decided to extend the scholarships system, and I understand that it proposes to allot and administer such scholarships as are granted. The State governments consider that the Commonwealth should allow such scholarships to be administered by the States. Another factor which w ill have an important bearing on this subject is the decision of the Premier of Victoria, as reported in this morning*s Melbourne press, to make representations to the Commonwealth for assistance in the establishment of the kindergarten system within the boundaries of the State. The State governments realize that the extension of the school age w ill be impracticable unti l tbe Commonwealth endows students more substantially than it does at present. This matter is in secondary schools and one essentially for Commonwealth The State governments, and State co-operation. Sooner or later, the Commonwealth w ill have to render practical assistance to the States for education purposes. Some measure of re-orientation w ill undoubtedly be necessary. Like C. J. Dennis, I repeat our chivalry is upside down. The citizens of Melbourne point with some degree of pride to a magnificent and spacious building which is situated in Russell-street and which is f u l l y occupied by hard-working staffs from the top to the bottom. These staffs are engaged in the detection of those who have no respect of justice or for law and order. It seems ironical that people should look with pride on a building that has been erected purely for that purpose. We point to the number and the size of our hospitals as an example of the measure of our civilization. When we think of the defence of our country we have in mind the number of persons whom we can enlist when war threatens us. Biit there is another side of the picture quite different from our magnificent buildings and hospitals. It is a very grim side. 'We can point to slum areas side hy side with the magnificent build ing3 that I have mentioned, where toddlers who have to live in rat-infested, bug-infested and flea-infested sub-standard homes play in the gutters every day. We dare not conduct many visitors to our oities, in Victoria at any rate, on an inspection of our barrack-like school buildings that are so old that anybody who had visited them would never want to see them again. School teachers are so scarce in Victoria that an improvement of the size of classes, which are at present too large, and an extension of the school leaving age, arÂ© not practicable. There is such a lack of schools in some suburbs of Melbourne that frenzied parents and schoo] teachers are almost panic-stricken as they try to discover a means of carrying on under conditions that are steadily becoming worse. The answer to whether or not these unsavoury conditions will continue to exist is closely related to the amount of support that the Australian Government will give to the States to help them out of the very difficult criminals had received proper psychoposition in which they find themselves. Any sound defence policy in this country must provide for the three fundamentals of health, intellect and social adjustment. health is so obvious that it should uot require to be mentioned, but, like many things that are obvious, it -receives very little attention. The earliest form of education provided by our State systems is given by the baby health centres, which have been unanimously pronounced a success because they have reduced infant mortality. of baby health centres was established to teach mothers the essential features of public health training. But after the age of two years children are no longer under Mr Andrews. lie care of baby health centres, so that the training that their mothers havereceived in the first two years of the lives of their children ends by being completely lost through uot having been continued. Kindergarten education is logically the next stage after the training at the baby health centre has been completed,, but the conduct of kindergartens has proved costly and as a result those institutions have been neglected. Anti-social tendencies are more likely to have their initial development in a child in the years immediately following its second birthday than at any other period of its life,, and they should be corrected at that period of its life. A mother requires theassistance of a .psychologist at that stagejust as much as she required at a previous stage the advice of the nurse at a baby health centre. The expenditure incurred in the provision of such assistance would be offset, in the long run, by thepossibility of reducing the strength of the police force. Many children whodevelop anti-social tendencies at an early age become criminals. The correction of such tendencies at the time when they were developing would mean that many more children would grow up to be decent law-abiding citizens. Such correction,, spread over large sections of the community, would make possible a diminution of .the strength of the police force that the State maintains for the prevention of crime and the solution of crimesthat would never have occurred if the logical care in their childhood. The dental inspection of children should commence at the kindergarten stage. Carefully designed propaganda should bedirected to parents in respect of immuThe importance of nization against disease and on the early discovery and treatment of tuberculosis and cancer. The expenditure on such propaganda would be amply offset by theconsequent reduction of the cost of building and maintaining hospitals. It would also reduce avoidable absenteeism in industry, which, I understand, is at a veryhigh figure. The gain to industry that The system would result from the proper application, of health knowledge at an early stage in the child's life is so high that its valuecould not be accurately estimated. The standard of the community's intellect is closely allied with the kindergarten system. Properly, educated children would grow up with the correct habits, would have made necessary communal adjustments at the right time of their lives and would have developed a love for all that our educational system really stands for. I believe that by giving financial assistance to the States for education we would aid them to attain a sound intellectual level in the community. A. knowledge,, gained in school, of the conditions of life and the outlook of the people of other countries, would assist in the prevention of war. In any event when war does come the people who are of real value to the army are people with education. The provision of. improved education can therefore clearly be related to defence. Such a policy may take a long time to bring to fruition and may be costly, but it would bring its own rewards. Only the Commonwealth could make a full-scale educational policy possible, and it is perfectly obvious, from the representations that have been made to the State authorities and that they in turn have made to the Commonwealth, that that policy is desired by the people themselves. It is necessary at this stage to have a thorough realization of the costs involved in such a policy. In order to improve kindergarten training in the community it would be necessary to establish colleges for the training of kindergarten teachers. I understand that the course of training lasts three years, and that intending trainees must have reached the leaving certificate standard before they may undertake the course. A course of training at such a college is so costly, however, that it would be almost impracticable to expect the average student to take it up. The provision of liberal scholarships for people who desire training as kindergarten teachers would be one way in which the Commonwealth could assist the States. I give credit to the present Victorian Government because, during the last two years, it has made available a very considerable number of scholarships for that purpose, but a good deal remains to be done in that direction. It must be realized that a properly organized kindergarten should teach only small numbers of children at_a time. The ideal number of children is nfteen and should certainly not be more than twenty. Each kindergarten therefore would be able to teach only 30 or 40 children a day if it had two half-day sessions. A large number of kindergartens would therefore be necessary. The cost of buildings and land would be heavy because the correct kind of building is necessary if the kindergarten is to do good work. I understand that the cost of a building and land necessary for the training of 30 children would be about Â£5,000. The provision of large numbers of kindergartens at such a cost is beyond the capacity of the cities and municipalities that have interested themselves in such matters. One practical step could be taken in the promotion of such services if parents were trained' in kindergarten methods just as they are now trained in the methods used at the baby health centres. If the Commonwealth intends to do anything a'bout assisting the States in educational matters it might consider that aspect as the first step in such assistance. There is a very great shortage of trained kindergarten supervisors. The municipality in which I live applied for one more than two years ago, but has not yet ibeen able to make an appointment. The construction of buildings to cope with abnormal school development in the States is an extremely urgent matter. In Melbourne most of the 'city schools are very overcrowded. Over the years a demand has grown for the establishment of consolidated schools in rural areas. That demand has arisen because it is felt that it is not just that country children should have to suffer merely because they are country children. These two demands may be regarded as existing side by side. In the interests of the general health of the community, medical and dental services should be extended immediately to children who compulsorily attend primary and secondary schools. Considerable expenditure would be necessary to make such services available, but I hope that the greatest co-operation will be given by the Dental Board and the British Medical Association if a plan to achieve this objective is put before them in order that the cost of treatment might be kept within the amount of money made available by the Australian or State Governments. Only the lack of the necessary money prevents the operation of such a scheme at the present time. The blueprints for post-primary educalion have been completely prepared and unless rapid assistance is given to the States by direct grants and by the extension of a greater amount of inducement to students than has been given in the past it is probable that another generation will pass by without any of these plans being brought into being. Technical and secondary schools are so few that it is necessary to conduct competitive examinations to see who shall he excluded from attendance at those schools. It is shocking that many children who have the capacity to benefit from secondary or technical education are unable to receive it because neither the accommodation nor the teachers are available to conduct the service. A child may be set .back for the remainder of his life, simply because he failed by a couple of marks in the competitive examination which is held for admission of pupils to these schools. The number of pupils admitted bears no relation to their capacity to undertake the. study required of them but merely to the space available. The progress of the Commonwealth suffers a great impediment because of the number of pupils who remain untrained as a result of this shortEnglish, whereas Victorian schools proage of accommodation and teachers. At the university level, money is a most believe that, with Commonwealth codetermining factor in education.

I believe that the provision of the educational facilities that I have mentioned ment will take some interest in the matter Hr. Andrews. would be a guarantee of peace and would certainly be the best guarantee of defence. In view of the position that the States are in at the present time, and the fact that they are responsible for the provision of education, it seems to me that unless tbe Commonwealth provides assistance it will not be possible to open the doors of secondary or university education to many people who have the capacity to use it. The Commonwealth has a great responsibility in that regard. The Commonwealth could assist the States, also, by laying down common standards in salaries, courses and opportunities of the various States. It seems to me that there is a belief that some States suffer because they are smaller than others. Commonwealth aid alone can make educational courses parallel in all States and make conditions sufficiently attractive for the best type of teachers to offer their services to any State. Only Commonwealth assistance can make available the opportunities that should exist in an educational system. The difference between the educational systems of the States at the moment is merely one of degree. Some States specialize in subjects that are different from those in which other States specialize. That position can be remedied by a Commonwealth organization. I understand, for example, that New South Wales schools specialize in bably specialize in mathematics. Such differences are not very material. I Arrangements for the Unfortunately, when the the States themselves. That is not a I hope that the Australian Governot education, that it will hecome education minded, and that it will realize that State education embraces all that the Commonwealth could possibly require in respect to health, wealth, and defence. It seems to me that tbe Government should endeavour to organize tbe co-operation that the States have been seeking for so long. This co-operation has become an absolute necessity from which the Commonwealth itself could derive very much benefit. I listened with a great deal of interest to the speeeh of the honourable member for Darebin( Mr Andrews) regarding primary education in Victoria. I regret that more members of his own party were not present to listen to such a reasoned address. Conditions very similar to those which the honourable member has described as existing in Victoria exist in New South Wales. In that State there is a crisis in education, due to a lack of necessary facilities. Any suggestions which honourable memibers on either side of the House may be able to make to solve these difficulties are worthy of considerait reveals in a nutshell the weaknesses tion. Although differing somewhat in my political views from the honourable member for Darebin, I agree with his references to primary education . I think that he has made valuable contributions in that matter and I compliment him on the speech that he has just made. During the past few months I have been amazed and somewhat amused by the utterances of honourable members opposite in decrying private enterprise. When I hear honourable members opposite talking about the failure of private enterprise, I wish that I could take them to Blacktown in my electorate where there is a magnificent monument to socialism. It is a huge heap of about 120,000 tiles. Those tiles were made at the New South Wales Government tile works at Blacktown, and they are all cracked. The cracked tiles are carried away as quickly as can be arranged, but more are always being added to the heap. I am reliably informed that 75 per cent, of the production of that government tile works has to be rejected. No doubt if this statement of mine happens to appear in print, the "" McGirr Mountain "", as it is called locally, will disappear for the time being. But the inefiiciency of the New South Wales Government tile works cannot be hidden indefinitely, and its story is an object lesson to every Australian in the failure of socialism. Those who are trying to build homes at present find that the most difficult problem facing them is that of securing roofing tiles. Three years ago the New South Wales socialist Government decided to solve that problem. It produced some brand new ideas. No doubt it was burning with a desire to show what socialism could do. That Government claimed that private enterprise had failed to supply roofing tiles in sufficient quantities to meet public needs. It decided to show us all how a government tile works could handle the problem. The New South Wales Government therefore established its own tile works. Now, after three years' operation, the supply of tiles is less than ever before, and it has been made so by government interference. Tbe history of the New South Wales Government tile works is a sad story of frustration for every home-builder, and of socialism. The New South Wales Government started off with what it termed a revolutionary new idea and a new process. It was quite triumphant about this process and said that it would show the outmoded capitalists what real efficiency was. The new method was called the extrusion process, and it has been used in the Blacktown State tile works for eight months, but it has not fulfilled one-eighth of the Government's promises for it. In fact, the whole scheme is a sorry failure. If the Government were to scrap it now, as it should do, it would have to admit failure, because it made such a fuss upon its introduction. Therefore, unfortunately, the State tile works must be kept going. The result is that man-power, electricity and coal, all of which are in short supply, are wasted each week in producing a very few tiles. In such circumstances it is no wonder at all that tiles are in short supply. The McGirr Government has hung an iron curtain of security around the Blacktown tile works, which has made it impossible to get any information about output or",23,Eadden

Upon my information, the Governuseful purposes. ment would be losing a fortune in selling even at the price of Â£26 5s. a New South Wales continues this sort of thousand, because the cost of production waste the housing position will not imis astronomical. The tiles produced are prove. This story touches the Australian being delivered to government-built Government, because the taxpayers not homes.

SinceI have been a member of this HouseI have heard many reflections cast upon primary producers by members of the Opposition. The wool-grower has become an object of abuse, although his only crime seems to be that he is enjoying a period of prosperity. Members of the Opposition have forgotten the lean years that the wool-growers endured. A necessary qualification for a socialist apparently is a convenient memory that will recall only those facts that suit the occasion. In these repeated attacks upon the wool-growers by the Opposition, the antics of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) have been an interesting subject for study. The honourable gentleman is rather like the visiting English footballers. He does not know whether he is onside or offside. If , in the past, he has had leave to criticize his own political party in order to maintain the shaky hold that he has on the electorate that he represents, he is now being repaid in full measure for that licence by his colleagues, with their continued criticism of the wool-growers. Not once since I have been a member of this House have I heard any expression of praise for the man on the land from members of the Opposition. There have been plenty of jeers about "" rural fascists "" and "" wool barons "", but members of the Opposition have shown very little appreciation of the difficulties that confront the average small grower of primary products. In fact, the Labour party seems to believe that, because wool prices are high, all primary producers are enjoying prosperity. aires. lusioning the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin), but I tell him that all is not well with many men on the land. His interjection bas shown that he knows very little about primary production. The socialist system of administration, for which the Chifley Government was responsible, has placed the small farmer in a very serious position. He has many difficult problems to solve, and much will have to be done on his behalf before he can enjoy anything like the measure of financial independence that was suggested by the honourable member's interjection. The honourable member may know a gcod deal about boiler-making, but he is ignorant on the suhject of primary pro* duction. I direct attention especially to the plight of farmers in the coastal regions of New South Wales. The disastrous floods of the past few weeks have provided us with a timely warning that water conservation and flood mitigation must be accepted immediately as a national responsibility. Serious consequences will follow any further delay on our part in accepting that responsibility. We have much to learn from the United States of America, Holland, and other countries about water conservation and flood prevention. Unless we devote ourselves to solving the alternating problems caused by too mucb and too little water in Australia, we shall live to regret our heedlessness. These problems are of national importance and they should engage the .attention of honourable members on both sides of the House. Critical conditions exist in the coastal areas of New South Wales. When we entered the winter months, the ground had been well soaked by heavy summer rains and it should have been obvious to any thoughtful person that anything more than a normal winter rainfall would have serious consequences. I have been most fearful of this winter, I saw the Hawkesbury River rise last year, when many settlers were ruined. The river broke its banks three times earlier in the year, and now it has done so for the fourth time with disastrous results. In MarchI asked the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) all millionto consider assembling a team of scientists and engineers to carry out, as a national work, a programme of flood prevention, water conservation and irrigation in one river basin with the object of evolving a general technique for use throughout Australia. I suggested the Hawkesbury basin as the location for such experimental work because it is the oldest river settlement in Australia and consequently has the longest record of flood damage. I again make the suggestion and ask the Minister for National Development to. give earnest consideration to it.",29,Eadden
113,Mr Cubtin,They are,30,Eadden
114,Mr Wheeler,"I do not like disilI cannot over-stress the urgency of the need to take definite steps to prevent floods and establish a system of water conservation. The plight of those who have suffered during the last week is sufficient testimony of the need for such action. In tlie Mitchell electorate, many farmers have been ruined. The savings of a lifetime of hard work have been dissipated during the last twelve months. The flood emergency relief scheme is inadequate in times such as the present. Crops and homes cannot be replaced with the meagre few pounds that are offered under the scheme. It is the responsibility of either this Government or the State government, not to offer a few paltry pounds when damage has been done, but to take action to prevent such damage from occurring. The victims of the floods are not looking for charity. They are prepared to work and take the risks of the seasons as they come, but tbose risks could he considerably reduced if the danger' of floods and droughts were removed. No man on the land has a bigger heart to meet adversity than have the growers of small cropsthe vegetable-growers, the citrus-growers, the dairy-farmers and poultry-farmers -wh o are working properties that arc likely to be flooded. When thefloodssubside, they go to work again to repair the damage that has been done and to restore order. I have never ceased to admire their courage. In this House during the last few months I have listened many times to the complaints of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron). He always seems to be worrying about what happened to him during the depression and to be resentful of the wealth of otber people. Everybody else seems to be happier than he is, according to his speeches, but I am sure that, if he would make a tour of the Mitchell electorate with me at present, he would decide that his lot was a very happy one by comparison with that of people whose homes have been covered in mud, whose crops have been ruined and who have lost all of their possessions, yet who have the courage to face the future with the hope that a good season may get them out of trouble. We have a duty to ensure that take the attitude that flood prevention, that hope shall not die, and I believe that and water conservation and irrigation we can do much to help those people. within the boundary of a State, are the Mr Wheeler. I acknowledge without hesitation that the initiation of the construction of a series of dams, weirs and other means of controlling water in a river such as thc Hawkesbury River may not have such a national significance as has the Snowy Mountains scheme. Nevertheless, I consider that sucb a task is of national importance. The Hawkesbury River basin is recognized as one of the food baskets of Sydney, with its great population. Floods in that basin mean less milk, less vegetables, less eggs and less fruit for the metropolis. Such shortages in Sydney, in turn, have an effect on the whole nation. Therefore, I suggest that our national development scheme should include provision for the financing of works designed to prevent floods in such river basins. I know that the great difficulty about undertaking schemes of that nature at present is that there is so much work to be done and that we have not sufficient machinery, materials and labour for our needs. That is the inevitable result of a centralized administration that fails to realize the value of enlisting the enthusiasm and help of people who live in the districts concerned and will benefit from such schemes. That is why I urge the claims of the Hawkesbury Valley as a project for inclusion in the plans for national development. When we consider that area, we are not concerned with any far-away dreams among primative surroundings. The population, and the amenities of civilized living, are already there. The development of that valley would I am sure, tap great reserves of labour in the surrounding districts. Local men would join in with enthusiasm, because they would know that, by so doing, they were benefiting their home areas. Such a proposition would be vastly easier than trying to recruit labour for a project in some practically unknown area hundreds of miles from civilization. Homes, roads, power and transport are already established in the Hawkesbury Valley, whereas the provision of them for a project like the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme will occupy some years. I realize that the Commonwealth may responsibilities of that State. That may have Â£100 before their pensions were be quite true, but the Commonwealth has affected. Consequently the Labour Gotaken from the States the right to collect vernment did relax the original position tbeir own revenues by imposing their own to some degree. That law also provided taxes, and I believe that, under those conoriginally that if husband and wife owned ditions, the Commonwealth must accept property the value of which exceeded sonic of the responsibility for projects that Â£400 each, they were not eligible to receive tbe States could possibly carry out if they a pension. The Labour Government in raised their own revenues. This is a creased that l i m it to Â£750 each.

However, those facts should be able to handle undertakings w ill serve to show that the matter is not snch as the Hawkesbury Valley developnew. ment scheme. I hope that when the Government is considering national development, due attention w ill be paid to the small grower and the farmer, who may bo hard h it by taxation, not directly by the assisted greatly by the right approach act itself, but by the regulations that are to the problem of water conservation and promulgated under it .

119,Mr Thompson,"been determined by tbe ruling of a committee that had considered it. If that is so, I suggest that the decision of the committee should be reviewed in order that persons in the category that I have mentioned may receive justice. I return to the subject of the "" genteel rich"", by whom I mean those persons who own a certain amount of property, and, consequently, are not eligible to receive a pension. The present system is wrong. A husband and wife are now permitted to receive the full pension if their income does not exceed Â£3 a week. Some people buy an annuity of Â£3 a week, or contribute to a superannuation fund for a pension of a similar amount, on attaining a certain age. They pay their contributions for that specific purpose, and when they retire from their employment they receive superannuation or an annuity at the rate of Â£3 a week. A husband and wife, who draw up to that amount, are entitled to receive the full pension of Â£4 5s. a week, so that their total having allowed for the first Â£100 to be income is Â£7 5s. a week. In that way they are rewarded, to some degree, for having made provision for many years to obtain an income of Â£3 a week from such a source as a superannuation fund. But what is the plight of other persons who, instead of contributing to a superannuation fund, made a humble investment in property? I shall cite an example. A person may have paid a deposit on a house, and have gradually discharged the mortgage over many years. When he retires from his employment, he owns the home in which he lives, and another dwelling that is worth Â£1,600. The second home will not return him an income of Â£3 a week. Indeed, he would be fortunate to clear 30s. a week on that investment after having paid rates and taxes, and maintenance costs. But because he owns a second home that is worth Â£1,600, neither he nor his wife is eligible to receive a pension. I contend that that principle is wrong, and I propose to place before the House certain suggestions for remedying the position. They are not mere suppositions, but are positive ideas that should be carefully considered. _ The Government should abolish the existing limit of Â£750 worth of property, and provide for the gradual reduction of the pension, so that it shall disappear at a Mr Thompson. point at which a person has sufficient money to enable him to provide for his' needs. That should'be the approach to this matter. member cite an actual case? practical case. I do not know whether honourable members fully understand the operation of the means test. Actually there are two, one of which is applicable to income, and the other to capital. I shall deal with the second. The annual rate at whicli a pension is determined is reduced by Â£1 for every complete Â£10 of that portion of the value of the property of the claimant or pensioner which exceeds Â£100 but does not exceed Â£450, and by Â£2 for every complete Â£10 of the remainder, if any, of the value of that property. My suggestion envisages the abolition of the property test, as it exists at the present time, and, after exempt, Â£1 per annum for each complete Â£10 to be included in the calculation of income of the claimant or pensioner. In other words, a husband and wife would be permitted to have Â£3 a week, or Â£156 a year. My proposal would meet the strong objection that has been made for so long to the disqualification of persons wbo bave Â£750 worth of property from receiving a pension. Eirst, I suggest that section 22 (g) of the Social Services Consolidation Act, which' provides for a limit on the value of the property that a person may have in order to be eligible for a pension, be deleted. I contend that that limit should be determined by the reductions that would be made for each Â£10 of the value of property in excess of Â£100. Secondly, I suggest that section 28 (2.) (fe) be deleted, and the fourth line of section 28 (2.) (a) be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" and Â£1 for every complete Â£10 of the value of the property of the claimant or pensioner which exceeds Â£100. exceeds Â£78 per annum."".

The amendments that I have suggested do not go so far as I should really like to go. However, they would be a step in the right direction. The Treasurer asked me what the Labour governments which I supported had done to provide relief to persons in the categories that I have mentioned. The Chifley Government raised the permissible value of the property of a claimant for pension from Â£400 to Â£650 and later from Â£650 to Â£750, and, also increased the permissible .income from 12s. 6d. a week to 30s. a week. However, the persons who are suffering most as the result of the present method of applying the means test are those who haye been able to purchase a house, or, perhaps, two houses, in addition to the house in which they live. I know of many cases of ordinary working people who, after they had purchased their own home for Â£400, or Â£500, provided for their old age by'saving sufficient to purchase an additional house which to-day would be worth, say, Â£800 or Â£900. However, they are not able to qualify for a. pension at present although the rent from the additional property would not net them more than Â£1 a week. The present method of applying the means test, operates unfairly against those persons who have tried to help themselves whereas persons who, in many cases through no fault of their own, have not been able to acquire any property, are entitled to receive a joint pension at the rate of Â£4 5s. for husband and wife. I have asked the Prime Minister( Mr and I fully appreciate the difficulties Menzies) a series of questions regarding tbe treatment of ordinary pensioners and the right honourable gentleman has merely replied that the matter will be considered. During the last few weeks I have received letters not only from persons in my electorate but also from persons in the various States as well as from pensioners' associations. The secretary of a branch association with a membership of nearly 500 pensioners wrote to me and inquired why pensioners had to wait till October next to receive the increase of 5s. or 7s. a week which, he said, had been promised to the pensioners. I was obliged to replv that no such proMr Thompson. mise had been made, that the Prime Minister himself had informed me that the Government had not yet decided to increase the pension. The Treasurer nods assent to that statement. That is the position. Probably, many of those old people will die before October next. I urge the Government to increase the rate of pension payable to general classes of pensioners. However, in the limited time at my disposal, I have not dealt with that aspect. Probably, the Treasurer will reply that it is all very well for me and my colleagues to make suggestions of the kind that I have just made, and will claim that the amendments that I have suggested would involve considerable expenditure. As we are now expending approximately Â£100,000,000 annually for the provision of social services benefits and as that expenditure is estimated to rise considerably next financial year, I can see no reason why persons in the categories that I have mentioned should be completely denied any pension whatsoever. I do not know wdiat additional expenditure would be involved in implementing the suggestions that I have made, but I do not think that it would exceed Â£3,000,000. The honourable member for Mitchell (. Mr Wheeler) said that my colleagues and I never have a good word to say for the primary producers and that we do not realize the losses that they have suffered as a result of floods. During the first year of my married life when I was a dairy farmer my cowshed was flooded ori sixteen occasions. I assure the honourable member that my colleagues that confront the man on the land, and those who are now going on the land, particularly ex-servicemen. I have experienced many droughts and floods. I was forced with my wife and five children to abandon my farm, and my total worldly property amounted to only Â£5. However, many primary producer? are in a better position to-day than thej ever dreamed they would be in. I take my hat off to the many who are on the land, particularly those who are prepared to face difficulties of the kind that confronted me. In some years I was carting water for my stock until 9 o'clock at night and I had to rise early in the morning to do my ploughing. No honourable inember can say that I have cast aspersions on a man on the land. ber is an exception to the general rule. leagues also appreciate the difficulties that -confront the man on the land. I sincerely trust that honourable members opposite -will not endeavour to make party political -capital out of the difficulties that confront primary producers. wish to deal specifically with two matters. The first is the present position of the poultry industry. It would be far from the truth to say that that industry is in a healthy condition. Practically every other important primary industry is now experiencing a great measure of prosperity. I mention, for instance, the wool, wheat, dairying and-to some degree -drie d fruits industries. All of them are enjoying a period of prosperity. That happy state of affairs, however, does not exist in the poultry industry, in which production is declining. Many poultry farmers are selling out and those who remain in the industry are in serious difficulties because of increasing costs and a too rigid price scale. Anstralian consumers complain not only of the high price of eggs but also of the scarcity of supplies. Poultry products have not increased in price to anything like the same degree as have other primary products. In Victoria eggs are now being sold at a price approximately 50 or 60 per cent, above that which prevailed at this time of the year in pre-war years. It is the policy of the Government to encourage the exports of primary products in order to provide overseas funds for the purchase of consumer and capital goods that cannot be manufactured in this country. In spite of the conclusion of a contract with the United Kingdom for the purchase of our surplus eggs, egg production is steadily declining. In Victoria production declined from 38,000,000 dozen in 1948 to 32,000,000 dozen in 1949. This year it is expected to decline by a further 2,000,000 dozen. This serious decline results from the unprofitable price fixed under the contract between Australia and the United Kingdom. Shortly after the last price review was made the industry estimated review was made the industry estimated that it was losing 4d. a dozen on all eggs sent to the United Kingdom. To-day the loss on export eggs is from 5d. to 6d. a dozen. As all our surplus production is sold in the United Kingdom under the terms of the contraot the payment of such a low price results in considerable loss to the Australian industry. Last year 33^ per cent, of the total production of eggs in Victoria was exported. The only way by which the industry can recoup itself for the loss on the export market is by raising the local price. During the export season two-thirds of our egg production is exported and the .local price is low. In the winter months, when production falls, steeply and export ceases, the local price is increased to offset some of the loss that results from the export contract. That the prosperity of the poultry industry is largely dependent on the price obtained overseas from our surplus eggs is realized by the Government which, I believe, is doing everything it possibly can to secure an increase of the contract price. I trust that it will be able to restore prosperity to this important industry, which is struggling to survive. In Victoria no fewer thau 20,000 persons are engaged in it, including a great many ex-servicemen. Their future prosperity will depend largely on the price fixed by the contract with the United Kingdom. As honourable members are aware, eggs constitute an important foodstuff in the diet of the people and a shortage of eggs must have an adverse effect on the health of the community. I trust that the Government will do everything possible to arrest the decline of this industry so that the people who now regard eggs as a luxury, may be able to increase their consumption of this vital and desirable food. Another matter with which I wish to deal is the impact of the present inflationary spiral on certain sections of the population.

He, and others like him, hang on from week to week hoping to be able to preserve what they have saved so that they may he able to pa9S it on as a patrimony to their children. People of that kind constitute the best elements in the community. When I think of them my mind goes back to an experience that I had-whic h I do not think was shared by any otlier honourable meniber in this House-whe n I lived through a period of uncontrolled innation in Germany, during which the mark, the exchange rate of which was originally 37 to the Â£1, soared fco more than 2,000,000 to the Â£1. During that period of extraordinary innation, those who had saved for their future and who constituted some of the best elements in the German community were financially mined. Some of them starved. That class vanished and then Hitle r came to power. We know what happened after that. Germany is not likely to happen here, because we have only the beginning of inflation in this country, although that in itself is bad enough. We should make sure fchat the pensioners. at least do not have to suffer in these times that we are passing through. What we require above all, as ,the Treasurer knows as well as any of us and better than most of us, is to stabilize the cost of livin g at least. revaluation of the Â£1 ? aspects of this matter. Stabilization of the cost of living would not only give relief to pensioners but also lead to a diminution of our industrial troubles, which can be very largely traced to dissatisfaction with rising costs aud prices. I hope therefore that the Government will be able to get on with the important task of stabilizing the cost of living. A second equally pressing and important matter is the liberalization of the means test so that some pensioners may enjoy the same rights as other people are enjoying. T believe that the means test could be liberalized, although I know that that step would cause some strain on the treasury. I commend a liberalization of the means test to the Government and thc Treasurer. I know that some attention is now being given to it , and that a subcommittee has been formed to examine it. I hope that it is being given f u l l and careful attention. [ 5 . 2 ] I shall direct the attention of the House to certain aspects of the development of northern Australia that I consider importaut. Bearingi n mind the troubled, uncertain conditions that exist in the world to-day, and especially the rumbling discontent that is apparent to our north, we should face, and take stock of our position, and then consider the future of northern Australia in relation to the rest of this continent, in terms of both defence and economy. Successive governments in the past have followed the policy of developing the most fertile and most readily accessible parts of Australia. That policy would be excusable and justifiable if there were no war on earth. Governments have apparently not realized All that happened in that northern Australia must be developed and populated for tbe sake of our security. When I say security I do not mean only the security of defence that a populated north would provide, but also the security of a more balanced economy. We all know that past governments failed to realize the disastrous effects that their lack of vision would have on the rest of Australia in the event of the occurrence of a war such as we have passed tlirough during the last decade. Australia's history reveals that governments have invariably adopted the line T h a t is one of the many of least .resistance. That course of action almost resulted in the loss of Australia in the last war. Had Australia then been lost the white races of the world would, have found themselves without a haven, in the Pacific area. For that reason alone it is our duty to preserve and develop Australia. We can no longer rely on our isolation as a means of defence, because the last war finally disposed of that fallacy. We have to look to ourselves for our own defence. I realize only too well that unpleasant memories have a tendency to fade with the passage of time. Nowadays we have forgotten the terror that was in everybody's mind in 1942 ancl 1943, when thc very fate of Australia hung in the balance. In those years the Japanese armies were relentlessly pushing southward.?-, and it seemed that nothing could",37,Eadden
127,Mr Clyd E Cameron,What about the,38,Eadden
128,Mr Ryan,,38,Eadden
129,Mr Ueison (Northern Territory ),"prevent their progress. The Japanese spearheads reached within 400 miles of Darwin when they took Timor, and the Japanese navy was unchallenged in the area to our north because of a series of victories that it had gained. We now accept as a commonplace the fact that in 1942 the Japanese bombed Darwin for the first time and brought the war right into Australia. That was the first occasion on which Australia had suffered a direct attack from an enemy. Final figures reveal that 250 men and women were killed and over 400 were injured on that occasion. I shall quote portion of an article written by Douglas Lockwood in the Melbourne Herald on the 18th February, 1947, about that attack. He wroteThat summier morning, five years ago, men ancl women were killed for the first time on Australian soil, by an enemy who regarded us, we know, as the plum of the Pacific. It looked as though the enemy who had long been casting covetous eyes in our direction was now knocking on tlie door. The battle of the Coral Sea, that grim and fluctuating naval battle, which eventually resulted in the crippling of the Japanese fleet and which finally removed the threat of the invasion of Australia, was fought within 500 mile's of our shores. The Japanese had long been casting covetous eyes in our direction and. it was only the weakness of our north that encouraged them to adopt aggression. Nobody will deny that had it not been for the assistance of our allies the Japanese would have succeeded in their designs on Australia. We should now look to our defences and learn from the lessons of the past. No honoralble member will suggest that we have unlimited time at our disposal to rectify the present position. I do not have to remind honourable members of the unsettled state of affairs in Asia and in the islands to the north of us. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) has issued statement after statement expressing the Government's concern and uneasiness about the situation in those parts of the world, as well as its uneasiness regarding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. I know that Australians will always regard Japan with a degree of suspicion. I, for one, treat Mr Nelson. with some reserve Japan's claim to a change of heart. I cannot forget that while Japanese envoys were in America discussing peace in the Pacific Japan made its attacks on British and American possessions in that very area. Australia must realize from past experience that Japan is not a nation given to making hasty decisions. I know that for years before the last war in the Pacific became imminent Japan had its spies out working in the guise of such innocent occupations as pearling and fishing, for the purpose of charting Australia's Northern Territory and so laying the foundations of a plan that would go into operation when it was prepared to attack. We found out to our sorrow later that Japan knew more about our northern coastline than we knew ourselves. When I hear that those same Japanese have changed overnight from a treacherous and cunning people to a gentle and democratic people who are content to conform to ordinary civilized standards, I just do not believe it. I am apprehensive about what may happen in, say, twenty years, if we accept tbe word of Japan in that respect. Do not honourable members agree that, in the face of the statements that have been made by the Minister for External Affairs and in the light of our experience, it is right that we should proceed very smartly with developing and populating northern Australia? I know that the task of developing the huge area of northern Australia will impose a considerable strain upon a country of 8,000,000 people. I do not wish to minimize the magnitude of that task, but the fact remains that northern Australia has considerable potentialities that must be exploited to their utmost in the shortest possible time. So that honourable members may realize the seriousness of the position I shall give an outline of tbe position in northern Australia as far as population is concerned. If Australia were divided by a line starting at Eockhampton in Queensland and running to Longreach, then south to the border of South Australia and the Northern Territory, and thence west to the Western Australian coast, it would be divided roughly into two equal parts. The northern part would contain an area of approximately 1,500,000 square miles. I realize that that huge area includes large tracts of land that could not be brought into production by any means that we have at our disposal to-day, but it is still possible that it could contain much valuable mineral wealth. It also contains large areas of country that could be put into production and thus contribute to the economy of Australia as a whole. The population north of the line that I have described is, as nearly as I can ascertain, as follows: within Queensland, approximately 265,000, of whom 190,000 are located on the coast and 75,000 inland; w it h in Western Australia, in an area that comprises approximately half the total area of that State, 5,000; within the Northern Territory, approximately 14,000. The total population of the whole area is therefore about 284,000. member refer to white population only? population is about the same number as were suitable for growing rice, Mr Douglas the population of Perth, which is the Taylor said yesterday. second smallest; State capital in Australia. tion. The position becomes even more alarming still when we realize that on tbe coastline Equalization Association submitted a report that stretches 5,000 miles fro m north of on the rice-growing potentialities of Northern Cairns round the north of the continent Tuesday. to Geraldton in Western Australia, there is a population of only 16,000.

Let tion a rice mill would be built, Mr Taylor said. me touch briefly on these matters in passing. The beef herds of the Northern rice Territory are the third largest in Australia to-day. The aggregate beef herd there is larger than that of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, or Tasmania and it is still capable of considerable expansion. Sheep have been bred and run in the Northern Territory for years.

Tobacco, cotton, sorghum and peanuts have been successfully grown commercially in the Northern Territory and their greater production would also be beneficial. The territory has gold-fields at Tennant's Creek and in other areas, that are in course of development. The territory's mica fields are as extensive as any in the world and they supply 9.S per cent, of Australia's requirements. Other minerals such as copper, tin and tantalite wolfram also are being produced, and a geophysical survey of the entire area is essential. Although something has been done in this respect I fhink that those activities must be increased/ The war made the Government realize the necessity for action in the north and plans were drawn up for its short and long term development. In 1945 a committee known as the. North Australia Development Committee was set up in order to carry out investigations and planning. This committee consisted of representatives of the Australian Government and the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia to investigate the approximate areas of which I have just spoken in respect of population and submitted certain plans and recom, mend ations. I do not know that it has yet completed its work. If it has, it would be interesting to know what ""its final recommendations were. I consider that a special ministry should be set up to handle the problems of the Northern Territory. Nothing less than that can achieve the co-ordinated effort that this job requires. Northern Territory should no longer be considered as an area that needs administration only by a part of a department. The attention of one Minister should be concentrated solely upon it. In an article written for the Melbourne Herald on the 18th August, 1947, the Mr Tfclnon. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture There is no reason why the Northern Territhreshold .of marked industrial development This is my opinion on returning from some thousands of miles of travel aroumd the territory. But there are certain pre-requisites. The first, is a Commonwealth Minister for the Northern Territory, so that decisions at Canberra can be made by people who are uot also loaded with a multitude of other duties. The honourable gentleman made certain other valuable suggestions with which I shall deal at another time. At one time he was Minister. for the Interior, and if he does not know what he is talking about I do not know who does. Incidentally, in making that statement. I do not intend to cast any reflection on the present Minister for the Interior( Mr McBride). The previous Government, recognizing that some alteration of the existing system of administration was necessary, established a directorate of Northern Territory affairs and placed it in control of a section of' the Department of the Interior with considerable benefit to the north. The result has been increased efficiency in the handling of many of tbe matters that concern that area. But thc Minister for Commerce and Agriculture said that in 1947, and the argument holds good to-day that nothing short of direct representation in the Cabinet will provide a firm foundation for the administration of the territory. The Government will have to apply itself to this task. Financial problems have to be overcome. Shipping will have to be provided, roads constructed, water conservation schemes implemented and agricultural activities assisted. Light and power plants will have to be erected and mineral surveys completed. Houses will have to be constructed in order to provide the people of the north with accommodation comparable with The that enjoyed by the people of the south. I am sure that if the Government, demonstrates its willingness to provide the fundamentals of development private enterprise will be only too pleased to assist. If the Government adopts a sympathetic attitude it will find that the pioneering spirit is far from dead in this",40,Territory Possible
134,( Mr Mcewen) Said,"eountry.' I agree with the statement that was made hy the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) when speaking on the Government's policy in relation to external territories. Dealing with the financial aspect of the development of Papua and New Guinea the honourable gentleman saidMany otber items necessary for the reconstruction and development of the Territory w ill involve expenditure on a profitable scale. tries that they visited. Expenditure of that magnitude is clearly beyond normal budgetary provision and the question of obtaining ut least a substantial portion of the necessary funds by way of loan must accordingly be explored. The Government used during the last war the method of finance to whicb the Minister referred in that statement, and by its use raised Â£562,000,000 in the financial year 1942-43. A colossal amount of money was used to finance tbe last war and the people of Australia who were prepared to sanction that expenditure in order to win the war would be quite prepared to sanction the expenditure of a fraction of it for the prevention of another war. The Government now has the opportunity to prove that the Northern Teritory is not a liability, and, in the process of providing that proof, it can make Australia a better and a safer place to dive in. view of the important and serious matters with which the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) has dealt, my remarks on the subject with which I intend to speak may be regarded as being in a somewhat lighter vein. At the same time, the subject is one of universal interest and it has a particular appeal for Australians because it concerns the 1952 Olympic Games. Probably sport makes a greater appeal to all members of the community than does any other subject. Even though honourable members of this House may disagree on most other subjects they can converse amicably and quite reasonably on the various sport,;: that they follow each week-end. In order to emphasize my point 1 should like to recount the Australian performances at the Olympic Games of 1948. The Australian team that went to England won two^first prizes, Wood and Winter winning the sculling and the high jumping respectively. Six members of the team came second in their events and five came third. Australia was placed in 69 heats and competed in 27 semifinals and 21 finals. The performances of our athletes were so outstanding that they were invited to other countries after the conclusion of the games. They won seven overseas .championships, the King's prize and the diamond sculls, and established twelve records in the various counThe value to Australia of the Olympic Games can be correctly estimated only if one has some idea of the prestige which participation in them confers. The J. Arthur Rank film organization made an outstanding film, The Glory of Sport, which was screened in 26 countries. Commentaries on the events at. the last Olympic Games were broadcast to 26 countries. Eight hundred journalists were sent by their newspapers to report them. Also in attendance were radio commentators, and many hundreds of free-lance journalists. It has been, estimated that 20,000 newspapers were represented at those games. It can be conservatively estimated that 1,000,000 inches of newspaper space was devoted to reporting the appearances, wins, placings and other features of Australia's participation in the different events. That tremendous volume of advertising of Australia was spread throughout, the world. Conservatively estimated on current advertising rates that amount of advertising received by Australia was worth Â£1,000,000. I submit that that was advertising of no mean order. At present we are midway in time between the 1948 Olympic Games and the 1952 Olympic Games, which are to be held at Helsinki. It is essential that we should commence now to plan for successful participation iu the games, which, perhaps, seem far off at present, but are actually very close because of the vast amount of work that has yet to be done. It is essential that Australia should be adequately represented at the highest standard, because in 1956 tbe Olympic Games will be held in Melbourne and competitors at Helsinki must be impressed by our standards. Preparation for the Helsinki Games will be",41,Territory Possible
135,Mr Opperman (Corio) [5.27],"I ninvaluable experience for Australiaa because upon our shoulders will fall the responsibility for the whole of the 1956 games. In 1956 athletes and experienced officials from all over the world will arrive dous service to this nation, and Ausin Melbourne, upon which world attention will be focused for the time being. It will be filled with journalists and broadcasting teams, and Australia's prestige will suffer if the games are not carried out according to the highest traditions of sport. Our competitors and officials should be at Helsinki weeks earlier than they arrived in other countries for previous Olympic Games. After the recent games we saw the spectacle of our athletes, upon their visits to other countries, performing far better than they had done at the games. That is because they did not have sufficient time in England in which to reach top form before competing. Therefore, facilities should be made available for our athletes to get to Helsinki earlier than they have arrived for previous overseas games. The matter has been given much thought because the 1956 games will be held in Melbourne, but finance naturally overshadows all other considerations. It is impossible to bave the job done properly if sufficient money is unavailable. The Olympic Counci] has set a target of Â£100,000, and is working towards that end. An enormous amount of effort, organization and administration must be put into the work in order to raise that large sum of money. If our team flies to Helsinki and returns by ship the total cost of the fares of the 140 members will be between Â£60,000 and Â£70,000. That item alone will take a very large proportion of the Â£100,000 that is to be raised. In spite of the widespread interest in the games throughout Australia, the Â£100,000 will be very difficult to obtain. Although the time occupied in covering the distance between countries has been lessened by air transport and fast sea transport between Australia and Europe it is still very great, and that means that Australians must make a special effort to keep themselves and their coimtry before the public of those other lands. Because of the tremendous volume of advertising that our athletes get at the Olympic Games the job of keeping Mr Opperman. Australia's interests before the world in other ways is lessened considerably. Therefore, the people participating in the Olympic Games are doing a trementralia should recognize the value of it. On the continent, and in England, governments recognize the great value of national participation in the Olympic Games. After the last Olympic Games special ceremonies were held by the French Government to welcome home its athletes. Because of the great interest aroused in other countries by the Australian athletes, success in the games can have a vital influence on immigration to Australia, and thus an interest in Australia can be developed in other peoples which would be very costly to get otherwise. The prestige of this country on the field of sport, and the bearing of its sporting men and women, are very impressive to the people of other nations. The disturbing moral outlook developed by the recent war can be considerably tempered by paying more attention to good clean healthy success in sport. The games also set the standard for national fitness and have a profound effect upon the younger generation. I realize that a grant of Â£100,000 has been made for our national fitness campaign, and that nothing could be more deserving than that cause. However, the thing that will direct attention to the necessity for national fitness is success at the games. In the News and Information Bureau, department of the Interior, skilled journalists are constantly endeavouring to find interesting and outstanding matter about Australia, to stimulate overseas knowledge pf this country. In the games there is a ready-made opportunity to do far more in a much shorter time than can be done by government instrumentalities. As a business proposition the advertisement that Australia gets from success in the Olympic Games is far cheaper and gets better results than do some of the more orthodox government methods. The games occur only every four years and this Government should assist Australia's representatives. I hope that the Government willhelp the Olympic fund to the amount of at 'least Â£30,000. That should be done because of the international effect of Australian participation at Helsinki, .and later the international effect of the Olympic Games being held in this country. There is no international gathering at which so many nationalities come into such dose contact as in the Olympic Games. No international affairs have heen conducted with less trouble and with less irritation between the participants than have the Olympic Games, with the exception of one or two small incidents which have been magnified out of all proportion to their importance. There is no better way of making a contribution towards international understanding than through participation in tbe Olympic Games. To show our appreciation of the value of the games to Australia we should give, not just before the games, but now, a representative sum of Â£30,000. I commend to the House the allocation of some sum of money towards meeting the cost of our participation in the Helsinki Games, and I suggest that the allocation be made a? early as possible so that our competitors w ill know that the Government is backing them. adjourned.

Minister) [8.1] -We nave received from the Senate a series of 29 amendments to the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. I think that it might he convenient if we were to group those amendments, and therefore I propose, first, that the committee take No. 16, which is an amendment to clause 9 and which raises four or five very important controversial issues, including those of the onus of proof, the area of the appeal, the problem of a further appeal to a full court and the problem of compensation in the event of a declaration failing. Secondly, I propose that the committer deal with amendment No. 7, which relates to the same matters in connection with a body of persons-no t actually the Communist party, but some alternative body. Thirdly, I propose that the committer consider amendment No. 28, which deals with the proposal by the Senate that the trial of an appeal shall be conducted before a jury. After that. I suggest, the committee should consider amendments Nos. 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21 and 22. The Government proposes to move that those amendments be disagreed to. Finally, the committee could consider amendments Nos. 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 29 together. The Government proposes that those amendments be agreed to. All except one were tendered by the Government in the Senate. I remind the committee that the bill has been declared (1.) In an application under suban urgent measure, and I propose to deal with it on that footing. Therefore, I have asked the committee to consider the Senate's amendments in a certain logical order that will facilitate discussion. I move That the amendments be disposed of in the following order:No. 19 separately, No. 7 separately, and No. 28 separately;",44,Communist Party Dissolutionbill 1950
137,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"PrimeNos. 2 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22 enable the committee to handle them in ; together; and Nos. 1, 4, 5, 9, 12. 13, 14, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 20, 27, 29 together. posal made by tlie Prime Minister( Mr the 10 th May, before the bill was transMenzies) requires the consent of the. committee because we are not dealing with the allotment of time at present, either individually or in the aggregate. I agree that the committee could deal with the Senate's amendment No. 16 separately. As the Prime Minister has stated, that amendment relates to a number of very important issues that concern the declaration of individuals. The committee could then deal with the Senate's amendment No. 7, which relates to a number of the same important issues in connection with organizations. That procedure would clear the ground for a satisfactory discussion. Amendment No. 16 involves the question whether, after a declaration, a declared person shall be able to appeal against the declaration. It also deals with the burden of proving the allegations against that individual, the right of appeal, the possibility of the court awarding compensation in the event of a successful appeal by a person who has automatically lost his position as the result of a declaration, and several other matters. Amendment No. 7 covers somewhat the same ground in relation to organizations. Amendment No. 28 relates to the mode of trial and to the question whether a declared individual shall have the right to elect to have the issue tried, not hy a judge alone, but by a judge sitting with a jury. The procedure of considering those three amendments in that order would be satisfactory. However, the proposal made by the Prime Minister for the grouping of the remainder of the Senate's amendments involves difficulties. I do not consider that the fact that the Government is in favour of one group and is opposed to the other group makes it convenient to arrange them in that way for the purposes of the committee. I suggest to the Prime Minister that the committee consider the Senate's amendments Nos. 16, 7 and 28, separately in that order and then consider the remainder in their proper sequence. Many of the amendments will be agreed to on the voices, and that will the most satisfactory way if the time allotted for their consideration is to be limited. Do you rule, Mr Chairman, that the decision given by the House on mitted to the Senate, governs the committee now? That question has not arisen. Minister has indicated that he intends to rely upon the earlier declaration. I should have thought that that declaration would not be applicable to the present situation, when the bill has been returned from the Senate. I agree that the proposal to consider the Senate's amendments Nos. 16, 7 and 28 separately and in that order is fair and convenient, but I have suggested that the other amendments should be dealt with individually in their numerical sequence instead of in two large groups. Question resolved in the affirmative. Minister) [8.9] -Believing as I do that the declaration of urgency to which the House agreed previously is still operative, I move That the times allotted for the consideration of the amendments be as follows:(a) For No. 10, until 9.15 p.m. this day. (6) For No. 7, until 10 p.m. this day. (c) For No. 28, u n t i l 10.30 p.m. this day. (d) For Nos. 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, u n t il 10.50 p.m. this day.

All the matters that are the subjects of the various amendments, except one, have already occupied the attention of the House and of this committee for a considerable time. They possess no novelty. They involve certain issues that have been thrashed out already in this chamber and in the Senate. The time for prolonged argument has passed. The time for action has come. that, under Standing Order 93, the decision made by the House, as long ago as the 10tlr May, to declare the bill an",48,Communist Party Dissolutionbill 1950

The bill might never have returned from the Senate, except in a formal way. I submit that the procedure for the limitation of debate that was adopted on the 10th May has no relation to the situation that arises after the Senate has made certain amendments and returned the bill to the House of Representatives. That procedure must be invoked again and the bill declared an urgent measure once more. Therefore, I contend that the motion is out of order as it was not preceded by a declaration of urgency. declared that the bill is an urgent tine "". . The committee will be required to measure, and the Standing Orders proconsider amendments that have been made vide that times may be allotted for any by the Senate to this bill, and, possibly, stage of the bill.

I submit-that the for that reason, I consider that honorruling is clearly wrong and does not able members should thoroughly comapply to a situation such as now exists. prehend the issues at stake. The Prime Standing Order 93, which relates to the Minister( Mr Menzies), who is interlimitation of debate, provides power in certain circumstances that are menjecting, may speak as much as he likes tioned, to apportion time to a particular in asides about this matter, but I venture clause or clauses of a bill or to any to say that Government supporters are particular part or parts of a bill. Eour not thoroughly aware of the importance stages are mentioned. They are the initial of it. stages, the second-reading stage, tbe committee stage, and the remaining stages of the bill. I submit that ""the remaining stages "" refers to the remaining stages remarks of the honourable member for of the bill while it is under the control Dalley are not related to the motion of of the House in the first instance and dissent from my ruling. does not refer to the present situation. Therefore, I submit that the ruling is in gentleman wasting time? error: the Chairman's ruling were accepted as be a waste of time, because I know that correct, a declaration of urgency would apply to a bill for an almost unlimited period. A number of reasons might have been advanced in support of the declaration, of urgency on the 10th May last. Eor instance, the Senate might have' been waiting to receive bills from this chamber, or honourable members might have been considering a measure with which they were unanimously in agreement, and the Opposition might have co-operated with the Government in order to pass it. However, tbe present circumstances are completely different from the possibilities that I have suggested.

I contend that the ruling is bad for the reason that the application of the ""guillotine"" from time to time should be for the purpose of dealing with the circumstances thenexisting. But the Prime Minister is now seeking to make the present circumstances fit those that were prevailing on the 10th May last, when this measure was declared an urgent bill. To date, the committee has no knowledge of the amendments that have been made by the Senate to the bill.

157,Dr. Evatt,"I rise to order. Do youMinister) [ 8 . 4 2 ] Tliat amendment No. 10 be amended by leaving out proposed sub-clauses (4.) to (OE.) (inclusive) and inserting the following sub-clauses:"" (4.) At tlie hearing of the application, the the highest national importance and applicant shall begin; if he gives evidence iri person, the burden shall be upon the Commonwealth to prove that he is a person to whom this section applies, but, if he does not give evidence in person, the burden shall he upon hinv to prove that he is not a person io whom this section applies. "" (5.) Upon the hearing of the application, the declaration made by the Governor General under sub-section (2.) of this secticu shall, insofar as it declares that thc applicant is a person to whom this section applies, be prima facie evidence that the applicant is such a person."". I shall now proceed to explain to the committee the significance of these matters which, after all, represent one of the principal nominal occasions of dispute between the two Houses. I say nominal, because I do not believe for one moment that the amendment before us now, which is in line w i th the amendment that was submitted by the Opposition in this House, is a bona fide amendment. I believe that it is deliberately designed to destroy the bill. illusion on the right honourable gentleman's part. if not an illusion. The amendment that has been presented to us by another place, which we have to consider and on which we are the masters of our own decisions, subject to the people whose verdict we would welcome, refers to a variety of matters, which, perhaps, I should state one by one. It proposes, in line with the view of the Labour party in this House, that where somebody has been declared, he shall have the right to go to the court not only on the question of whether he is a Communist, or a member or officer of the Communist party, but also upon whether the activities proved against him in those proceedings are prejudicial to the safety and defence of the Commonwealth. In brief, what the Opposition, through its majority in the Senate, is putting before us is that there ought to be an appeal to the court on the whole of the ingredients in the declaration. ""We have already disI movecussed that matter in this, chamber. On more than one occasion I have made it clear on behalf of the Government, or at least I have tried to do so, that we do not propose to leave decisions on matters of safety to some authority other tban the authority of the King's Ministers in the King's Australian Parliament. gentleman w ill ignore the judiciary? yes. stand. member now knows where he stands, it is one of the few occasions on which he does so. I like this sudden and new-found enthusiasm for the judiciary on the part of the Opposition. gentleman has been the strongest supporter of the judiciary when that has suited his purpose. its strongest supporters, but I happen to believe, and I think that most honourable members andmost of the Australian people w ill agree with me, that the safety and defence of Australia are matters in respect of which a particular responI t was an allusion, sibility has been imposed on the King's Ministers in this country. For somebody to tell me that Ministers, who, in the event of war would be held accountable for their judgment, should abandon their responsibilities and say that the courts should determine most significant matters of national defence, is to ignore the true function of the courts. The courts exist in order to do justice between man and man and to apply a known law to the facts that are proved before them. Opposition members have suddenly and, for the first time in my long experience, discovered that they prefer the decision of a judge to the decision of Ministers who are responsible to this Parliament, and through the Parliament to the people. They have said-and I have not the faintest doubt with deliberate intent to wreck this legislation-""You must give the right of appeal on the whole of the subject-matter of the declaration, and you",52,Pairs

When a Minister in this Parliament is prepared to abandon his responsibility for national safety it will be high time for him to go out of office. The next matter that arises in the amendment made by the Senate is this: The Senate has said, in effect, "" The Gommonwealth, having declared somebody, and that somebody having exercised his right to go to the court on all these grounds""-whic h go f ar beyond anything that was discussed here six weeks ago gentleman mean two grounds? verbal quibble. difference. say on the whole subject-matter of the declaration. Indeed, that is exactly what I said.

I shall reflect on the Senate with the greatest pleasure in the world. It is monstrous that this country should not he governed by those who were chosen to govern it in December last.

It said, in effect, "" We will not accept an amendment the only purpose of which is to enable a Communist to keep out of the witnessbox; but we shall submit an amendment that provides that, although a declared person has the duty of beginning in his appeal, if he is prepared to go into the witness-box and be sworn, from that moment the onus will rest on the Crown "". If that is not fair, what is fair? That means that a. man who, in the opinion of the Governor General in Council and of the most responsible of .political opinion in this country, whatever political party it may represent, is a Communist and is declared to have engaged in activities which are prejudicial to the safety of this country, he must either go into the witness-box to disprove that he is a Communist, or he must carry the onus of proving, by every means at his disposal, that be is not a Communist. A very simple question is involved. Do honourable members want such a man to go into the witness-box and take the oath, or do they not? If they want to save him from going into the witness-box and taking his oath, and if they want to save him from the inconvenience of cross-examination, which no truthful man need fear, they will not vote for the Government amendment, even though it provides that, if such a. person goes into the witness-box and takes the oath, the Commonwealtb will accept the whole burden of proving to the court, that he is a Communist. munist? defined in the bill and that definition was The next point in the nonsense that is talked about onus of",53,Pairs

Place all your cards on the table. Tell us the ways and means by which you get information. Nothing could suit us better"" ? The question is: Are honourable members in favour of dealing with the Communists, oiare they in favour of surrendering to them? The members of this Parliament and the people must line themselves up on that matter. The Opposition, having provided in its amendment for an appeal on all grounds, with this heavy burden of proof on the Commonwealth, has further provided through its Senate majority for another appeal to tbe Full Court. An appeal on what? On questions of law? The matter hardly arises because, if this legislation h employment of certain persons. We are unlawful, power to appeal to the High Court will be unnecessary, as the former Attorney-General, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), well knows. On what ground could an appeal be made? Any appeal would be on a matter of fact. Havingbeen given the decision of one judge that the Governor General in Council was not incompetent to determine what the safety of the country required, there must be a further appeal to the Full Court. For what purpose would such an appeal be made? even by a murderer. member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) had even a nodding acquaintance with the criminal law of this country he would know that a murderer has no such right. The right honourable member for Barton can tell him in his more quiet moments that a convicted murderer who wanted to appeal to the High Court against his conviction, would first have to approach the court for leave to appeal, and that nine times out of ten leave would not be granted. able gentleman were a member of the cnurt. able member for Watson( Mr Curtin) that whatever happens in the fiiture I In the next placeI am omitting minor considerations-the amendment made by another place, which is in conformity with the amendment submitted by the Opposition in this chamber, provides that if, after all these remarkable series of events have taken place, the declaration, of a person is set aside, he shall im entitled to compensation. The honourable member for Lalor was kind enough a few moments ago to refer to the evergreen subject of murder. Although tbe penalty for murder is death, no person who is charged with murder and is acquitted receives compensation. Under this provision in the bill, no erime is charged, no penalty is applied, and no imprisonment or fine is imposed. Its sole purpose is to produce the termination of the now told by the Opposition that in this civil proceeding the Communist-o r thc alleged Communist if Opposition members prefer that term-havin g succeeded in his proceedings against the declaration, should be given compensation at the expense of the Australian people although, mark you, that compensation would be something to which he would become entitled only because of the proposition of honourable members opposite that therr* was some doubt about his guilt. I am bound to ask why Opposition members are so anxious to give to the Communist privileges that they deny to the common burglar. Why all this anxiety, this solicitude for these people? Do they not believe that a Communist conspiracy exists in Australia to-day? If I were to answer that question myself, I should remind Opposition members that they have already voted, whether genuinely or not remains to be seen, for every statement in the preamble to this bill. They have agreed by their vote thai, communism constitutes a dirty and deadly conspiracy against Australia and that the Australian Communist party should be abolished and destroyed. Let them forget it if they like, but by their votes if not by their voices they have agreed with the truth of all those statements. Yet, having said that, they",54,Pairs

We all are in favour of abolishing the Communist, party, without appeal, and without raising any question of the onus of proof. We all are in favour of wiping them out like that.

I have only ten minutes in which aspect is a sham, and defence is not the to make niy remarks and I wish to tell genuine basis for the bill. the committee what the substance of the matter is. The position is the court and wins his case. He has been that the Senate's amendment, which declared to be a Communist and also to the Government proposes to reject, be prejudicial to the defence of the gives persons who have been decountry. ""When he wins his case the court clared under clause 9 certain elemensets aside the declaration, but he still has tary rights of justice.

That stigma will stand against to follow these words closelyis engaged, or is likely to engage, in activities that is meted out by this Government. prejudicial to the security and defence of the Such a position seems to me to be about Commonwealth. . . . The first point;-whethe r the individual conceived. declared is a member of the Communist aspect been brought into this matter party or a Communist according to the at all? What is the essence of the very wide and vague definition in this matter? It is plain that the references bill-is the only point upon which to defence have been placed in the bill appeal lies to the court.

The Government wae charge may be made by the Executive not willing to bring down a bill to proCouncil against an individual, aflirming vide that Communists could not be that he is a person engaged in activities oflicials of trade unions because it conprejudicial to the defence of Australia, sidered that such a bill, without the and that that individual has no appeal use of the defence power, would be whatever.

198,Dr. Evatt (Barton) [9.6],"In this members of the Communist party theitself, "" How can we get our proposals through ?"" It decided to give a flavour of defence to this matter and has brought in a bill under which it can say to an individual, ""You, being a Communist, cannot he dealt with by us as such, but we have provided that the Executive Council may declare you not only a Communist but also a menace to the defence of this country, and then we shall be able to deal with you"". Why, if a man is innocent of the second charge, should he not have the right to clear himself before the court? The question of the onus of proof is equally important. That question is whether the burden of proof shall rest upon the Commonwealth, which makes the charge without hearing the individual, or whether the individual shall have the onus of proving that he is not a Communist. It is contrary to all the principles usually followed in this kind of case that the onus of proof should Test upon the individual, but the Prime Minister says clearly that it shall not rest upon the Commonwealth. He says, ""Why should not a Communist take an oath and go into the witness-box ? "" he not? wliether a Communist will take an oath, but whether a person who is alleged to he a Communist will take an oath. Why should declared persons be put in a different position from defendants in ordinary cases? During the Prime Minister's speech, the honourable memher for Lalor( Mr Pollard) stated quite allotted for the consideration of Senate correctly that the Government is denying amendment No. 16 has expired. to Australian citizens, against whom it does not charge a crime, the rights given to persons charged with treason or murder. That is true, because in cases of amendment be agreed to. treason or murder the prosecution mu9t prove its case. The Government's argument in connection with this matter is a mere subterfuge. The idea that the onus of proof may be shifted at a later part of the case when a. person goes into the box is a trick. The Prime Minister rushed, as I have to rush, to the next point, which concerns an appeal to the full court. He states that there should be no provision for an appeal to the full court. Again we say that an appeal lies to a higher court in the case of most indictable offences. It is perfectly true that on matters of fact there has to he leave to appeal, hut on all questions of law there is the right of appeal under the laws of the States. We wish accused persons in this case to be given the same rights as are given to persons accused of crime. Wc now come to the matter of compensation. There is a provision designed to give the court discretion to award compensation in the case of a person who has been wrongly declared and who has been successful in having the declaration setaside. Nowi f that person has occupied an office in a trade union he will have been dismissed from it and will immediately have lost his salary and his rights. Is it not absolutelv elementary justice that if such a person wins an appeal he should have the right to ask the court to award just compensation? This is not like the case of a person charged with a crime. The Prime Minister has had no time to deal with other parts of this amendment. I consider that it is now plain from what the Prime Minister has said that all this talk about providing just procedures has gone by the board. All that has been done in the other chamber, following broadly tbe point of view that we took here, is that the individual against whom a charge is made should have the right to have the charge proved against him.

Minister) [9.28] -Amendment No. 7 is an amendment to clause 5 of the bill, that is to say the clause that deals with bodies of persons corporate or unincorporate not being industrial organizations of a certain description. Once again it is necessary to remind .. .. .. 67 the committee of the provisions of clause 5 .. .. .. 40 because the interesting fact is that the first and second sub-clauses of that clause were voted for by both sides of the Par27 liament in both Houses. The clause deals with a body of people, not the Communist",58,Government Members Wh Y Should
202,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Primeparty its-elf but some other body whicli represents an alias for the Communist party. It is well known that there are many such bodies which are the Communist party in another form or under another name. They have been denned in clause 5 asany body of parsons(Â«) which is, or purports to br, or, at any time after the specified date and before the date of commencement of this Act was or purported to be, affiliated with the Australian Communist P a r t j ' ; (6) a majority of the members of which, or a majority of members of the committee of management or other governing body of which, were, at any time after tlie specified date and before the date of commencement of this Act, members of the Australian Coinmunist Party or of the Central Committee or otlier ; Communist Party; (c) which supports or advocates, or, at any time after the specified date and before the date of commencement of this Act, supported or advocated, the objectives, policies, teachings, principles or practices of communism, as expounded by Marx and Lenin, or promotes, or at any time within that period, promoted, the spread of communism, as so expounded; or (d) the policy of which is directed, controlled, shaped or influenced, wholly or substantially, by persons who(i) were, at any time after the specified date and before the date of commencement of this Act, members of the Australian Party or of the Central Committee or other governing body of the Australian Communist Party, or are communists; and ( i i ) make use of that body as a means of advocating, propagating or carrying out the teachings, principles or practices of communism, as expounded by Marx and Lenin. They are the four groups of people, the four descriptions of bodies, which are covered by clause 5. I take it that no honourable member of this committee doubts for one moment that it would be foolish merely to abolish the Communist party and then to allow it to spring up in another form the next morning under another uaane and carry on exactly the same activities. That would, of course, bu crazy. In doing that the law would :be reduced to mere nonsense. In order to guard against that absurdity clause 5 was introduced to provide that these other bodies under these other names could be declared provided that they have this vital hook-up with communism and with Communist direction. Honourable members opposite voted for that sub-clause, but have now once more turned about, and said, "" Although we agree that in theory you should be able to deal with these bodies, we believe that if you declare one of them you should carry the entire burden from first to last of proving the nature of that body and the nature of its activities "". What have we provided in the amendment that we put forward in another place, and that I am now putgoverning body of the Australian ting forward in this House, so that it may be a part of the proposed law to be sent forward by the House? We propose that at the hearing of the application to the Court the appellant shall begin. We further proposeIf evidence is given in person by such officer or officers of the applicant as the Court is satisfied is or are best able to give full and admissible evidence as to matters relevant to the application the burden shall be upon the Commonwealth. . . . Assume that such a body comes before the court. The court says that the person who may give information to the court on oath about this body is the secretary or presiCommunist dent or a member of the Conimittee of Management, as the case may be. The court then says that these are the people who may give evidence on behalf of the body. If those people say that they will not give evidence on oath, then the onus will be on that body to prove that it is not objectives, policies, what the Governor General, on the advice of the King's Ministers, has declared it to be. AgainI say to the committee, and to the country, "" Why not? "" What is sacred about these people who are office bearers of these organizations that gives them this delightful immunity from going to the inconvenience of taking the oath, which, after all, is merely an oath to swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? But once more thc Opposition puts forward an amendment, the whole object of which is to keep these omcers out of the witnessbox. Then the right honourable member for Barton, lashing himself into a fervour about the liberty of the subject, which rang a little hollow in my ears, wants us to believe that this is terrible, that nothing like it has ever occurred before. That being so, I say to him in the homely phrase, "" Be your age "". As Attorney General for a number of years, he repeatedly prosecuted people in cases under the law of this Commonwealth 'where the onus was on them to prove their innocence. I do not remember any fine passions being exhibited .by him at that time. If we are to he told that this is a breach of the law of our land, and an interference with our rights, may I remind him, not for the first time, that when there is a war on, people, parliaments, and governments in all British countries exercise powers over the normal liberties of the subject without question? Of course, like a colleague on the front bench has just done, he can yawn when I say that, because some of those who sit with him believe that we are now living in a state of peace, perfect peace. I remind this committee that had we been living in such a state and not been confronted hy a grim enemy and his agents inside this land, this bill would never have been introduced. It is all nonsense to talk about this state of unbroken peace. Government still sell them wool? the honourable member and his colleagues discussing. He saidwill not have so much wool left to pull over the eyes of the Australian electors. be acting on information (the Minister) of I do not expect honourable members oppothe most confidential character which could site to appreciate all that I have just not be communicated to the person detained said. Opposition members interjecting, able members will cease interjecting, especially the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) otherwise he will not have a further opportunity to interject. ney-General will not need to be reminded of a celebrated case that occurred during the recent war and ultimately went to the House of Lords. That is the case of Liversidge. In that matter, the House of Lords, which is the highest judicial tribunal in Great Britain and the actual repository of the common law, saidWhere the Secretary of State, acting in good faith under Regulation 18 (3) of the Defence (General) Regulations makes an order in which he recites that he has reasonable cause to believe that a person is of hostile associations and that by reason thereof it is necessary to exercise control over him and directs tliat that person be detained, a Court of law cannot inquire whether in fact the Secretary of State had reasonable grounds for his belief. The matter was one for the executive discretion of the Secretary of State. The right honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Hughes) will well remember an exact parallel to this case during the first world war. That is the case of Wallack, in which the High Court made a similar decision. Now let us consider what has been said. Quite a lot of people are offering at presnt to explain what British justice means, and what the ordinary rights of the law may be. Those explanations have caused a lot of good people to become confused into thinking that this is some kind of lawyers' dispute. I want to dispose of that belief, and iu order to do so I shall merely have to quote a short passage from the judgment of Lord Maugham, an immediate ex-Lord Chancellor of England, who was sitting as These are words that have profound It is obvious that in many cases he will or disclosed in Court without the greatest risk of prejudicing the future efforts of the Secretary of State in this and like matters for the defence of the realm. Very little consideration will show the power of the Court to give directions for a hearing of proceedings in camera would not prevent confidential matters from leaking out, and such matters would become known to the person detained and to a nrmber of other persons. It seems to me impossible for the court to come to a conclusion adverse to the opinion of the Secretary of State in such a matter. It is beyond dispute that he can decline to disclose information on which he has acted on the ground that to do so would be contrary to the public interest.",59,Pairs

206,Mr Menzies,"The former AttorLater, in the same case, a celebrated lawyer, a law lord whose name is well known to many members of this Parliament, Lord Macmillan, put the matter even more plainly. He saidHow could a court of law deal with the question whether there was reasonable cause to believe that it was necessary to exercise control over the person proposed to be detained, which is a matter of opinion and policy not of fact? A decision on this question can manifestly be taken only by one who has both knowledge and responsibility which no court can share. He could have said "" B y one or m a n y "" to give his opinion application to the King's Ministers as a whole. That statement is not only in accordance with the law as it has been laid down repeatedly over a period of years, but is also pure horse sense. The Opposition says "" No, we shall have none of this. ""We intend to insist upon a procedure by which the Crown w ill have to lay all its cards on the table before the gentleman who is there because of his conspiracy has to put one of his own on the table "". If anybody is pleased with this amendment party of Australia. It is the most ironical thing in recent history that the people who are going round conducting propaganda on behalf of these misleading amendments are the Communists themselves. They are enjoying for the moment the rare privilege of in voking the name of that system of British justice of which the Communist party is the sworn enemy. Nothing could be more possessed of humbug than the spectacle that we now see. Consequently, I do not propose to occupy any more time on this amendment because it is on all fours witb the last one on which the committee voted. A little later I shall point out that amendment No. 28 together with this one, makes it perfectly clear that the object of the Opposition is to destroy this bill and not to improve it . honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) to withdraw that unparliamentary remark. That amendment No. 7 be amended by leaving out proposed sub-clauses (4.), (5.) and (6.) and inserting the following sub-clauses: "" (4.) At the hearing of the application, the applicant shall begin; if evidence is given in person by sucb officer or officers of the applicant as the court is satisfied is or are best ahle to give full and admissible evidence as to matters relevant to the application, the burden shall be upon the Commonwealth to prove that the applicant is a body to which this section applies, but, if evidence is not so given, the burden shall be upon the applicant to prove that the applicant is not a body to which this section applies. "" (5.) Upon the hearing of the application, the declaration made by the Governor General under sub-seetion (2.)' of this section shall, insofar as it declares, that the applicant is a body of persons to which this section applies, be prima facie evidence that the applicant is such a body."". quite correct that, as the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said, this clause and this amendment raise questions of similar principle to those that were discussed under clause 9. But there are important distinctions which the committee should it is the Communist bear in mind. This matter deals w i th organizations alleged to be of a certain character. All through the Prime Minister's speech runs the assumption that because you allege these things against bodies and describe them in a certain way in the bill, then they are truly described. That involves a point to be determined by the judiciary. Whether or not this clause that defines affiliated organizations t r u l y describes them f u l l y is to be determined by the court. It is useless for the Prime Minister, who yields to none in his appeals to passion, to try to confuse the issue. He assumes that which has to be proved. Eor the sake of illustration I refer to paragraph (d) of sub-clause (1.) of clause 5. If a body were declared under that provision, and if the court did not set aside the declaration, all the property of that body would be taken from it Avithout compensation. Everybody should agree that that would be a Order ! I ask the very serious and direct interference with civil right9 unless the facts are proved.

""Wben the matter crimes to the appropriate court, the -question to be decided is whether the -charge that has been made against the body is true. In substance the charge is that there is some Communist influence iin the body or that there has been some Communist infiltration. The effect of the declaration of thc body under the bill w ill be comiplete loss of proprietary rights without compensation. The proper course to follow is laid down in the Senate's amendment, which should be accepted. persons who make imputations against any body should prove tbem. That is the only correct procedure in such circumstances. The further amendment proposed by the Government, which provides that, in the first instance, a declared body must prove its exemption 'from the terms of the bill and that the burden of proof may be shifted, to the Commonwealth if the chief officers of the body convince t.he court that they are sufficiently informed to be able to give f u l l and admissible evidence in relation to the application, is simply ,a device intended to get over the fact that the onus of proof is to be placed upon the body instead of upon the Commonwealth. 1 come now to the second part of the declaration. Asi n the case of individuals, the Government does not propose to declare all the bodies that w ill be covered by this clause. It s intention, as is stated in sub-clause (2.), is that it wil] not ban such organizations, unless in addition t.o being of the character described, they are bodies the continued right honourable existence of which would be prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth It is a very vague The Prime Minister has referred to the great case of Anderson and Liversidge. I do not think that his use of it was justified. It is true that it was a war-time. I did not approve of it . case in which a person with enemy associations had been detained. He did not appeal against the detention order, but he challenged, by independent applicat i o n , the validity of the regulation under which the order was made. The court held, by a majority decision, that the regulation applied. In order to make the situation absolutely clear, I shall read from what was said by Lord Macmillan, whom the Prime Minister quoted. Lord Macmillan saidWere the person detained left without any safeguard, this might be an argument against holding that an absolute discretion has been conferred on the Secretary of State. But the argument is the other way when it is found, na it is in this regulation, that elaborate provision is made for the safeguarding of the detained person's interests. I refer to the constitution of advisory committees to which any person aggrieved by a detention order may make representations. The duty is imposed on the chairman to inform the objector of the grounds on which the detention order has 'been made, and to furnish him with such particulars It provides that as are in the chairman's opinion sufficient to enable him to state his case. In other words, a person with enemy associations in time of war had a right, under the regulations in the United Kingdom, to put his case before an advisory committee, and the duty of the chairman of that committee was to make clear to the individual the substance of the charge that had been laid against him. That is a feature that is conspicuously absent from this legislation. Even the making of the declaration to the effect that it is likely to prejudice the defence of the Commonwealth will not be known to the organization concerned.

I have pointed out that, under the British regulation, a hearing was accorded to the individual concerned. The Government proposes that there shall be no right of hearing under this legislation. Therefore, the Senate has inserted a provision which grants to a body a right of appeal to the appropriate court on two points. The first point concerns the question whether the body is a body such as is described in clause 5 ( 1 . ) . The second point concerns the question whether it is a body detrimental to the security of tiie nation. To-day tliere is a state of peace. The Prime Minister may use any metaphor 'that he likes to choose, but the fact is that there is a Ftate of peace between Australia and Eussia, although it is a state that can be f a i r l y described as one of strained relations. The Prime Minister can talk about a. "" cold "" war, but Australia has diplomatic relationships and f u l l trade relationships with Eussia. It is completely untrue to say that there is a state of war between the two countries. In my view it is utterly mischievous as well as untrue to say that only a technical state of peace with Bussia exists. Both in GreatB r it a in and in Australia in time of war, any individual against whom an order was made had the right, not to go to a court, but to state his case before an executive tribunal, which was usually presided over by a judge. That right is not to be given to the organizations to which clause 5 refers. I say that the Prime Minister proposes to deny to Australian citizens in time of peace the rights that were accorded to enemy aliens in GreatB r it a in and Australia in time of war. That indicates the state of bias in which the right honourable gentleman has made his approach to this legislation. The Opposition's view is that everybody in the community is entitled to justice and a proper hearing. If imputations are made against any body, affecting its civil or proprietary rights, it is entitled to be informed of the nature of Of course not. But the the charge against it and to be granted a f a i r hearing, so that the judicial authority w ill be given the duty of making its verdict upon the charge. The Prime Minister has talked about the King's Ministers of State and the King's Government. Under our Constitution the King's courts are the protectors of citizens against whom charges of the character that are contemplated in the bill are levelled. Under the Government's proposed provision, we should produce the shocking result that, even though a body might appeal successfully against, its classification under clause 5 ( 1 . ) , itmight remain for ever under the shr-dow of the further declaration, which is unappealable, that its continued existence was prejudicial to the country.

Members of the present Opposition declared last December that they would not ban the Communist party if they were returned to power.

The proposal to introduce criminal law into civil proceedings is the clearest proof that the Opposition wants to load the dice against the Oommonwealth. that is provided by the fact that the -Opposition also proposes that provision shall be made for payment of compensation. Thus, we have this position: The -declared person comes before a j u r y of twelve men. this clause. Senate amendment No. 28. right honourable memher for Barton w ill be so obliging as to look at it he w ill find that it relates to both clause S and clause 9; and I am talking about clause 9, which deals with individuals. I am saying that the individual goes out because on. balance somebody has decided to give him the benefit of a doubt. So, he w ill be better placed than is a man charged with burglary who is acquitted, because, under the Opposition's proposal, he w ill be entitled to compensation. This seeks to put the Communist in Australia in a better position than is any ordinary fellow who may be charged with an -offence under the criminal law. to provide for compensation for a man who is innocent. that the Senate amendment gives to the man who is brought within clause 5 a privilege that is denied to the ordinary man who is charged with a crime. That is the attitude that the Opposition adopts w i th respect to the gravest internal threat that has yet confronted our country. The only other point that I need to make is that this country elects a Parliament. It elected one on tbe 10th December last. On that occasion it installed in -office the present Government; and in previous years, it installed another -government. But whatever the government, it was the government that the j u r y of the Australian pepple chose and put in office in order to guard the interests of the Australian people and, above all, to ensure that the safety and defence of this country should not be neglected. But the Opposition, seeking to whip up an agitation because of the known deFurther evidence of votion of our people to the j u r y system, says, in effect, "" All right, on this question which concerns the safety and defence of the people of Australia and in which opinion and judgment are in gredients ""-the bill provides that persons or organizations may be declared if , in the opinion of the Governor-Generali n is not covered by Council, they do certain things-""the opinion of twelve men brought in by chance selection and put on a. j u r y is to be substituted for the opinion of nineteen If the people sitting in a Oabinet and the opinion of 121 people sitting in His Majesty's House of Representatives"". What sort of an amendment is that? What sort of ducks and drakes does that play with responsible government? This is not a simple question of fact. It is not a question of whether Jones shoots Brown, or of whether Brown steals Robertson's goods. The question is whether out of a whole snarl of circumstances, some to be proved and some to be assumed, but all to be seen against the background of the national interest, the judgment of responsible authorities is that a man should not be allowed to be in the Government service or to occupy a responsible position in a key union. If that task is to be entrusted to a j u r y the Government might as well say good-bye to its responsibilities and this Parliament w ill have washed its hands of all charge that is laid upon it to ensure the safety and defence of the realm.

234,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.26],"the courts should not come into them at all because, he says, the Executive having spoken that should he the end of the matter. He has belittled the jury system, which is the very foundation of our system of justice. The right honourable gentleman has so little respect for the jury system that, at a Liberal party rally in the Sydney Town Hall last ""Wednesday night, he declared' that it would be an act of lunacy to hand over to a jury of twelve men the responsibility of deciding whether a declaration should be confirmed. When he talks about the Governor-'General in Council why does he not speak in plain terms instead of in legal jargon? What he means by the Governor General in Council is the Liberal-Country party Government which, he says, should be the sole judge of these matters. He belittled the idea that, under tlie jury system, if one man disagreed witli the remaining eleven he would decide the issue. Probably, if the decision Berry, D. R. were left to the Government, the issue might still be decided by one man because one Minister could make it. 'The Prime Minister has talked about activities threat to the safety of this country. If the Government has information iu its possession whicb shows that organiFadden. A. W. zations, or individuals, have been conspiring against thc safety-of the country, and has not. launched a prosecution under existing laws, the members of the Government have been false to their oath of office. The fact is that the Chifley Government, when it went out of oflice, did not have any evidence that showed that such activities were heing carried on. Therefore, the Prime Minister should present to the Parliament some evidence of the existence of an actual threat to the safety of the country. The right honourable gentleman knows full well that he is only trying to work up public hysteria because he wants to establish in this country a fascist dictatorship. On innumerable occasions in the past he has gone on record in favour of totalitarian forms of government. He has had a lot to say about letting the people decide. It. would bs a very good thing to let the people decide; and, judging by the deciMr Ward. sions that they have given in recent State elections, I have no doubt about what their decision would be. allotted for the consideration of Senate amendment No. 28 has expired.

It has heen agreed that a declared person or organization should have the right of appeal to the High Court, or to a supreme court judge in one of the States. Eor the purposes of that provision, the definition of ""the appropriate court"" is set out in the hill at present as follows:"" the appropriate uourt "" means(a) in relation to an application by a body of persons-the High Court, the Supreme Court of tbe State or Territory (being a Territory forming part of the Commonwealth) in which the principal office of the body is situated or the Supreme Court of a. State or Territory (being a Territory forming part of the Commonwealth) in whicli a substantial number of inonvbers of the body are resident: Let us now consider the position of an organization. Under the hill as it left this chamber, no appeal could be brought to the supreme court of a State by an organization unless it was established that a ""majority"" of the members of the organization were resident in the particular State. Thus, if there were a hundred members in an organization, and 30 of its menibers resided in one State, 30 in another, 20 in another, and 20 in another, there would not be a majority of members in any one State, with the result that the organization could not take it3 case to the supreme court of a State, but would have had to approach the High Court. That was why the amendment was moved in the Senate to substitute the words, "" substantial number"", for the word "" majority "". .a body could approach the supreme court in three or four States.

In fact, his wife -office of the organization is situated. no application was made by officials of the organization, it would be impossible for the members to approach the supreme court of a State. I submit that the Senate's amendment was a reasonable one and should be accepted. [10.43 ) -It is quite clear that, as the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) pointed out, these amendments represent an attempt by the Opposition to sabotage the bill, and make it unworkable. Persons who would not dare to oppose the bill openly, because they know that the rank and file of the Labour party are overwhelmingly opposed to communism, are using subtle means to oppose it. Amendments Nos. 6 and 15, which are at present before the committee, are both designed to bring within the ambit of the court an appeal on the second ground of the declaration, so that it may be required to rule whether an organization or an individual is in fact, liable to comrmit acts which are prejudicial to the safety of the Commonwealth. One can understand the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) being particularly tender on points of this kind because, in a way, he is defending himself, and members of his family, perhaps, in what might be an awkward predicament in view of their past activities.

The journals published by the organization during the time that M.r. Clivo Evatt was its president fully bear out the truth of my allegation.

The same applies to the honourable gentleman's other remark, which was completely gratuitous, in which he criticized my brother because he was associated with some Anglo-Soviet body. AllI desire to say in conclusion in regard to his reference to me, is that far from having the slightest association with the Communist party, I , along with other leaders of the Labour party, have been subjected to incessant attack from the Communists and in that respect its attacks resemble the false attack made by the honourable member for Mackellar.

All of these amendments except one were made by the Senate at the suggestion of the Government. Most of them are minor. The one that deserves perhaps some particular mention is amendment No. 4, in which we have set out to guard against the suggestion that there might be some hasty, ill-considered declaration of somebody, by providing that the Executive Council shall not advise the Government to make a declaration under the various sub-sections unless the material upon which the advice is founded has first been considered by a committee consisting of the Solicitor-General, the Secretary to the Department of Defence, the Director-General of Security and two other persons appointed by the Governor General. That amendment should certainly commend itself to the Opposition. That amendment certainly succeeded in commending itself to the Opposition in the Senate. is one point that I can make in the time available. time allotted for the consideration of this group of amendments has expired.

268,Motion (By Mr Menzies) Agreed To,"Minister) .[11.7] -On behalf of the committee I bring up the following reasons:Reasons of tlie House of Representatives for disagreeing to amendments Nos. 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22 and 28 of the Senate. 1. Because thc amendments are designed to and will destroy the efficacy of the proposed law. 2. Because the amendments do not effectuate the policy for which the Government received an overwhelming mandate at the elections on 10th December last. 3. Because tlie amendments will prevent the carrying out of the policy of thc Government to protect this country and its people against the dangers recited in the preamble to this bill. I move That tlie committee's reasons be adopted. committee that met and reported so rapidly, has asked the House to adopt its report, which states, among other things, that the' amendments are designed to and w ill destroy the efficacy of the proposed law. I say that that statement is false. The suggestion that the amendments for which the Labour Opposition in the Senate was responsible were designed to destroy the efficacy of the proposed law made to-night by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) is quite incorrect. To repeat a phrase used by the right honourable gentleman, it is an unworthy and ignoble suggestion. The primary objective of the Opposition in both this House and in the Senate has been to ensure that the administration and implementation of the measure w i l not give rise to injustices. Mr Spender Ministeri n order in interjecting from the back bench? are disorderly; but a Minister, if he wishes to speak, may do so from any part of the House. the long number of years that I have been in the House, when I have interjected from any place other than my own, I have been rebuked by Mr Speaker Prim* and I suggest that that precedent should be followed in respect of the honourable member for Warringah, the Attorney General. able member for Warringah is not the Attorney-General. He is the Minister for External Affairs. that the Government has put forward ie untrue. The Senate's amendments arc designed to provide safeguards whicli w ill ensure that neither persons nor organizations w ill be unjustly deprived of property or their civil rights. To state in a forma] report to the House of Representatives that these amendments are designed by the Senate to destroy the efficacy of the b ill is not only untrue, but completely contrary to all constitutional practice governing the relationships which exist between two chambers such as this House and the Senate. I am surprised that such an expression could be used under your chairmanship, Mr Speaker. that the right honourable member is not imputing to me the responsibility for this statement. you would not be responsible, Mr. Speaker. I say that this bill, as amended by the Senate, is a workable measure and that it is completely inaccurate to say that its efficacy would be interfered with by the amendment of the Senate. If an individual were to be declared and were to lose his status interjecting, or position in a trade union or in the is the Public Service how would the fact that he had the right to take the declaration that had caused these evil consequences to him to a court of justice All interjections to be tested, or is he so elects, by a jury , destroy the efficacy of the bill? The fact that a declared person could do so would not destroy the efficacy of the I rise to order.

277,Dr. Evatt,"No . I am sure that I was unable earlier to refer to one feature of tbe bill which is important and which carne into existence in another chamber. That feature is the appointment of a committee of five, including the heads of the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Defence and the security service, in order to make some report to the Government on the particular organization or person proposed to be declared -that is to say, by the Government Even under this proposal, an individual has no right to be heard. If that committee were to lie constituted in the same way as the advisory committees which were used in time of war, it would be of some substantial advantage. I notice that this document is headed. ""Reasons for the House of Representatives for disagreeing with the amendments of the Senate"". I submit that even that statement is inaccurate because the committee was only appointed to deal with certain amendments and its report does not refer to them all. amendments "". means "" all "". The amendments are not specified. The second reason given in the report is as follows:Because tlie amendments do not effectuate as much consideration by the committee the policy for which the Government received au overwhelming mandate at the elections on t.he 10th December last. This adjective "" overwhelming "" is losing its force and accuracy as the months go on. A slight majority at the polls did result in the Government having a large majority in this House, after the lasi general election. But I submit that these statements are quite inconsistent with those that were made hy the present Prime Minister and the Leader of the Australian Country party .before the general election, when those right honourable gentlemen said that the action which it was proposed to take against the Communist party would ibe "" subject to appeal"". Thej' also said that the date in respect of which persons would be declared would be sometime in November. The third reason that the committee has given isBecause the amendments will .prevent the carrying out of the policy of the Government to protect tliis country and its people against the dangers recited in the preamble to this bill. Again, the question is begged. No reasons of fact are adduced to the Senate for the action taken by the House parties-in dealing with the Senate's amendments. This House, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, has not even given consideration to the Senate's amendments. The Senate spent eight or nine days in an important debate on this bill. This House has ouly considered the Senate's amendments for a short evening and even that time has been interrupted by a large number of divisions. It is typical of the Government's unseemly haste and restriction of debate and its interference with freedom of speech that the culmination of this debate should be a report which, I suggest, the committee, appointed a few minutes ago, has not even met to consider. DocsI t does not say "" all the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) support these statements? The committee was appointed five minutes ago and the report was in existence, apparently, before the committee was appointed. I suggest that the report was given about of three as the Government permitted honourable members to give to the Senate's amendments in committee this evening. Therefore, I submit that these reasons are not fairly put, are not true in substance, and should be dissented from and voted against. Commerce and Agriculture) [11.17] The Government believes tliat the Senate's amendments are designed to destroy this bill. The historic approach of the Labour party to communism confirms the conviction of the Government that the Labour party desires to destroy any proposal to dissolve the Communist party.

He then asked me tlie following questions:Is it a fact that token shipments of Axistralian iron ami steel, wire and galvanized iron are going to New Zealand? If so, will the Prime Minister ascertain whether New Zealand really requires the present quantities heing imported, and if not will the Government reduce such shipments in view of the desperate need for tliose materials in Australia? In reply to the honourable member, I would advise that his statement is entirely without foundation and, in fact, quite contrary to the true position. Insofar a3 the honourable member's questions are concerned the answers are as follows:1. Yes. 2. The New Zealand Government has advised that all iron and steel products .being received from Anstralia are definitely required in New Zealand.

I have since made inquiries concerning the transaction referred to by the honourable member and have now been advised that the tank-landing ships in question were ships of the Royal Navy which had been loaned to the Royal Australian Navy at the end of the war.

Has he considered the serious effect that the mass iniportation of this glassware will have upon the industiy in Australia? 4. Will the permit to import this equipment adversely affect tlie business established in Australia by Philips during the war, and which played an important part in the defence equipment of Australia. 5. If a permit has been granted, did he consult with the Glass Workers Union or the producers of similar equipment in Australia, in order to determine what adverse effects such a licence to import would have on local industry ? Trade and Customs has supplied the following information:1. The by-law concession to which the honourable member refers is of long standing, having been in operation for many years. Rates of duty are free under the British preferential tariff and 12-J per eent. ad valorem under the most-favoured-nation and general tariffs. The by-law has not been modified by the present Government. 2. Any importer may avail himself of the concession without making special application. 3. The quantities of glass bulbs imported under the by-law are very small in comparison with quantities of the same class of goods produced locally. 4. No. 5. No licence is necessary for the importation of glass bulbs of United Kingdom origin. Licences are issued for importation from easy currency sources on evidence of availability and from hard curreney areas after it has been definitely established that similar goods or suitable alternatives are not available from local production.

303,"Mr Mulle Ns Asked The Treasurer,","MT . FADDBN -The answers to the honourable member's questions are. as follows:1, 2, 3, and i . It is usual for copies of American motion picture films to be printed in Australia from duplicate negatives imported from the United States. The intrinsic value of such negatives is insignificant and no total figure is recorded for such imports in trade statistics. The main dollar liability for such films arises from royalty payments, which are, ns u rule, related to box-office receipts. There no restriction on the importation of the negatives of American films, In 1947 the previous Oovernment entered into an arrangement with the Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia which provides for the restriction of film remittances to America to 50 per cent, of tlie amount remitted for this purpose in the calendar year 1046. Under this arrangement, unremittaible earnings are to be finally expended in Australia or to remain invested here for a period of ten years.
