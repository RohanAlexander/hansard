In the province of labour he is the acknowledged aristocrat. But at the present time, through no fault of his own, Australia offers him few attractions. During the last twenty years large engineering concerns have sprung into existence, have flourished for a few years, and have partially or wholly fallen. The probability that the reports. Surely we ought to be taken into Clyde Engineering Works in Sydney will close at the end of the year will cause disappointment to everybody who desires to witness Australian progress. The writer proceeds to point out that this distress and want of employment is due to a lack of demand, and I find, from figures supplied to me by the right honourable member for Balaclava, that the value of the imports in the iron trade last year exceeded that of the imports of 1903 by ^107,255. it is the duty of the Tariff Commission to deal as quickly as possible with .one or two of these pressing items, and if they are unable, as at present constituted, to satisfactorily carry out this important work, it is'the duty of the Government to come to their assistance. orable member? seat on the Commission, so that the honourable and learned member's interjection is pointless. we should get information which would be useful to us. appointment. vernment will urge the Commission to place the evidence taken by it in the hands of honourable members as soon as it is printed.

Speaking for myself, I regret the situation. I should have been only too glad-and I think other members of the Commission take the same view-if the Commission had been in a position to make the official evidence public, particularly in view of the fact that newspapers which profess to supply reasonable and correct reports of the evidence of the proceedings have presented absolute travesties to the public. that we should have selected certain items and after investigating them, have presented a report regarding them to His Excellency. less the Commission visited all the States? been made as to the items with which we should first proceed to deal. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports told us that when the appointment of the Commission was under consideration he urged that certain items should be selected as the first subjects of inquirv. lenged by other honourable members at that time to nominate items, but neither he nor anvone else who shared his view, condescended to enlighten us. ber's pardon. I indicated the items affecting the iron trade. the view taken by this House in appointing the Commission was, broadly, that we should proceed to investigate the effects of the Tariff upon Australian industries generally, and we naturally proceeded with our inouiry by taking the items in their proper order under the Tariff. I now desire to direct attention to a phiise of the question which was debated in another place yesterday. To my mind, a most unfortunate complexion was given to the issue raised by an honourable senator, who was charged by those who opposed him with acting in a partizan spirit. It was alleged that his action was part and parcel of a free-trade move intended to block the work of the Commission. Knowing as I did that that view was not correct, I took steps to place myself in a position to give the statement an absolute denial. I knew as a fact that so far from any effort of a party character having been made yesterday, endeavours I do not know anywere directed to preventing, the motion from being brought forward. The original intention was that Senator Clemons and the honourable and learned member for Illa warra should take action simultaneously in their respective Houses. The leader of the Opposition in this House, for reasons that seemed good to him, was anxious that these two gentlemen should not take action. He persuaded the honourable and learned member for Illawarra not to move in the matter, but he was unable to turn Senator Clemons from his purpose. That honourable senator, and I believe properly too, intimated to his leader that the issue was not a party one, but of a personal character, affecting the Commission, and a duty he had to perform to the electors, and that he would proceed with his motion even against the wishes of his leader. No suggestion has yet the charge now ? perfectly clear that the free-trade members of the Commission cannot properly be charged with having attempted for merely partisan reasons to block the progress of its work. I had intended, if this opportunity He was chalhad not been offered, to bring the matter before the House in another form. We are being asked to give up practically the whole of the session 'to the work of the Commission, and I wish to know whether the HouseI beg the honourable memever intended that that should be done, or ever had any idea that members of the Commission would be placed in such an imI wish to point out that proper position. Our first duty is undoubtedlv to the people whom we represent, and when I accepted a position on the Commission I never dreamt-and I am sure no other member did-that we should be expected to travel to the other States and take evidence whilst Parliament was sitting. mission go to the other States during the recess ?",14,Adjournment Formal Tariff Commission

The present position does not arise from any vote of the political members of the Commission, but from a vote given by two members of the Commission,' who, although perfectlyfree to exercise their rights, have placed the political members of the Commission on the horns of a dilemma. The particulars of that vote, have already been given elsewhere, but I can assure honourable members that the actual result of the division that brought about the present position affords no criterion of the opinion of the members of the Commission. I wish to know from this House whether the political members of this Commission are expected to leave their legislative duties to take care of themselves, and to go round the other States collecting evidence. not do so we ought to resign, but that is begging the question. ciple involved. marily to represent the electors, and our first duty is to them. discharge that duty if we go to the other States and spend practically the whole of the session upon the work of the Commission. ther time. expression of opinion from honourable members.

The work has been excessively trying, yet at the same time interesting, and I intend to see it through. I shall do my best to complete it as soon as possible, because I believe the results will be beneficial to the community as a whole, and very enlightening to those who take any interest in the Tariff question. to rise immediately after the honourable member for Perth had resumed his seat, because I thought that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, as Chairman of the Commission, would probably have something to say on behalf of himself and his fellow members. when a charge was made against the Commission. The honourable member charged the Commission with not carrying on their work satisfactorily, and I think the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, as the official head of the Commission, ought to have been the first to defend it. It is all very well for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to say that some weeks ago he contemplated taking action of this kind, but it is a significant fact that in the Age this morning bear out my statement. stances I am not disposed to accept the word of the Prime Minister in connection with anything.

There might be something in the proposal if no work remained to be done in this city. But I would point out that it was by reason of the agitation aroused by the representatives of Victoria and by the newspapers of this State concerning its so-called languishing industries that the Commission was appointed. So far as Victorian industries are concerned, we still have at least three or four months' work to do in this city. asked to visit Western Australia in the middle of its inquirv. bers of the Commission can be employed in taking evidence each morning, whilst Parliament is in session, why should we be called 'upon to leave pur (parliamentary duties in order to visit Western Australia and South Australia ? I submit that that is an absolutely unjust and wrong position in which to place any political member of that body. choose between two alternatives. I must be accused of neglecting my duties, as a member of this Parliament, or of neglecting them as a member of the Tariff Commission. mind the position admits of no argument. Responsible as are my duties as a member of the Tariff Commission-and from the past five months' experience I have learned to thoroughly appreciate how onerous and responsible are those dutiesI have no hesitation whatever in placing my parliamentary duties before those which pertain to my position as a member of that Commission. members discharge both their parliamentary duties and those pertaining to membership of the Tariff Commission by sitting in Melbourne and taking the evidence of Victorian manufacturers, I say there is no excuse whatever for the Chairman or any other member of that body attempting to force members of this House to occupy seats upon it, into a position in which they will have to neglect their parliamentary work. far as I am personally) concerned-and I intimated this fact to the Chairman some three or four months ago, when I saw that there was a probability of this contingency arisingI refuse to leave my parliamentary duties in order to attend the sittings of the Tariff Commission, either, in Tasmania or any of the other distant States. I am glad that the honourable member for Perth made reference to the endeavour which has been made to brand the action which was taken in the Senate yesterday afternoon as a move on the part of the'free-trade members of this Parliament. ' The honourable member for Perth is not a member of the Free-Trade Party, t i e is a member of the Labour Party, and I have not the slightest hesitation in endorsing every word which was uttered by him in connection with that matter. Honourable members have seen the division-list, showing the voting by the And yet the Commission is members of the Tariff Commission upon the proposal that they should visit the other States during the current session, and refer, ence to it will prove that that proposal was of the Victorian free-trade representatives upon the Commission. Where, then, is the ground for the accusation that the action which was taken in another place was a concerted movement on the part of free trade members to hang up the inquiry ?

That fact conclusively proves that there was nothing in the Seeingthat the political nature of a concerted free-trade movement of that tribunal can in connection with what occurred yesterday. Concerning the remarks of the honourable member for Perth in regard to the attitude of the leader of the Opposition towards this matter, I can confirm his statement that it was owing to the intervention of the right honourable member for East -Sydney IthatI refrained from bringing the subject before the House yesterday.

75,Mr Fuller,"A t any rate, I knowpositions upon the Tariff Commission. In view of the situation which has arisen, if that inquiry partook of the nature of that made by an ordinary Commission, and if its members had accomplished only a little work, my resignation would have been in the hands of the Governor General long ere this. But I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that we have been engaged in that investigation for the past. five months, that we have asked some 60,000 questions, that we have accumulated a pile of evidence-in'short , that -we have undertaken a herculean task. Realizing the position in which any person who succeeded to that Commis.sion by reason of the resignation of any of its present members would find himself, I would hesitate a long time before taking the extreme sf4p suggested. Another statement has been made-to the -effect that members of the Commission are making a good thing out of the inquiry. In regard to the allegation made'in the Senate to the effect that the members of tlie Commission are in receipt of very good -emoluments, I wish to say-and I think the fact ought to be made public-that we receive nothing. We are giving our services in connection with this great matter out of patriotism. WhilstI am prepared to do everything I can to help forward that inquiry, and whilst I am actually out of pocket over the whole business, I feel indignant that I should be accused of making a good thing out of it. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has declared that the official report of the evidence taken -should be placed before the public. Upon that matter I think that our chairman took a very proper view. We hold our positions upon that Commission, not by virtue of an appointment from this House, but under the Royal prerogative, and we are responsible primarily, not to this House, but to the Governor General. with the view expressed by the chairman when he pointed out that, so far as the -evidence; was concerned-n o matter how useful a purpose might be served if it were placed before the public-it was our first duty to present it to His Excellency the Governor General, from whom we received -our commission. progress report has been presented, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will have an opportunity of seeing a portion of -that evidence, oapies of which, I understand, will be laid upon the table of the House before very long. I have no desire to labour this matter unduly. I merely wish, in addition, to refer to the statement of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that we ought to have first inquired into the condition of those industries which are alleged to Be struggling As the hcnor ible member for Perth has very properly pointed out, at the time the matter of the appointment of the Commission was under consideration, and when it was being urged that those industries which were stated to be suffering acutely from the operation of the Tariff should be specified, nD honourable member opposite ever went so far as to mention even one of them? What is the position of the Commissioners? To a very large extent we occupy a judicial position. We cannot ' determine, which industries are _ struggling for an existence until the evidence relating to them has been laid before us. It will be only then that we shall be able to decide which industries are struggling, and which industries are being ruined in any of the States. Consequently we could have taken up no other position than that which we have done. I may sayi that we were unanimous that we should inquire into the effects of the operation of the Tariff upon the industries of ,Australia in the order in which they appear in our Tariff Act. I wish to intimate -as I did long ago to our Chairman-that , as far as I am personally concerned, while recognising the great responsibility under which I labour as a member of the Tariff Commission, I regard my duty to my constitutents and the country generally-whic h means my presence in Parliament-as of paramount importance. point out that if we consent to the departure to other States of those honourable members who occupy seats on the Tariff CommisI entirely agree sion, we shall establish a precedent which cannot be a very good one. Seeing that the Constitution itself demands that honourable members should be present in their places in this House during the session, and that a record is taken of their attendances, I hold that it is not for us, under any plea whatever, to sanction the release of honorBut. now that fhe first able members from their duties here. the attendances, is it not? think that any member of the Commission who is also a member of Parliament, and",17,Adjournment Formal Tariff Commission

I shall be prepared to pay some attention to what he says. I am surprised to hear.of the unconstitutional course proposed to be taken by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo-that he is one of those honourable members who are so forgetful of the provisions of the Constitution demanding our attendance in this House that he proposes, as a member of the Tariff Commission, to proceed to other States during the present session. When an application is made for leave of absence on his behalf. I may feel it my duty to oppose it . taken up by him should be brought under the notice of his constituents. able member elected to represent the people in this House should be allowed to absent himself in the way he proposes while Parliament is in session. and learned member for Bendigo has a better attendance record than has the honourable and learned member. sions be appointed, it may become impossible for the Parliament to meet. If the members of the Tariff Commission consisted solely of eight honourable members on the Government benches, would it be said for one moment that the course now proposed to be taken should be adopted? I think not, and what would not be allowed in the one set of circumstances should not be permitted in the other. have a suggestion to make to the Government.. equal number of free-trade and protectionist members on the Tariff Commission, and that their report, therefore, must be a half and half one. we are aware that certain industries have been absolutely strangled, I think that the Government should at once bring in a BilD dealing with those industries, and allow the' whole matter to be fought out by the: Parliament without waiting for the report of the Tariff Commission. Heaven only knows when the labours of that Commission will be completed. Their deliberations may extend over the next ten years. The iron industry has been crippled; the local industry of manufacturing harvestershas practically gone, and the distillery factories have also been virtually closed. But, apart from these considerations, we ought to say at once whether we are prepared to allow our country to be run by those whoWhen he is able to talk sense, pay no taxes. If our foreign trade friends believe in foreign countries, let them leave Australia. I came here because I believed it to be the best of all countries to which I could go. I repeat that, instead of waiting for the report of the Commission, the Government should at once bring in a B ill dealing with those industries that are now languishing, and, allow the wholematter to be fought out. On this particular question, some of our free-trade friends are more autocratic, heartless, and tyrannical than was any despotic monarch who The position occupied the throne of ancient Egypt. No honor1 not wish to speak at length on this question ; but I cannot forget that when this matter was debated in the House last session, I made, advisedly, one or two irregular interjections, because it appeared to me I think that the honourable that there was one individual in the Commonwealth who had been lost sight of, and that was the consumer. It seems to bealmost a religion with the protectionists of Victoria, and with the protectionist press, that, as soon as they have proved that an industry is languishing, the wisdom of imposing more duties is at once conclusively demonstrated. In the case of the agricultural industry, for instance, our protectionist friends entirely forget that, while it is not being protected, proposals are being made day after day to heap further obligations, in the form of additional taxation, upon it . It was with these facts inmy mind that I interjected on the occasion referred to that the consumer should"" We all know that there is an receive some attention.

(Parkes),"I domission have shown a disposition to inquire not merely whether an industry is waning -or prospering, but what effect the duties which enable it to prosper are having upon the consumer who pays. object to that. -it said, in a vague and general way,that it is to the interests of the people that everyindustry should prosper. ThatI admit; 'but it is not in the interests of the people that industries should prosper at an unlimited expense to the people who pay the duties imposed to protect them, even although those duties may help to pile up the banking credit of the manufacturers. I wish to draw attention to one paragraph in the progress report of the Commission which -shows clearly that it has done its duty. The paragraph is as follows: If Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland were the only States interested in the Tariff grievances which we have already investigated in those States, we would be in a position to submit some recommendations respecting items in the first five divisions. The other States of the Commonwealth are, however, also interested. Our recommendations might lead either to the reduction of Customs and Excise duties, or the increase of Cus'toms and Excise duties; they would, therefore, involve revenue, as well as industrial considerations in which the people of the whole Commonwealth are concerned, who have all a right to be heard by a Commonwealth Commission before the :stage of deliberation and recommendation is reached. We are of opinion that it would, be an unfederal procedure establishing a dangerous precedent if a Royal Commission appointed to deal with Commonwealth questions of importance and -complexity, in which all parts of the Commonwealth are vitally interested, were to arrive at findings, and give advice to Parliament without liaving affordednot the manufacturers, but-the taxpayers of each State an opportunity of ""being heard either in support of or in opposition -to proposed alterations of the law. I am sure that every right-thinking man will say that the Commission are doing their"" -duty in refusing to come to even one con-clusion with regard to proposed increases -or reductions of duty, until they have heard -every man who chooses to come forward and say how proposals for piling up the -duties affect him as ia taxpaver or consumer. -members of this House who are members of the Tariff Commission, have pointed out what they consider are its difficulties. They do not wish to go to Western Australia as members of that Commission while the House is sitting, and I am satisfied we shall find that if the Commission goes to Tasmania, Western Australia, and South Australia during the present session, not one honourable member sitting on this side of the House will be able to take part in its deliberations there. Subsequently, when the evidence taken in those States is brought before them, they will not be in a position to properly deal with it. A Commission, in framing its report, must be guided not only by the. evidence submitted, but by the demeanor and the character of the witnesses who have given that evidence. The Attorney-General, as a lawyer, must recognise that this is so. I am sure-that when he is appearing as counsel in a case, he attaches just as much importance to the character and bearing of a witness in the box as he does to the evidence which' that witness gives. The two honourable members to whom I have referred, absolutely refuse to proceed to Western Australia, for the reason that they believe that they would be false to their duties as representatives of the electors in this House, if they absented themselves in this way while the House was in session. If the course proposed by the Commission is to be followed, what is to prevent the appointment, in the future, of a series of Royal Commissions, comprising so many members of this House, as to render it impossible for a quorum to be formed ? At all events, the fighting strength of the House might be seriously depleted in this way. If this course is to be adopted, the result will be that parliamentarians will either have to refuse appointments on Royal Commissions, or else be false to their duties as representatives of the electors. Both the Federal and States Legislatures debar Select Committees from meeting while Parliament, is sitting, and I think the same principle should be adopted in regard to Royal Commissions. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports admits that only four members of the Commission will proceed to Western Australia. What reason have we to believe that they will be able to take evidence there? It takes four members to form a quorum, so that in the event of one of their number becoming incanaci tated, the rest would have to remain there, perhaps, for days, doing nothing. expensive staff, in addition, would also be kept in waiting there. member for Melbourne Ports seems to think that the only languishing industries which exist are to be found in ""Victoria.",19,Adjournment Formal Tariff Commission

They had an opportunity to bring before the public gaze the private peculiarities of the members of the Commission, and they refrained from doing so; but the Chairman did not pay to them the respect which was due to them.. If he had been a free-trader, instead of a protectionist, he would have received very different treatment from the Melbourne Age.

105,Mr Deakin (Ballarat,"Minister o flearned member for Illawarra, which apply particularly to the members of the Tariff Commission. Members of Parliament who undertake the highly responsible, very arduous, and, as in this case, prolonged obligations attaching to service on Royal Commissions, do so without fee, reward, or other pecuniary recognition. act in the public interest at the sacrifice of their leisure, and often at the loss of business opportunities. Special recognition is due to the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, who has already sacrificed almost a year's professional income in the discharge of the duty devolved upon him as Chairman. Neither he, nor the other Commissioners who are members of Parliament, receive any pecuniary recognition of their services, while the travelling expenses paid to them are, in any case, quite inadequate. velling expenses when the Commission is sitting in the State in which they reside. to another State, the travelling allowance is not sufficient to recompense them for the loss of other remuneration. Consequently their service is a g if t to the public, and as they devote their time, knowledge, and ability to the country without reward, the least we can do is to recognise their disinterestedness. There is no more ungratef u l task than to sit on a Royal Commission inquiring into a contentious subject such as the revision of the Tariff is. But although differences must inevitably arise in regard to the conclusions of the Commission, they must not prevent us from fully recognising the services of the Commissioners. While the honourable member for Illawarra is technically correct in the contention that a Royal Commission is not subject to Parliament, every Commission, except as a matter of form and dignity, is more or less the creation of Parliament. It acts for purposes considered by Parliament, and its report can be dealt with effectively only by Parliament. quently, like every other agency within the Commonwealth, it comes properly under the review of Parliament, by whom its actions can be criticised or challenged without reflection upon the Commissioners,, and without any offence on their part. There are one or two precedents in English historyone as recent as 1869-in which what"" was thought to be delay on the part of a Roval Commission has been challenged by the Commons in a proposed address to the Throne. In 1869 the matter was notpressed to a division, the motion being withdrawn on the receipt of satisfactory assurances; but, so far as I remember, no one: at the time questioned the right of Parliament to criticise the methods of the ComThey mission, or the time occupied by it . parliamentary interference was strongly denounced on that occasion. to familiarize myself with the conclusion, arrived at in the Commons, and have not. read the debate, which was short. Thetestimony of the text writers, however, is. that it is unusual for Parliament to interfere with Royal Commissions, not that it is improper, because that would depend on the nature of the interference. We must recognise that, in the present instance, a. certain judicial character attaches I-J the proceedings of the Commission, which we must therefore protect against reflectionswhich might less improperly be cast on nonN o , , and when it moves judicial bodies. AlthoughI was fortunateenough to dissuade the honourable member for Melbourne Ports from asking the House to consider this question at an earlier date, and would rather that he had not felt it his duty to move the adjournment thisafternoon, I cannot challenge either the propriety of the course which he has deemed it necessary to follow, or the manner in which he has performed what he considers to be a duty. I heard no word of reflection cast by him on the' Chairman o r any member of the Commission. All he did was to express anxiety, which is shared by a great many others, in regard to thelength of time which will probably be occupied before the Commission makes its; report. tacks have been made on me. must expect that. Personal attacks are in favour this session. The question raised Conseby the honourable member relates to thetime at which the report of the Commission is likely to be presented, and it is to that subject that most honourable members have addressed themselves. That question may properly be considered by us, because it was very gravely and fullv discussed at the time of the appointment of l h e Commission.

These were agreed to by the then Prime Minister, who, in the course of subsequent remarks, indicated his natural expectation .that reports would be presented during the present session. Honourable members certainly anticipated that probability, and expected that'the Commission would terminate its duties early next year.

It is rarely that we have in this House a f u l l attendance of honourable members, because some are generally absent visiting their constituents, or on other reasonable grounds. To suggest that the absence of two or three more in connection with the inquiry of the Tariff Commission would affect the conduct of business here is to say something which our experience does not justify. Honourable members are in this, as in other matters, answerable to their constituents alone for the time which they give to legislative work, and the public duties which they undertake or leave undone. to refer to Parliament, which constituted the Commission, for instruction. a contrary opinion, although I do not know that the debate can result in what the honourable member desires. however, that he approached the question in an independent spirit, without bias, and swayed by nothing but his duty to the public. It seems to me, however, that in this, as in other matters, every honourable member mjust judge for himself; that those who decline to attend the sittings of the Commission in Tasmania, so that they may discharge their parliamentary duties here, are free to do so, and that those who think that their immediate duty' at any given time is to the Commission should act accordingly. It must also be pointed out that, inasmuch as the Commission is composed of an equal number of representatives of the two fiscal parties, both of which have non-political as well as political representatives, it is not necessary for all its members to be present at every sitting before the deliberative stage is reached. It may reasonably be arranged that a small number of members representing both sides shall collect evidence which can be read and considered by those honourable members The non-political are who think that their legislative duties require that they should be in constant attendance in this House. There need be no loss to the Commission, although some loss may be involved to members of the Commission, and some loss to this House, through the absence of those who are enH e holds a parliagaged taking evidence in other States.

Speaking as a private member, I stated, at the time the Commission was appointed-and other members expressed a similar view-that I looked forward with confidence to such a selection of subjects for inquiry by the Commission as would enable the most urgent cases to be dealt with in the order of their merit. I do not say that that is not being done. I have not followed the work of the Commission closely enough to justify me in expressing an opinion on that point. I am quite prepared to suppose that the Commission have taken that course. WhatI do say, however, is that there was a strong expectation on the part of the public, and I have not indicated among honourable members of this House, that they would take such a course, and that some definite pronouncement would have I Quite recognise, been made in regard to some pressing matters during the present year.",22,Adjournment Formal Tariff Commission

I do not pose as a judge myself, but submit that it ought to be possible for each honourable member to weigh his obligations, and to consult his fellow members with a view to the final closing of an otherwise interminable inquiry before an appeal is made to the country next year. I do not know that I need say anything more. I am obliged to honourable members for having granted me an extension of time, in order to continue my remarks upon a rather novel but very important practical question. that I strongly deprecate the introduction of this subject into Parliament, because I think it is most unfortunate that the labours of a public Commission on such a question as this should be interfered with by par1 liamentary influence. The tone and character of the debate to-day have certainly justified me in the view I held. The Prime Minister says that he tried to discourage the honourable member for Melbourne Ports from bringing this matter up, but the Prime Minister has himself-if I may use the expression-abuse d the occasion more than any other honourable member. After having deprecated the bringing forward of the matter, he made a long speech, covering the whole of the debatable ground we wished to avoid. my duty. Air. REID Of course I know the honourable and' learned member is a martyr to duty on all occasions. I enter upon this debate with the greatest possible reluctance, because I believe that it may impair the usefulness of the labours of the .Commission and the value of its report. I had hoped that this matter might be settled in some other way, without bringing it before the House. But since the Prime Minister has brought it forward in such a comprehensive way, it is necessary for me to make a few remarks. The Prime Minister has stated that four members of the Commission form a quorum, and that only that number need proceed with the inquiry. In this particular case the quorum would be made of three protectionists and one revenue-tarifTist. That would be the result on a Commission in which the representation was intended' to be absolutelv equal, four representing one view. and. four representing the other. If the course nowsuggested is persevered in, instead of equality of representation being secured, three commissioners would represent one They are the best judges in the view, and one would be on the other side. The Prime Minister seems to think that it is a matter of no importance at all that a commissioner should be present when the evidence is taken. As a member of the legal profession, he should not take any such view. He has suggested a very easv -way out of the difficulty which seems to have presented itself to some members of the Commission. He says, "" You can stay -away all the time, because after the evidence has been taken you can carefully peruse it . "" One of the chief servicescommissioners render is by personally attending the meetings of the Commission, and eliciting from the witnesses as much information as possible. That is of the greatest consequence in carrying out the work of the Commission. With reference to the scope of the Commission, a great attempt was made to limit it . But I absolutely resisted it, and the Commission will be guided by the commission -issued to them by the Governor General. That is their code of instructions. They will not take instructions from any Prime Minister or from any member of this House. If they were to listen to honourable members of this Chamber, they would be violating their duty. They have the plan of their operations laid down by the authority iwhich constituted them. That plan consists of an examination into the position of Australian industries, not into industries which may be pushed under their notice by one individual in one part of Australia. They are to view all the in-dustries of Australia comprehensively and nationally. Nobody expected that their labours would be finished in a few months. As honourable members will recollect, my first desire was that no members of Parliament should be appointed to that Commission, or, at all events, that very few should be appointed. But it was found to be so difficult to get persons who were f u l ly qualified and who were not interested in some way in the movements of trade, that ultimately it proved that it would be better for the bulk of the members of the Commission to be members of Parliament. But the serious point with me is that there seems to be something political-som e political influence beneath this attempt to drive the Commission in a certain direction for a definite political purpose.

147,Mr Reid,"I do not know that anya Commissioner who sits at the table, fully intending to act as the minority act, and who abstains from voting so as to bring about a decision which will leave him in Parliament and drive other members of the Legislature away from Melbourne? I understand that the voting was four to three. The majority consisted of the Chairman of the Commission, Senator McGregor, Mr Clarke, the citizen protectionist member of that body, and Mr Wamsley, the free trade member. The fact that Mr Wamsleyi voted with the majority, thus making the number of Commissioners four to go away, instead of four to stay in Melbourne, shows that there was no tinge of free-trade manipulation in connection with that division. Since the Commission has been appointed, the less we have to do with its members the tetter. and it ought to be respected as such, and we should interfere with it as little as posTariff, but with his eyes f u l l y opened, and sible. But there is the extraordinary state of affairs to which I have already alluded -the fact that a member of the Commission who could not go away from this city, actually abstained from performing his duty, in order to force other members of Parliament to be absent from their duties. What was the motive for such conduct? It is highly suggestive of a political design. If there is any/ other motive, it should be mentioned. of. I believe that the opinion of that Commissioner is notorious. He thinks that the Commission ought not to visit the other States during the session. He made no secret the fact that the Tariff Commission was of his opinion to his fellow Commissioners. He believes that its members should stay in Melbourne, and complete the Melbourne portion of their work. We learn now, for the first time, from the debate which took place in the other Chamber, that he actually proposed an amendment to the effect that the Commission should remain in Melbourne, and complete its labours here. Perhaps the Chairman of the Commission mav have heard of that amendment, but none of the other Commissioners did. Four of them absolutely say that they never heard any such proposal made. It is an extraordinary state of things that this very senator who did not vote on the subject-the vital point as to the proceedings of the Commission-no w says that he moved an amendment which would have prevented the Commission from leaving Melbourne if anybody but himself had heard him submit it. The whole incident is a pity, and it suggests a state of things which we view with concern. other matter. The Prime Minister is beginning to speak as if he contemplated another action which will revive painfuL memories. He knows well enough that before the Tariff Commission was appointed, the Treasurer of the day, and myself, as the head of the Government, pointed out unmistakably that whilst anomalies-hardship s of a certain kind-migh t be dealt with by this Parliament, anything; which raised the fiscal question could not be dealt with, if there is any honour or truthfulness in public leaders. The honourable and learned gentleman was Prime Minister on a previous occasion, and he went before the people of Australia, and drew the very picture of industries being destroyed by ' the operation of the Tariff which he draws to-day. He spoke of inI look upon it as a judicial body, dustries which were languishing. He pointed out the evils of this compromise being aware of all these ruinous consequences, he invited the people of Australia to select their representatives on the honourable basis of honest men who would respect their honest public pledge, namely, that the Tariff should not be altered during the life of this] Parliament. There is no expression in that language which the most acute lawyer can juggle out Fortunately, we have in the records of this Parliament every word that I have just uttered.

The honourable member complained that the Chairman had not a casting vote on matters of policy. We know that the report of a Commission is not drawn up until the work of cluded, so that the fact that the Chair» man has not a casting vote does not involve any delay in the presentation of the report of the Commission. The giving of a casting vote to the Chairman of a Commission is simply an attempt to give one man the -power to present a report as being the decision of possibly four men, when it is the decision of only three. It is a mere juggle. The question would probably not have been raised in connection with the appointment of the Tariff Commission but for the absurd position which arose in connection with the report of the Iron Bonus Commission. It will be remembered that that Commission consisted of twelve members, six of whom drew up one report, making certain recommendations, whilst the remaining six framed another. But because one of these "" parties included the Chairman, who had a casting vote, the report which he signed became the report of the whole Commission. "" We , your Commissioners,"" it ran, whereas there was an absolutely equal number in favour of a different report. port, however, was stowed away at the close of the other, as if it were a sort of rider to the verdict of a jury. That arose from the mere juggle of a chairman having two votes instead of one. With that precedent before us, it would have been an absurdity to allow the same state of affairs to arise in connection with another Commission. It was this that led to the Commission being so framed as to provide that the Chairman should not have a casting vote in the matter of the report. That, however, does not affect the present position of the Commission. It is a matter that can only come into play after the evidence has been taken.

I wish to show that the Union between Great Britain and Ireland is an admitted failure I would remind the fraud, and maintained to the discredit and the damage of the people of the Empire. What test have we of this? In the first place, we find that the population of Ireland was in 1800, when the Union was entered into, two-fifths of that of the United Kingdom, and now it is but one-tenth, having been reduced from four-tenths to one-tenth. the Union? it is. The population of Ireland to-day is actually less than it was in 1800, while the population of all the other parts of the United Kingdom has increased. I wish now to show the grounds upon"" which the Union was advocated by that great Minister, William Pitt the younger, and to show that his expectations have been absolutelv falsified. In 1800, when commending this step to the Parliament of England, he said it wasI t is with a. view a measure whose object is to communicate to the sister kingdom the skill, the capital, and the industry which have raised this country to such a pitch of opulence, to give her f u l l participation of the commerce and of the Constitution of England; to unite the affections and resources of two powerful nations, and to place under one public will' .the direction of the whole force of the Empire.

Tiemev expressed a similar view, and Grattan saidThis Union will lead to generations of disloyally and agitation and strife. That is exactly what has occurred. Now, I should like to refer to the mode of government in Ireland at this present day, in order to show that the constitutional liberties and the ordinary common-sense arrangements existing in Great Britain are not to be found in Ireland. It is said that a union exists between Great Britain and Ireland; but there is no union. There is an Act of Union, but it is a union merely in name. There is a separate Executive, a separate establishment, and forty-oneindependent Departments, only one or twoof which are under the control of the LordLieutenant, who is the Executive head of the Administration. The Lord-Lieutenant"" has no real control over the Departments. There is one Legislature, but there are different laws made for each country. Before the Union Irish members made laws for the Irish people, face to face with them. and he may be said to be subordinate to his chief. Now British members make Jaws for the If the Lord-Lieutenant is not in the Cabinet, Irish people, without any responsibility to the them. The making of laws for Ireland has been taken from those who did know, and has been given to those who do not know, administration Ireland's conditions. As the great Poster, forty-one departments; certain of them are, for last Speaker in the House of Commons in obvious and perfectly justifiable reasons, removed Ireland, said You tire creating a separate State, a separate establishment, a separate exchequer, a separate debt, separate courts, and separate laws. The Lord-Lieutenant and the castles still remain, but Ireland has no Parliament. land are represented in the British Parliament. that the great measures which have been passed in the British Parliament during the last century have been confined to Great Britain, and have not been extended, to Ireland. The great parliamentary reform measure of 1832 was passed for the benefit of Great Britain. Ireland was carefully excluded from its benefits. When the Catholic emancipation took place the fortyshilling freeholders were even deprived of their right to vote. During the period from 1829 to 1879 forty-eight Coercion Acts were passed for Ireland alone, and, by a strange coincidence, fifty Land Bills proved they failed to pass. directed solely to the benefit, of Ireland, and they were brought in by Irish members. Lord Dunraven is a Unionist, and still adheres most emphatically to the Union. Notwithstanding that, he has expressed himself in the clearest terms with regard to the evils of the present system of government for Ireland. There was an old saying that England had gone for her policy to hell, and for her methods to 1 Bedlam. I cannot conceive of any civilized country at this period of the world's' history possessing such a ridiculous and unbusiness-Iike system of government. Lord Dunraven, who is one of the most influential men in Ireland, points outIreland is governed by a Lord-Lieutenant General and General-Governor. Lieutenant is assisted by a Privy Council .having functions similar to those of the Privy Council of Great Britain, and exercising the same amount of control. He is also provided with a Chief Secretary. It sometimes happens lhat neither the Lord-Lieutenant nor. the Chief Secretary is in the Cabinet, but, as a rule, if the Lord-Lieutenant Cassandra, for once, prophesied falsely. There is in the Cabinet, the Chief Secretary is not, 0 for Ireland. 569 [3 AUGUST, 1905.] Chief Secretary is, and the chief may be said to be subordinate to his secretary. The appointment of Lord-Lieutenant and of his Chief Secretary is purely political. The of Irish affairs is in the hands of altogether from the sphere of the Irish Government. A very few of them, with one or two small exceptions-onl y those connected with crime -ar e under the control of the Lord-Lieutenant. Over some of them the Irish Government can exercise very limited and partial control. The proceedings of others merely come under the cognizance of the Irish Government, which cannot But the people of Ireexercise any effective control, and over many, including some important departments, the Irish Government possesses no power of control whatever. Imagine a Department without even the control of the Minister responsible to the British House of Parliament. He continues:This system, which I think it will be admitted is, to say the least of it, peculiar, has not even the merit of being cheap ; on the contrary, whether compared with the expenses incidental to government elsewhere, or looked at relatively to the amount of money voted for Irish services, the working expense of running the administrative and executive machine is costly in the extreme. In the expenditure of money devoted to Irish services, and passing through the hands of those forty-one departments, the people of Ireland have fruitless that is to say, no voice. These Bills were Just fancy the huge sums of money which haye been spent free from any control from the point of view of the public. IfI . am not wearying honourable members. I might say that this view of Lord Dunraven has been confirmed by the opinion of Sir West Ridgeway, who was Under-Serretary for Ireland during the most trying period of the land league, when Ireland was very disturbed, and who was abused right and left by the leaders and others. Let us listen to the words of this man of experience, who had to hold the reins during a troublous time. Writing to Lord Dunraven, he said:For this reason, but not for this reason alone, do 1 subscribe to the proposal of your association, for "" the devolution to Ireland of a larger measure of local government than she now possesses,"" The Lordand, unhesitatingly, do I share your belief that the Union will be strengthened, not endangered, by that concession. We all remember the dire predictions which attended Mr Balfour's g if t to Ireland of the limited rights of local government which she now enjoys, and we have lived to realize--wha t I realized at the time-that happily fore, we need not be alarmed or depressed if she",32,Homerule For Ireland

193,Mr Higgins,"I want to point outagain denouncesthe devolution to Ireland of those extended rights of local government which must sooner or later be delegated in other directions if the Imperial Parliament is to be saved from paralysis and impotence. NowI desire to refer to the Reform Association, which is a body composed principally of landlords and men who are interested on the unionist side. We desire to express our strong opinion that if local knowledge were brought to bear upon expenditure, the money could be made to go further, and would be more usefully employed than it is under the present system. The eflect we feel confident would be a great improvement in the mutual relations between Great Britain and Ireland, increased confidence in the Government of the latter country, and amelioration in her economic condition. . . '. The great and increasing difficulty which Parliament finds in dealing with the unwieldy mass of business that comes before it is, we believe, very generally admitted. Under existing circumstances, the special needs of Ireland do not and cannot receive adequate attention. Sufficient relief cannot, Prime Minister for a time, actually savs in our opinion, be afforded by mere amendment in the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. Some delegation of authority is necessary. We believe that power to deal with much of the business relating to Irish affairs which Parliament dominant partner,"" as he styles England is at present unable to cope with, might, with perfect safety and with advantage both to Ireland and Parliament, be delegated to an Irish body to be constituted for the purpose.

Mr Charles James Fox uttered words of the same tenor.

They say :Burke, in speaking of this matter, saidNireluctant tie can be a strong one. Lecky says, in regard to this questionThe Imperial Parliament exercises over Ireland legislative functions, but it is almost powerless upon public opinion. It allays no discontent, and attracts no affection. As I have already said, there is an Act of Union; but there is no true union of the two kingdoms. The very phrase used by Lord Rosebery the other day shows that. A British statesman, who happened to be that a majority of the United Kingdom is not to have its way unless the majority of one part of the Kingdom-the ""pre-declar e for that way. He says that we must find a majority in England before we can say that a measure of -Home-Rule for Ireland should be carried, even if it be The honourable member I say that that is not a union.

I do not know that I can appeal to any statistical authority higher than Sir Robert Giffena man whose motives cannot be impugned, and whose skill is proverbiala man who is -himself a Unionist. Ireland there are 3,000,000 people living by agriculture, and that their average income is £ 1 3 or £ 1 4 annually. family of five, that would represent about £ 6 5 a year. He further points out that, when the Union with Great Britain was effected, Ireland had a debt of ,£24,000,000, but that between 1800 and 1815 it was raised to £128,000.000-that is to say, in the proportion of more than five to one. money applied? to the Napoleonic wars between'' 1800 and 1815. in the interval, the debt of England increased very considerably, but not nearly so much. A t the time the Union was consummated, England had a £420,000,000, but, in 1815, this amount had increased to £680,000,000. That is to say that, whereas Ireland had increased her debt in the proportion of five to one, England had increased hers in the proportion of three to two. Then, in r8i7 , when the Irish debt had been so increased, the two debts were merged. tion were the debts allocated after the United Kingdom upon the Civil Service is Napoleonic wars? merged-that is to say, England took Iretenth of the population, and one-fiftieth of land's debt, and Ireland took England's. that time.

That the increase of taxation laid upon Ireland between 1853 and i860 was not justified by Ireland the then existing circumstances. That identity of rates of taxation do not necessarily involve equality of burden. That while the actual tax revenue of Ireland about one-eleventh of that of Great Britain, the relative taxable capacity of Ireland is very much smaller, and is not estimated by any of us I have just said so. as exceeding one-twentieth. The average taxation per head, according to the Commission, creased to £ 2 5s. 6d. per head.

For fifteen years before the Union Ireland spent £41,000,000 , but for the fifteen wars after the Union she expended £148,000,000 . As the result of the Union her expenditure increased to that extent. Somewhere about the fifties Sir Robert Peel and Mr Gladstone equalized the taxes. differences in the scale of taxation operating in the two countries. But equalizing the taxes in amount does not mean making them equal in incidence. people of India, for instance, were taxed at the same rate as all the people of Great Britain, an injustice would be done tb the former, because they are much poorer than are the people of England. In the same way it is unfair to tax the people of Ireland at the same rate as the wealthier people of England. In the fifties taxation in Ireland was increased by 52 per cent., while in England it was increased by only 17 per cent., this being the result, partly of the Crimean war. The fiscal system was built up so as to make the taxation f a l l upon Ireland with much greater severity than upon Great Britain. the object. was. fiscal system had that effect. impute motives in these matters. that members of Parliament are very apt to country in the civilized world which has look at their own constituencies and to such a low crime record as Ireland has the interests of those constituencies.

The tary police force consisting of 18,000 men, Although at the time of the members of that House legislate with a view to the interests of England, and do not sufficiently consider those of the weaker country. Ireland has been subjected to the burdens of English wars, but has not received the benefit of the war expenditure. Until lately she had no naval dockyards, while England had nine. In 1843 the naval expenditure of Great Britain amounted to £ 6 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and of that sum only £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 went to Ireland. fine dockyards in Belfast. I may point sent time, but they are not naval dockyards. able and learned member's argument, every constituency should have its own dockyard and a share in the naval expenditure. to make. The boast at the time of the Union, that the same laws would be given to Ireland as to England, as the result of the two countries being under the one Legislature, was a false one. The laws and the Up to that time there had been liberties of the people in the two countries are not the same. In the address to King George III . , to which I have already referred, it was stated that If the Ireland was to be governed by the same laws as Great Britain. As a matter of fact, however, right through the last century two differing lines of legislation have been applied to the two countries. We have had Coercion Acts and Land Bills for Ireland-the Land Bills generally f a i l ing to become law-and a series of Acts for England that have no relation to the other country. Nearly every year a Coercion Act was passed, until in 1.887 fhe Coercion Act was made perpetual. The position of affairs an Ireland is that the people there have no right of public meeting; they do not enjoy the right of personal freedom from arrest; public meetings may be broken up.

228,Mr Higgins,"That is a weak replyarmed with rifles, andl required to undergo drill instruction. Another point is thattrial by jury does not prevail in Ireland. The system in operation is that of trial by two magistrates, who are removable at the will of the Chief Secretary. In many cases a man is imprisoned without any trial taking place. One man may actually cause another to be imprisoned upon suspicion. Under an Act of Edward III . , passed in 1361-a n Act which is obsolete in Great Britain-a n information may be laid against a man on the ground that he is in danger of breaking the peace. Upon the swearing of this information, the man can be brought before a magistrate, who, without any trial, may require him to enter into a bond that he will not break the peace; failing which he must go to gaol as a rogue and a vagabond. This law, while operatingin Ireland, is not applied to England, is treated as obsolete. There is no constitutional government of Ireland, because its administration is really conducted in defiance of the wishes of four-fifths of its representatives. imagine what would be the position if Australia returned four-fifths of its representatives pledged 'to some definite policy of administration, only to be confronted by a Ministry which defied that policy? The Imperial Executive is responsible, not to Irish, but to English opinion. That does not mean equal liberty. MavI read what Mr Chamberlain said twenty years ago upon this questionI do not believe that the great majority of is now destroyed. Grattan prophesied that Englishmen have the slightest conception of the Irish manufactures and commerce would system under which this free nation attempts to rule the sister country. It is a system which wither with Irish liberties, and so they is founded on the bayonets of 30,000 soldiers enhave. On the other hand, it was said that camped permanently as in a hostile country. It is commerce and industry would follow capia system as completely centralized and bureautal to Ireland; but in place of that, such cratic as that with which' Russia governs Poland, or that which prevailed in Venice under Auscommerce and industry as Ireland had trian rule.

Even to this day the people of parochial, municipal, or educational work, withIreland are getting poorer as well as fewer. out being confronted with, interfered with, controlled by an English official, appointed by a A tax of i d . in the £ 1 produced ten years foreign Government. Then what did Disraeli say ? He said of Ireland has sunk from two-fifths of that thisNeither liberty of the press nor liberty of the from four-tenths to one-tenth, and its gross person exists in Ireland. . . . I go as far as possible into the opposing that of Great Britain to one-seventeenth; camp for testimonyIt is a fact that at any time in Ireland the clining from one-tenth to one-fiftieth of those police may enter into your house, examine your of Great Britain. In 1800 the taxation of papers to see .whether there is any resemblance Ireland was about £2,000,000; in 1825 between the writing and that of some anonymous it was £6,000,000; in 1850, £9,000,000; letter that has been sent to a third person. Mr Higgins. Ireland, if a man writes an article in a newspaper and it offends the Government, he has a warning; and if he repeat the offence, his paper may be suppressed. That statement was made by Disraeli in 1874. At that time, according to him, Ireland has neither liberty of the press nor liberty of the person; yet upon the consummation of the Union she was to enjoy the same liberties as the rest of the United Kingdom. Another point to be remembered is that Judges take part in politics in Ireland. Many of them are members of the Irish Privy Council, which administers the affairs of the country. When on circuit, they sometimes charge a jury with opinions upon politics. There have been repeated cases in which coroners' juries have brought in verdicts of "" guilty of wilful murder"" against policemen for firing unnecessarily and killing people in the streets. For instance, after the Mitchelstown massacre there was a coroner's verdict of wilful murder. Whatever the Chief Secretary of the day might have Can any one thought, one would say that he ought at least to have ordered a trial, after such a verdict; but there was no trial. The Crown did not prosecute. What can be thought of constitutional liberties or constitutional government under those conditions? Now take some other test. What has become of Ireland's manufactures? At the time of the union she had a thriving cotton manufacture, which employed about 30,000 hands, and in which .£600,000 or £700.000 were invested. That industry ago £93,000; and to-day will produce only £85,000.

It is a matter which has been in oDntroversy for a long time. The Governments at Home, who have practically controlled the administration of British affairs during the past twenty years, have not been able to go so far as the Home Rulers desire, although many Acts, I am glad to say, have been introduced for improving and ameliorating the condition of the Irish people. I believe, too, that many good results have flowed from that legislation. think that we are as competent to judge of the merits of this great question as is the Parliament of the old country, who have been dealing with it for so many years. I have no feeling at all in the matter; if I have any general feeling at all, it is in the with the economic and social conditions of direction of allowing people to manage their own affairs in their own way, subject to the law and the Constitution.

We are not the electors of Great Britain. The electors of Great Britain and Ireland are surely well I think the honourable and able to deal with this question. I therefore resent the action of the honourable and learned member in desiring that I should express an opinion upon it, in the same way that I should resent a similar resolution in regard to our internal affairs emanating from the Imperial Parliament.

I am sorry that I cannot endorse the whole of the statements contained in the motion.

But I have sufficient confidence in him to know that he would not have put upon the business-paper a resolution agreeing strongly with the attempts to settle the land question, unless he had thoroughly understood it , and if it is satisfactory to him, I think that it will, in most respects, be satisfactory to me. Since the Union between Great Britain and Ireland, 1,000.000 of the Irish people have died through 'famine, 500,000 have been evicted, and three-quartets of the population of Ireland have disappeared. When these facts are placed in a nutshell before the Australian people who are happy in their own system of Home Rule, they must prove an eye-opener to them.

The Treasurer and the honourable and learned member for Parkes have declared that the question of Home Rule is not a part of our business. Is it not strange that we are only told to mind our own business now that a certain proposal does not meet with the acceptance of the Imperial Parliament? I would remind those honourable members that, not long since, we thought we were minding our own business when we supported the British Government in the Soudan, and a little later we imagined that we were attending to our own business, a'nd were interested in the permanence and prosperity of the Empire when we despatched troops to South Africa.

The question of Home Rule for Ireland is one that lies close to the hearts of a very large proportion of our people, affecting them at every turn of their lives, and forming the subject of many letterswhich they write to their friends in the land from which they come. Surely it is one with which we ought to deal. It is clearly a question on which we may express our opinion, for it is one that indirectly affects at least one-fourth of our own people. It is certainly undesirable that a very large proportion of our fellowcountrymen should feel that those who live in ^the land from which they come are being, unjustly treated.

At the same time, I had tried to prevent purchasers from being misled into buying goods to which the union trade mark was wrongly applied. bestowed some time in explaining the application of proposed new clause 77, which I had had circulated with other proposed amendments. That clause is divided into two parts, the first of which gives absolute authority to the employer to apply the union trade mark to goods which are the manufacture exclusively of members of a union, and I apprehend that it is to such goods that, in the vast bulk of cases, the union trade mark would be applied. second part provides that where goods are not wholly the manufacture of unions, authority to place the union trade mark on them may be given by a union. I said, and still say, that I think that that authority would not be misused. This morning I have endeavoured to effectuate more completeley the principles which I laid down, and I have framed another clause, copies of which will presently be distributed amongst honourable members, which I propose to substitute for clause 77 in the amendments already laid on the table. This new clause will entirely get rid of the need to obtain, under any circumstances whatever, authority from a union to use a union trade mark. It provides, as the former proposed new clause did, that the union trade mark may be applied by an employer or by a member of a union by direction of the union. If the goods are exclusively the manufacture, workmanship, or product of the labour of members of a union, the employer may apply the union trade mark without more ado. He may also apply it lo goods which are in part, but not exclusively, the manufacture, workmanship, or product of the labour of members of a union, but he must apply it in such a way as to clearly indicate that the mark does not refer to that part of the goods which is not of union manufacture. this wav, all parties will be protected. think that the common law in respect to boycotting will apply in this case? different question. The provision to which I refer sufficiently protects the manufacturer. He is not required, under any circumstances, to ask the union for permission to apply its trade mark.' The union cannot prevent him from applying it if the goods are made wholly by union labour. But, in applying it, he must deal 'fairl y with the public, and must not lead them to believe, when goods have not been manufactured I wholly by union labour, that it applies to the whole of the goods, when it has application to only a part. able?

However, these matters may be thoroughly thrashed out in Committee. WhatI wish to point out now 'is that the unions will get no advantage which employers will not get. Whatever they can claim, the employers can claim. If a .difficulty arises about boots manufactured in the way described affecting the employer, it will affect also the unions. It seems to me that the clause meets the objection that the unions may use the Bill to oppress employers. The difficulty pointed to by the right honourable member for Balaclava is inherent in the application of union trade marks, and has nothing whatever to do with the power of a union to unfairly attempt to prevent In employers from using them. The clause applies as much where goods are exclusively the product of the labour of unionists as where they are not. It is almost impossible that all goods can be exclusively the product of union labour, if the manufacture of the raw material is taken into consideration, because one cannot say/.how",46,Honourable Members Hear Hear

If wood is imported, partly planed and sawn, and made available for working, surely a vehicle made from it here by union labour would be union-made, notwithstanding that non-union labour may have been employed on the wood before it was imported from abroad. made unless the wood had been cut by union men with union axes and handles, in forests thinned by union labour. sufficiently indicated the difference between my proposed new clause 77 and that which I originally proposed. short, does away absolutely with any necessity for any authority whatever from a union. It has the further advantage of giving protection, even in other cases where that authority is so given as to unintentionally mislead the public, who might think that part of an article so branded was made by union labour when it was not. This, therefore, hits the advantage, it seems to me, on the best consideration I can give to the matter, of protecting the unions, the employers, and the public. additional observations of the honourable and learned gentleman in charge of this B ill, instead of throwing more light on the subject, show that every attempt he makes to carry out what he desires involves him in but greater confusion. I wish to say at once, that so far as the general provisions of this Bill are concerned, they may well be dealt with in Committee, because the object of a Bill of this kind is one which I think commands universal assent. But one of the parts of this Bill is unprecedented in the history of legislation in any Trade Marks Act that has ever been passed in any part of the British Empire. I do not say that that fact disposes of the whole question, but I do say that it places a very grave onus upon those who propose to introduce into a measure of this kind, provisions such as I have alluded to. In the first place, we should be bound, I think, by the terms of the Federal Constitution under which' we legislate, and the power given to legislate with reference to trade maTks is of a strictly limited character. Acts."" I have here Quick and Garrairs excellent work on the Constitution, and at page 598 the effect of descriptions in cases in England of the expression ""trade mark"" is given in a very succinct wayA trade mark is some name, symbol, or device consisting in general of a picture, label, word or words, which is applied or attached to a trader's goods, so as to distinguish them from the similar goods of other traders, and to identify them as his goods in the business in which they are produced or put forward for sale. The object of a Trade Marks Bill is to enable the public, when buying a certain article, to know the manufacturer who produced that article and put it on the market. In the course of time, these marks acquire a distinct commercial value. The make of a certain manufacturer becomes popular, owing to its quality, cheapness, or other consideration, and it becomes then the inThis clause, in terest of the trader to label his product so that the public will know when they are buying it, and any infringement of his mark is properly made a subject of legal redress. Any attempt on the part of a manufacturer to turn out his goods in such a manner as to resemble the goods, or label, or description of those of another, is properly looked upon as an unfair thing, causing loss and damage to the persons whose goods are imitated. This provision for a trades union label is absolutely foreign to the scope and nature of a Trade Marks Bill. It has never been in such a measure in any part of the world.

However, that does not affect the: argument I am about to state, because, so far as we are concerned, we have to act upon a power given to us by a written Federal Constitution, and it is a most serious question, to my mind, whether, in the power given by this Constitution to pass a law relating to trade marks, there is any power given to put into such a law a provision of this sort, which is intended for a purpose absolutely foreign to the object and policy of a trade marks statute, and has no natural connection with it at all. a statute to insert a provision that all aiticles made in a teetotaller's factory, run on temperance principles, should have some label to show that they were turned oiit of a temperance factory, or that articles should be labelled to show that they were turned out of a factory in which all the workers professed some particular form of religious belief. would be just as germane to the object of a Trades Marks Act to include a provision that a temperance factory should have a temperance label, a Methodist factory a Methodist label, or a Presbyterian factory a Presbyterian label. would be just as legitimate in connection with a general measure relating to trade marks as is the provision inserted in this B ill .

If it were a proper thing to be in such a B ill , that private member of the Senate was more diligent, and more able, and more successful than were the members of the Government.

It is a mark which belongs to the man who offers the goods for sale, and not to the man who manufactures the goods. For instance, in the manufacture of one article of trade, there mav be six, or, at any rate, three or four, different unions involved. manufacture of a simple bar of iron, for instance, there is the miner, the smelter, and the ironmoulder; and there are other articles in the production of which a still larger number of unions are concerned. But a Trade Marks Act is not intended to advertise all the different unions, or the men belonging to the unions who make the article. If a union made the article, the union might deal with it as any other manufacturer could; there is nothing to prevent unions entering into industries and manufacturing businesses, and having trade marks. But the unions wish to get behind a thing which belongs to another man with the object of advertising themselves. the man who makes the article has a right to have a label to advertise that he is a member of a certain bodv. surely the man who is connected with the mine from which the raw material comes is entitled also to use a label in order to let that fact be known. The honourable member sees that it is not the union qua the Trade Marks [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bilh union by whom the article is made; the article is made by individual workers, who are employed in a business concern, and who happen to belong to an outside union.

There is now in clause 77A a provision under which the application of the union trade mark lo goods shall be deemed to be unauthorized unless it is applied to goods which are exclusively the product of the labour of members of the union, and under paragraph b it can be applied to goods which are in part, but not ""exclusively,"" the manufacture or workmanship or product of the labour of members of a union. So that the Attorney General has seen the force of the word "" exclusively,"" and the hardship which it might work, and he now proposes to supply a loophole for cases such as those to which I have referred. 77B expressly stated that the union might authorize the application of the label to goods not exclusively made by unionists. Paragraph a dealt with goods which were ""exclusively"" the product of the labour of members of the union, and paragraph b dealt with those which were not exclusively the product of such persons. the Bill which was laid upon the table yesterday I find that under 77BThe application of the union trade mark to goods shall be deemed to be unauthorized unless(a) it is applied to goods which are the manufacture or workmanship or the product of the labour of members of the union exclusively, &c.

It is believed that if a union label is put upon articles of commerce a preference will be shown to a particular manufacture of a particular man.. It is the seller to whom I am alludingthe man who sells goods bearing the label. That enables trade unions to put compulsion upon every factory-owner who empTovs a non-union worker-to say to him, "" If you do not discharge that man, you do not get our label.""

I do not know why. As I have said before, if I were a man working in one of these trades, it is ten to one that I should be in a gard as degrading, undignified, and imunion. I do not understand why some of these men object to join a union, but it is not for them to satisfy me whether the objections are right or wrong; it is not for them to go before any trade union and satisfy the union whether they are right or wrong.

It will be remembered that a desperate effort was made to embodv in that measure a provision that an Arbitration Court should be made a labour registry for the great unions, with the legal necessity of denying men work if they applied at the same time as unionists belonging to the same trade. The Court was to tell them to go and starve, to say to them, ""You do not belong to the union-joi n the union or starve."" That was the democratic legislation that the Labour Government wished to force I suppose it is possible for upon us at the point of the bayonet, but in spite of their power and that of their allies, we defeated them. _ One would think that the allies of the Labour Party, working with them so closely as they do, would have the manliness to adopt the same course that the labour members take.

These men are now doing the work of the Labour Leagues, which we withstood when they made an assault on the legal rights of industrialists.

We have seen the wealthier and privileged classes trampI say ""Work your ling down those below them in days gone past. Through the wrongs, which the mass of humanity suffered from those above them, we have evolved democracy, and it is one of the saddest features of this democracy that the moment it achieves power and equality of conditions the men who should be the greatest champions of the equal rights of the workers use all their power, and it is now a terrible power in this House, to drive out of employment the men who are not unionists, because they The effect of this provision will not take the pledge.

I know that this is so. because 1 was there at the time. matters of legislation, the fact that a cerI s that what the honourable tain system began thirty years ago is not proof of a venerable antiquity. This system had its beginning in the United States, in circumstances very different from those I which prevail here. There was at the time a large number of Chinese in San Francisco, who were supposed to be infected with leprosy, and there was a strong desire on the part of the people not to buy, any article made, in these circumstances, in Chinese settlements. It was advanced, as a reason why a step of this kind should be taken, that it would enable the people to avoid things made under such loathsome conditions. But that is not the case in Australia. Here it is a case not of fighting the Chinese, but of fighting our own fellow-countrymen who do not happen to be unionists. The system has been used in America, as honourable members will find, in a most tyrannical and No , but it is one of the violent way. I wish to deal with the matter, however, not upon these extreme grounds, but simply as if the label were used in a business-like way. Clearly the object of this clause is to enable unions to make it worth the while of manufacturers I cannot understand the to employ only union labour. I think that is a fair way to state the case, because under this B ill , even as the Government propose to amend it, manufacturers will not be able to use the union label, unless they employ only union labour. Let us take the amendment' which has just been put upon the table, and a case hi which the employer may himself put the union label on his goods, because he is complying with these provisions.

But I wish to point out that the Government proposal will not meet the whole of the evil. Let us suppose that this is done. How easy it would be for a trade union to advertise in the very oase where a manufacturer had put the union label on his goods,' and had employed union labour in their manufacture, that he was using their label without their authority. That would be a perfectly correct statement to make. No one could impugn the action of the trade union in making such a statement. manufacturer might, as a matter of fact, reply, "" It is true that the union would not allow me to use their label, but I used it because I was entitled to do so by law."" The advertisement published by the union, however, would do injury to the manufacturer. list of manufacturers who used their labels without their authority, nearly as much mischief would be done amongst the class upon whom the use of the union label is supposed to have an effect, as in any other case. It will thus be seen that the unions would be left in this position : that they could say to the very man who was obeying the union rules, "" If you use the union label without our consent, we shall advertise that fact."" But the serious point is this: The Attorney General will not pretend that in the new amendment, which he has circulated, he has cured the evil to which I refer. member will admit that there is nothing that he has put in the proposed new clause which would enable a manufacturer, who had IOO men, ten or twenty of whom were non-unionists, engaged in the manufacture of an article, to put the union label on goods so produced. label if the goods were made by union labour. their manufacture, it would not be true to put upon them a statement that they] had been made only by union labour. ask. the right to use the union label in such circumstances?

Play the judge. orable and learned member must not address the honourable member directly. your impatience in listening to this very wearisome debate. I simply wish the Attorney-General to allow me to answer his question. I only wanted the admission he The has made. He now fairly admits that if a manufacturer employed 100 men in a factory, ninety of whom were unionists, and ten non-unionists, the union label could not in such a case be honestly placed on the goods made by him. I do not admit the right honourable member's contention. If a manufacturer employed ninety non-unionists in making certain goods, and 150 unionists in making other goods, the union label could be placed on the articles made by the unionists. am speaking of J 00 men engaged in the manufacture of the same article. Out of 10,000 bars of soap made in a factory, one would not separate the number of bars made by ten non-unionists as compared with the number made by ninety unionists.

The Bill will work iniquitous results upon the workers in our Australian industries. view, Parliament, in dealing with men in the vital respect of their daily bread, their an alternative given to the non-unionists. daily opportunities of avoiding starvation, misery, and pauperism, has no right to mould its laws so as to make the avenues of employment easy for those who wear a certain badge and hard for those who will not. It cuts across the very grain of every principle of democracy, and of every feeling of humanity to do so. Fight your union battles as much as you will. long as they are within the legitimate sphere no one can object to them. .The unionists of Australia have as great a right to combine to endeavour to get better conditions for their labour and themselves as wealthy financiers have to combine to get better conditions for 'their money. But I treat them as I treat the others, and I say that if it is endeavoured to pass a law which will interfere with the right of any honest worker in Australia to earn a living-although you may make the attempt in. the interest of the unions-it is wrong. Even if you were to do it in the interest of religion, it would be wrong, and an abuse of the rights of legislation in a democratic community. about democracy ?

We are using politics and Acts of Parliament to dragoon men into our political leagues at the risk of losing their livelihood and losing their right to work."" party in Australia yet has ever mixed up a man's opportunity of earning his daily bread with his political convictions. There has never yet been that odious, sinister, -degrading, inhumane line drawn between men in the great public controversies of Australia. This is the introduction of a sinister line of legislation. It is using the power of the democracy, in a Parliament which was intended to pass equal laws, to pass a law which makes the necessity of joining a political organization part of the conditions upon which a man can earn his daily bread. I say that is a degrading attempt, and it is contrary to all the rules on which legislation should proceed. a vast politicalI will not say conspiracy, because it is open and above-board above-board movement, with which the honourable and learned gentleman is not connected. He thinks too much of himself, -evidently, for that, in some way or other. and learned gentleman cannot be got to say why he does not belong to it. sive if he. did. But I should like to point cut: that one of the other serious evils which such a law as this will introduce is that, while under the average trade marks law the question is one of cheapness and merit in an article, and under the ordinary trade marks system a man secures popularity because his article is good and -cheap, under this system of union labels the basis of value will be vitiated, and a man may make the quality what tie pleases, so long as he has got the union tag on his goods. A large number of people, especially among the working classes, are expected to go into a shop and be perfectly satisfied with an article' of commerce, so long as it has the orthodox tag on. It will be enough, it is expected, if it has the trade union brand, to show that the article is of the first quality. In the ordinary operations of commerce these marks are used for various purposes. buy in the cheapest market, wherever they can find it . as a rule able to indulge in the luxury of paying more than they need. ronize things which are sold at a somewhat No other higher rate than others can afford to pay. But my feeling always has been that the working classes of the country have no margin enabling them to throw money away. They have to exercise the strictest economy in all their purchases to keep their families going at all. I say that it should never be a mark of reproach in a poor household that its members have to study cheapness. The reproach I often make is that there are people in Australia with large incomes who exercise in regard to Australian products a niggardly t h r if t i ness. I believe in men of means encouraging our Australian workers and industries It is part of by not looking a shilling in the face, but by paying more and more and more for an article of colonial manufacture than they It is an alliance. would pay for an imported article. ButN o , it is an open and tbe great mass of the people, however patriotic they are, and however willing they would be to do that, cannot afford to do it, and it would be a cruel thing to expect them to do it. No man with any consideration would expect them to do it. But the only object of a trade mark has been to ind'cate the merit and quality of an article. As for our sanitarv methods, to which the Attorney-General referred, there are Factories Acts, which apply to non-union factories in the same way as to union factories. There is no distinction in the Factories Acts which would make a union factory more sanitary than a non-union factory. In connection with the warres boards in Victoria, there is no distinction made between non-union men and unionists that I am aware of.",61,Honourable Members Hear Hear

I believe that they should operate equally all round, and I understand that the wages boards in Victoria act in that way. Whether a man is a unionist or a non-unionist, he gets the benefit of the wages boards' decisions. But one of the worse features of some of these Arbitration Acts, the New South Wales Act, for instance, is that the attempt is made to put one man on a superior footing to another in the same line of industry. If a man can earn that by his own energy, well and good, he is then as much entitled to it as is a merchant to the big profit he may earn on a bale of goods. But when an attempt is made to make use of a law intended for the protection of every one, and to be administered equally in the interests of a l l ; when an attempt is made to twist the laws of the land to serve not class purposes merely, but the selfish trade interests of a part of a class, then, I think, we have reached a point in Federal legislation that should awaken the concern of every man who desires to see this mighty democratic engine work fairlv and equitably to all members of the community. I make no excuse for the time. I have taken in dealing with this matter. our views are, it will be admitted that there is here: proposed a new departure in a matter of serious importance, and I must express my great concern that a question of this sort should be dealt with in a House constituted as this House is at present. Honourable members may perhaps allow me to express my opinion, that no House is on a healthy basis when those who are responsible for bringing in large Government measures do not possess the confidence of a majority of the representatives of the people. There is no sort of alliance that can make the present condition of things in dealing with these large affairs a healthy one. described that than the present Prime Minister of the country.

I am glad to say that the moment I saw the veryfrail majority I had thoroughly imperilled, by the defection of the leader of a largenumber of honourable members on my side, the only censure I incurred was that of overhaste in getting out of such, a dangerous and ignominious position. My honourable friends opposite may laugh. They aire entitled to laugh. They are in the happy position of the man in the cart with the whip in his hand. They enjoy thehrxury of driving, the animals all day and' all night long. I am talking now of the unfortunate animals in the shafts. My honourable friends have reason to laugh.

What, during his public career, has ne done to remove those obstacles, and to make the path easier ? Nothing! Not one step has he ever taken towards assisting in that direction. AndI say, further, that after all his declarations of sympathy with trade unions, I do not remember any instance where the right honourable member has gone out of his way to help them, in a political sense. He 'has treated us in the House to-night, as he has done on previous occasions-for instance, in regard to the Arbitration mea-sure-to most heartrending pictures of the -misery that is going to overtake the non-unionists if these conditions are to be allowed to become law. I can only say t h is : ThatI think that members of ihe party to which I belong have shown some regard for the interests of non-unionists -in the past. We have done so as a body. I do not know that any member of this party has ever done other than what the majority has done, and that is on all occa-sions to advocate that wherever a trade union exists, it is' ignoring the object of its very being, unless its doors are'freely thrown open to every worker in the community, that he may have the chance to participate in any benefits and privileges which the -members of a union may secure. That has been the basis upon which I have always advocated that trade unions should be managed; and upon no other basis can they be justified in the eye of God or man. a union if he does not see fit? right honourable member knows well that in the present condition of industrial organization-in the present condition of societya man is not master of his own I do actions so far as competition for employment is concerned; that unless he is prepared to take advantage of the strength which' he can obtain by association with his fellow-workmen, the very term ""liberty"" is nothing but a misnomer. I did not make it so; I tried be allowed to be the best judge of that? "" greatest good to the greatest number,"" and that is why the community has assented to laws that allow even the honourable member to be here. I wish to referto thecriticisms of the right honourable member, and perhaps I should first take that wherein he taunted the Government of which I was the head with not having introduced a proposal of this character in its Trade MarksB ill . I may say at once that personally-owin g to the fact that in Western Australia some unions have already registered trade marks under the existing law, and that in England for many years past, trade union labels have been in useI took it for granted that as our laws were founded upon those of Great Britain, or were practically the ""same in many respects, there was no necessity for us to include provisions to give trade unions the right to register their labels. Therefore, I admit that I did not go into the question fully. I look it for granted that what had been done with apparent legal sanction in England and in Western Australia, was also practicable in every State of the Commonwealth. But we were assured by our legal friends that that was not so-that is, that though it is a fact that trade union labels have existed in Englandf o r some twelve years at least, the case Ras never been tested whether the registration is a proper one or not, and further that in Western Australia there has been no test of the. legality of the registration-and when I learnt that, I saw that the point was open to argument as to what was the definition or construction of the existing law.

I say, sir, that the speech of the right honourable member to-night was put forward with the object of convincing the public that the Labour Party and the present Ministry are associated and legislating for the benefit of a section. taunt back in the teeth of the right honourable member, and those associated withhiim, and to say that those who are working for sectional and class legislation are the right honourable member and his friends. They desire to confine the use of the protection that the State is prepared to give to a man's label or trade mark, to one section of the community, and one section only. Any employer-an y person with capital who is trading is to be allowed, according to the ideas of the ,right honourable imember, to have all the protection that the State can afford in the single and the proper use of a particular trade mark. gree of protection is not under any conditions to be extended to associations of workers. Any one, so long as he is not a workman, may come along and claim that the State should step in and punish a person who infringes his trade mark or label. trade mark in the same way as any other person. gentleman knows that wo-kmem are not usually engagedin the selling of goods; therefore he knows f u l l well that the permisthat in that country the use of labels has sion which he is gracious enough to extend to them cannot be taken advantage of. Anv person can use a trade mark. To-day a trade union can use a trade mark. They can use as many labels as they like, and no one can stop them so long as they do not infringe the registered trade mark or label of any person. But the object of this trade marks legislation, as I understand it, is that where a man has invented an exclusive term or sign by which he will mark or indicate the goods of his workmanship as a guarantee to the public, the State steps in and assures him of protection ami the uninterrupted enjoyment of that trade mark. But honourable members on the other side sav that the workman is not to have any legal protection. They cannot denv him the right to put a label upon a cigar which he makes, or to arrange with his employer to put a union trade mark on a suit of clothes, or a hat, or a pair of boots; but as soon as he asks the State for the same degree of protection that is extended to his employer he is committing a sin, and, according to the dictum of honourable members opposite, he is asking for something which is of a class character, and in regard to which he has no right to come before the State as a suppliant. I cannot admit the justice of the claim set up by honourable members opposite. It is said that trade unions may use this power if it is granted to them. that they may prevent the use of a label ? jection, it does seem to me, in the first place, that any attempt to limit the right of a trade union, once a label has been registered, is to treat that union differently from the way in which the Bil l proposes to treat employers. As a matter of practice, I do not object to the clauses which the Attorney-General has brought down, and which, in my opinion, sufficiently protect But the same dethe man who does employ union labour, but against whom a particular union may have a grudge. I do not object to the protection of a fair employer by means of these clauses. From the stand-point of equity, of treating all classes in the community alike, whether employers or emA workman can take out a ploves, there should be no greater restriction put on a trade union than is put, for instance, on a tobacco combine, in regard to their use of a label. What is the case at the present time? We are told by those who quote American experience been abused. I am prepared to admit that trade unions, like every other associationof individuals, are only'human. and therefore quite as liable to abuse powers which are too great as are employers. great ? There is always the possibility of abuse by any set of individuals; but because there is that possibility we do not sit down and do nothing. We surround a proposal with as many safeguards as possible; but, beyond that, we do not fro. What is the position in America? There the. whole conception of trade unionism is different from that which obtains in Australia, or other part of the British Empire.

Just as the legislative machine of the Americans differs from ours, so their trade unions differ from ours; and they use methods, which I am happy to say no trade union in Australia has ever been guilty of using, so far as any of us have been able to ascertain. their masters. run the legislative machine. In Australia we working men have shown that we do not rely exclusively upon the trade union weapon for bringing about fair conditions. We are prepared to enter the legislative arena, and attempt by argument to convince the people that there is a necessity for an alteration to be made, so far as it can be effected by an Act of Parliament. America, on the contrary, the trade unions rely solely on the weapons of the strike, and the boycott. These weapons are used sometimes fairly, but often unfairly, as far as I have been able to read, and certainly in some cases without sufficient cause, so far as those who are responsible for the control of trade unions are concerned. into a boycott, too? point later. Let me keep to the question of how far we are entitled to differentiate in treatment between employers and employees. Take the case of a trade mark issued to an employer. Do not honourable members know that the use of trade marks is absolutely abused by. private individuals, so far as the public welfare is concerned? Are they ignorant of the fact that the tobacco combine, for instance, has said that they will not sell one brand of cigars bearing a registered trade mark to any person who is desirous of retailing it under a certain price? Is it not a fact that honourable members well know that in every part of the Commonwealth there are traders who sell certain brands of commodities to one individual only in a certain locality, and will supplv them to no one else? That is an abuse, so far as the public interests are concerned. It is an abuse of the licence which the community has issued to those traders, and in a measure it is in restraint of trade; but from those honourable members who are affectedly solicitous about fair play all round, there is no protest against issuing to such employers trade marks, and the exclusive use of certain signs and methods or indications of their particular [22] manufacture. There is ho cry that we should put safeguards round the trade marks which are issued to such employers. All their indignation is centred round a proposal to enable trade unions to identify the work of their members, so that that section of the public who desire to buy goods produced under fair conditions may have some guarantee that they have been so produced. The honourable member for Dalley asked me whether it was not possible that a boycolt could be arranged by a trade union if this measure were passed. could not be compelled to buy union-labour articles only. I have heard of no case where that has been In attempted; and, in the second place, that kind of regulation always fails. perience. but I know of no case where such an attempt has succeeded. I have heard of no case in England, and know only of one case referred to. exercised as well without the Bill. a boycott, a trade union label would not be necessary to insure its success. After all, the best guarantee against an abuse of a power such as this clause proposes is public sentiment. If public sentiment approves of labels being placed on goodsif public sentiment demands a label of some sort which will enable purchasers to know that goods have been produced under fair conditions-good s which are so labelled will be bought. If , on the other hand, the public hear that a boycott is unfairlv attempted-if the public press is filled with the protests of those who have been injured by an improper manipulation of the law-the public will refuse to buy goods bearing the trade union label. I am qu'te convinced that there need be. no fear if any danger in this connection. There is very great necessity, it seems to me, for some indication to the public as to the conditions under which goods are produced. We are told that we have factories legislation, arbitration laws, and wages boards; and I admit that to a certain degree the condition of the workers has been materially helped by those various phases 'of recent, legislation.

The union label, therefore, appears to be the only means of helping the workers in the factories to help themselves. For this reason, and because of the benefits to the public, as well as to the workers for which it is guaranteed, the support of the union label is strongly urged by the committee on organized labour of the Social Reform Club. The committee regards the label as the only sign which indicates that the work has been done under suitable conditions, and with any consideration of the rights of the employee's, and, therefore, urges the conscientious public in making purchases to ask for articles bearing the union' label. do with dismissing a man who is not a unionist ? ber, I must admit, is beyond me. In this bulletin Mr Brooks saysI f it is conceded that labour organization is a necessity of the timeThis is a point to which I should like to direct the attention of the leader of the Opposition, who upon every occasion that he rises to speak admits that unions are a necessity. He commends them for their good work, and declares that if he were a workman he would belong to them. Of course he would. Every smart workman belongs to them. Mr Brooks saysI f it is. conceded that labour organization is a necessity of the time, that it is especially necesunions of their trade marks.

The above is the decision, after inquiry, of a man who is not a member of a labour union, and who is one of the trusted writers1 in America upon social subjects. I think that I have said sufficient, so far as one view of the American experience is concerned. I do not propose to follow the leader of the Opposition through all his observations, but there are some further points upon which I would like to say a word or two. He declares that, in his opinion, this clause does not come vwithin the powers granted' to us by the Constitution. He further says that in no part of the world have trade union labels been incorporated with any ordinary trade marks law. I am not able to speak with authority as a lawyer, but I happen to be able to quote one or two instances in which laws do exist-at any rate, in the United States -and where they do include this kind of legislation in their ordinary trade marks law. In California, for instance, in 1901, a new section was added to its trade marks legislation. member referring to Federal or to State law? is a matter which comes within the purview of the States. It is headed, "" Chapter 158, Trade Marks, & c , of Trade Unions."" In Ohio the legislation is again headed, W h a t has that to ""Trade Marks of Trade Unions,"" and in Alabama the same heading is used. These are all late Acts, some of them being rs recent as 1900 and 1901. The use of the term "" Trade Marks of Trade Unions"" shows that the practice has been to include them in the ordinary trade marks legislation. Acts, or are they incorporated in the general trade marks law ? cial Acts, and some are not. In Wyoming the law relating to the trade marks of trade unions has been embodied in a special Act. Mr Brooks, writing in 1898, states that no less than twenty-eight of the States of the Union had passed legislation legalizing the registration by trade fore be a very general disease, if it can be regarded as a disease. Consequently it seems to me that the proposals of the Government are quite within the four corners Of course there is of the Constitution, which permits us .to legislate in respect of trade marks. I do not profess to be able to construe legally the phraseology of the Constitution, but upon any reasonable interpretation of the term trade marks it appears to me that we are entitled to take the course which is now proposed. The leader of the Opposition went on to say that, under the proposal of the Attorney-General, if an employer had one non-unionist out of 100 men working upon a particular product, he could not use the union label. I am quite free to admit that he could not, if the non-unionist were engaged in the manufacture of any article upon which the employer sought to put that label. It would be altogether ridiculous to pass a law to authorize people-withou t going to the unions at all -to affix a label of which the unions were",67,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Therefore, the objection which the leader of the Opposition put forward would sult: Ninety-nine men out of ioo might be employed in the production of certain goods to which it was proposed to affix the union label, and if the remaining man were a non-unionist, he would have to be employed in the production of goods that were not to be labelled, otherwise the Act could not be complied with. a given class of article.

If honourable members opposite are not willing that trade unionists should be protected from the operations of persons who desire to make improper use of a particular trade mark they should vote against the Bill, but to my mind that would not be a fair method of treating one set of men as against the other. The leader of the Opposition stated that under the wages board system of Victoria, of which for a moment he seemed to approve, non-unionists were treated in the same way as unionists, and. received the same rate of wages. I am informed,; on what seems to be pretty good authority, that in quite a number of instances non-unionists do not receive the same wage as unionists do any specific instances to give? those who can speak with authority that the non-unionists do not receive the same wages as unionists. I shall explain the reason. The decisions of the wages boards affect unionists and non-unionists alike, but the non-unionists are, in a larger measure, at the mercy of the employers, and constant infractions of the law lake place, and are reported in the daily papers. In these cases, employers have,, in defiance of the wages board regulations, failed to pay proper wages to non-unionists. The reason is well understood by all those who have had to work in factories or workshops. It is well known that the slightest pretext is often seized upon by an employer unless a workman is protected by association with his fellow operatives. to all employers. many employers who would scorn to take advantage of anything of that kind, but there are among employers, as among other classes, men who take advantage of the first opportunity to' impose upon unprotected men. Therefore the non-unionist is always at a disadvantage as compared with the unionist. That is only natural, because he has not the same strength as the unionist. ber make the unions thoroughly, accessible to non-unionists ? and subscriptions? should be aware that under the New South Wales Act, the Arbitration Court has power to limit the fees to any degree it considers necessary.' It can, in fact, strike out all provision for payment of fees if it chooses. During the time that I was actively) connected with trade unions, I found that, in most of them, no difficulty was experienced in arranging for the payment of entrance fees over an extended period. do not differentiate between one man and another. on the same basis. In New Zealand, 95 per cent, of the unions registered under the Arbitration Act charge 2s. 6d., or less as an entrance fee, and the subscription is either 6d. per week or less. No one can say that 2s. 6d. is an exorbitant charge for entrance to a union. In the union to which I belonged in 'Sydney, arrangements could always be made, and were made, by which a man could pay his fees after he had obtained work. ber knows that in many cases the fees were very high. and no one more strongly denounced than I did the high fees charged by one or two of the water-side labourers' unions in Sydney at the time, of the 1890 strike. still charge high fees-the Wharf Labourers' Union, for instance. reduced by the Court some few years ago. I think the entrance fee is now 10s. However, I am no defender of high fees. would not object to the regulation of such matters in this Bill. be very difficult to regulate such matters in this measure. That should be done in another way. I am not going to seek to render the Bill useless by attempting any impossible scheme, but shall be prepared to consider any practicable proposal that maybe put forw'ard.

The leader of the Opposition affects a holy horror at the condition into which politics have drifted in this House. He asserts that this Bill is an indication of the terrible danger that confronts the public. Here we have the spectacle, he informs us, of a Ministry bringing in a measure, in which they do not believe, at the behest of a number of their supporters On the cross benches. the Ministry were very strongly opposed to it. that is so. I do know, however, that I did not exchange a word with any member of the Ministry in reference to this proposal, until it was actually in print.

For years he was quite content, without perceiving any particular danger to the public, to lead a Government with a minority of the Parliament of New South Wales behind him-conten t always to rely upon the support of a number of honourable members who were only in partial sympathy with him. At the best, those honourable members regarded him only as one who was for the time being carrying out something in which they believed, but in whose general politics they had not the slightest confidence.

It is a very easy matter to excite the indignation of a number of honourable members of this House either by waving the red flag, of the Labour Party or by simply asserting that a certain Bill is another attempt on the part of the Labour Party to obtain something to which they are not entitled. I appeal to honourable members to view this question, for once, free from any prejudice of that character I ask them to consider the terms on which trade marks of any kind are granted. Why is a monopoly of a particular sign given to any person? Simply because the public are entitled to know, if they wish, legislation. that certain goods are the production of a particular individual. whole origin of the trade marks system. Brown, Jones, or Robinson succeeded in producing an article under a given name, which met with the favour of the public, and in the opinion of the Parliament of the day the people had a right to be informed as to what were the goods so produced, while no other person had a. right to attempt to impose on the public in connection with them. And so with regard to trade unions. They can, to-day, place any mark, according to arrangement, on goods that are put on the market, as long as the manufacturer is agreeable. This Bill does not propose to interfere with that right, but it provides that no individual shall come in and unfairly and improperly use a label or trade mark that a trade union has registered as its own. That is simply a proposal to mete out justice to one section of the community-justic e that we hope to see extended to all. I have the fullest confidence that, after all, public sentiment itself can be relied on to prevent any possible abuse that might otherwise follow upon the adoption of this proposition. like to ask the Attorney-General whether at this stage he will allow the debate to be adjourned ? 10.30 p . m . question, and I cannot promise to conclude my remarks by that time.

The question will be thoroughly discussed in Committee. learned gentleman assures us that the measure will be thoroughly discussed in Committee, and it is one of such grave moment to the industrial life of Australia that I hope it will be carefully considered, not only by honourable members, but by all who take an interestin business life. To my mind the question before us is one of the gravest that has been considered by this or any other Parliament in Australia. It is a curious fact that in the case of this measure, as with others that have been brought before us, we have to turn to older countries for precedents and for information as to what its effect is likely to be. This is another example of experimental rible about it, nor is there anything associated with the Bill that should cause the honourable member to seek to be amusing. Curiously enough, it is, as I have said, experimental legislation. been in operation in other countries. and also in England. tralia. moment the origin of the trade union label system in the United States. The first occasion when this trade union label was used in America was in 1874, when, as the leader of the Opposition pointed out, it was used for quite another purpose than that for which it is being used there today. It was introduced to protect the users of tobacco and cigars, chieflv from infection with the awful disease of leprosy, and one can quite understand that it may have been thought desirable for the protection of society. But the conditions holding in respect to it to-day are entirely different. Its use has entirely changed.

652,Mr Wilson,"Let us consider for athe conditions under which it was originally used. But before I proceed to relate some of the facts which I have collected, in regard to the use of this label, I wish to answer some of the objections raised by the honourable member for Bland. He questioned the methods by which men were admitted to the learned professions, and particularly to the legal profession. He instanced the legal and medical professions as close corporations, which put all sorts of obstacles in the way of young men who desire to enter them. do. tions are regarded as obstacles? Would these honourable gentlemen like to see people enter the legal or medical professions without being required to pass examinations? I think not. The only other bar to entrance into the legal profession seems to me to be the obtaining of articles of indenture. That cannot be any great objection, because many men must be known to the Attorney-General, and to other honourable members, who have risen from the humblest positions to the highest ranks of the legal profession. Theyl have shown abilitv. and their articles have been given-to them, and when they have proceeded to their examinations, that ability has been still more in evidence. The same holds good of the medical profession. Many who were my fellow students in Lon-' don have now worked themselves up from the lowliest to the highest positions in the medical profession. We have no grander example of that than the late Sir Andrew Clark, who, from one of the lowest positions in life, rose to one of the highest posimade byi non-union labour. tions in the profession, and was one of its greatest adornments. The public demand the placing of obstacles such as examinations in the way of those who wish to enter the learned professions. No man could wish to employ a lawyer who had not received the necessary legal training, or a medical man who had not received the education required to make him a qualified medical practitioner. The protection given to these professions by law is given to them in the interests of the public. We would not like to have the medical profession filled with quacks, who could exploit the public, nor the legal profession filled with men not properly rjualified, who could take advantage of the public in many ways. The honourable member for Bland went on to say that the unions were open to all, and do not follow the methods which have obtained in America. Only a short time ago, however, the Wharf Labourers' UnioR of New South Wales was brought to book by the Arbitration Court of that State for attempting, by raising its fees, to make itself a close corporation by preventing non-unionists from joining it. The matter being brought under the notice of Mr Justice Cohen, he ordered the rule to be altered, and the fee was reduced. Similarly', when the dispute between the Australian Workers' Union and the Machine Shearers' Union was being tried in the New South Wales Arbitration Court, it was found that fines of as much as £ 3 were levied on members who did not vote for labour candidates, as directed by the union; and the attention of the Court having been drawn to the matter, the union was ordered to alter its rules, which it did. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney was intimately connected with the first-named of these unions, and the honourable member for Darling with the second. With regard to the union label, I wish to know if we shall be allowed by our honourable friends in the Ministerial corner, and by the Attorney General, to insert a clause providing that, manufacturers may jointly register a label notifying that the goods to which it is applied have been made by non-union labour? done under the general provisions of the Bill.

The Attorney-General professes to have a great desire to act fairly between all classes of citizens, and I ask him to go a little further than he has already gone in this philanthropic effort, and draft a clause-whic h he can do very much better than I can-to protect the interests of the non-unionists. The honourable member for Bland told us that there is a very great difference in methods between trade unionism in Australia and in America. I should like to draw attention to a few matters which seem to me to show that trade unionism in Australia is on all-fours with trade unionism in America. Take, for instance, the application of the words "" scab "" and "" blackleg."" Take the terms ""boycott,"" ""bosses,"" and ""walking delegates."" Have we not, in Australia, frequently known opprobrious epithets to be applied to non-unionists ? Is it not a common thing in union circles to call a man who does not belong to a union a "" blackleg "" ? member for his interjection, as it confirms my contention that the honourable member for Bland is not right when he says that trade unionism in America is not the same as trade unionism in Australia. the honourable member for Darwin. MT. WILSON -We have, heard other members of this House, besides the honourable member for Darwin, using the words""blackleg"" and ""scab,"" and in a more contemptuous manner. member must be deaf. orable member say that a man who jumps another man's job, when he is fighting for existence, is not a "" scab "" ? What would the honourable member think of a non-union doctor who lumped his job? ber for Bland, speaking of a person who restricts the use of his trade mark, mentioned the tobacco trust, and said that it prevented certain shopkeepers selling certain cigars, except at a certain price. AllI can say is that the action of any individual questions covering proper sanitation for or trust that would do anything so foolish could only recoil upon themselves. circular to that effect. E»3] they have sent round a thousand circulars. The only effect would be to curtail the sale of that particular brand of cigars. It would simply be an act of folly on the part of a manufacturer to prevent a shopkeeper from selling his goods. With regard to another matter mentioned by the honourable member for Bland, that manufacturers are not to be compelled to use any trade union label, I shall deal with it more fully later on in giving some information which I have from America. It has frequently been proved in America that members of unions have been fined for purchasing goods which did not bear a trade union label. The trade unions in America have gone further than that, and have fined members whose wives or children have used articles of clothing or other goods that had not upon them a trade union label. This shows that the honourable member for Bland cannot have looked very closely into the matter, and is not fully seized of its importance. mention some cases in which unionists were fined in the way he has stated? if the honourable member will remind me. The honourable member for Bland told us that the use of a trade union label would be a guarantee that the articles of manufacture to which it was attached had been made under proper conditions as to wages, sanitation, and so forth. The honourable gentleman urged this as a very strong recommendation for the trade union label, but I should like to point out that all that he asks for in this respect is provided for already by the industrial legislation of the several States. dustrial legislation in Tasmania. They would sweat the hair off your, head there. wished the honourable member to say. honourable member for Darwin very well, and he ought not to run them down. very well, in doing them the honour to represent them. workers are carefully looked after under the provisions of the Health Act. ber referring to sugar plantations?",73,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Owing to the restrictions imposed by the Alien Immigration Restriction Act, they have so far been unable to start the cultivation of sugar beet in Tasmania. But they have there some of the finest land in the Commonwealth, and when honourable members come-to their senses on some of these questions, the Tasmanian people will be able to obtain from the Victorian Government at a very low rate, the machinery of the finely, equipped sugar-beet factory at Maffra, and will be able to start sugar plantations in opposition to those in the district represented by the honourable member for Herbert, but on different lines.
