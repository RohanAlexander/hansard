7,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,"Prime Minisback in liis place in this chamber, in which case Le will deal with the matter personally. oppose the further postponement of a decision on this matter. On Friday last, when this matter was under consideration, in compliance with the request of the Postmaster-General( Mr tion 49 of the Constitution, but has not Parkhill), then Acting Leader of the House, I 'agreed to the adjournment of the debate, so that a legal opinion might be obtained from the Crown Law Department, to guide the Government as to the exactprocedure to adopt so that punishment .might be inflicted upon the offenders. When the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) asked on Tuesday for the further postponement of the'debate, the members of my party agreed, but we stated in the House, and the Prime Minister concurred in our suggestion, that the matter should not be postponed beyond to-day. members on this side, at least, expected that there would be no further delay, and that the Government would have come to a decision hy to-day. It is remarkable that it is only when dealing with newspapers that express political views opposed to those of the Labour party, legal difficulties seem to arise. If a Labour journal had offended in this way, no legal difficulties would have arisen or even, to confer with his, colleague, the Attorneyhave been mentioned; the Government would have been prepared to take immediate action against it. I contend 'that the Government and the Crown Law. Department have had ample time in which to ascertain the exact legal position, and that the Government should now be prepared to say how far it is prepared to proceed in giving effect to the unanimous resolution of the House that the printer and publisher of the Sydney Sunday Sun are guilty of contempt. can quite understand the attitude of the Ward), and I sympathize with him in the frame of mind in which he finds himself; but, if he would allow me to say so, he has not yet had the necessary experience of parliamentary administration, to enable him to realize the great difficulty in which the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) is placed through the absence of his colleague, the Attorney General( Mr Latham). I beg of him, therefore, to be patient. So far as I understand this matter-and I trust that the honourable member for East Sydney will realize that I am not speaking dogmatically-the Parliament as a whole has certain powers under sechitherto thought fit to exercise them legislatively. That being so, the common law applies, and, in a parliamentary matter, that means the practice of the Imperial Parliament, which may or may not be applied to our own proceedings, in certain cases. It is by no means clear that the common law of the Imperial Parliament with regard to contempt and t.o punitive proceedings can be applied to our own proceedings without special statute. At any rate, it is an extremely doubtful point. The Crown Law Department has, no doubt, given certain Therefore, opinions, but, in the absence of its ministerial head, it naturally hesitates to recommend definite legislation, and in the absence of any such recommendation the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), I take it. is also hesitant to take immediate and defiiiite action. The honourable member's sense of grievance is justified; but, if he will be patient for a few days, until the Prime Minister has had an opportunity General, the matter will be taken up by many honourable members at fhe point which was reached last week when certain assurances were given bill). I beg the honourable member, in the name of all those who wish to see definite action taken in this case, to allow ( the debate to stand over for a few more days, and not to embarrass the Government in the unfortunate absence, through illness, of the Attorney-General, who is unable to give his advice on the subject. If legislation should be necessary, as I believe it will be, obviously'the Government must have the benefit of the ceeding further in the matter.

At South Melbourne, in my electorate, there are two factories for plating radiator shells, and at* South Yarra and Carlton, in the electorates of Fawkner ,and -Batman respectively, there ame (Others. A similar factory exists in every capital city of Australia. Altogether, these factories give employment to .hundreds of . adults in plating radiator shells. . all the employees are not employed solely "" on radiator -shells. vince the Minister that a further inquiry by the Tariff Board is necessary. '. . . ' The proposal before the committee is one to abolish a duty altogether, not merely to reduce it. Instead of duties of £2 British, and £3 foreign on radiator shells, it is proposed to allow these shells to come in free from all countries. If the Senate's request iB agreed to, 40 or 50 apprentices who have almost completed their apprenticeship to this technical trade will be left without a trade to follow. The practice of the Ford Motor Company, and other companies, of having their electro-plating and chromiumplating done in Australia, has resulted in 90 per cent, of the total number of radiator shells imported into Australia during the last three or four years being plated in local workshops. Repeat orders have been received by the companies engaged in this work and these, leave out ""bonnets, instrument together with many .congratulatory references as to the -polish and finish of the jobs done, afford striking evidence of the outstanding success of the local industry. Price reductions ha.ve also been made to the extent of .50 per cent, in the .reason for .the Government's action except British, free; that the Ford Motor Company at Geelong has changed ks policy. Two or three years ago this company was quite prepared to bring radiator shells in unplated, and have the work done here, but it now desires tlie work to be done elsewhere. Two or three other motor companies have followed its lead in this regard. Apparently the Government thinks that that is a sufficient reason for altering the fiscal policy of .the country. Two or -three years ago the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) was strongly opposed to the importation of luxury lines for motor cars and otherwise from the. United States of America, and he showed quite clearly last night that he was ,not really happy about this proposal. If this alteration is ..made, the -outlook of the apprentices, who have spent five or six years in learning this industry, will be gloomy indeed. The Government is suggesting not a reduotion of 4 or 5 per cent, in the duty but the removal of all protection from the industry.",17,Customs Tariff 1933

Many Australian companies were encouraged to install extra plant, including technical chemical baths and other equipment to do this work. The Walhalla Company, at Carlton, installed extra shafting and additional acid, baths for this work, and it and most of the other companies that installed extra plant are still paying for it. If this proquality of its work first class. The cost posal is approved, one of the. worse acts of . fiscal vandalism and industrial wreckage that this Government has yet attempted will be successful. ployers and employees alike ask that this proposal be subjected to further inquiry by the Tariff Board, and I hope that the Minister will agree to refer the item back to the board. [3.14J I see no reason why this item should not be referred back to the board foT further consideration. this projected legislation one firm has already been advised that in future all shells will be plated in Canada. If factories engaged"" in chromium plating and similar activities lose the business of this kind, which they at present enjoy, additional unemployment must be caused. I do not think that tlie Canadian Parliament would entertain such a proposition as this for a single moment. It has been said that the dismantling and reassembling of radiator shells add to the cost of them, . but it is quite unnecessary for these parts to be assembled in the coun^ try of origin. They can be crated loose and assembled here. The Australian coin* panies engaged in electro and chromium plating are rendering a national service. 'During the war small plants of this kind operating in France were able to render valuable service in keeping aircraft in commission. Aero-engine worn parts were re-surfaced that. otherwise would have been discarded. The establishment of this industry in Australia has involved the installation of plants costing over £100,000. Worn parts are reconditioned by an electro deposition process', and are returned to service in a* 1 A duty condition as good as that of the original parts. Here, where we are dependent upon the importation of aero engines, this service will prove vital to. the maintenance of our aircraft. We are expending a large amount on defence, and with these plants in operation the surface^ of worn gun sights and gauges can be restored and the equipment, instead of being discarded as formerly, can be placed ih service again. This reconditioning of worn parts saves thousands of pounds. The Australian industry is efficient in every respect, -and the of operations here is comparable with that of similar operations abroad. In Australia we have the plant, the knowEmledge Of the industry, and the capital, and we can supply the full requirements of any trade requiring the dlect'ro depo-. sition of metals such as chromium, nickel, copper, &c. I sincerely hope that the item will be referred back to the Tariff Board for further consideration, and that this Australian industry will not be destroyed. -The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), and the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Jennings) have made out a strong case for the reconsideration by the Tariff Board of this item. The only reasou given in justification of the Government's altered policy is that a certain motor manufacturing company operating in the Corio division now desires work of this' kind to be done overseas. Last night Ministers protested against suggestions that the Government was being"" influenced by the picture-producing interests of the United States of America; how we are told'that the motor manufacturing interests of that country are also influencing it. ber read the report of the Tariff Board on this item? have been influenced by the speeches of honourable members.

Surely tbe interests of tbe Ford manufacturing company should not be our sole concern; yet, apparently, because that company may be able to obtain plated radiator shells overseas for a little less than the shells would cost if plated in Australia, the Government intends to allow it to do 30. It has been argued throughout the tariff debate that these changes are being made in order to give the primary producers some relief in respect of their requirements, but I hardly think that that argument could be stretched to include this item. these duties will not affect those who are in a position to purchase motor cars, but will adversely affect the chromium-plating industry of Australia and throw many men who are now engaged in it out of employment. The case that has been put on behalf of this industry is surely strong enough to attract the support of most honourable members in order to prevent the Ford Company from exercising its influence, on the Government. for West Sydney has stated that the Ford Company has in some way influenced the opinion of the Government. I take that statement as offensive, not only to me, but also to the Government, and I ask that it be withdrawn. not consider that the statement of the honourable member for West Sydney to the effect that the Government was influenced by a certain company to be offensive. I suppose tliat every government is influenced by many people, and properly so. It is the practice for an honourable member to withdraw a statement to which exception has been taken by another honourable * member on the ground that it is offensive to him, but I cannot insist upon the withdrawal of a remark which, in my opinion, ought not be regarded as offensive. uot come into this matter at all, and I cannot understand the honourable member's reference unless it has some sinister has, during the depression, really been meaning. insist upon its withdrawal. not personal, and was along the lines indicated by the chairman. The Ford Company is interested in this matter, and has a right to make its representations to the Government. All that I am saying is that its representations should not be accepted. desire to associate myself with the request of tbe honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), that this item be postponed. I take a particular interest in this matter, because, as has been mentioned by the honourable member, there is a plating factory in my The withdrawal of constituency. Only a few days ago, I discussed the industry with the bead of that establishment. I have carefully studied the report, of . the Tariff Board, and it seems to me that the reasons given in it for the removal of the specific duties and the substitution of ad valorem duties are not sufficient to warrant the alteration. I understand that the Minister considers that in some way the specific duties, which were practically prohibitive, infringe the Ottawa agreement, and, if that were so, that would be a fatal objection; but I have considered carefully sections 10 and 11 of the Ottawa agreement, and have come to the conclusion that the specific duties do not infringe those sections at all. It might be suggested that, by reason of the prohibitive duties, there was not sufficient opportunity given to British exporters for reasonable competition in the Australian market, but when we consider that the cost of,plating radiator shells forms an infinitesimal part of the cost of the imported motor car, that objection vanishes. The evidence given before the board shows that an allowance of from 3s. 6d. to 5s. is made in respect of nnpluted radiator shells imported from Great Britain, and that, coat cannot have the slightest effect, npon the export trade from Great Britain to Australia. It is u mere fly upon the wheel of the British industry, and does not infringe in the. least upon the opportunity given to the British manufacturer to conduct his motor trade in Australia.

No objection has been raised by the users of these parts to the specific duties, and as they do not increase the price to the purchasers of motor cars, I consider that the work of plating radiator shells should continue to be performed by our own workmen in our own shops.

The local industry will not suffer. the small manufacturers, but not the big ones. always attempted to follow a tariff policy that will hold the balance evenly between all sections of the community, and between primary and secondary industries. On previous occasions, honourable members have complained that motor car items have been microscopically dissected, and that there are, in consequence, items in the tariff which should never have been there. The Tariff Board has now recommendedthat the schedule be simplified in this respeet. It has cut out instrument boards, which no one ever asked to be included, and nobody has complained at their removal. It is now proposed that radiator shells shall also be admitted as part of the complete chassis, so that it will not now be necessary to remove the shells, and have them plated, and then put back again. On page 5 of its report, the Tariff Board shows, among several examples, that the additional cost of this operation to car importers is 17s., while Australian industry benefits only to the extent of 8s. for labour and material. . these parts can be sent out in crates. required for each car. I submit that some' honourable members have got this matter out of perspective. It has been said that one firm has been doing 50 per cent, of the work for the whole of the Commonwealth, and the value of all the work taken together is estimated at only £2,500. Therefore, the other firms must be dividing the other 50 per cent, of the business, and the value to each cannot be very great. Some of the firms which have complained that they did not have an opportunity to present their case to the board were represented by the secretary of the Chamber of Manufactures. In any case, the inquiry was advertised well enough, and the firms could have had their own personal representatives there if they wished. report shows that the principal firms carrying on in Australia were, as a matter of fact, represented inquiry. Honourable members know that I would not willingly see any industry injured by overseas competition. Many predictions have been made that various Australian industries would be smashed as the result of tariff amendments, hut can any honourable member mention one industry in which unemployment has followed as the result of this Government's tariff policy.

This duty was imposed when I was Minister for Trade and Customs for a very good reason, to force car importers to have radiator shells plated in Australia. In its report the Tariff Board statesRadiator shells are not manufactured in Australia, they are all imported, and, in most cases, are, on importation, attached to the radiator cores to which they belong. This means that on arrival in Australia they have to be removed from the cores for plating and the parts re-assembled when the shells are returned from the plating works. In addition to the delay and inconvenience caused by this procedure, the importers are put to the additional expense of dismantling and reassembling, the costs of which range from Is. Cd. to 6s. 6d., and tlie average about 4s. 6d with radiator shells that have been plated per shell. That has not subjected the importers of favourably with any carried out elsewhere, motor cars to any great hardship. The honourable member for South Sydthan that at which it can be done ney, in a thoughtful speech, referred to overseas. the proposal of one company to import car user in Australia stands to gain tbese radiator shells packed in crates, nothing from the change that is proposed which would overcome the uneconomic by the Government. It speaks highly for handling necessitated by the present the efficiency of the Australian plating system. It is interesting to note that in 1930-31 the work is extremely technical, and is the chassis were imported into Australia carried out by highly trained operatives numbered 9,200; I presume that in 1927who serve an apprenticeship of six years, 28 and' 1928-29, when conditions were and whose rates of pay are fully double more normal, the importations were even those which obtains in Great Britain. greater.

An official of the organization had ascertained that £20,000 had been expended on plant and £10,000 on land and buildings in Victoria since the duties were increased. A reduction in the duties which would result in the importation of plated radiator shells would mean the displacement of several employees. This would be serious at the present time when there are 40 or 50 members of the organization wit h experience in the electroplating trade who are still unemployed. He was hoping that when Australia returned to more normal times, there would be a considerable increase of employment in the industry.

When this duty was imposed, additional plant and equipment were installed in Victorian factories at a cost of about £20,000. The request of the Senate will, if acceded to, render much of this plant useless, and. what is probably more important, men and youths who have been trained in this special work will lose their employment.

54,Mr Dennis (Batman) [3.56],"Ipersons. I admit that the whole of the time of employees may not be given to the work of electroplating radiator shells, but on one knows better than the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White), who has been a manufacturer for many years, how important it is to have orders which can be carried out when other work may be slack. Therefore, I hope that nothing will be done in connection with this subitem that may cause unemployment in i.his particular industry. It follows that, if the electroplating of radiator shells is done before the chassis leaves the factory overseas, there will be less employment for Australian operators. I hope that the committee will accept the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), and in that way help to keep our people in employment. If the Senate's request is accepted, a considerable number of men engaged in electroplating will lose their jobs. Some of them are just, finishing their apprenticeships, and will have no opportunity to find other work. It is the duty of the committee to see that, this industry is treated fairly in the interests, first of the employees, and, secondly, of factory-owners, who have, in many cases, invested the whole of their life savings in the industry. I am pleased, that some honourable members with free trade leanings, having factories in their electorates, feel disposed to support the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. interested to hear the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) give the assurance that this matter would be at once referred to the Tariff Board. manufacturers said that they were notrepresented at the previous inquiry. ance would not be lightly given; consequently there must be strong grounds for maintaining the status quo until the matter has been again investigated by the board. imposed without a reference of the matter to the board. for a considerable time, and, under it, the industry has expanded, and a considerable number of persons have been employed. Even the Minister himself must be satisfied that the final pronouncement has not been made by the board. Therefore, why effect a change until a further report has been received from the board ? The next point made by the Minister was that a violation of the Ottawa agreement is involved. The honourable gentleman became entangled in an argument with the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), with whose contention I am in entire agreement. Surely the action proposed would not violate article 12 of the Ottawa agreement, which lays it down that there shall be no increase of an existing duty in excess of the recommendation of the Tariff Board! The existing duty is £2 British and £3 general, aud tlie proposal is to reduce, not to increase, it. The Minister said that the duty against Great Britain is equivalent, to 500 per cent. .""J00 per cent. report of the Tariff Board, it admittedly is a prohibitive duty. The contention of the Minister, that the effect of the recommendation of the board is t.o impose an ad valorem duty of 32£ per cent, on unplated radiator shells from America, cannot be contested; but the Government's proposal also involves the removal of the flat rate protection of £3 in connection with American plated shells. As the equivalent of £2 is 500 per cent., the equivalent of £3 must be infinitely higher ; consequently, the protection against American plated shells is being reduced from approximately 700 per cent, to 324 per cent., which is n very drastic reduction. shells is being reduced from a flat rate of £3 to an ad valorem rate of 32-J por cent. against unplated shells is increased. the plating industry in Australia. brought in lacquered or japanned.

Although the work is good, tbe price has been reduced, and employment is given to Australians, it is proposed to withdraw the existing protection. The effect must be to wipe out the industry. There is a strong case for further consideration -Reading carefully the report of tiie Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [4.6] -This is a most interesting subitem. The Tariff Board says that the industry is an uneconomic one. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has presented a very fine case in opposition to the contention of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) that there is a definite violation of the Ottawa agreement. The companies concerned wish to have the matter further considered. The stand that I take is, that if the industry is uneconomic, it should be wiped out, but that such action sliould not be taken until the fullest investigation has been made. The report of the Tariff Board shows that only one firm out of the five that operate in Yictoria was represented .at its inquiry. The bounds of fairness would not be exceeded if the question were referred back to the Tariff Board before the committee came to a decision upon it. There is a precedent for the adoption of that course in the case of the glass industry, which was investigated by the board on more than one occasion. Obviously, this industry has not been able to state its case, possibly on account of its own carelessness, and now finds that it is likely to be wiped out. only one phase of its activities is involved. Australia. The board gives. representaMr E. J. HARRISON -But it is an important phase, as the Minister knows. If it is essential to the uninterrupted operation of the plant, it must necessarily be given full consideration. ing. Mr E. J. HARRISON -The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde) has pointed out that plated radiator shells will come in duty free. but the duty will be 15 per cent, in the case of Canada, and 32^ per cent, in the case of the United States of America. There is no evidence of Mr E. J. HARRISON I still think that the Minister should endeavour to obtain all the evidence available from firms who were not represented at the previous inquiry. If he referred the matter back to the board, he would be commended by the whole of the committee. Tariff Board, one can come to no other conclusion than that this is a most uneconomic industry. It has been proved The that the plating done in Australia is remarkably good, and that no fault can be found with those who conduct the enterprise. The report of the board contains the following statement:Radiator shells are not manufactured in Australia; they are all imported, and, in most cases, arc, on importation, attached to the radiator cores to which they belong. This means that, on arrival in Australia they have to be removed from the cores for plating, and the parts reassembled when, the shells are returned from, the plating works. In addition to the delay and inconvenience caused by this procedure, the importers are put to the additional expense of dismantling and reassembling, tlie costs of which range from Is. Cd. to -Os. 6d., and average about 4s. Od. per shell. Overseas manufacturers make' certain allowances when they supply non-plated shells. The allowances represent the bare cost of plating the shells, and consequently are very low': United Kingdom manufacturers allow from 3s. 6d. to 5s. per shell, and manufacturers in the United States of America from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 9d. per shell. That shows that the cost of dismantling the shells, sending them to the plating works, returning them, and having them re-assembled, is greater than the allowance made by overseas manufacturers for tlieir unplated condition upon arrival in tive examples, showing the excess costs to car importers in comparison, with the advantages to Australia in the way of labour and the use of Australian raw materials. In example A, the cost of dismantling and re-assembling shells and cores is 3s. 8d., while the charge for plating is 7s. 6d. The allowance made by the exporter for -supplying the non-plated shell is 3s. 6d. Therefore, the additional cost which results from having the plating done in Australia, is 7s. Sd. In example B, the cost of dismantling and re-assembling is set down at 3s. 6d., and the cost of plating at 9s. 6d., a total of 13s. The allowance'made by the exporter",25,Customs Tariff 1933

But the charge for plating is 18s., and the allowance made to xthe exporter for supplying the non-plated shells is only 5s. The board goes on to sayIt is clear that the advantages of having tlie shells plated in Australia are hopelessly outweighed by the disadvantages which the excess costs impose on users of motor vehicles. XI113 is not entirely tlie fault of the local platers, who appear to be turning out good work at reasonable prices. The whole of the arrangement is utterly uneconomic, and the benefit conferred by the local industry is not commensurate with the cost involved. In the circumstances, it appears to me difficult to find an argument in favour of the postponement of the sub-item. [Quorum formed.] report of the Tariff Board is dated the 10th July last, the information it contains is not by any means out of date. When this matter was inquired into the meeting of the board was advertised, witnesses were called and those who wished to give evidence had every opportunity to do so. It is incorrect to say ""that this industry is carried on without' detriment to any one, because I bave received a telegram from the president of the automotive industry of Perth, which states that the cost of plating shells in that city is 30s., whereas the overseas factory allowance for unplated shells is. 5s. In addition to the cost of plating in Perth 5s. is charged for removing and replacing the' shell so that the actual cost of this small amount of plating is 30s. In larger cities, where there are more cars, the average cost of plating, according to the board's report, is 12s. 6d-, which has to be paid by the importer or by the purchaser of a car. This duty represents a tax on some one to provide protection for what is merely a branch of an industry. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Some firms, particularly in Sydney, say Forde) said that in Victoria £17,000 is paid annually in wages for plating work; but as the Tariff Board states that the average number of motor cars imported into Australia during the last two years was 6,000, the total value of the Australian work and materials tised in plating would not exceed £2,500. It would appear that, in saying that £17,000 is paid in wages in Victoria"", the Deputy Leader of the Opposition grossly exaggerated the position. Electroplating was undertaken in Australia before motor cars were in use. Electroplating works have existed in every city and in many important towns in Australia for many years, and even if radiator shells are not plated here, these works will still continue in business. I cannot support the postponement of the item, because I consider that, the committee should come to a decision to-day. the views expressed by those who suggest that this matter should be referred back to the Tariff Board for further investiga-' tion. If the last word has not been said in this matter, the Minister for Trade and 'Customs( Mr White) would not be agreeable to the duties being further considered by the board. Up to the present the elfif troplating industry has been conducting its operations with a certain amount of protection, and it would be undesirable io reduce the duty and then to refer the matter back to the board with a view to that body recommending a higher rate of duty. It would be more logical to leave the duty as it is and ask the board to reconsider it. the whole schedule. plating is highly-specialized work, and I cannot understand why the Tariff Board has dealt so harshly with the industry. Chromium-plating was first undertaken by a Sydney man named W. , T. Carmichael, who incurred a great deal of expense in importing modern and costly machinery. He made such a success of the work that a number of others engaged in the industry. No one denies that the quality of the local work is excellent, or that the industry is efficiently conducted. that if they are given another opportunity to present their case before the",26,Customs Tariff 1933

The right course to follow is to refer the matter back to the board, which can make a further report before a final decision is reached. [4.24] -It has been said that the value of the work involved in plating radiator shells does not exceed £2,500 a year, and that the average cost of plating shells is 12s. 6d. each. I have just received a communication from one of the twelve , firms engaged' in this work in New Soutli Wales, which states that the value of the plating work done by it on radiator shells unplated, manufactured in the United States of America and shipped from Canada is £2,400 per annum. The price this firm quotes is 8s. 6d. a shell, including packing and transport. I am informed that the Tariff Board was invited to investigate the plant of this company, but did not do so. Further investigation should be made, aud I shall support the postponement of the item, to enable the Tariff Board, to go further into the whole matter. I have received the following information from Victorian firms engaged in electroplating:This"" request"", although based on a Tariff Board report, dated the 10th July, 1033, should not be supported, because such report does not furnish a proper investigation into this industry. In Victoria there are. five electroplating firms chromium-plating of motor-car fittings, four i>f whom knew nothing about the Tariff Board inquiry, having failed to notice the advertiseHarrison, E. J. ment in the paper. Clearly, insufficient evidence was available to constitute a fair investigation. Australia stands sixth among the nations of the world in the number of motor cars in use, and the chromium-plating industry is valuable to Australia. Prior to the depression, one motor firm imported motor cars, trucks, and accessories to the value, of £10,000,000, and although business has been practically stationary for some time, it is now improving, and, according to the Minister, those engaged in the automobile industry has indicated that,£l,000,000 worth of additional motor cars was purchased last year. The representative of one firm has recently returned from avisit to two or three of the principal States with £200,000 worth of orders, clearly showing that the motor trade is improving and that employment in this industry and in allied industries will rapidly increase. I trust that the Minister will allow this matter to be further considered by the board. Question-That paragraph (6) of subitem (G) of the requested amendment be put. Tho committee divided.

The addition of the words "" and for motor car window regulators "" is requested. No alteration of the duties is sought. The effect of the request is to include handles for -window regulators in the same item as handles for motor car doors. Window regulator handles are similar to motor car door handles, and are manufactured by the same process. The regulator handles and the door handles are often sold in sets, and the prices are very much the same. The Tariff Board has recommended this alteration; hut, apart from this, the alteration is desirable from the point of view of administration, as under present conditions regulator handles are charged a proportion of the fixed rate applied to the regulators, aud similar handles will often be dutiable at different rates of duty. Difficulty is encountered by the department in ascertaining the correct duty payable, and the alteration is desirable in the interests of both the trade and the department. The duties provided in paragraph 7, covering window regulators, were imposed by the previous Government without having received a report from the Tariff Board. The board has now reported on the matter, and is satisfied that the duties requested by the Senate will provide adequate protection. The board found that Australian manufacturers are in a position to supply all Australiau requirements of window regulators, and that the fixed duties of Is. 3d. each, British; 2s. each, general, should afford the industry sufficient protection against the importation of the single arm and other low-priced types; but in order to protect sufficiently the local manufaceach, British, 4d; turers against the higher-priced types, ad duties are unnecessarily high, exceeding in some cases the Australian manufacturer's price, and in all cases of tlie single arm type represent over 100 per cent. It will be noted that handles have been excluded from the paragraph. This experienced in determining the duty which is payable. Handles are at present dutiable at a proportion of the fixed rate applicable to window regulators, and the situation arises in which identical handles are dutiable.at different rates of duty. Provision is, made in paragraph 359 F 5 for handles for window regulators to be made dutiable at the rates applying to door handles. The proposed modification of the Senate's request is necessary in order to maintain the margin of preference of Is. each, in accordance with the Ottawa formula. Motion agreed to.

The Tariff Board, therefore, recommended that the duties on circular saws with inserted teeth should be British, free, and general, 15 per cent. All the parties represented at the board's inquiry agreed that these saws are not being made in Australia, aud are not likely to be made here for many years. The Tariff Board states.that under existing conditions, but without primage, reasonable duties would be British, 30 per cent.; and general, 50 per cent.; hut that if the rate of exchange were now at par and primage duty non-existent, reaThe value of bitusonable and adequate duties would be 45 per cent, and 65 per cent, respectively in the case of saws n.e.i., but on saws not made in Australia British, free, and general, 15 per cent. The Government had two choices, and it accepted the recommendation that the duties 'be British, 45 per cent., and general, 65 per cent. The reason for accepting it is that provision is already made in the exthe British preferential tariff rate on account of exchange, which means that there is really not a great deal of difference between the two recommendations when all the factors are taken into consideration. ference ? and 65 per cent., less the exchange adjustment of l l i per cent., would leave the British rate of duty 33J per cent.,",30,Customs Tariff 1933

109,Mr Forde,"I ask the Minister tomittal, I was merely giving effect to an earlier promise. ter's object in moving for the recommittal of the request in regard to axe handles is not to reverse the decision which the committee arrived at yesterday. Believing that a great injustice was done to the manufacturers of cornflour when the committee accepted the Senate's request, I am glad that this matter is to be further discussed. Trade Riley) directed my attention oh Thursday of last week to the position of the cotton-growers and cottonspinners, and I can add very little to what I told him. then. At a conference of representatives of the growers and spinners recently held in Sydney satisfactory arrangements were made for the disposal of this year's cotton crop. A high official of the Customs Department was chairman of the conference, and has officiated in a similar capacity at previous conferences. knows better than most people that the Tariff Board has made a prolonged inquiry in to every aspect of the cotton industry. Evidence was obtained from Great Britain, and the board sat in both Melbourne and Sydney. Its report is not yet to hand, but the Government will not delay dealing with it .when it is received. It may be taken for granted that the subject will be dealt with in the next schedule tabled in the House. the companies interested in the industry will have to cease operations. Question resolved in the affirmative. In committee (Recommittal) : Item 58Groin nnd pulse, prepared or manufactured, --iz.:(c) Cornflour, per lb., British, 3d.; general, 3d.

That the requested amendment be made. view of the fact that the Australian consumers may now purchase cornflour at the price at which it is retailed in England, I hope that the Government will refer this item back to the Tariff Board for further investigation and report. It is believed by the Australian manufacand Customs) [5.0] -The turers of cornflour and the Australian ' seriously if this duty is reduced. The duty on cornflour under the 1921-28 tariff was British, 2d.; general, 2d. That duty had operated practically ever since federation until the Scullin Government, in 1929, increased it to British, 3d.; general, 3d. On the 4th April, 1930, importations of cornflour were prohibited, and that prohibition remained in force until May, 1932. During that period the Australian cornflour manufacturers supplied the whole of Australia's requireThe honourable member ments, and our maize-growers were able to sell their product at prices much above average world's parity for maize. The Senate has now requested that the duties be reduced to British, l f d . ; general, 2fd. when not packed for household use, and 2d. and 3d. respectively when packed for household use. Such a reduction would undoubtedly adversely affect the local industry, for it would open the market to cornflour manufactured overseas from, black-grown maize. I have always believed in protecting both the primary and secondary branches of allied industries. Whilei t may be said hy some honourable members of the Country party that overseas competition is desirable in connection with such' monopolies as those engaged in the manufacture of galvanized iron, steel, 'and matches, it cannot be justly said that overseas competition is necessary in this case, beeause Clifford Love and Company Limited, of Sydney, Maize Products Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne and Sydney, and Parsons Brothers Proprietary Xiniited, e-f Melbourne, are competing against one another for the Australian cornflour market.

117,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [5.4],"I nbeen protected in the past, it would be : wrong for us to remove such protection now. In 1925, the Tariff Beard recommended duties of 2s. 6d. per central British and 3s. 6d. per central foreign on maize, and these were approved hy Parliament. A consequence has been that the Australian maize-growers have received an average price of 5s. a bushel for the maize that they have sold to the local cornflour manufacturers. I ask the committee to reject the Senate's request, because its .acceptance would lead to unemployment in both the primary and secondary branches of tbe industry, deal a blow at maize-growers as well as the workers in the maize products industry, and enable Scotch cornflour manufactured from maize produced by black labour to enter into competition with the cornflour manufactured in Australia from maize grown by white labour. I feel that the committee acted hastily a few days ago in acceding to the Senate's request on this item, and that, if it reconmaize was quoted on the London market siders the subject now, it will realize that, if the duty is lowered, both the maize producers and cornflour manufacturers will be in jeopardy. The Country party has frequently emphasized that the wheat, butter, potato and onion growers of Australia should receive prices for their products commensurate with the cost of production, and surely the maize-growers are entitled to similar consideration. If the price of maize is maintained at something near the existing figure, the industry will be conducted with a sense of security. That the old rate of duty was ineffective can be judged from the following table showing the quantities of cornflour imported in recent years:lb. 1984-25 192526 192627 192728 192829 lj032,000 In five years approximately 2,000 tons of cornflour was imported. meant that our maize-growers have lost the sale to cornflour manufacturers of approximately 160,000 bushels of maize. The Queensland maize-growers stated in the evidence submitted by them to the Tariff Board that their position was so serious that any action which tended to reduce the market for, or lower the price Mr Forde. of, maize would be a calamity. I think that rtbey submitted a convincing case to the board. Evidence .also submitted to the board showed that tbe average prices paid for maize by the cornflour manufacturers of New South Wales over a period of .years have been as follows:ibushel. s. d. 1928 . . 4 4 1929 . . 5 10 1930 .. ..5 3 1931 .. ..3 6 1932 .. 4 l l i 1933 (to 28th February) . . 5 8 I understand that the present price is about 5s. a bushel. Evidence was also submitted showing that the price of maize in the United States of America, according to tbe Sydney Morning' Herald of the 19 th January, 1933, was as low as 1 cents or 3£d. sterling a bushel. A fair average price was stated to be 21 cents, or 10Jd. a 'bushel. A t the time that tbe inquiry was being made by tbe board, at 2s. 2d. a bushel, but the Australian maize-growers were receiving 5s. 8d. a bushel for the maize that they were then selling to the cornflour manufacturers. All branches of the industry are concerned about the probable adverse effects of a reduction of the duty on cornflour. Mr E. J. Riley, the secretary of the Manufacturing Grocers Employees Federation, writing to me from Melbourne, stated thatThe members of the Manufacturing Grocers Employees Federation are vitally'interested in this inatter. If the duties are lowered to allow cornflour to be freely imported into the Commonwealth, a number of our members w ill be affected, and w ill no doubt be thrown out of work. 299,000 Surely it is reasonable to ask that .. 501,000 tbe Australian maize industry be protected 932,000 against imports of maize or cornflour .. 1,330,000 from overseas. I sincerely hope that the Minister will agree to refer this item back to the Tariff Board, so that information This has available now, but not available when the inquiry was made, may be submitted to the board. It is felt that such information will cause the board to alter its -recommendation. If the Minister will allow the old rate of duty to apply until the Tariff Board has made a further recommendation,we on this side of the chamber will be prepared to forgo our amendment' with a view to discussing this item some time before Parliamentadjourns. This industry has been built up in the face of great difficulties, and is giving employment to hundreds of our people, and unless the local manufacturers are given sufficient protection they will be unable to compete with overseas manufacturers who are usingmaize grown by black labour. I am pleased that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) has recommitted this item, because it gives the committee an opportunity to rectify what, I feel sure, would be a great injustice to an Australian industry. There is little that can he added to the case against the change of duty which has been presented to the committee by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr that the price of wheat aud of flour must Forde).' I would remind the Minister, that the cornflour industry is preeminently an Australian industry, that it handles a raw product of Australia and manufactures it into the finished article, that it supplies a wide and constant demand, and that it has been established for half a century. I have taken the trouble to ascertain the position of this industry in pre-federation days, and I find from the Victorian YearBooh 1S95-1S9S, that 40 years ago the Victorian duty on maizena was 2d. per lb. I ask, the. Minister to try to conjure up the conditions that existed in Australia in those distant days, and to remember that this industry has been established and has continued its operations during all these stirring and revolutionary changes that have marked Australia in the interim. I ask him to bear in mind the fact that the duty of 2d. per lb. in 1895 was more than would be a duty of 5d. per lb. to-day, that in those days the currency of Australia was gold, that the general level of wages was much lower, and that, in short, Australia was then undeveloped, yet it was then considered that a duty of 2d. per lb. was fair for the purpose of encouraging the Victorian industry. When federation was established all the States were brought together. viously some of them had been free trade. In the State of New South Wales cornflour was at that time admitted free of duty, but! previously there had been a duty of | d : pei' lb. The Federal Ministry, in its effort to adjust a tariff to meet the conditionsimposed upon them, fixed the duty at id', per lb. Thus before federation the duty was 2d. per lb.; after federation it was for some time i d . per lb. It was subsequently raised to 2d: per lb., and later to 3d. per lb. It has been pointed out that the cornflour industry is ancillary to a great primary industry; is as. much a part of' maize-growing as butter-making is of dairying. Honourable members of the Country party would be the last to say that butter-making is a secondary industry. They regard it as a primary industry, but it is certainly no more a primary industry than is the making of cornflour' from maize. They recognize go hand in hand, and they are not at all unmindful of the necessity for demanding a local price for wheat and a local price for flour. I remind them that I have supported the fixation of local prices for both wheat and flour, and I consider that they should now be prepared to support the imposition of a diitry sufficient to place the cornflour industry upon a satisfactory basis. I have been disappointed at the report and recommendations of the Tariff BoardI n my opinion the evidence does not support the recommendations. It is curious that the board has become, or is in danger of becoming, a kind of pooh-bah iu this country. Its original duties were severely circumscribed. It was appointed originally to inquire into and report upon the conditions existing in every industry so that the Government might come to a decision upon the facts as adduced by evidence; and for a long time it was the practice of governments to exercise their discretion, sometimes accepting and sometimes rejecting the recommendations of the board. But those spacious days are gone. 12 of the Ottawa agreement. welfare of our country should be our first ' consideration.

120,Pre,"Mr HUGHESI admit that; but theresponsibility for every act of this legisthat this continual harping on the fact lature. The supreme test of the policy of this Parliament is to be found in its effects upon employment or unemployment of our people. The position to-day is that at least 500,000 of the workers of this country are employed in industries sustained by the .tariff; yet we see that the whole fabric by which their destinies are shaped is controlled by the Tariff Board, and not by this Parliament, and that nothing that this Parliament may do can raise the customs tariff except upon the recommendation of that board. It may be thut some honourable members will approve of this or that recommendation of the board; that may easily happen; but, as a general principle, I do not think that they will subscribe to a principle by which this Parliament abrogates all its responsibility, and is stripped of all its powers. We are asked to accept, the duties specified in this item because Tariff Board has recommended them. Viere was a time when the board had leisure. But those days are gone. It is assumed by some people that this body is composed of super men; but they are men like ourselves, staggering under the load of their obvious imperfections, and, without resource to make careful inquiry into the conditions existing in each industry, are racing through the tariff. They have been asked to rebuild, within a. few weeks, the structure which it has taken this Parliament and this country years to erect. The cornflour industry is essentially a primary industry. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that the maize-growers of this country receive 5s. a bushel for the maize used in tbe manufacture of cornflour. The Tariff Board, in its report, being unable to refute that fact, has fallen for over 40 years, and never during back upon the weak excuse that in Queensland the growers receive -only 2s. 9d. a bushel. It proposes to remedy that condition by talcing action, which, on the face of it, must reduce the maize-growers of Queensland, to extremities by cripping the industry that helps to maintain the price even a.t the low level I have indicated. What is to become of the maize-growers of Queensland if the cornflour industry is seriously injured as a result of a reduction' of duty? It is sufficiently obvious Mr llutihox. that Scotch cornflour can be produced for 2d. per lb. is intended to prepare the minds of the people of this country for a catastrophic fall in the price of cornflour, and, of course, of maize from which cornflour is made. Australian maize crop is used for the production of cornflour. intended to reduce the price of cornflour in Australia by flooding the market as far as possible with cheap Scottish cornflour produced -from, black-grown maize. Surely we should have some regard for our ideals. This is a White Australiaa fact, which honourable members should keep firmly fixed in their minds-and how we can abase ourselves at the shrine of black-grown products I cannot understand. There must be some compelling motive to induce a Parliament, which is pledged to support a White Australia policy, to follow instead a policy which encourages the use of black-grown maize. No one is a greater supporter and champion of the Empire than I am, but our first duty is to the people of this country. If the boot were on the wheat leg instead of on the maize leg, there would be no doubt where our friends of the Country party would stand. I appeal to them to broaden their views, and admit that even the maize-growers must live. Eor the manufacturers of cornflour in Australia, the home market is the only ono open to them; but it is proposed by this tariff amendment to deal the manufacturers a staggering blow. In the aggregate there are thousands of people dependent for a living on this industry. It has been in existence the whole of that time has it sweated its employees, or paid low wages. At the present time, it is paying more than the basic wage to its employees. It has maintained those honourable traditions of business which are eminently desirable iu this materialistic age, and has treated its employees as human beings. It has refused to be alarmed by the depression, ancl has during the darkest days gone on paying good wages. The Tariff Board, in its report, says that the Australian manufacturers have",35,Customs Tariff 1933
121,Mr Nairn,"Only 4 per cent, of the",36,Customs Tariff 1933
122,Mr Hughes,"Evidently it isbeen making inordinate profits. board cannot prove that assertion, nor does it attempt to do so. It conveys tbe impression that tbe manufacturers ia England and Scotland are inspired by philanthropic motives and are indifferent' to profits, and so are able to produce .cornflour at very low prices. It is suggested by the board that the well-being of Australia depends upon tihe price of cornflour being reduced. This comes on the heels of a declaration by a judge of an industrial court that the cost of living has come down to such an extent that the basic wage in New South Wales should be reduced by 2s. a week. While the old duty > was in existence the cost of living was consistently falling, and now, I suppose, when the duty is to be reduced, the cost of living will go on falling to such an extent that the basic wage will be reduced by another 2s. a week. Is it iu that direction that our economic salvation lies? I do not suppose that we shall be able to buy cornflour any cheaper in Australia if this duty is reduced. The Tariff Board states on page 7 of its report' The duty of 2d. per lb. represents an ad valorem duty of approximately 00 per cent, on' a well-known and expensive brand of corncornflour manufacturing industry had flour packed in England. An attempt is made to show that in England cornflour can be bought for 2d. or 3d. per lb., but the fact is that Brown and Poison's cornflour is being sold in England to-day at 9d. per lb., while the same cornflour is being made in Australia, and sold at 7d. per lb. that assertion. Minister's statement; but I point 'out that, if the price in England is 9d. per lb., that price is in sterling, which repreindustry reasonable and adequate protecsents l l ^ d . in Australian currency. Even if the price in Australia is 8d. per lb., that is still 3^d. less than the price in England. Moreover, I am informed, and believe, that this firm established a factory in Australia, and continued to manufacture for some years. It made every effort' to establish a business in this country, but failed even in this Eldorado, where it is said that the cornflour manufacturers are piling up riches beyond tbe dreams of avarice. Wliere is the evidence The that the firm of Brown and Poison, in Scotland, is a benevolent institution, while the manufacturers in Australia are vampires sucking the people's blood? There is no evidence to that effect. One day the Tariff Board says that the manufac^ turers of axe handles, for instance, need not be protected, because three Australian axe handles can be bought for the price of one imported handle. Then, the next day, the board says that cornflour 'is not deserving of protection because it * is making too much profit. It frowns upon one industry because it sells its product too cheaply, and upon another because it charges too much. The cornflour manufacturing industry has been in existence for more than 40 years, it has built up a great business, it sells a good article, and no one has ever complained of the price or pf the duty. Because of this, and because we should do nothing to reduce the chances of employment for Australian citizens, I ask the Minister to leave things as they are, and to give the Australian industry an opportunity to continue. -The riglit honourable member for North"" Sydney( Mr Hughes) said that the been in existence for 40 years, so that, presumably, it wa3 in existence before there was any protective duty at all. He said that members of the Country party would be more disposed to support this industry if it were connected with wheat rather than with maize; but I assure him that, while a certain amount of wheat I have already disproved is grown in my electorate, a great deal more maize is grown there. My electorate produces 85 per cent, of all maize grown in Victoria. However, the question before us is: Are we to give this cornflour tion, taking into the consideration the higher price that -it has to pay for maize or to make the duty so extremely high that excessive profit taking will be possible?

Another part of the letter refers to an interjection which I am reported to have made while the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) was speaking as to the effect that "" the duty was lcl. in '.921, and -Jd. later in that year"". As honourable members know, interjections that are recorded in another member's speech easily escape one's attention. The year should have been 1901, and not 1921, as was erroneously recorded in Hansard. L see no reason why the committee should not support tbe vote that was recorded the other evening in this chamber, for it is in conformity witb the report of the Tariff Board, gives adequate protection to the industry, and accords with the Ottawa agreement. Silling suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. acceptance by the Government of the Senate's request for a lower duty on this sub-item is a serious mistake. As the Minister for Trade and Customs' ( Mr Tariff Board, nor is it suggested that, White) has indicated that he is prepared to refer it back to the Tariff Board for further consideration, the right thing to do is not to disturb the status quo pending such investigation, because there is good reason to believe that, after having obtained further information concerning conditions in the industry, the board will substantially alter the recommendation upon which the Government is now acting. I cannot understand the board's logic, for while it is alleged that excessive profits are being made by Australian manufacturers of cornflour, aud that, therefore, a lower duty should be imposed, neither the board nor the Government is able to inform its mind with regard to profits being gained , by foreign manufacturers of this commodity. But, on the evidence available to us and from our knowledge of trade practices in other countries, we may quite I quoted it the other safely reason that, if excessive profits are being made by Australian manufacturers, quite extraordinary profits are enjoyed by their foreign rivals, who obtain maize, the raw material, at a lower price than that ruling in Australia, and whose labour and other costs are very much less. It follows, therefore, that since there is little difference between the prices charged for cornflour of foreign manufacture, and those of the Australian article, the oversea manufacturer, being in the enjoyment of the advantages which I have mentioned, must be making much greater profits than his Australian competitor. I say further, that if , as is alleged, the price of this commodity in Australia is higher than it should be, lower duties will uot prove to be the right corrective. On the contrary, if , as seems likely, tbe foreign manufacturer secures a stronger hold of the Australian market, he will have further opportunity to exploit it. Obviously, the situation calls for the appointment of a price fixing tribunal. If , as has been alleged, the Australian manufacturers are making excessive profits, why have uot overseas firms established branch factories in this country, for the purpose of securing some of the advantages which, we are told, this market offers to local manufacturers? This is a phase of the industry which is not mentioned in the report of the if a lower duty is imposed, the price charged for cornflour will be less than present rates, though no one can deny that interference with the measure of protectionnow enjoyed by the Australian industry will seriously affect local manufacturers, and, through them, those maize growers who depend upon this market. It is estimated that between 400,000 and 500,000 bushels of maize is required to meet tbe Australian demand for cornflour, and thafthe area given over to the production of this",39,Customs Tariff 1933

165,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [ 8 . 3 2 ],"Imanipulate the numbers in the committee. During the debate last night stress was laid on the evidence given before the Tariff Board by H . J. C. Beer, the president of the Axemen's Association, and I remarked at the time that that gentleman had put forward two contentions. In one he asserted that no Australian timber, suitable for the manufacture of axe handles, is available in commercial quantities. On the other hand, we have the evidence of those v/ho are so confident that, suitable timber is available in Australia in commercial quantities tliat, if they receive sufficient tariff protection, tbey are prepared to extend their factories and to build new ones. evidence was directed at something which he did not understand, or else be wished to misrepresent the position to the board. Mr Beer also said that there was a possibility of a timber-feller working on a platform at some height from the ground meeting with a serious accident owing to an Australian axe handle breaking. American axe handles also are likely to break. He was more concerned about the quantities of suitable timber available in Australia than he was about the suitability of the Australian timber, and he neglected to mention the possibility of a man using .an American axe handle meeting with an accident. I have also discovered that Beer has another axe to grind. He has been giving evidence on behalf of overseas interests on the subject of saws. Apparently, he is a professional organizer on behalf of overseas interests. Great stress was placed upon his evidence as a supposed axeman, but it was not disclosed that he is also a professional urger on behalf of importers and is endeavouring to break down the tariff erected to protect Australian industries. Before this matter . is considered further, the Minister should submit substantial why the decision recorded last night should be reversed. Unless that be done, the committee will not be treating tbe subject on its merits. The Government is using the forms of the House to manipulate the numbers and secure a majority in favour of a proposal, which, after full discussion, was rejected by the committee last night. Minister is able to give good reasons wby those who opposed the request last night should now reverse their vote, I hope that a majority will adhere to the decision previously recorded on this item. Until this evening, I was under the impression that tariff schedules are dealt with on non-party lines. I have heard that so often that, in my innocence, I believed it to be true. of the honourable member on motor bodies? tariff schedule, I have voted according This gentleman's to my convictions. This matter was discussed at length last night, and a decision reached. Subsequently, it was rumoured that tbe item would be recommitted because the Government believed that it would be' able to reverse the vote. Probably pressure has. been brought to bear upon certain honourable members, but I hope He did not tell the board that that they will record their votes as they did last night. If they do not intend to do so, they should say why they have changed their opinions. Neither the Minister nor the Assistant Minister has given any reason wby. this request should be reconsidered. No additional facts have been brought before the committee to justify the course which the Government is now taking. The voting last night was 27 against and 24 for the Government's proposal,, making a total of 51, or roughly 10 more votes than are available to-night. If the Government secures a majority on this occasion, another belief which I have held will become an illusion.

I have already pointed out that even if the request bo accepted,"" the Australian industry need not necessarily be injured, because Australian manufacturers can make handles from hickory imported in the log. Honourable members cannot close their eyes to the valuable report submitted by the Tariff Board, which has every facility for obtaining evidence from both sides. Why should some honourable members criticize the evidence of only one individual when testimony' has been given on both sides? The board acts in a judicial capacity. It weighs the evidence submitted to it, and arrives at a conclusion as to the facts, and it is in a better position than honourable members to arrive at a reliable decision. In the course of some pertinent remarks, the hoard stated in its reportThe board is most anxious to avoid making a recommendation which w ill cause a serious setback to the industry. A t the same time it cannot deny the rights of users of hickory handles to obtain their requirements at reasonable prices. Would honourable members insist that hardwood should be used in the manufacture of all furniture ? It is not the same class of timber as imported hickory. for Herbert is an enthusiastic advocate of the use of Queensland timbers, but while I recognize that that State produces timbers in greater variety than is to be found in other parts of Australia, the honourable member will admit that one class of timber is not suitable for every purpose. In. the southern States hardwood axe handles are made, and although they are quite good enough for household purposes, ample proof was submitted to the board that many timber-getters and bushmen prefer hickory handles, and are willing to pay a higher price for them. Is it suggested that these men should be penalized in buying the tools that they require for their work? They should not be saddled with a heavy duty because of State selfishness, nor should they be forced to use axe handles which they consider unsuitable. The board went on. to sayThe experience oi the last few years has shown that hickory handles are essential for certain purposes, and the board considers that the costs of such essential requirements should not be raised by duties imposed in an attempt to force users to purchase definitely inferior substitutes. The members of the Tariff Board have Australian sentiments as strong as those of honourable, members who desire only Australian materials to he used; but honourable members should exercise a sense of proportion, and not claim that simply because a. certain class of timber is grown in this country it is better than any tim1 ber procurable in other parts of the world. The board further statedThe above table shows that under normal conditions the margin of preference may be insufficient to enable Canadian exporters to capture a very large proportion of the available Australian trade. Having regard to the fact that the handles imported from Canada are manufactured from American hickory, the board is of the opinion that no greater margin of preference is justified. That, I think, is a fair report. Although some honourable members have predicted that injury will be done to local industries because of the board's recommendations, they cannot point to any in which such injury has actually occurred. I shall watch the industry carefully,, but I urge the committee to accept the recommendation of the board. The board makes an economic survey of an industry, and, having a good idea of values, it is in a position to judge the merits' of the requests made to it. If the committee adopts the recommendation it will be observing the spirit of the Ottawa agreement. hope that the committee will adhere to the decision reached by it last night. I do not pose as a timber expert, but last night I quoted evidence given by a Queensland expert who knows more about timber than do the members of the Tariff Board. I may be quite as competent to express an opinion on this subject as the members of that board; I am not aware, that they have more common sense than a good many other persons in the community.

Watson, Wood Technologist of the Queensland Forest Service, also reticularly when it was flatly contradicted ferred in his evidence to the excellent qualities of Queensland timbers. A Tasmanian merchant has sent to the mainland in the last five months 35,000 handles made by local companies, and repeat orders are being received. Despite that evidence, the Tariff Board, by some strange process of reasoning, expressed the opinion that the Australian handle was not so good as that made of American hickory; but, as the honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom) has pointed out, this prejudice against Australian timbers is not new. Queensland maple is highly valued for furniture manufacture, and huge quantities of it are sent, overseas for this purpose. Twenty-five not in demand for furniture ing, and it was thought that good furniture could not be made without imported wood such as British walnut or oak, American oak or New Zealand kauri. So great was the prejudice against the use of Australian timbers that people were prepared to pay fancy prices for New Zealand kauri, stained in imitation of various other timbers. Not until the export of kauri was prohibited did Australian timbers become popular. The committee now has an, opportunity to assist to break down this prejudice. One honourable member, who spoke of the quality of American hickory for the purpose of making axe handles, said that, despite the tariff barrier, . 100,000 American hickory handles are imported into Australia Honourable members speak of the wonderful durability of American hickory axe handles | but, if 100,000 of them' have to be imported each year to replace breakages, they cannot be of high quality. consider that the present duty on hickory axe Such heavy importations suggest, first, that, those who prefer the imported handles are prepared to pay the high price charged for them, and, secondly, that breakages must he numerous. The only direct evidence against Australian axe handles, on the ground of their lack of durability, came from a gentleman who, apparently, is an agent of overseas manufacturers. strange that his evidence should carry Mr Rosevear. such weight with the Tariff Board, parby men who earn their livelihood as timbergetters. The agent to whom I have referred said that there was not sufficient quantities of suitable timber in Australia to justify setting up an industry to manufacture axe handles. His contention is disproved in the most convincing way by the fact that people are prepared to build factories, and to extend existing factories, for the manufacture of axe handles from Australian timbers. The evidence in favour of the existence of adequate supplies of suitable timber far outweighs that to the contrary. It would appear that the Government is piqued, and is determined to use its majority to reverse a decision arrived at by this committee after a ful l discusyears ago maple was sion. No new evidence has been adduced makin favour of the American handle, or against the Australian-made article. The committee would be well advised to adhere to the decision at which it arrived last night. Mr E. J. HARBISON (Wentworth) [9.4] -The arguments .of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Eosevear) were both inconsistent and illogical. He quoted the evidence of MrM . B. Foley, a professional axeman, in favour of Australian axe handles; but, after all, that is the opinion of only one man. Against his opinion was that expressed by MrH . J. C. Beer, president of the Victorian Axemen's Association, who submitted a statement signed by 168 axemen in that State. The honourable member for Dalley attempted to discount Mr Beer's evidence every year. by saying that he was an agent for overseas manufacturers. The petition, signed by 168 axemen and submitted by Mr Beer, readsWe, the undersigned axemen or bushmen, handles should be considerably reduced, as in our opinion there is no timber in Australia available in commercial quantities suitable for making axe handles. It is dangerous for us to use Australian handles in our work, because they ore not reliable. .Surely the opinion of those 168 men should weigh with us.

The course that the Government is now taking will tend to destroy whatever little confidence the people may still have in it. Trade and Customs) [9.20] I am sorry tliat it is necessary for me to discuss this item again; but tlie speech of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr when tliey know that the use of Australiau Makin) shows"" that he, at least, is under a misapprehension, so, if I can enlighten him, the time spent on this recommittal will not be wasted. The honourable member said that the schedule sent from this chamber to the Senate provided for such duties as would give effect to the provisions of the Ottawa' agreement. He should know that when the agreement was introduced some 400 increases of foreign duty had immediate application to give the prescribed margin of British preference. But the rates of duty were all subject to revision by the Tariff Board. Since then many reports have been received recommending certain alterations of duty, as in the item being discussed, but preserving the margins required under the Ottawa agreement. In these circumstances, the honourable member should really express his thanks to me for correcting the misunderstanding under which he has been labouring. On the general subject of tool handles, I remind the committee that the Tariff Board made the following comments in its report:Tlie principal classes of bandies on which what country will next be included within these duties were requested are handles for small tools, such as chisels, files, small hammers, hatchets, saws, screwdrivers, handles bulk of the axe handles iniported into for certain farmyard and garden tools such as forks, rakes, hoes, and spades and handles for shovels. I hope that the committee will realize the Board, but according to a newspaper wisdom of approving of the duties rereport, some of the advice tendered by it quested by the Senate, which are in to the Government in connection with accordance with the recommendations of the tobacco industry was not based on. the Tariff Board. might be thought from the speeches on this subject, that this was a question of admitting handles on a free-trade basis; but I remind the committee that even if the Senate's request be agreed to, a substantial duty will remain on imported axe handles. I make no comparison between the respective qualities of hickory and spotted gum for the manufacture of handles, because I am not competent to judge the merits of either.. But the Tariff Board, in its report, observed that' Men who make their living with the axe should have the right to choose the class or' handle they use. It is unlikely that timbergetters are prejudiced in favour of hickory timber would enlarge the avenue for their own employment. No attempt is being made to force axemen to buy hickory handles. The board also pointed out that locally manufactured axe handles cost only from one-half to one-third the landed duty-paid cost of imported handles. Those who prefer the locally manufactured handle may procure it at a price considerably less than that of the imported article. If the higher duty desired by some honourable members were agreed to, imported handles would cost four times, as much as the locallymade handles. The duty now proposed is 45 per cent., and this, allowing 25 per cent, exchange, 10 per cent, primage, and 10 or 15 per cent., natural protection, would bring the full measure of protection enjoyed by the local article up to about 100 per cent. In all the circumstances, I think there is no justification, for refusing the Senate's request. I had not heard uutil this evening that the terms ""of the Ottawa agreement could be. stretched so far as to include the United States of America. I do not know the terms of the agreement. The great Australia are made from hickory grown in the United States of America. I do not desire to be unduly critical of the Tariff reliable information.",47,Paibs

It is quite easy for us to understand that such an energetic person would find it a simple matter to collect 168 signatures to a petition for presentation to the Tariff Board, but the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) has directed attention to the opinion of a skilled axeman, which does not bear out the view expressed in Mr Beer's petition. Mr Beer is simply an urger for foreign business, and is not at all interested in tbe welfare of Australian industries. |'9.29] Trade and Customs( Mr White) a few minutes ago, revealed the folly of this .Parliament delegating to the Tariff Board, its right to determine rates of duty.'

It has been shown, on occasions, that the Tariff Board, in recommending rates of duty, does not always fully analyse the evidence submitted to it or give due weight to the experience of the persons who come before it. Honourable members have failed likewise in that respect. We have heard a good deal about the evidence of Mr Beer, the president of the Victorian Axemen's Association, but his evidence is refuted by the following evidence of MrM . B. Foley, professional axeman, of New South Wales:As a bushman since boyhood, I have been getting my living through the axe. For tlie l>u.st eight or nine months I have been cutting more unemployment. It is to our own sleepers for tlie Forestry Commission, and have been using three axes-tw o squaring axes and an American axe-al l fitted with Australian spotted gum handles. using spotted gum handles for the last couple of years, and one now in use for three months. One of the axes in use was for grooving, and a handle that will stand up to that will stand up to anything. Many other practical aud professional a semen gave similar evidence before the board, yet. that body ignored it, and based its recommendations on the evidence of the representatives of the importing interests. It has been stated that the timber-getter should have the right, if he so desires, to use imported hickory handles, but the timber-getter who prefers imported handles must remember that this Parliament has protected the Australian timber industry in order to ensure his livelihood, and on that ground alone he should object to the use of imported timber.

The Minister has stated that the request must be acceded to in order to conform with --The speech of the Minister for section 12 of the Ottawa agreement; but I oppose this item as I opposed that section of the agreement, on the ground that it places the responsibility of this Parliament too much in the hands of the Tariff Board. It has been stated that Australiantimbers are not suitable for axe handles; but I contend that there is no better timber in the world for that, purpose than Australian spotted gum, which, according to experts, will stand a greater pressure per square inch than any other timber. Australian hardwoods are now being largely used in the construction of houses and furniture, and for mining purposes. It has taken a long time to break down the prejudice against local timber. At one time there was a prejudice against Australian boots and hats, but to-day few people in this country wear the imported articles. By discouraging Australian industries such as this, we are bringing about more and advantage to manufacture our requirements from our own raw materials.' AusI have been tralian timber is now being largely used, not only for tool handles generally, but also for parts of agricultural vehicles which, a few seasons ago, were made exclusively of American timber.

That gentleman, in his official capacity as chairman of the Forestry Board of Queensland, visited the timber areas of those two States and gained first hand knowledge of the industry. He has also' inspected the timber areas of the United States of America and Africa, and therefore should know at least as much as the president, of the Axemen's Association of Victoria of the suitability or otherwise of Australian timbers for tool handles. The greatest axeman iu the Commonwealth has won many of bis championships with axes fitted with Australian handles, and although he has at times to cut blocks 15 feet or 16 feet from the ground, he has never to my knowledge suffered any hurt on account of using local handles* -The Minister stated that one of the reasons for the recommittal of this item was to afford opportunity for further discussion.

The exchange adds another 25 per cent, and primage 10 per cent., making the protection equal to 80 per cent. At the present time, I am operating a sawmill, and I know that the axemen attached to it say that it is necessary for them to use American axe handles, especially for broad axe work, as handles for this class of axe are not made in Australia. The American handles do not compete with the Australian-made article, which is only half the price, and is purchased where possible by reason of its cheapness. If the excessive duty is allowed to remain, the only effect will be that those who must Southampton in the House of Comhave American handles will have to pay more dearly for them. One might be pardoned for believing that this is not an Australian parliament, because every time an Australian industry is under consideration, it is made the target for a battery of hostile critirepresents Worcester in the House of cism. Last night, ihe committee decided upon a certain course of action in regard to axe handles, and refused to make an amendment requested by the Senate. Tonight we are having the whole debate over again, because the Minister has discovered that we are cutting across the provisions of the Ottawa agreement. The Leader of the Country Party (Dr. Earle Page) said that the axemen working around his mill were anxious to obtain American axe handles. There is nothing to prevent them from getting the handles and paying the old rate of duty. If Australia is good enough for them to live in, Australian-made axe handles should be good enough for them to use. The evidence submitted to the Tariff Board proved conclusively that the Australian article was equally as good as the imported. If we adopt this policy in regard to other industries, we shall very for nations on the other side of the world. The reason stated by the Minister for having tbe bill recommitted is not the true one.

As has been the case with'many other fiscal sins committed by the Government, this is done in the name of Ottawa. I have had some personal experience in. connection with axe handles, and, because of that and my early life in the outback, have taken a particular interest in this Australian industry. In the Darling and other electorates there grows ;i timber called mulga. nu'iiibers representing Mallee districts claim that mallee is destructive to axe handles, while those who have ironbark in their electorates say that that timber is even worse than mallee. In describing the adamantine qualities of mulga, 1 need only say that, if the toughness of mallee is multiplied by that of ironbark, you reach approximately the toughness of the mulga of Central Australia. Only recently I observed the use of Australian axe handles some 600 miles inland by a number of men who are supplying wood to BrokenH ill . Some eighteen months ago the attention of the men was drawn to the fact that Australian-made axe handles could be procured-the y bad previously patronized the American article, at great co3t to themselves-and there came along a complimentary bundle of some three dozen axe handles made locally from Australian timber. After testing them most severely, the men declared that they were the best axe handles they had ever used. Incidentally, since I came to Canberra, I have found that one Australiau axe handle has outlasted four American handles. 1 do not say that some American handles are not good; but, through the desire to get as and to turn them out rapidly, American manufacturers are marketing an article that is practically worthless although expensive to purchase. Many handles are committee (Consideration of made of imitation hickory. The retention of this duty is important to those who use axe handles, and who support Australian industry, for it definitely enables Australian manufacturers to produce an article that compares favourably with the imported product. Therefore, I strongly urge the committee to resist the Senate's request. ""When last I spoke on this item, I ventured the opinion that the proposed reduction of the duty could not be justified on the ground that it was in any way affected by the provisions of the Ottawa agreement, and I now say, deliberately, it is to the Minister's discredit that he should have put forward this defence. I am forced to the conclusion that the honourable gentleman has not been so frank with the committee as he might have been. The figures dealing with the imHonorable portations prove that this item is not even remotely related to the agreement made at Ottawa.

Last year, as I have stated, the trade had receded to £11,186. Thus it is evident that the Government desires, by reducing the duty, to make up to importers of American axe handles what they had lost in trade to the Australian manufacturer. It is almost inconceivable that the Government, which claims that its aim is to promote Australian interests, should lend itself to a proposal that will imperil the future of this important local industry. In the discussion of other tariff items, the reasons advanced by the Government for a reduction of duties have been that local manufacturers have been taking unfair advantage of the protection given to them, and have been penalizing Australian consumers. They have urged that competition, preferably competition from overseas, is necessary to keep down prices. That argument cannot be sustained in connection with told handles can be purchased for the price of one imported handle. The Government, in seeking to reduce the duty, is not treating the Australian industry fairly. It is prepared to encourage, not an Empire-grown product, but the product of the United States of America, a country which has little trade sympathy with Australia. Although we import heavily iu several lines from that country, it buys practically nothing from us. The Minister should certainly explain, if be can, why the Government is showing preference for foreign interests. Clearly this is now the policy of the Government. It would not be wide of the truth to speak of it as an importers' government, because it gives such scant consideration to Australian products. It is remarkable that an industry such as the one covered by this item, an industry which has proved its capacity to supply Australia's needs, should now be jeopardized by a lowering of the protection which, hitherto, it has enjoyed.

Later, honourable members may have an opportunity to comment on the ignominious defeat of the Government on another matter. able member may give reasons why the bill should not be returned to the Senate, but may not continue along the lines he is now following. the tactics that have been> employed by the Government is such that I find it difficult to speak with restraint. I object to the bill beitig returned to the Senate in its present form, because in one particular at least it does not express the considered opinion of a majority of honourable members of this House. I , therefore, propose to vote against the motion. attention to Standing Order No. 181, which readsOn the motion for the adoption of the report the bill may, on motion, be recommitted, either in whole or in part; in which case, if amendments be made and the bill be reported, a subsequent day shall be fixed for taking the report into consideration and moving its adoption, and the bill, as reported with the amendments, shall in the meantime be printed; but if no amendments have been made the report may be at once adopted. I submit that, as amendments have been made to this bill, a subsequent day must be fixed for the remaining stages of it. sidered requests of the Senate, and came to a resolution thereon.
