The House Met At 2.30 P.m.","Mr Clerk, Notwithstanding the sad memories attaching fo the past week, we have the duties of the present day before us. It is my pleasure and honour to move That the honourable member' for Laanecoorie, the Honourable Charles Carty Salmon, do take the Chair of the House as Speaker. Dr. Carty Salmon possesses credentials as Chairman of Committees, and in tbe discharge of his duties would have ever before him the precedents established by our late respected Speaker, and the parliamentary procedure gathered together by the late Mr Blackmore. I commend him to",14,Setup
1,Sir Philip Fysh (Denison) [2.31].,"honourable members as Speaker, and, if he be elected, promise their very sympathetic and even vigorous support. I doubt not that he will bring to the discharge of his duties all the capacity which he possesses, and will be actuated solely by the desire to properly conduct the business of the House. I second the motion, and, in doing so, endorse what the mover has said. I have known Dr. ""Carty Salmon for many years as an administrator and as Chairman of Committees. He is one whom those who are best acquainted with him look up to, and honour. I am sure that, if elected, he will do credit to the House, and justice to himself. I need not say that the necessity for any motion at all causes me personally the most profound regret; but since we must now proceed to the election of another Speaker, I moveTbat the honourable member for Kennedy, the Honourable Charles McDonald, do take the Chair of the House as Speaker. Speaker during the unavoidable absence of Sir Frederick .Holder, and holds the position of Chairman of Committees. His qualifications for the position are admitted on all sides, and have twen proved by the splendid success of his rule. We have had tributes to his worth' and impartiality from very many members of the Ministerial party, as well as of the Opposition. At no time has his ability or fairness been questioned. The suggestion has never been made that he has not carried out his duties with impartiality and credit. It would have been possible to have had this matter settled on non-party lines, and I am sorry that that has not been done. A candidate for the Speakership should be proposed only after consultation between the various parties, or by an informal meeting of honourable members generally, prior to the"" meeting of the House for the purpose of a definite selection. In South Australia it has always been the practice to have an informal meeting of members before proposing a Speaker, and I think that , that practice was adopted before the late Sir Frederick Holder was first chosen. At any rate, on that occasion there was a general understanding, before the House met, as to who should be chosen. This is desirable so that we shall, as nearly as possible, secure unanimity in the choice of Speaker, or at least the appointment of a member who has the confidence of a considerable' majority. I regret that on this occasion no attempt was made to secure unanimity, because I am certain, knowing the facts, that it might have been obtained. Because of the action of the Ministerial party there must now be a contest for the Speakership on the floor of the House. That is regrettable. The Ministerial party -in caucus, let me emphasize-ha s determined that the question shall be treated as a party one. make it a party question. determined yesterday that it should be a caucus matter. That being so, we now have no alternative but a contested election. deny that this has been made a caucus matter? deny it? cumstances, there are one or two matters to which I feel it necessary to allude. For the two candidates individually I have the same good feeling, and have nothing to sayin regard to tbeir personal character. hold a caucus yesterday afternoon ? who should be Speaker? has never pretended that it does not hold caucuses; but, before it .knew what the Ministerial party would do, it decided to leave this matter over to the meeting of the gentleman who has acted . as .Deputy Speaker, and has presided over our Comv mittees with admitted. success. The honourable member for Barker the other night alluded to him as the most fearless Chairman that he had ever known, and one whom he was proud to. see in the position. The Minister of Defence, too, 'when irÂ» Opposition, said that the absence of a conspicuous warring of parties"" during the Tariff discussions was largely due to the Chairman of Committees, who, more than any other honourable member, he thought, had assisted to put through the Tariff. said that.",14,Election Of Speaker

The Leader of the Government has also complimented the honourable member On his work; and we know how arduous that work was during the Tariff discusSpeakership, we shall be reaffirming the decision at which we arrived when we chose him as a suitable person to preside over our deliberations in Committee. We have also had experience of Dr. Carty Salmon in the Chair. The Parliament that elected the honourable member as Chairman of Committees decided by a majority that he had been found wanting in the office, and his re-appointment was not affirmed. Labour party introduced the party system for the first time in connection with the elecmatter-that he is a fit and proper memtion of a Chairman of Committees. fact, the election of a Chairman of Committees in this House as well as in the House of Commons has always been a party question. must also recollect that the party with which numbers to enable it to do what he suggests. I do not wish, however, to be diverted from the point that I wish to emphasize: that the House having had experience of Dr. Carty Salmon as Chairman of Committees, on the first opportunity. of Committees was then a sessional appointment. man of Committees has been reappointed to that office, whereas the present Ministerial candidate for the office of Speaker could not secure re-election after honourable members had had experience of his presidency over their deliberations. Chairman of Committees, so that the honourable member is utterly in error. feated in the same Parliament in which he was elected Chairman of Committees. honourable member's party. cast for Dr. Carty Salmon on every occasion that he offered himself for the position of Chairman'of Committees. this party is concerned, the voting was the same when Dr. Carty Salmon was first elected as Chairman of Committees as when he was defeated. for the Labour nominee. those honourable members did so not out of mere caprice, but because they considered that they would be discharging a public duty by replacing the then occupant of the chair by an honourable member in whom they had more confidence. I ask honoras Chairman of Committees has done anything to forfeit their confidence. I know that the answer must be that he has not. In the circumstances, therefore, I submit to those who are not pledged-and I hope that every honourable member will be free to give expression to his real desire in this ber for the office of Speaker. I sincerely trust that there will be an opportunity to ascertain the real feeling of a majority of the House. There are other honourable members who could secure the appointment by an absolute majority vote, and I have The honourable member every reason to believe that but for the method adopted by the Ministerial caucus, some of those honourable members would have submitted themselves to the will of the House. have won. only have won, but would have set out to discharge the duties of his new office with the knowledge that he had the confidence of an absolute majority if not of every member of this House. 1 regret that in the circumstances under which the election is being conducted. Dr. Carty Salmon, if chosen for the office, will set out with the knowledge that he has not the confidence of nearly half the members of the House. It is to be regretted that a partisan vote should be taken on the election of Speaker, and I hope that the the duties of Chairman of Committees so well will weigh with honourable members in determining this question. can scarcely add anything to iwhat has been said by the honourable member for Boothby, and I feel, too, that it is difficult to say anything in the way of further eulogy of the late lamented Speaker.

As a young parliamentarian, I rely much upon those who have had greater political experience than I have had, but I feel certain that what I say in this regard will be endorsed by every honourable member. I have very much pleasure in seconding the nomination of gret that, as has been clearly evidenced by the caucus held yesterday afternoon by honourable members opposite, the election has been made, a party matter. It has been alleged, not suggested, that the Labour party also held a caucus. That is not so. Several members of our party in our room yesterday had an informal conversation in regard to the matter, but we passed no resolution, and did not arrive honourable members on this side are comat any definite decision. We were under the impression that our party might possibly be approached by a Ministerial ambassador with a view of having this question settled on the -Jines 'that were followed bn a previous occasion, and that the elecmember to judge the attitude of honourable tion would be conducted in such a way as would reflect credit on the House, and give satisfaction to the country. Mr has made, or by speeches such as we have McDonald has not been anxious to become a candidate ; indeed, it is somewhat against his own inclination that he has been nominated. We felt, however, that since he had discharged the duties of Chairman of Committees so satisfactorily, it would be doing the honourable member for Kennedy but simple justice to allow honourable members an opportunity to show whether they were caucus-bound or were free men, able to vote according to their convictions. I feel perfectly certain that were honourable members free to vote as they pleased, the honourable member who has been nominated by the honourable member for Denison would not be selected. It is not yet too late to test the feeling of the House, and for this position. Could either the honorto ascertain whether some other honourable member more acceptable to honourable members generally, might not be chosen.

HALL -He is turned down by seventeen gentlemen who hapjiened to be present at the caucus meeting, and whose nominee obtained two more votes than any other. The question of who is to be chosen by the House to preside over its deliberations is apparently to be re-tled by the question of which gentleman has most supporters on the spot the day before Parliament meets. If a man happens to be a Melbourne man, and can get all his local friends to roll up and give him their support, whilst the New South Wales section of the same party are coming over from Sydney, he gains the support of the whole party, ancl so a man who mav succeed in obtaining only nineteen or twenty votes at the party meeting secures the support of a majority of the House.

As the voting was very close, the honourable member for Bourke chooses to say that the Age report is wrong, without telling us how the votes were cast. I wish to call the attention of honourable members to the British practice in regard to the choice of a Speaker, and to contrast it with what happened yesterday, when the Prime Minister presided over a party caucus to decide who should be nominated. In a statement of what took place in 1874, Todd, in volume I . of his Parliamentary Government in England, saysUpon Mr Gladstone's resignation Her Majesty sent for Mr Disraeli, and empowered him to form a Ministry. Being able to rely upon a majority of fiftv in the new House of Commons, Mr Disraeli had no difficulty in this task. By February 2r, the new Cabinet was complete. It consisted of twelve members only, of whom six had seats in the House of Lords. And here it may be remarked that the opening of this Parliament-wherei n the Conservative party had an undoubted majority-gav e occasion for the distinct recognition of the admitted expediency of treating the Speakership of the House of Commons as no longer the prize of the party in power. tice of the English House of Commons, not of an American House of Assembly! tice.

If that is the best that the Age can write of the honourable member, then it.s best is bad. I am sure that whoever is elected to the office of Speaker will receive the support of honourable members on this side of the House, and it will stand to the shame of the Fusion that they have been the first to drag down such a question as this to the level of party politics. no desire to be drawn into what seems to have developed into little short of a wrangle, but I feel it necessary to make a few observations. The office of Speaker is the highest gift that we can bestow upon any honourable member, and, therefore, I agree with those who have lamented the introduction of party politics in connection with this question. As one of the rank and file, I am confident that, had an honourable member of outstanding ability offered himself for election, there would have been no cavil. I regret that an honourable member such as the honourable member for North Sydney, could not consent to be nominated. I trust that he will forgive me for mentioning his name, but I repeat that there would have been no difficulty, had the honourable member or any of several whom it is currently reported woulrj not come forward, agreed to their being nominated. made by the Labour party as to honourable members on this side be:ng caucus-bound have no effect upon me, although the action that I intend to take will probably come as a surprise to them. nominated for the office of Speaker two honourable members with whom I have been associated since the inception of the Federal Parliament, and I intend to vote with due regard to their merits. It is somewhat distasteful to me to have to discuss their qualifications for the office in public, but since they have been nominated, and their abilities have been canvassed, I do not hesitate to say that I intend to vote in a way that, I believe, will be in the best interests of the Parliament and the country. Mr cated. If their challenge were the only McDonald has for a long time held office as Chairman of Committees. To my mind there is no more onerous position in connection with our Parliament. The Chairman of Committees has always a more difficult task to perform that has Mr Speaker himself. It is in Committee that our great struggles take place, and the Chairman must exercise great tact, and hare a thorough knowledge of parliamentary procedure to enable him to successfully preside over our deliberations. The honourable member for Kennedy has shown remarkable capacity in the office of Chairman of Committees, and the way in which he has discharged the duties attaching to it must have met with the approval of honourable members generally. His impartiality has been acknowledged again and again, and his knowledge of parliamentary, procedure has been displayed on many occasions. He has discharged the duties of his office well and properly; but if some other honourable member of outstanding ability were nominated for the office of Speaker, it is quite probable that he would not be a candidate. As it is, we have simply to choose between the present Chairman of Committees and another honourable member who, in the early stages of the Federal Parliament, held that office. We have had experience of both, and I repeat that no one can cavil at the way in duties of Chairman of Committees. The holder of ' that office has no pre-emptive right to the Speaker's chair; but if he desires to secure it, I see no reason 'why it should be denied him. If there are to be no further nominations, I shall vote for the honourable member for Kennedy, for I think that he has earned the position. I The remarks see no alternative course, if I am to be guided by a true sense of justice. If the caucus system has been introduced in connection with the settlement of this question, I certainly regret it. I have had nothing to We have do with it. If it be true that honourable members on this side of the House have met in caucus, and selected a candidate for the office of Speaker, their action does not reflect great credit upon them. Having regard to the high office to be filled, it would have been far better for them to agree to fight out the question in the House. It is not because the Labour party have challenged honourable members on this side of the House to vote outside party lines that I intend to vote in the way I have indiconsideration involved, I should take an opposite course. As it is, I have a free hand, and shall vote for the honourable member whom I think is best fitted for the office.

He will have a right to expect the consideration of every honourable member during the remainder of the session. This is not a personal matter, and I hope that. Dr. Carty Salmon will accept my assurance that I intend to vote to the best -of my judgment. I certainly regret that neither the honourable member for North Sydney nor the honourable member for Parkes has seen fit to stand for the office. gret the circumstances in which we are called upon to elect a Speaker and must also deplore the fact that party bias has been shown in connection with the determination of this important question. We should seek to elect as Speaker one -whom we all respect and whom we believe will do that which is right. I learn with regret that a caucus to deal with this question was held yesterday by honourable members opposite. Such conduct was very different from that which has prevailed in connection with the election of a Speaker in the Tasmanian House of Assembly, as well as in other State Legislatures. The question ought to be lifted far above party politics, and we should be guided solely by a desire to elect to the office of Speaker the honourable member whom we consider best fitted for it. I move That the honourable member for Riverina, the and that he will endeavour to emulate the Honourable John Moore Chanter, do lake the Chair of the House as Speaker. Mr Chanter was the first Chairman of Committees in this House, and lost the office through no fault of his own. Honourable members generally are aware that when the first Parliament had expired by effluxion of time, Mr Chanter, who was then Chairman of Committees,sought re-election as a member of this House, and owing solely to a mistake made by a Commonwealth officer, was not returned. Subsequently, the election was declared void, and at the second contest the honourable member was returned. He was associated during the first three years of the life of this Parliament with the late Speaker, and satisfactorily discharged the duties of Chairman of Committees at a time when many honourable members had come fresh from State Legislatures, the Standing Orders and procedure of which were altogether different from those under which we work. Consequently his office was a peculiarly difficult one, but only once, so far as I can learn, was there an'appeal from his decision to Mr Speaker. The result of that appeal was that his ruling was upheld. This shows that Mr Chanter's experience as a member of the Parliament of New South Wales served him in good stead. I have, therefore, nominated him, and trust that the election will be decided quite apart from party considerations. Honourable members opposite say they are perfectly free to vote for whom they please, and I sincerely Rope that the House will exercise its discretion and refuse to be dominated by two Melbourne newspapers. This is'a Federal, not a State, Parliament, and we ought to deal with the question before us upon broad principles, and select the candidate whom we consider test suited for the high office that we have to fill. I contend that the honourable member for Riverina in the early days df this Parliament displayed abilities fitting him for the position of Speaker, and that he should have the confidence of the House. If , however, Parliament is to be dominated by a few honourable members who meet in caucus, the outlook for Australia will be a bad one. I have always opposed such domination, and it will be a bad day for the Commonwealth if a House of seventy-five honourable members is to be ruled by the decision of some seventeen or eighteen members. I trust that whoever may be selected will have the loyal support of the House, splendid example set by our late Speaker. I have only to add that I trust we shall never again hear of the introduction of the caucus system in connection with the determination of a question of this kind. If there is to be a caucus let it be a caucus of the whole House. I rise with pleasure to second the nomination of my old friend, Mr Chanter, for we have been political friends perhaps for a longer period than have any other two members of the House. The honourable member for Bass has said nearly all that I intended to say as to the way in which the honourable member lost the position of Chairman of Committees. It is quite probable that he would have been Chairman of Committees to-day, and as such would have been chosen for the office that we now have",23,Thomson I T Is Partito Accept Thc Woid Ot The Honourable Mem

During the long years of our friendship, Mr Chanter has always proved a true and earnest man, and I think I need say no more of him. I rose, not only to second this nomination, but to make one or two observations in regard to the late Speaker. I said nothing yesterday because the occasion was a very solemn one, and I was under the impression that probably there would be only two speakers to the resolution; but I wish now to say that I have been singled out for attack by a -vicious press. I had no greater friend than the late Speaker wasto me. He was the man who stood by me in the early days of Federation, when I was endeavouring to select a Commonwealth Ministry. are present here to-day-wh o tried to prevent his joining me, but he refused to listen to their counsel. He came to Sydney, and he would' have joined the Government I was trying to form; and he has been my friend ever since. ber always bowed to the late Speaker's ruling. was, perhaps, the only man in the House who could control me, because I am a strenuous fighter. On the day before his death, after I had been speaking in the afternoon, he sent for me and asked me to be careful of myself. He pointed! out that my voice was weak, and that I did not look well; and he said that if he could help me in any way he would gladly do so. had a friendly and pleasant conversation with him in his room; and he gave me further advice. Wicked people who try to make out that I would do anything which I knew would injure him are the worse class of peopio to be found in the community. purposes. poses probably. I ' have always regarded the great man who has passed away as my friend and adviser in matters political; and honourable members must kno.w that it would be furthest from my thoughts to do anything to in any way jeopardize his health. HadI known that he was not well I might not have spoken so long as I did on that afternoon. ber did not speak for very long. nearly two hours. As showing the feelings which the late Speaker entertained towards me I may say that while I was addressing the House the honourable member for Kalgoorlie handed me a note suggesting that if I did not feel my voice strong enough or did not feel well in any way I ought to cease speaking and ask leave to continue my remarks afterwards. I did not know at the time fiom whom the note came, but I subsequently ascertain that it came from Mr Speaker. I feel I did right yesterday to leave the eulogies of this great man to the leaders of the House; but I cannot allow any idea to get abroad that I would do anything to injure the man who was my guide in poliThere were those-and some tical life. -The meeting of Ministerialists yesterday will be regarded by the country as a regrettable event. For the first time in the history of our national Parliament-and I know that there has been no such occurrence in the history of the State from which I come-the election of a Speaker has been made a party question. The honourable member for Bourke tried to make out that the report in the Age was incorrect-that there was no vote taken at the meeting. I sincerely hope that the report is incorrect, but, unfortunately, no one has denied that a vote was taken, and that every member who participated feels that he is bound by the result. If , however, honourable members do not feel bound in honour, I After dinner, on the same day, I propose to give them an opportunity of doing what ought to have been done in the first place. I propose to nominate a gentleman who, if he will accept nomination, will, commanding, as he does, the respect of every honourable member, secure election by a very large majority. I refer to the honourable member for Balaclava; and I shall nominate him as one way out of the disgraceful position in which we find ourselves-the one way to return to the observance of the highest traditions of Parliament, which I hope will always be upheld. Further, it is the honourable way out; and if honourable members opposite feel that, now that they have the whole facts before them, they have done that which they ought not to have done, they will, I hope, vote according, not to the decision of a section of Parliament at a party meeting, but according to their own private convictions.",24,Thomson I T Is Partito Accept Thc Woid Ot The Honourable Mem

He must have a judicial mind, and must be .governed by an equable temperament, for his mission is to balance the conflicting political forces of the nation. He must so exercise his power that each member shall be able to enjoy every parliamentary right as completely as though he were the only member in the Parliament, and yet ""so that each member, through the atmosphere in which he exists, shall gather force and strength from the other members. The Speaker, therefore, is the embodiment of the intelligence, impartiality, and fair play of the whole Commonwealth. That being so, the Speaker should not be chosen by a party. Consequently, the Labour party wisely refused to select a man, or even to talk about selecting one, except casually. It was a great mistake of the Prime Minister not to consult with the Leader of the Opposition, ancl not to invito all members of the House to meet and discuss the matter, in order to see if we could not come to an agreement. suited the Age. to .choose the Speaker of the CommonI movewealth Parliament. So far as concerns the honourable member who has been chosen by the Government caucus-bound party, I have the highest respect for him, and I want it to be distinctly understood that my protest is against the way the Governmen caucus selected him. The Speaker other man in the House, but it seems now that he will be simply representative of a partisan section. Surely nobody wants that?

Why should hot Dr. Carty Salmon have just as good a chance in the open House as any one else? Why should not candidates submit themselves openly to the House, and let the House be the judge? It is sad to think that this system has been introduced into this new Parliament, which is not yet nine years old-introduce d too, by one of the ideal men of Australasia. I should never have dreamt that the present Prime Minister would sit in a caucus like Dick Croker, or Charles F.

The principal argument advanced by the Attorney-General is that the Government, having a majority behind them, are entitled to elect whom they please to the office of Speaker. The honourable member has sought to justify that contention by the quotation of certain authorities. I am not here to quarrel with the decision laid down by the legal adviser to the Ministry, but on a previous occasion, when we had to choose a Speaker, the honourable member who occupied the position of Leader of the Opposition was consulted by the head of the Government before any action was taken. It is for the Government to say what shall be our future procedure. They have seen fit to take a course different from that followed by the first Parliament;. they are creating a precedent, and I presume they consider that, as a Ministry which has restored responsible government to the Commonwealth, they are taking a dignified course. I regret that they have seen fit to take this action. If I understood"" the Attorney-General correctly, he wished to convey to the House that the Government as a party had not decided upon a nominee. He used at least equivocal language, saying that we need not necessarily infer that the Government as a Government had a nominee for the office of Speaker. My impression is, however-and , indeed, it has been stated-that there is a candidate for the office of Speaker who is absolutely a Government nominee. has said so, according to the press. with the controversial side of Ihe question The Attorney-General has said that it is the right of the Government to select for the position of Speaker one of their own supporters. In other words, if the Government have a majority they are entitled, according to the honourable gentleman, to use it in the selection of a candidate for the Speakership. with which I do not agree, and if effect be given to it, the result will not be creditconstitutional experience and guidance, and able. It was not, however, to discuss that matter that I rose. The Minister of Defence has said that we are having ""another exhibition.""

We have now four nominations, and to discuss the merits of each candidate would do no credit to the Parliament. now for nearly two hours. Minister object to that ? The honourable gentleman is strong on dignity when it suits him, and I would remind him that this is an important epoch in the history of the Commonwealth. As soon as we had paid the usual compliment to the memory of the late Speaker yesterday, the Prime Minister rushed upstairs, and took part in a meeting of his party, called to consider this question. The Labour party held no such meeting; indeed, f. advised my party not to hold one, and we have not, as a party, come to any decision, save that which is vestedin me as leader. 1 am here now to make a suggestion without consulting any member of my party, although I have consulted the honourable members who nominated Mr Chanter. The suggestion that I make to the Prime Minister now undoubtedly a good deal of feeling in regard to the several nominations, and the way in which they have been made, I suggest to the Prime Minister thatalthough I believe the House will succeed under any Speaker-w e should postpone our decision on the several nominations, and, in the meantime, have an open conference.

We have one Minister making one statement, and another a directly opposite statement. In the circumstances, how is one, situated as I am, to take any forward step towards that which one believes is for the welfare of Australia?

263,Mr Deakin,"First, the Attorneyproceedings. Those present were put under no pledge or bond. It was suggested by more than one speaker that any who took: part in the choice should determine to abide by the result. That proposal was not put'to the vote, and was not enforced on any one; it was at most an honourable obligation on those who took part in the selection. caucus ! the Labour caucus could be conceived. Not only, as I say, did one or more members deliberately leave without any question being put, but they, are still as much members of our party as before; but art independent course was afterwards taken by others. The action of those who remained was left to each man's sense of what was right and fair. If a member took part in recommending a candidate, or in becoming a candidate, it was left to him to say whether it was fair to insist on his opinion after doing so, since he took part in a meeting which he might have left without expressing an opinion. Labour party. nutted by the legil obligations which bind the Labour party, as a matter of fact, the party usually presents the same solid front as when bound by pledge. As I have said, the habit of acting together seems to exercise great sway. that what I say is not correct? able gentleman is stating is correct as to the decisions-bein g placed in such a position legal obligations of the members of the Labour party, but then practice goes a long way outside even those large obligations. Consequently, the meeting which we held yesterday, though it is called a caucus, because it was a political gathering of members of Parliament, was in no sense the kind of caucus which binds honourable members opposite. The meeting yesterday exercised no powers of coercion over its members, either directly or indirectly, such as is employed opposite, apparently even in this case. As I have said, the Leader of the Opposition, if he had submitted his proposal at the first moment cf our gathering to-dav, or had chosen to submit it beforehand,"" he would have been perfectly justified in either step, because this is a matter quite outside the ordinary discharge of Ministerial duties. The proof of this is that it was not dealt with by the Government as a Government question. The Cabinet did not even consider, much less decide, it. The members of the Government attended our meeting with others, but made no recommendation. I do not know how any one of mv colleagues voted, or how a single member voted, and no member or colleague asked me how I was voting or had voted. It was purely, an independent : choice made by each of us,, no one else knowing how he voted. right to do that? ing a distinction between our proceedingsyesterday at a political meeting and a Labour caucus. isterial party are political meetings, while we meet in "" caucus."" of the honourable members opposite are different in spirit, in intention, in practice, and in effect. I regret to say that, after nearly two and a half hours spent in a much too personal debate, we are no nearer a decision. We have arrived at a point from which it is impossible to retrace outsteps. Nothing remains to be done except -and I hope in the briefest possible time -to select an honourable member who will, I am sure, when once chosen, receive the united support of the House in the discharge of his onerous duties. take this opportunity of lodging my protest against a member of a partya party which we are now told is bound by caucus that his vote is lost to those with whom he is associated. So long ago as fifteen years, I made a similar protest on the ground that a member of Parliament, on being selected as Speaker, or Chairman of Committees, disfranchises his constituency, and loses his party a vote. I know that the Labour party have several times lost a vote owing -and though that gentleman is, perhaps, my closest personal friend in the party, he knows that the view I am now expressing has been held by me for years. My experience of over twenty years is that the Government with the numbers behind them have, with one single exception, nominated the Speaker, and have always carried their proposal. Only once in the history of the Victorian Parliament, so far as I know, was a member of the Opposition nominated",34,Thomson I T Is Partito Accept Thc Woid Ot The Honourable Mem

That gentleman is not the Speaker of the Victorian Parliament to-day, simply because certain members of the Labour party -objected to losing his vote, as they would if he were elected, and walked_ out of the chamber without voting. about that! ought to hear the last of all this humbugging nonsense about the caucus. After all, ""caucus"" is only, a synonym for a meeting of the Labour party, which must differ from meetings of honourable members opposite just as, for instance, a meeting of barristers must differ from a meeting of medical men. If the caucus on our side is more solid in its vote than is the caucus on the other, the fact simply shows our better organization. This question has come down to a party vote pure and simple, and no one need try to blind us to the fact. If my reading of the rules which govern this meeting to-day is right, I object to the fact that if a majority vote for one man the other two candidates have no chance of having a vote recorded for or against them. It seems to me that the outside public, when reading of these proceedings, will say, "" A plague on your different parties."" had some common sense ruling this Parliament. What has taken place to-day proves that the election of Ministers, which I hope will soon be brought about in this Parliament, will have to be conducted by ballot. If we had had an exhaustive ballot to settle this question, we should not have had this acrimonious discussion. The candidates nominated include Dr. Carty Salmon, a gentleman with whom I have had, perhaps, more severe differences than with any other honourable member, although I cannot recall an unjust decision given by him. He was voted out of the chair by a combination of the party then sitting on this side, following ,a threat that can be verified he was a. man. For the matter of that, by reference to Hansard. That threat was carried into effect, and he lost his position. the party who are now on this side. by a party the remnants of which are on the opposite side to-day. However strong my differences with Dr. Salmon may have been, I am sure that, if he is elected, he and side. Another candidate is my old friend Mr Chanter, who, through no fault of his own, but because of the incompetency of the Federal officers controlling an election, was absent from this House for a time while a man of wealth was unjustly allowed to fill his place. The courts of justice ultimately reinstated him in his proper position, and removed that wealthy man from this Chamber. never been refunded to him. cluding two Labour Governments, have come and gone since then, ancl yet that injustice has not been remedied. Another candidate nominated is a friend of mine, with whom I am, perhaps, more intimately associated than with any one else in the House. I play many games of chess with him, and have a most friendly feeling towards him. If it comes to my vote, I will support him, but I wish that our party would follow the example .set by the Labour party in the Victorian Parliament, and decide that, until we have a .majority, we must keep every vote, so that we may make the greatest use of our strength. No one from this or the other side can cavil at my friend's decisions in the chair. As a Protectionist, I certainly., have strongly objected to some of his It is time we votes, but he was a true Free Trader at that time, and, as new Protection had not been proposed, he gave his votes as his conscience dictated, clearly, distinctly, and truly, like the straight man that he is. Another gentleman has been nominated whom I would have seconded had not the honourable member for Darwin forestalled me. If this matter had to be decided by an exhaustive ballot, that gentleman would have possibly won more votes, especially at this time, than any of the other candidates. I am tired of going back for an example a hundred or a hundred and twenty years, to the time of Pitt, when, in England, no man held a vote because no man in Great Britain to-day has a vote because of his manhood. I am tired of going to the "" Mother of Parliaments"" for an example. It is absurd to say that we in Australia, with our extended franchise and our freer laws, must always go back a hundred years or more for a precedent, to a nation which hesitated for so many years to bring the Ballot Act into existence.

I regret that this has devolved into to execration even at this day? Sooner than be guided by the quotations given by the Attorney-General, I would take the good sense of tlie Democracy of Australia, and say that such elections as this should be conducted by, an exhaustive ballot, especially when we hear to-day the phrase, ""To the victors the spoils""-of office. With ing, me for the high position of Speaker.. an exhaustive ballot, no one could say that there had been any lobbying. I have put on record my protest, and, if I could find another man who held my opinions, I should walk out of the chamber and refuse to vote. The present system robs a constituency and a party of a member's vote, and I would sooner see the Speaker and Chairman of Committees elected from outside. An example is to be found in the various Trades Hall Councils, which are the Parliaments of the working man. They do not elect their presidents for long term's. So far as my knowledge goes, with the exception of the early institution in the fifties, no president has been elected by those bodies for more than one year. enough. enough. Switzerland, the most Democratic country of the world, a country that is now called the school-house of Europe, never allows the President of the Republic to hold office in two successive years, nor does it allow the President of the Legislative Chamber to be elected for more than one year. We, when we elect a man to a position like this, make it almost a lifelong appointment. As a Democrat and a member of the Labour party, which is the soul and essence of Democracy, I lodge my protest against what is now being done. I lodged it fifteen years ago, and it has taken a long time to bear fruit, but the recent election of Speaker in the Victorian Parliament has not caused the Labour party there to lose a vote. If a member of that party had been selected for the position, his vote would have been lost, but now the party vote is strong and solid. Sometimes a Speaker dare not offend, for he knows that the hour may come when all those votes will be wanted. would sooner see an independent man from outside Parliament in the position of Speaker. Having uttered my protest, and proved my contentions conclusively from the two splendid instances of Switzerland, the school-house of Europe, and of the Trades Hall Councils of Australia, I will cona purely party vote, and that I am bound to give my vote accordingly. I have to thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh and my kind friend the honourable member for Darwin for nominatYesterday I attended the caucus meetingthe first I have ever attended, and probably the last, as I have always been opposed to them. ThereI suggested to the chairman that it should be left to the whole of the members of the House tochoose a Speaker. I feel that a great mistake was made in not calling members of the House together at a general meeting, to discuss the question, so that a Speaker should have been proposed and seconded, and' unanimously elected when the House met. If that had been done, there would not have been any of the unpleasantness that has occurred to-day, or that may perhaps occur in the future. us adjourn until to-morrow. of the meeting did not agree with my proposition, and it was proposed thatnominations should be received. If Mr W. H . Irvine, or Mr Bruce Smith, or Mr Dugald Thomson, had agreed to be nominated, I am sure that the House would unanimously have supported any one of them. I should not have opposed any one of them, but I allowed myself to be nominated at the meeting. I was not successful in obtaining the highest number of votes. ProbablyI did not have sufficient friends who had confidence in me, or perhaps they thought some of the other gentlemen nominated were better entitled to the position than I was. was not the House.

288,Mr King O'malley,"That is gaggingbut, at any rate, I attended the meeting. I did not leave it, and, therefore, I think I am in honour bound by what took place there. I believe, from expressions used in this Chamber to-day by many friends on both sides, that, if the matter had remained a non-party question, I should have been honoured by being elected as Speaker. But, having taken up the position that I did yesterday, I feel that I must forego whatever chance I had of that honour, and remain a private member. One cannot help feeling very grateful to friends, especially those on the Opposition side, who are opposed to me in politics, for the many kindly expressions they have used today regarding myself, and also to many honourable members on this side, for what they have said privately, who would, if they had had an opportunity, have voted for me. In the circumstances I should be very pleased if the honourable member who proposed me would withdraw my nomination. withdrawn. After the speech that we have just listened to from Mr Wynne, those who have been preaching anti-caucus and anti-caucus methods ought to close their lips for ever. I do not say that honourable members opposite are not entitled to decide by majority on questions of public policy what legislation will be best in the interests of the country; but in this case they have departed altogether from the question of policy, and the Prime Minister's speech cannot be interpreted as meaning anything else than this:-""We have got the numbers, and we are going to have this position."" We are all sorry for the necessity for this election, question. but I agree with the honourable member for Denison that, whilst we regret the circumstances, we must, as public men, face the question. I therefore cannot join very enthusiastically in the view that we cannot settle the matter in open Parliament, and in the light of public criticism. I am not very enthusiastic about the suggestion that a question of this kind should be settled by a meeting before we assemble in Parliament. We have a Ministry led by a gentleman who has always denounced caucuses and their effects. Speaking on the 25th May last, at a meeting at the Melbourne Town Hall, to which admission was by ticket only, and where he was to explain a policy which is not now. before the country, he saidI say that when some of your representatives go into a room, and a division is taken, say, amongst twenty-one members of Parliament, supposing eleven vote on one side and ten on the other-al l voting according to their judgment and conscience-the ten come out no longer as representatives of the people. They come out as delegates of delegates. They come out as the representatives of eleven other representatives. Where is your freedom? Where is your independence ? . Where is your liberty ? What is the effect upon the constituents of the ten out-voted men? What is the effect upon the thousands of the constituents who elected those ten men, who are compelled to vote against their conscience and their judgment at the dictation-no t of the constituents, but of fellow representatives? Labour party say that they are prepared to support certain candidates for the Speakership, even in preference to their own nominee, rather than make this a party matter. But what is the position of the Prime Minister? According to the most accurate reports that we can get, thirty-two Ministerialists attended a caucus yesterday, and, according to the Age of this morning, seventeen voted one way and fifteen the other. in the Age is incorrect. that I have heard'the honourable member repudiate an Age statement. That newspaper is not remarkable for its veracity, but it is the organ of the Government, which could not live a week without its support. It has alsofirst-handinformation as to the intentions of the Administration. Does the Government Whip deny that there was a ballot? it does not matter whether the voting was seventeen to fifteen or twenty to twelve; the figures are immaterial. Some honourable members opposite say that no resolution was carried binding them to adhere to the decision arrived at, but they acknowledge that they are in honour bound to do so. I believe that the honourable member for Balaclava, but for the result of that secret ballot, would be the choice of the majority of honourable members this afternoon.

I wish now to deal, in the light of experience, with the merits of the candidate who has been put forward. My statements regarding him are not to be taken as reflecting on him personally.

The Prime Minister, in order to establish the fact that the members of the Ministerial party are bound only by their sense of honour, said that he did not know how other Ministers had voted at the caucus. Apparently, therefore, the Ministry was not unanimous. Ministers accept the result of a secret ballot, and will waive their personal opinions to give effect to it ; yet they will not admit that it was a caucus decision. site know what the voting was. are the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Franklin. for Laanecoorie was, on the 17th March, 1904, elected Chairman of Committees by twenty-nine votes to twenty-seven, the honourable members for Robertson and Angas then voting against him, and the right honourable member for East Sydney for him. On the 2nd August, 1905, he was re-elected by thirtv-five votes to twentv-seven, the honourable members for Darling Downs, Hume, Maribyrnong, and Bass, and Messrs. Isaacs and Kennedy, voting against him. But, on the 20th June, 1906, when a third election took place, he was defeated by twenty-one votes to twenty-eight, although the House had had experience of his abilities during more than two years, and Parliament was to expire in a few months. On that occasion he was defeated by a majority of seven. Nine pairs were recorded, so that altogether sixty-seven votes were accounted for. Surely, when a Chairman is defeated in the dying hours of a Parliament, after members have had two years' experience of his abilities, it is an indication that, in the opinion of the House, he has not given complete satisfaction. able member for Bass second his nomination on thc last occasion? could not get any one else. vernment had so small a following that they, I assume, had to call on the honourable member for Bass. member for Laanecoorie when he was defeated ? for Kennedy, the present Chairman of Committees.

I Intend to vote for him. the honourable member seems to be remarkably free from the caucus opinions of honourable members opposite. We are now, however, to have an affirmation of the principle of the spoils to the victor.

Is it such a statement as one would expect from the occupant of the Chair? WhilstI have expressed my opinions of the action of the Government, I am not going to regret it, because I feel that, as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow, so surely will their action recoil, boomerang-like, upon them.

I was, and I am still, perfectly content to accept any honourable member who is selected for the position. I think I have established the fact that on the precedent of the House of Commons the nomination lies with the majority of the House. at by seventeen members. arrived at, it is by majority of the House that the selection is made. seen from what I have read that honourable members opposite are now really putfour and his Tory friends in the British Parliament; but in England the Tory party displayed the right spirit, in their desire to maintain parliamentary institutions, and within six months, when in. a majority, proposed the very man they had before opposed. The naive confession of the honourable member for Mernda as to what he did yesterday, and why he did it, must be very illuminating to members of the House and the people of the country. able member attended a caucus meeting, yet he now declares that he never had the faintest idea that a caucus meeting was any other than what he ingenuously terms a ""political meeting."" On our side, too,,we learn something that astonishes us not a little, that a caucus is a meeting of persons of opposite opinions who say to one another, in the most casual way, ""You are going that way, and I am going this way ; let us take a vote to decide which way we shall go, and go together.'' The honourable member for Mernda, at,the meeting, proposed Dr. Carty Salmon as the Ministerial candidate for the Speakership, because he believed that gentleman to be the best man for the position. He was quite within his rights in so doing, and his attitude is so far absolutely unassailable. But what did he then do? He agreed that if the honourable member for Balaclava got more votes than Dr. Carty Salmon, he would not support the best man, but the next best man. member mean to say that if more votes had If there was a been cast against Dr. Carty Salmon than for him, he would still have supported that gentleman ? ported the honourable member for Balaclava. orable member for Memda has been in politics many years, and has denounced the caucus a hundred times; yet to-day he comes out with. a statement of principles which, I venture to say, would destroy him, or any other man, if he expressed -them on the public platform. The honourable member's idea of the caucus as a means of securing unanimity suggests a Christian, on his way to heaven, meeting a sinner going It will be to hell,' and saying to him, ""Look here, let us toss up to see which way we shall go, and then both go together."" It is beyond doubt that, unless the Christian has a double-headed penny, to hell he will go. The statements of the honourable member for Indi, the honourable member for Mernda, and the honourable member for Balaclava, have clearly established the fact that there was yesterday a caucus meeting of the ordinary kind for a most extraordinary purpose. The Prime Minister tells us that this was not a Government meeting. Of course it was not; it was a party caucus. It was exactly the same kind of caucus the Labour party have alThe honorways held on matters concerning its platform-that , and nothing less.

The honis all that keeps the Labour party to any determination; and there could be nothing more sacred or effective. votes to fifteen, or whatever the numbers were, the meeting yesterday decided to support Dr. Carty Salmon. On the Opposition side of the House there are thirty t odd votes, and on the other side there are thirty-nine, more or less. If the seventeen supporters of Dr. Carty Salmon 'compel twenty-two persons to vote against their convictions, it means that the Speaker is to be elected by seventeen members. places the prospective Speaker in a most invidious position. I believe that on one occasion I voted in favour of Dr. Carty Salmon, when he was a candidate for a position in the House; and I have absolutely no objection to him as a member of the House, and as one familiar with procedure in Committee. AllI say is that the House, in the most deliberate way, preSalmon; and the House, which took that step after experience, is supposed to know its own mind. The honourable member for Mernda has told us that we ought to follow the precedent of the House of Commons. It is quite true that in Englana the party in power usually put forward their man; but do they put forward a partisan? In the wjiole period covered by the history -quoted by the Attorney-General, from the time of Pitt until now, it has been almost the invariable practice in the House of Commons to nominate a man practically unknown. When Mr Gully was elected, he was elected by a House that hardly knew him. I am only speaking from memory, but of Brand, Peel, Gully, and Lowther, all but the last were almost unknown; and in every case the Speaker selected was not a partisan. The only time that the British Government attempted to elect a partisan they were beaten. tween a member of a party and a partisan. I myself never pretend to be anything more than a party man. Whatever virtues or defects lie in a strong supporter of a party, taching himself, once he got into the Chair, lie in me and men of my kind. It would be grossly improper, even if I were otherwise qualified, to place me in the Chair by the vote of a party. I have neither the temperament, the record, nor that reputation for impartiality, as essential as the actual virtue of impartiality itself. The Speaker is the presiding officer of the House. He must be above party. Sir. Hughes. ought not to owe his election to a party vote. That view which applies to every By seventeen House applies particularly to this House, and the present circumstances. The newspapers have lately been ringing with stories of furious party warfare of such a character that pairs, for the first time in the history of Parliament, have been refused. Under these circumstances, it would not be right or proper to elect Dr. Carty Salmon, who is a notorious partisan-whos e name was mentioned freely when the present Fusion This Ministry was formed, and who is well known as a man who is heart and soul behind that Fusion. Under the circumstances in which party warfare is carried on here, to place Dr. Carty Salmon in the Chair would be neither more nor less than to elevate a partisan to the dignity and position of chief officer of the House. A partisan, no matter what his intentions, cannot help seeing through the' glasses of party. McDonald is the only Chairman of Committees who has taken part in a party debate. last Wednesday and Thursday, Mr McDonald acted in a way towards his party and friends and supporters that no purely went out of his way, as it appeared to us, to prevent us from taking a certain step, and we were practically warring with his impartiality has never been questioned. McDonald is the only Chairman of Committees who, during his term of office, has taken part in a party debate on the floor of the House. fectly entitled to dissociate himself, as a I emphatically distinguish beof Committees; and he has contrived to carry out both functions in a way that leaves no room for criticism. There is no man who has been so singularly successful in defrom any of his old party associations, as the member fdr Kennedy. As I say, the House of Commons practice has always been for the party in power to select a man who has never made himself objectionable, or even prominent; and the effect has been to leave no room for the supposition that it was a case of spoils to the He an ex-Chairman of Committees who was",42,Opposition Members Hear Hear A

369,Victor. To Pass Over Mr Mcdonald For,"defeated is, on the very face of it, a party move. The Leader of the Opposition has put forward the reasonable proposition that we adjourn the debate to enable honourable members to confer, and arrive at that free selection the House should make. No honourable member will deny for a moment that, if a vote be taken now, we shall not get the Speaker whom the House desires. We simply have to choose between two men; and it will be a party vote pure and simple. The Prime Minister and the honourable member for Mernda have denied that the vote taken yesterday was a caucus vote; but in face of the facts such denial will not serve. I say most emphatically that the Labour caucus has never ventured to assert itself in regard to this question in any shape or form. Members of the Labour party enter this House absolutely untrammelled, free to vote for any candidate they please. said at Ballarat, only a little while ago, that he was quite aware that the Labour party were only bound to the programme, and not to other business that comes before the House; but to-day he has told us that, although we are not bound, we always vote together. If there is any objection to the caucus system, it is that members of a party are bound; and I say that, on the question before us, we are not bound, whereas the honourable member for Mernda, and every honourable member opposite who attended the meeting yesterday, are absolutely bound in honour to vote for Dr. Carty Salmon. The Labour party has never been bound in any other way than in honour, because what else is it to put your name at the foot of a document, even when the pledge comes into force? A man pledges his word, and is his word something different from his honour? Such contentions are only trifling and quibbling. The Prime Minister said he could not accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Wide Bay, because it came too late. Yet we now learn that the honourable member for Balaclava made the very same suggestion himself yesterday to the caucus. In face of such a revelation, what can we think of the Prime Minister's action? It is clearly an effort to carry this election, I shall not say. by a trick, but by something very like it. that, if the honourable member for Balaclava had known as much yesterday as he knows now, he would not have gone into that caucus at all, because he never had a show there, and he says that he will never go into another. The honourable member for Werriwa pointed out that five or six New South Wales members of the Fusion party were coming over in the train. Had they been present at the meeting, very likely somebody else would have been selected. Dr. Salmon is notoriously one of the supporters of the Deakin party. I will not say he was disappointed, but he was not selected as ""a member of the Ministry, and now, when the first vacancy comes, he gets it. What are we to think? What will the people outside think? Naturally, the honourable member is a partisan, he is a faithful follower; he is always present, and he gets the first vacant office. If it were a Ministerial office, I should have absolutely no objection, for he would deserve it ; but the presiding officer of this House ought to be a man The Prime Minister from whom every member on this side, as well as on that, can confidently expect an absolutely fair deal. We shall never get that from a partisan. If I were in the Chair, would members opposite consider that they were likely to get from me tliat fair and impartial consideration would not hear them. much in their favour. I should be prejudiced against them then only for reasons that God Almighty was responsible for. There are a number of gentlemen on the opposite side who everybody knows, had they been nominated, would have been chosen by the House without question or cavil. We have always opposed the honourable member for Parkes politically, from the inception of the Labour party. He has been our consistent and bitter opponent, yet no one would ever question his absolute impartiality. Nobody has questioned it. If I were in a Government, and had the power to put a man upon the Bench, I would just as soon put him there as any man I know, and stand my trial before him, civilly or criminally, because . I believe him to be fair and of a judicial cast of mind. It is now July, and we have to go through four months yet of a very stormy session. It is of no use to say that we have not, because we have, and I do say there will be required from the gentleman who occupies the Chair that tact and command of the House which can only come from one in whom every section has confidence. He must not only be impartial, but we must believe"" him to be so. And, of",43,Opposition Members Hear Hear A
370,Mr Wilks,The honourable member,44,Opposition Members Hear Hear A
371,Mr Hughes,"That would be verycourse, the House must believe that he is capable in every respect to hold the position. I do not hesitate to say that, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it would be very much better, even if Dr. Salmon should be ultimately selected, that the House should go into conference, decide upon a man, come back into the chamber, and proceed directly to elect him. morial that we could erect to the late Speaker be to have a dignified selection of his successor? to give the House the opportunity which it ought to have to choose its presiding officer without any caucus domination, I reached Melbourne only to-day, with five or six other members of mv party; ancl I am given to understand ""that the Labour party did not even consider the question as a party in any way. We have the assurance of our leader that our party will go into such a conference with an. absolutely open mind. dates. party has not made up its mind to do anything in the matter, and that it has come here with the single idea of getting the best man to preside over the deliberations of the House. In the circumstances, I beg to move That the election of a Speaker be not proceeded with until a conference of members foT the purpose of better ascertaining the feelings of the House has been held. I trust, Mr Clerk, that you will give the House an opportunity of voting upon that motion. I am certain that you will ransack your Parliamentary Practice in vainfor a precedent; but there are some circumstances so unique as the chairman of a public meeting. orable member that you, . Mr Clerk,, are practically in the same position as is the chairman of a public meeting. I see that the Standing Orders do not provide at all for this contingency. They simply direct that in a new Parliament the House shall proceed to elect a Speaker; a member is proposed, and if unopposed, is called to the chair; but, if not, a vote is taken. I submit that that is merely an indication of the way in which the Speaker is to be elected, and does not in any way curtail the ordinary methods of debate, or prevent the House from adjourning the debate. A motion for the adjournment of the debate is always in order, nor do the Standing Orders prevent us from moving the previous question. I have told you, Air. Clerk, that if you say that this motion is not in order, I shall be compelled either to move that the debate be adjourned, or, "" That this question be not now put,"" which is practically the same thing. The motion "" That this question be not now put,"" must always be in order when there is a motion before the House. That being so, it means that the question is open for discussion Ln the ordinary way, and subject to all the ordinary methods by which debates are conducted or adjourned. It has been adpropose to submit a motion. I mitted, most frankly and freely, that sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen gentlemen determined yesterday morning, or yesterday afternoon, to elect Dr. Salmon. Those gentlemen did not even constitute a majority of their own party. That is a most significant point. It means that they are now going to compel twenty-five other members of their own party to vote in the direction which they have decided to take. This occasion is.unique in. the history of the Federal Parliament. I doubt if a parallel can be found in the history of any other Parliament where feelings have been more bitter or where there has been more occasion for such feelings. Consider the circumstances in which the Fusion came into existence. It is composed of parties who, until a little while ago, were irreconcilably hostile It is now proposed to select one meinber of one of those parties which, a little while ago, we were supporting and which agreed to support us, and deliberately deserted us, and to put him in the chair over us. That ought not to be done except by the House itself in the freest and frankest possible way. ln the circumstances, my motion ought to be put, and the House should go into conference so that we may discuss amongst ourselves the claims of the various available men, particularly the honourable member for Balaclava. He stated on the floor of the House this afternoon that, although he felt compelled by his action of yesterday to withdraw, he would, but for that, be a candidate for the office. Of that honourable member, I know nothing but what is good; but I wish to especially emphasize the fact that he has never been a party men.

In the circumstances, we ought to be allowed to choose freely any one of the members who are available for the position. whom we can appeal upon the motion of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney; but I submit, with confidence, that probably the first part of it is in order. "" That this sitting be'now adjourned,"" and by agreement, I think that can be now put; but beyond that, there is no possible warrant for the addition of any condition whatever. for the adjournment of the debate.

When I think of the manner in which the business of the House has been conducted ever since I have had the privilege of being a member, when I consider the many virtues exhibited by the late Speaker, it hurts me to feel that we are having imposed on us a course derogatory to the high standard of procedure which obtained under his direction. The one consideration which should guide us in this very important matter is the fitness of candidates to occupy the high and exalted position of Speaker.

Should such a majority prevent us from doing what is necessary to choose a Speaker whom we can respect and obey, as a model of dignity and justice? The honourable member for Wentworth says that we need not so much a Speaker who will act justly, as one who will be able to control the House. The late Speaker was a man who could act justly, and who could control the House as probably no other man will be able to do. He will be an example to all his successors. I ask whether the candidate whom the caucus majority of seventeen wishes to force upon us acted in such a way, when Chairman of Committees, as to win the confidence even of those who now, for party reasons, support him? Not only did members on this side suffer injustice at his hands; members opposite, as the Hansard records will show, were also conscious of it, and felt impelled to take revenge when he had next to submit himself for election. sessional appointments. now whether the Chairman of Committees should be elected for the session, or for the Parliament. The sessional election has this advantage, that a man who has not acted well can be got rid of before he has lost all power to control our proceedings. When an honourable member is elected to such an office for the life of a Parliament, and proves unfit for the position, honourable members have a very rough row to hoe. The honourable member for Laanecoorie is a party man. beck and call of the Prime Minister, whose shadow he has been, so to speak, ever since I have been in this Parliament. As a member of the State Parliament he haunted him in the same way.

In such circumstances, I for one McDonald is not a party man ? ister of Defence to point to one case in which the honourable member for Kennedy, as Chairman of Committees, has displayed a partisan spirit. On the other hand, I can point to two cases in which most deliberate attempts were made by the honourable member* whom the Minister of Defence is now supporting for the office of Speaker to .be unjust to honourable members. How can honourable members be expected to pay to the Chair that respect which is its due when the House has forced upon it the presidency of an honourable member of that character. I feel it necessary to make these statements before a candidate is actually elected, for after the election has taken place, I shall continue to respect the position apart altogether from the honourable member who occupies it. I shall endeavour to do my duty, and to assist the Chair to carry on the business of the House in a fair, honourable, and dignified manner. I shall do that even if Dr. Carty Salmon be elected. Although, when he occupied a junior position, he did not always deal leniently with me, I have not allowed that to influence my decision in this case; I have shown no personal bitterness towards him. My sole contention is that he is too strong a party man to be elected to the office of Speaker. It does not speak well for some honourable members opposite that the attractions of the lofty position of Speaker are not sufficient to induce them to forsake their private businesses in order to discharge the duties associated with it. There are some honourable members opposite whose candidature would be almost unanimously supported, but we have had an experience of the honourable member for Laanecoorie as Chairman of Committees which is exactly the opposite of that which would commend his selection. We have reached a critical stage in the history of this House. There has never He is practically at the been such a clear-cut division of parties as there is to-day.

388,Mr Webster,"Despit e all that hassupport of the action taken by the Government, but I do not. hesitate to say that there is absolutely no precedent for it. Tliere is no case in history where an attempt has been.made to foist upon a House as President or Speaker an honourable member who, during his occupancy of a junior position, has shown himself to be absolutely unfit for the higher office. As showing how paltry-minded is the honourable member for Laanecoorie, I would' remind honourable members of an occasion when I rose to make a few remarks, and had not heen speaking for five minutes when the honourable member, who was then Chairman of Committees, ruled me out of order for tedious repetition. says that it. is a pity that Dr. Salmon is not in the chair now, because the honourable member has said all this before. ber is fast becoming a very fair imitation of the Minister of Defence, in trying to attribute to honourable members statements that they have not made. larrikin of the Government! In the case to which I have just referred, no question of parliamentary procedure was involved. The honourable member, as Chairman of Committees, had simply ito exercise his judgment in determining whether or not I was in order. I have since spoken at far greater length in this House, but neither in this nor in the State Parliament of New South Wales have I been ruled out of order for tedious repetition, save in the instance I have mentioned. The incident shows the paltry spirit of the honourable member, since he was prepared to resort to such a subterfuge in order to rule out of order an honourable member of a party to which he was opposed. support the honourable member do so with their eyes open. There is no precedent for electing as Speaker an honourable member who has filled the position of 'Chairman Of Committees in such an unsatisfactory manner as Dr. Carty Salmon has done. All the authorities quoted by honourable members opposite, therefore, go for nought. The honourable member for Mernda quoted from the British Hansard to show what took place in the House of Commons when Mr Gully was first nominated for the position of Speaker. That quotation practically supported the position we now take up. Mr Gully, who was colourless in politics and to whom therefore no objection could be taken as a party man, was supported by the Liberal party. The Tory party objected to a Government nomination, but Mr Gully was elected. A few -.months later, when he stood for re-election, all party feeling vanished. He had shown his fitness for the office, and honourable members unanimously re-elected him to the office that he had so honorably filled. We should be prepared to act in a similar manner towards the honourable member for Laanecoorie had he honoured the position that we conferred on him some time ago. It is right that an honourable member who has filled with satisfaction an important office should be re-elected to it, and it follows as a natural corollary that an honourable member who has shown partiality as a Chairman of Committees should not be elected as Speaker. I do not wish to labour this question. I have expressed my opinions, as I generally do, fearlessly, believing that every honourable member should speak that which is within him. We should have a far better Parliament if we had more outspokenness and! less of the desire to cover up one's true feelings and opinions by a multitude of words. I feel that this House is not going to be what it has been if it is to be controlled by a gentleman of the type and character I have indicated ; and it is because I have fears for the good order and dignity of the House that I have made these observations. [7.53] I thought that it would have been unnecessary for me to speak to this question; that honourable members would have agreed to the adjournment of the debate in order that an open conference might be held, at which a satisfactory decision could be arrived at. Had that .course been Those who adopted an amicable settlement of the difficulty could have been made, and we could have returned to the House and made the appointment of a Speaker a formal matter. But since the powers that be have determined that that course should not be adopted, it behoves honourable members generally to speak to this question in justice, not only to ourselves, but to those whom we represent. As a new member, I have sat under only one Speaker. I refer to the late Sir Frederick Holder, in whom I found one to whopi I ' could confidently appeal for advice and guidance, ancl from whom we all obtained in that respect more than we might reasonably have expected.",47,Opposition Members Hear Hear A

I should have liked to feel that his successor, while, perhaps, having a very high example to live up to, would be one who could be accepted, if not unanimously, at any 'rate, by a large majority. The Government made one of the greatest of blunders in holding a caucus meeting to decide whom they thought the best man, without giving the Opposition an opportunity to agree with , that decision. We have been told that we, of the Opposition, are a caucus party, and our method is spoken of with marked disapproval by honourable members opposite; and yet, when the opportunity presents itself, they adopt the same method. I am sure that members on all sides of the House would like -to see this matter settled, because there is at present no authority to restrain any member from speaking innumerable times-ther e is no finality.

The same vote cannot be taken again. The voting was equal on each side. That is a position from which you, Mr Clerk, must extricate yourself as best you can. I submit that the only way in which the Prime Minister can act with credit to himself and due regard to the dignity of the House, is to do what half the members of the House in a division desired should be done, and what not only common sense and good taste suggest, but equity and reason dictate-ad journ the debate, and endeavour to come to a decision in the way indicated. I hope the Prime Minister will take that course. If he declines to take it, he does so after every warning, and after an expression of opinion of the clearest possible kind, not only by men on this side, but by men on that, that we are to have a party vote, carrying out a decision arrived at by a Ministerial caucus. We only ask that the vote shall be a fair expression of the opinion of the House, and I hope that the Prime Minister will see his way clear to agree to it. House sympathizes with the position in which the Clerk has been placed. He has an extremely difficult duty to perform, and is loyally endeavouring to discharge it. May I suggest to my honourable and learned friend, and to the House, that it is not necessary to raise or answer the question of the right of the Clerk to exercise all the [62] 1 powers of a Chairman who is an elected member of the House? The question is and, there being an equal vote on either carried. The House is, therefore, in statu quo. It is in exactly the same position as before that motion was moved. In those circumstances, it is surely not necessary to appeal to the Clerk to decide whether he can vote or not. The only course to be followed is to proceed with the consideration of the motion, and-if honourable members will consent-to a vote at once. last vote is another indication that the wrong procedure was taken by the Prime Minister and his party in connection with the election of a Speaker. I took the opThere were thirty-one portunity, at the earliest possible moment, of saying, on behalf of this side, that we were prepared to withdraw all our candidates and enter into a conference with honourable members opposite, with a view to the election of a successor to our late lamented Speaker. That course has net been taken, for reasons known to honourable members opposite. The party which I have the honour to lead, and which has been designated the Caucus partya name which I do not wish to disclaim-hel d no caucus, and came to no decision on this matter, and every member of it is entitled to vote just as he wishes: I make that statement in reply to the assertion of the Prime Minister that we always vote solidly, whether we are bound by our pledges to our constituents or not.

He is now proceeding to speak upon the general question, which he has no right to do, inasmuch as he has done it already. proceed, after the little display of the Minister of Defence. I have not taken part in the debate from the party point of view, nor do T intend to. I say again that members on this side are quite prepared to withdraw every nomination, and to leave honourable members absolutely free from any party ties to vote for the choice of the united House. I believe that is the best way to get out of this difficulty. proceed with the business that was previously before us, because no motion for the adjournment of the debate can succeed unless it is supported by a majority. There was simply a tie, consequently there was no majority for the motion, and the debate is not adjourned. in the Standing Orders of the Senate that the President and Chairman of Committees honourable member cannot quote it here. levant were shut out of this debate, a good deal of what the honourable member has said to-night would not have been allowed. The Senate Standing Orders provide that the President and Chairman of Committees shall respectively, in all cases, be entitled to a vote, and that when the voting is equal, the question shall pass in the negative, but no such provision applies in this Chamber. If you are to contend that when the voting is equal the question passes in the negative, you mav find vourself, Mr for the rights of an Opposition, but toClerk, deciding who shall and who shall not be Speaker. It may happen that the COOK -My honourable voting on the motion that Dr. Carty Salmon be elected Speaker will be thirty-one votes on each side. quotation is against his own side. wanted a provision of that kind in our Standing Orders, it seems to me that it would have been there already. As it is am not accusnot there, it is evidently omitted for some reason. If , Mr Clerk, you are to decide that equal votes pass the question in the negative, we may have the same voting repeated when Dr. Salmon's name is put to the House, and you may decide that he shall not be Speaker. I submit that that is not contemplated, nor is it contemplated that you shall decide any other question when the votes are equal. we are unanimously of the opinion, as stated by the Prime Minister, that when there is an equal number of votes on either side, we are in statu quo, and the debate goes on. The honourable member for West Sydney, however, rightly objects to the Clerk giving a vote. The Clerk is not a member, and it ought not to appear in the records of the House that the motion was negatived. It was not negatived. The affirmative was not carried, and the debate goes on as before. The CLERK -As has been said, there is no necessity for me to give a decision upon the question of a casting vote. The motion unquestionably has not been carried, in that it has not received a majority of votes in its favour, apart from anything that may be said with regard to the exercise of a casting vote. [8.23] I desire to submit myself to the The will of the House. If everything that is irrenot understand that the debate is yet closed. I desire to join with others in entering a protest against the way in which the Government have conducted this very important matter. The honourable member for Hume termed them the "" Confusion "" Government, and I think, in view of what we have seen to-night, that that name is very appropriate.

428,Mr Spence (Darling) [8.24],"I doLeader of the Opposition, but has actually asserted that it was the duty of the Leader of the Opposition to come to him. How could the Leader of the Opposition even dream that the Government, although we had not a high opinion of them, would consent to the selection of the Speaker of this 'House by seventeen men at most, according to what we have been told? The position is that seventeen members are to foice upon the House some one whom the majority of the House do not approve. A great deal has been said in denunciation of the caucus methods of the Labour party. Buti f that party conducted its procedure in the way in which the Ministerial party has done in this matter, I should sever my connection with it, because I should be ashamed of it. The members of the Labour party would not be asked to settle a matter of this kind in caucus. No caucus decision regarding any matter that is not a plank of the party's platform is binding on our members. however, has led innocent followers, like the honourable member for Mernda, into a trap. That honourable member was induced to attend what he was told was a political meeting, and did not know until it was over that it was a caucus, and that he was bound by its decision. Surely he was not quite so innocent that he did not know the object of the meeting. The desire of the Government was clearly to limit the nominations from the Ministerial side to one. The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have claimed that the Government has the right to nominate the Speaker in the case of a vacancy. There must have been more than one candidate on the Ministerial side, because a ballot had to be taken to determine who should be nominated. The honourable member for Balaclava has told us this afternoon that he cannot submit himself to the will of the House, because his name went to the ballot of the caucus. Had he stood for Speaker in this Chamber, a majority would have voted for him. Honrable members of the Labour party are prepared to support candidates belonging to the Ministerial party; but we wish to choose a man on whom we can rely. The Government, however, is going to force on us a candidate for whom only seventeen members voted in caucus. Some of these were evidently coerced. We hear of members being bound only in honour to vote for the caucus decision; but what higher obligation could there be? No member could be com[62]2 pelled by physical force to do anything of the kind. To call yesterday's caucus a political meeting is ridiculous. The term is applicable only to large .public meetings on political questions. The Ministerial caucus prevents the House from choosing the man whom it thinks best fitted for the position of Speaker. We were told that one of the reasons for the fusion which supports the present Ministry was to get rid of caucus government, and yet the first important step that has been taken by Ministerialists is the holding of a caucus to prevent a majority of the House from deciding who shall fill its highest office. This is outrageous. I did not think that the Government would have descended to these depths. It is right that this action should be exposed to the country. The honourable member for Parramatta, when on this side of the Chamber, always strongly asserted the right of the Opposition to make public the wrong-doing of the Government. I hope that this long discussion will show The Prime Minister, Ministers that there is a wiser ancl a better plan to follow. It is a great pity that the Prime Minister did not informally consult the Leader of the Opposition, with a view to a mutual arrangement between all parties. The Labour party wishes to see partisanship abolished in the election of the Speaker. It is not pleasant to have to publicly criticise a candidate for this position; but such criticism is forced upon us by the circumstances. The Ministerial candidate would not be acceptable to a majority of honourable members were they free to vote in accordance with their own opinions. Had the honourable member for North Sydney been willing to stand, he would have had the support of a large majority. The present arrangement has an uncommonly ugly appearance. It would seem that the Government holds the view that the nomination to the Speakership is in its gift, by way of reward to a follower.. This should not be so. The best thing-to do would be to put aside all that has taken place up to the present time, and start afresh, leaving honourable members to vote for whichever candidate they think best fitted for the position. mitting to the caucus. should not be decided by caucus procedure.

No one knows what was the ballot at the Government caucus except the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Franklin. is wrong again. be if I were standing on the honourable member's head. Then there is the honourable member for Bourke, who is always condemning Labour methods. honourable members are "" as good as Labour men,"" as they claim to be of the honourable member's breed in our party; we have none of his tribe amongst us. The honourable member is sitting where he ought to sit. Those who claim to be as good as the Labour man should sit with the honourable member for Fawkner and the honourable member for Flinders; but they will have to explain later on why they are sitting there. I urge the Minister of Defence, as the second in command of the Commonwealth ship of State, to take the advice tendered by the Leader of the Labour party. Although we are his political foes, surely we have some brains! The honourable member, when Leader of the Opposition, was constantly pleading his cause. No one has filled the pages of Hansard with more "" trip e "" than he has done, and now he blames us for doing the same thing. The honourable member condemns us for doing what he himself has done, and, going further, he accuses us of blocking business. But what were the present members of the Ministerial party doing a year or two ago, when they kept the House sitting for two or three days and nights, necessitating an adjournment at midnight on Saturday? tion of Standing Orders. those Standing Orders, the Government are afraid to enforce them. It is not too late even now to give the House an opportunity to choose the Speaker; and when he is so chosen, no one will be more loyal to him than honourable members on this side. gret very much that the election of Speaker should not have been unanimous, and, even now, if the Prime Minister consents to an adjournment, and there is a little consultation, that desirable result may be brought about. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has suggested that all candidates should be withdrawn and a conference held; and I should be prepared to go a little further, and say that the Opposition will surrender any claim to suggest names from their own side. I in no way object to the majority in the House selecting a Speaker. of the honourable member ! a majority, and can do what they like, whether I object or not; but, as I ' say, I see no objection to a Government with a majority behind them selecting a Speaker from their own side. I know that if my party were on the Government side, and we were in a majority, 1 should think it only fair, if there was a suitable man amongst us, to select a Speaker from the supporters of the Government. At the same time, it is only wise to endeavour to select a gentleman who has the. confidence of honourable members on both sides, and there would be absolutely no difTiculty""""in getting such a gentleman from the Government benches. It goes without saying that Dr. Carty Salmon cannot possibly have the confidence of the House, because he has already been tried, and found wanting. He was removed from the position of Chairman of 'Committees by a majority of the House, a number of honourable members who had previously voted for him, recording their votes against him on the second occasion. There is no precedent in any Legislative Assembly in the world showing that a person has been re-elected under such circumstances, though I can quite understand that a Chairman of Committees in the case of a majority on the other side, after a general election, being rejected without any reflection on his capabilities. But in the case of Dr. Carty Salmon honourable members actually changed their votes, although on each occasion he had received Ministerial nomination. It may be that Dr. Carty Salmon, in spite of all protests, and of all that has been said, may be elected Speaker; but I am a party man, and, for some reasons, I am glad at some of the happenings of the last day or two. .Honourable members opposite, ancl especially one or two, are prone to charge the Labour party with being",54,Opposition Members Hear Hear A

453,I F These Mr Thomas,"The Government haveassociated with the worse forms of Tammany Hall politics; and I have here a newspaper report of an interview with the honourable member for Bourke, published: in the Age, from which the following is an extractIncidentally I claimed that the caucus system gards it as unwise to have a partisan, and of the Labour party interfered with personal libertv and political freedom; and the instance I gave related to the overthrow of the Deakin Government when, as is well known, a substantial minority of the Labour party was against any change; but, a majority in caucus having determined to put the Government out, all members were compelled to vote the one way. If it be a fact that, as a Labour party, we interfere with personal liberty and political freedom, because, when we meet together, the minority may decide to go with the majority, it appears to me that the Ministerial party who meet in caucus or "" political meeting,"" are open to the same charge. When the Labour party meet together it is a caucus, but when there is a gathering of honprable members opposite, called together by the Leader of the Government, it is a "" political meeting,"" according to the member for Ballarat. That reminds me that when Mr in my mind was rather severe on the honGladstone was attacked bn his Egyptian policy, and reference was made to the fact that General Gordon was surrounded in Khartoum, the honourable gentleman replied that General Gordon was not surrounded, but was only hemmed in. From it mere party stand-point, I am glad of this discussion, because we, on this side, will be able in the future to go on the platform and ask the people of the country whether it is consistent to charge us with hampering personal liberty and political freedom, while those who claim to be in favour of the most perfect liberty ancl freedom adopt exactly the same means of consulting with one another. charge ! ber is now a party of one, but when he was the whip of a party in this House, I suppose he used to attend party meetings in the same way. "" honourable member used to get his instructions from the Prime Minister? please.'' and under such circumstances, I do not wonder that the right honourable member for East Sydney"" threw up the sponge "" when he met the House after the recess, though I always believed that it was because of the Ballarat speech of the present Prime Minister. The honourable member for West Sydney, while he has no objection to a party man as Speaker, rehe gave some instances in support of his views. I think the honourable member might have cited a strong case, seeing that when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who was a member of the Ministry, was anxious to be Speaker, Sir William Harcourt, who was the leader of the House, refused to allow him to be nominated on the ground that, as a meinber of the Government, he must have necessarily taken part in heated discussions as a partisan. I admit I am not very sorry that this discussion has taken place, and that certain articles have appeared in the Age, a newspaper which has suggested that no one who is tainted with Free Trade principles can receive anything.at the hands of the Government. 11 that be so, it makes no difference to me; but, while I think the article I have orable member for Parkes, it may prove of advantage from a party stand-point. However, so far as this Government is concerned, we are told that "" No Free Traders need apply."" One or two have suggested that in some way consideration might be given to the Opposition, but personally 1 ask no consideration from the Government. If the Government choose to thrust Dr. Carty Salmon upon us as Speaker, well and good. We shall have to put up with it, and do the best we can to muddle through in some way or other. The honourable member for Balaclava stated that he was, in a sense, trapped into the caucus. I should have I shall be free of that thought that a man of his age ought not to have been so trapped. However, he was simple and confiding, and was trapped into taking part in it. Had he known a little of the wire-pulling that had been going on, and the ability which some of those who were competing with him had for that kind of thing, he would possibly not have done what he did. I have here a quotation from a speech of the honourable member for Ballarat, in which he refers to having been "" trapped '-' into voting against the Watson Government -""trapped "" into voting out of office a Government that ought to have been allowed to stay there a little longer"".

459,Mr Thomas,"With such a whip,are the Prime Minister's words. I doubt very much if he was trapped, but I have his word for it, and if one so skilled and able was placed in that position, he might have some little compassion on the honourable member for Balaclava, and allow him to be freed from any caucus pledge, or from responsibility for anything that took place in the caucus of yesterday. After all that has been said, and after the last vote, where half the members present voted for delaying the matter, which practically meant that every one of them was against the honourable member for Laanecoorie taking the chair, if the honourable member still persists in his candidature, I do not envy him the position of Speaker. Sixty-two members voted in that division, and that, ordinarily, is a very fair House. I am sure, if pairs had been granted during the last few weeks, it would have been a very rare thing to see sixty-two members taking part in a division in this Chamber, so that there was a remarkably good House present. Thirty-one of the sixty-two practically voted against Dr. Carty Salmon taking the chair. who voted against the motion only did so because of the caucus decision. they were in honour bound on account of the caucus, which some of them said they were trapped into. If Dr. Salmon, after such a vote as that, and after the expressions of opinion about him, and the fear which many of us have that he will not be able to conduct the business of the House fairly, is still prepared to take the position, it rather emphasizes my opinion that he is not qualified to hold it. I am certain that the honourable member for Parkes or the honourable member for North Sydney, if they had been nominated and the same feeling had been shown against them, would never ^ave dreamt of continuing their candidatuic. If the honourable member for Laanecoorie does so, it proves that he is not qualified to be Speaker. If he does take the position, and falsifies cur predictions, so much the better for him, and so much the better for the country. [9.16] I regret that I have had to witness the scenes that have taken place in this Chamber to-night. I regret it the more because it follows upon the demise of a gentleman who was respected and honoured on all sides of the House. If a little more consideration had been shown to the whole of the members of the House, whose interests are at stake in this matter, this unseemly procedure might easily and readily have been avoided. Those who are responsible for the present state of affairs would have very much better consulted the dignity of the House, and the best interests of this Democratic institution of Parliament, and their position as leaders of it, had they shown a little more consideration to honourable members on this side. The filling of the Speaker's chair is a. matter of concern to all of us. It has not been regarded as a party matter ih times gone by, and the custom in Great Britain, which on these occasions we usually follow, has been largely in the direction of removing the question from party prejudices and party interests to the higher plane of questions in which the whole House is concerned, and in which, as far as possible, the greatest unanimity should prevail. I do not know why a departure has been made from that old practice, unless the Government have decided to adopt an American, rather than a British, system, which is known as "" the spoils to the victors,"" and, because they happen to have a majority on that side of the House, to coerce that majority, the selection made not meeting with its unanimous approval, into endorsing it by a caucus decision. Knowing that they can command a majority vote, tlie Government are prepared to confer this high and distinguished office upon a certain gentleman, regardless of whether he is or is not acceptable to a very large section of the House. I regret that we are substituting a doubtful American practice for the good old British practice that has heretofore obtained. Even at this late hour, after all the unseemly proceedings that have taken place, the Government might well reconsider their position and retrace their steps. By so doing, although they cannot repair all that' has been done to-day, they may do a great deal to rectify the mistake which was made at the outset. The Leader of the Opposition was not consulted in any way in connection with the proposed appointment. That is a practice which has always been recognised as part and parcel of the non-party character of such questions as this. When the question of electing a Speaker in our first and second Parliaments arose, the courtesy was always paid to the Leader of the Opposition of consulting him. To-day we have witnessed a departure from that",56,Opposition Members Hear Hear A
460,Mr Hughes,And a number of those,57,Opposition Members Hear Hear A
461,Mr Thomas,"Yes, they pleaded that",57,Opposition Members Hear Hear A
462,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare),"procedurea departure marked by incidents that are no credit to the House, and that, I trust, will never be repeated. Despite all that has happened, the Government would be well-advised to agree to adjourn the debate and to arrange a consultation with the Leader of the Opposition under the quietening influences of the next few hours. I have every confidence that if that were done, judging by the promises that have been made from this side of the House, the outcome would be an arrangement that would wipe out a great deal of the bitter feeling that has been engendered, and place in the chair a gentleman who would be selected, not as the result of a party vote, on the policy of the spoils to the victors, or by a minority vote in his own party, but by practically a unanimous vote of the whole House. We are told by the press that the votes cast for Dr. Carty Salmon in the Ministerial caucus yesterday afternoon totalled only seventeen. There were on the train in which I arrived from Sydney to-day a number of members of that party, who had no opportunity of expressing their views in the caucus, and, so far as we could learn from them, they knew nothing about the arrangement until they landed here. All these are incidents which 1 think that those who are leading the House will be glad in calmer moments to forget. The best way to forget them, and to wipe them out altogether, is to allow an adjournment to take place, to arrange the consultation that has been spoken of, and to meet the House on another day with such a proposition that whoever goes into the high position of Speaker will have the respect and support of the majority of honourable members. In that way a majority will feel that they have had a say in determining who shall fili the position, and will be prepared to abide by the decision, and give the successful candidate that moral and generous support without which it will be impossible for him to discharge his high and important duties in anvthing like a satisfactory way. That is something worth striving for; a course that will be in the interests of the orderly procedure of this House. I fail to see how that desirable feeling which will maintain order and assist in the conduct of the business of the Chamber, with as little friction as possible, can be secured by adopting and forcing upon the House a caucus decision. I stronglv urge the adoption of the suggestion that we should retrace our steps in favour of a procedure which would secure the election of a Speaker who will have the support, not of a section, but of the whole House. If this is done, the occupant of the chair will have an easier task than will fall to him if we proceed as the Government desires. Of course, if the Government insists that the nominee of the Ministerial caucus shall be chosen, we, on this side, although feeling that we have a grievance, and that the person who has been chosen is likely to be warped by party feeling, will respect his office, and give him all reasonable assistance in the proper discharge of his functions. But there will be imposed on us restraints and conditions which have not hitherto been, and should never be, imposed on any party. I hope that the request for an adjournment will be granted, and that a friendly conference will be held between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, with a view to securing a Speaker, who will be generally acceptable, so that our business may be conducted in a manner creditable to' the House. If the Government insists on ignoring the wishes of the Opposition, and even of some of its supporters, and insists on the selection of its nominee, it must take the responsibility. It is generally recognised that, on the occurrence of a vacancy in the Speakership, the Chairman of Committees has first claim to consideration. This claim has been recognised in the Parliaments of the States. But the present Chairman of Committees belongs to the Labour party, and as the fusion of two other previously hostile and diametrically opposed parties has been brought about to secure our destruction, we can hardly expect that that procedure will be followed now. The Leader of the Opposition will not insist on the election of the Chairman of Committees to the Speakership. All he asks is that the members of the Opposition shall be taken into the confidence of the Government, and given an opportunity to select the most suitable man available for the position. We are prepared to set aside the moral claims of the Chairman of Committees, who belongs to our party, in order, in the interests of the House, to secure an amicable settlement of the difficulty. A Speaker unanimously chosen will be able to 3.*: charge the functions of his office much better than one who has had to encounter the severe criticism and opposition of a considerable number of honourable members. If we are compelled to have a division, many will vote against the Government nominee because of their past experience of his actions in the chair, while some will have to do so as a protest against the objectionable method which has been adopted in this case, and which has resulted in forcing on the House the choice of a small number of Government supporters. I have heard Ministerialists criticise the Labour party for its caucus methods, but we have never applied those methods to a position of this kind. During the fifteen years that I have been a member of the party, the caucus has never been used to promote the interests of .any one ol its members individually in the way in which the Ministerial caucus was used yesterday. A caucus decision is never taken by the Labour party in respect to any matter upon which its members are not pledged to their electors. If a matter is only remotely, and not specifically, related to the policy of the party, any member can object to having to vote on it in caucus, and his right to do so will be acknowledged and respected by his fellows. With honourable members opposite it seems to be different. I imagine that the reason is that they adopted the methods of the Labour pary without knowing what they really are. By the vote of seventeen at a caucus meeting in which the whole of their party was not present, they are dictating to the remaining fifty-seven members of the Chamber. Never in the history of the Labour movement has such a thing been done by the Labour party. Such action would not be tolerated on this side. The. Ministerialists have made a crude and objectionable application of the caucus methods. Hitherto the Chair has been filled by a gentleman who gave every satisfaction to the House. He conducted our business with so great a. knowledge of parliamentary procedure, and practice that his decisions cculd not be questioned, and no suspicion of partiality ever, attached to them. He was appronchahle by all. and was the philosopher, friend, and guide to every one of us, irrespective of party. Those who were new to parliamentary life, and had vet to learn the principles of procedure, found him ever ready to divine their difficulties, and to give them the beneAs soon as I had an opportunity, I stated fit of great experience and well-seasoned advice. The best honour we can show to him, in appreciation of his talent and ability, is that suggested by the honourable member for Dalley; to elect one who will worthily fill the position which he occupied with so great credit to himself and with such advantage to the House. Mr Thomas Brown. That is a highly desirable objective, for which we should strive, not only as an expression of our appreciation of the work of the man who has gone, but as the best means of starting the parliamentary machine under a new Speaker with a minimum instead of a maximum degree of friction, such as will certainly be the outcome of the election if it be carried out on the lines proposed by the Government. Before we go to a vote, I wish to enter a most emphatic protest against the action of the Government in departing from the recognised practice ancl procedure, and in deciding, by means of a party caucus, to bind their members to vote for a particular representative as Speaker, without consulting in any way the other parties in the House. I make that protest for the reason that the Government are laying down a new procedure and a bad one. This course has been followed by a party consisting of a majority of the House, and it reflects no credit on them. Indeed, through the Government, such an action reflects upon the whole House. We have had the statement that long before we met to express our regret at the death of the late Speaker, the Government had summoned their followers to a caucus, to decide by a party vote that a party man should be his successor. Such indecent haste must go home to the hearts of the people, who have been told again and again in the press, and by some supporters of the Government, that the demise of the late Speaker was, to some extent, caused by the action of certain honourable members on this side of the House. I am not going to say that the choice of the Government is a reward for party services, but we have the statement of some honourable members who attended the Government caucus that, but for the binding pledge which, under a misapprehension, they gave there, the selection of a Speaker would be very different from that which is likely to be made. That charge, of course, lies on the Government. that I was ready, on behalf of the party I have the honour to lead, to withdraw all candidates proposed from this side, and to take part in a free conference, with the object of securing the best presiding officer who could be selected to succeed our . late Speaker. That offer has. not been .accepted, and we cannot",57,Opposition Members Hear Hear A
463,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay) [9.41],"control the House further than we have attempted to do. The discussion has elucidated many points, and I can say that, in no circumstances, was the question of a party nomination ever discussed by the party which I lead. Although on Monday we met casually and talked over the matter, no one name was mentioned, and no member of our party was bound. Even at the present moment no member of our party is bound to vote for the honourable member for Kennedy, or for any one else. To that he was not exceedingly anxious to be nominated for the oflice of Speaker, if a thoroughly representative member of the House could be secured for the post; but I and some of his friends think that in the matter of ability, dignity, and services rendered to this Chamber, he ranks second to none of those who have been nominated.

Personally, I never had a speech reprinted with cross headings until I delivered my speech in the recent no-confidence debate, and only on two occasions have I ever had a speech reprinted at all.

474,Mr Spence (Darling) [10.3],"I hadcross-headings. These cross-headings are charged for as the printing is charged for j and, unless there is some reason which at present we do not appreciate, I cannot see why the practice should not be permitted. The reprints are not issued as from Hansard, but as reprints of speeches on certain subjects. I may say that the Government Printer follows a very proper rule, and stipulates that the cross-headings shall be parliamentary, and, avoiding comment, merely emphasize the subject of the various portions of the matter. If the Treasurer has given the instructions indicated, I hope that they will be withdrawn or modified. Ac a matter of fact, the speeches of honor1 able members are not sufficiently circulated, -*>eing that the press do not, and, indeed, cannot, be expected to report them fully. Under the circumstances, the electors are confined to what they can hear from the platform, and it is highly desirable that they should be kept well informed, always having regard to the safeguard adopted by the Government Printer. Violet Town, in my electorate, there is an aged naturalized foreigner who has lost his naturalization paper, and because of that has been refused an old-age pension. I ask the Treasurer whether' he can see his way to give a direction to .the magistrate to have a search made so that it may be ascertained definitely whether the man is naturalized. There is in my electorate a similar case to. that cited by the honourable member for Echuca; and I think it could be met by having a search made of the Victorian archives. I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, sir, on the position to which you have been elected. When you wake to-morrow morning, I am sure that it will be with the full determination to hold the scales absolutely fairly. I feel confident that we shall have your sympathy, because your heart is on your left, and we are on the left of you. We are on the eve of great changes, and hope to build up a civilization which will be the boast of the world; and I trust that you will consult the necessary authorities in order to find out whether you cannot avoid going to the tail of a horse in order to find a head decoration, which is at once ungainly ancl useless. the recent changes made by the Minister of Defence, at the instance, I suppose, of the Military Board, he has transferred an officer holding the position of Commandant in Western Australia to the position of head of the Quartermaster-General's Department in New South Wales. I offer no comment on the capacity of the officer mentioned; but 1 desire to know on what ground these changes have been made. So far, in the history of the Commonwealth Forces, officers holding high appointments have been moved up, but in this case, an officer has been moved down to a position of inferior prestige, but vastly greater responsibilities, because he is occupying now the chief position in a branch of by far the largest section of the defence forces of the Commonwealth, whereas previously he was occupying the position of general supervisor of the smallest section of the forces. Australia is the least numerous with the exception of those of Tasmania and Thursday Island. I wish to ask the Minister of Defence by what method these changes are made, and whether he will in the near future take into consideration the advisability of inquiring into the fitness of all officers holding these high appointments throughout Australia, with a view to seeing that only those who are well qualified to hold them shall be allowed to retain them. [10.n] I wish to emphasize the point raised by the honourable member for Yarra regarding the reprinting of political addresses. The reprints are paid for by honourable members, and if sub-headings are inserted, it is simply to indicate the different sections of the'speech. The whole cost of inserting them in the Government Printing Office is borne by the members who order the reprints. The practice therefore involves no cost to the Treasury, or to any one beyond the member directly interested. I understand that the Government Printer also exercises a certain amount of discretion regarding the headings. He sees that they are not objectionable, and"" that they are pertinent to the subject to which they are attached. The House is entitled to an explanation of why the Treasurer should interfere by instructing the Government Printer not to insert sub-headings. A number of honourable members have received an intimation from the Government Printer that if they require reprints of their addresses, although they pay for them, they cannot have sub-headings inserted, even though they are prepared to pay for",61,Members Major Genenal He Has Cross Headings I Did See One O F

I should like to ask the Treasurer if this is the first step towards carrying out that policy. It certainly is an interference with rights which honourable members have enjoyed for the last four or five years, and it has the effect of making their addresses less readable and intelligible their privileges as members of Parliament from their point of view, although the value of sub-headings may be a matter of opinion. I presume, however, that members would not pay for them unless they considered them of"" some advantage. Apparently, the Treasurer is not satisfied, despite all the safeguards of censorship by the Government Printer, and-the obligation of members to pay for the full value of the work done for them. The House is entitled to know the intentions of the Government in this matter, and whether it is the beginning of a policy of abolishing Hansard in the interests of the big daily papers. If it is not, what reasons have the Government for instructing the Government Printer to curtail honourable members' privileges in this direction? wish to draw the attention of tbe Treasurer to a paragraph in this morning's press to the effect that, owing to the delay in passing surer who should decide whether they shall the. Old-age Pensions Bill, there will be some delay in the payment of old-age pensions in Queensland. That delay will be caused by the fact that the State payments will have ceased, and the existence of an inber of this House, I shall resent to the terval before the Commonwealth Act comes into force. Will the Treasurer see that the money will be there, and ready to ibe paid as soon as it is legal to pay it? It is obvious that any material delay beyond a few days may be a matter of serious inconvenience and suffering to those who expect pensions. [10.16] I would like to ask you, sir, if there is any law in this House compelling you to wear a wig? Many years ago, an English Judge, when in the United States, lost his wig. Those who found it, not knowing what it was, had it examined at one of the universities in Western America, and the analyst discovered in it microbes and insects enough to kill forty men. In this twentieth century, I protest against these antiquated forms. I object to things that used to be worn when men were barbarians being worn any further in this House. As you, sir, have a good head of hair, and are a good-looking man, you can do without a wig. [10.17] I am surprised to find that the Treasurer is not ready to disabuse the minds of honourable members of the impression that he has been interfering with in the matter raised by the honourable member for Yarra. I do not know how it comes about that the Treasurer has any right to be heard at the Government Printing Office respecting the reprinting of Hansard in pamphlet form, provided that nothing is printed which has not taken place on the floor of the House, that the cost of reproduction is paid by honourable members, and that the reprinting is approved of by the proper authorities. The privileges of Parliament, going back to the days of the Commonwealth of England, have been respected by Ministers, and honourable members must not allow the privileges which are few to be interfered with. If the Treasurer has stepped in and interfered in that way, he should be told that he had no right to do soOne honourable member tells me that the matter relates only to the head-lines, but that is not the question. It should be the Speaker, and not the Treabe printed or not. If the pamphlets do not contain new matter, I presume they will be printed. If they contain new matter, they will not be printed. As a memlast any interference by the Treasurer with our privileges. surer) [10.20] I am glad to have an opportunity of explaining the matter.

I am sure that honourable members will acquit me of a desire to interfere with anything that is within the privilege of any honourable member-o n the contrary, I desire to assist.' But really, I had to demur a little to some of the headlines that I saw. those which the right honourable member inserted in his own speeches? very much worse. orable gentleman objedt to some things, which are said in this House? right honourable gentleman will do will beto try to exercise control over what honourable members say. able member uses a strong expression in the course of a speech-probabl y an expression that is almost unparliamentaryI do not think that he is justified in putting it into a headline.

Then again, there is the matter of the covers. regulate all that. to covers with flaming advertisements, which I do not think come well from the Government Printing Office. mine. more on the cover of any reprinted speech of mine than the statement that it was delivered on such and such a day. But, in some, cases things have been-put on covers for electioneering purposes. However, I will consult with Mr Speaker, and we will see whether we cannot devise some plan. I am sure that honourable members will .agree with me that a document emanating from the Government Printing Office should not contain advertisements for electioneering purposes. These reprints arc transcripts of the speeches from Hansard and the cover should contain the simple statement to that effect. The subject, with the date and the name of the honourable member, should be clearly stated and nothing more. In regard to the old-age pensions matter, referred to by the honourable member for Echuca, and the honourable member for Capricornia, I have to say that, of course, until the Old-age Pensions Act Amendment Bill is passed by the Senate any pensioner in Queensland, although he may have been in receipt of a pension from the Queensland Government, having been twenty years in Australia, but not having been here twenty-five years, will not receive his pension from the Federal authority. But as soon as the Bill is passed by the SenateI shall do everything I can to facilitate immediate payment. The explanation of the Treasurer is very unsatisfactory. He has assumed the role of censor without any authority from Parliament. I have never had one of my speeches reprinted, but I take the point raised by the honourable member for Robertson, that, if the Government is going to control the publication of Hansard by the Government Printer, it is invading the prerogative of Parliament. Hansard is not concerned. I was speaking only of reprints of speeches. ber's interference with a custom which grew up under the authority and direction of the late Speaker, to whose good qualities we have all testified so highly, shows that he is determined to invade the privileges of Parliament. Quite a number of honourable members think that that part of Australia which lies more than a hundred miles from Melbourne is of no account, and can see no need for Hansard. But without the official record, the public at large would not know what honourable members say and do here, the press reports being absolutely insufficient. fered in any way with the publication of Hansard. Besides, I have had as many speeches reprinted as has any honourable member, and have paid for the work. orable member mean by referring to the fact that it is done at a very low cost? Evidently the Government wishes to usurp the functions of Parliament. Personally, I am not concerned in this matter, because I have never yet had a speech reprinted, and probably never shall.

I hope that the Prime Minister, in closing the debate, will indicate how far the Government will wish to go. the Minister of Defencei f he will arrange that members of Parliament shall be supplied with copies of the report of Major General Hoad on his recent visit to England and America. Many members of the general public have received copies, and members of Parliament, who require to be. specially instructed in Defence matters, particularly in view of the probable introduction of a Defence Bill, should also be supplied. When congratulations were being addressed to you, Mr Speaker, upon your elevation to your high office, members omitted to mention their appreciation of the services rendered by the Clerk during the debate which preceded your election. He has had a very arduous and trying time, and an experience without precedent, so far as the records which I have been able to search, show.

As to the question put by the honourable member for Wentworth, I wish to say that certain changes have been made in the commands in two of the States, resulting in the transfer of Colonel Le Mesurier from Western Australia to a position in New South Wales. It was felt that we could obtain better value out of that officer in the position to which we proposed to appoint him than we were getting in Western Australia.

I deemed it wise to make the change, and Colonel Le Mesurier has not been degraded in any way. His status is not being impaired in the slightest degree, and, altogether, I think the change will suit him and and the Department. to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to a practice whereby the Commonwealth, with the assistance of the banks, is being robbed annually of thousands of pounds. I refer to the system under which open postal notes which are paid into banks are in some cases used over and over again. In many country banks, a customer asks for a postal note, say, for Â£ 1 or 30s., and, paying its equivalent in cash, over the counter, is handed one that has already been used. Thousands of open postal notes, so obtained after they have been used for the purpose for which they were originally purchased from the Department, are sent to Tattersall's. That has occurred over and over again. The Government have refused to make postal notes legal tender, yet customers of banks are so using tbem. I have on the Commonwealth may be obviated. My suggestion is that the town or city at which the postal note is to be payable shall be printed or written upon it. A regulation should at once be passed providing for that change, for in that way this fraud on the Commonwealtli could be stopped. I am sure that no honourable member desires to see the revenue depleted in this way. would do what the honourable member speaks of. inquiries when the matter was first brought under my notice, and was told that the banks said it was no business of theirs; their customers desired the accommodation, and postal notes are negotiable all over the Commonwealth, whereas exchange has to be paid on bank notes in States other than those in which they are issued. I hope that the Postmaster-General will at once take action to prevent the Commonwealth I do not think that we revenue being depleted in this way. desire to refer to certain questions that I put recently to the Minister representing the Minister of Trade and Customs in regard to the size of corn sacks. Honourable members will recollect that last year the then Minister of Trade and Customs issued a regulation prohibiting the introduction of corn sacks other than those of the standard sizes named in the proclamation. No one will Find fault with his action, because it was designed to prevent very heavy weights being placed ""in sacks, and so endangering the lives of those who had to handle them. Unfortunately, however, it entails a hardship on a very large section of the community-o n both farmers and merchants. I asked whether the Minister of Trade and Customs was aware that, under the proclamation, bags were being imported that would not hold the weight which the standard corn sack was intended to hold, namely, 200 lbs., and that, if his inquiries should prove that such was the case, he would give instructions that bags of dimensions sufficient to permit of that weight of corn being placed in them could be imported.

The Minister informed me that experience shows that the standard sack holds, on the average, 200 lbs.; my information is that, on the average, it does not hold more than 185 lbs. weight. Further, I was informed that the standard sacks were not equal in quality to those that were formerly imported. A large number of municipal councils, agricultural societies, and like bodies have asked me to endeavour to induce the Minister to agree to the size of the standard corn sack being slightly increased, so as to enable 200 lbs. weight to be placed in it. posed to hold 200 lbs. f.a.q. that they do not hold more than 185 lbs. weight, and that, when they are sewn up with that weight in them, they have no ears, and are therefore difficult to handle. It is represented that if the sack were made a little wider and longer, it would meet all requirements, and be very serviceable. I wish, however, to push the matter a little further. If we could obtain a guarantee that not more than 200 lbs. weight of corn would be placed in a sack, sacks of all sizes might be allowed to be introduced. guarantee? to endeavour to induce the State Governments to provide a guarantee by some regulation or law; but, of course, if the States do not consent, I cannot ask the Minister to go further. I do not think that the States have been approached just as, perhaps, they ought to have been. We must not forget that the Commonwealth Parliament and the State Parliaments represent one and the same people, and that, if we can' minimize the difficulties of the producing classes, it is our duty, as well as that of the States, to do so. Tasmania is .particularly penalized, because in that State more than 2 cwt. is never put into sacks. put into the sacks. appreciate the action of the Government in making the limitation.

The men who have the handling of the bags, the growers, and all concerned desire the liberty to use other sacks also. ber has not interviewed the right men. the men working at the threshing machines, the farmers, and all who have to do with the handling of the bags. In view of the Premiers' Conference, I ask whether something cannot be done in this matter, because if what I suggest can be carried out, it will be a beneficial and business-like act. to prevent the States from dealing with the matter. asking the Minister to induce the States to deal with it. I am astounded to hear the remarks of the Treasurer as to the instructions regarding certain documents supposed to be reprints from Hansard. I was under the impression that Hansard is under the control of the House, and not under the control of any Government or Treasurer. A most extraordinary fact is that during the no-confidence debate the Prime Minister himself had a speech reprinted, with cross headings, but, when the honourable member for Yarra endeavoured to have his speech similarly produced, he was refused permission. Like the honourable member for Wide Bay, I have never had a speech reprinted, and I am not likely to have one reprinted, so that I am not speaking as an aggrieved person. The House is now faced with the fact that the Treasurer has been allowed to interfere with the privileges of honourable members and to usurp a function which has been delegated to no Government. The whole control of Hansard lies with the President and Mr Speaker, while the printing of other documents is within the province of the Printing Committee. Something should be done to protect the rights of honourable members. We have had the startling statement from the Treasurer that he practically alters reprints in a way to suit himself. not issued as copies of Hansard? states that all he placed upon the title page was ""Reprinted from Hansard."" When documents are altered in the way the Treasurer states, it appears to me that if anything libellous were circulated, the person issuing the documents might lay himself open to an action, seeing that they would not represent a true reprint from Hansard.",67,Honourable Members Hear Hear

579,Mr Webster (Gwydir) [11.1],"Iis a system growing up here whereby certain honourable members are designedly, or, if not designedly, at any rate very determinedly, hurling, in a most offensive way, irrelevant interjections into a speech. It appears to me that it is done for the purpose of getting in a cutting reply while an honourable member is speaking, and placing a false impression upon his utterance. Necessarily the speaker takes up some time in responding to an innuendo hurled at him by a designing member, and thus breaks the continuity of his speech I believe that the late Speaker did agree that it was not absolutely necessary for either an interjection or a member's reply to an interjection to appear in the record-that he could expunge the passage from the proof if he so desired. was that an interjection need not appear if it was not replied to. an honourable member can strike out any interjections which are not replied to. But I submit that even interjections which are replied to are no part of a member's speech, and very often are thrown in to divert the course of his remarks, and, I might add, for other more unworthy motives. member is always saying nasty things. able member has intervened in his usual way, I may say that he was in my mind's eye when I was referring to offensive interjections. It has become a very offensive habit on his part, riot only with myself, but with any one who happens to be making an effective speech, to make such interjections. There can be no objection, I think, to the use of headlines which deal with the topics discussed by the speaker. I have issued an address with a few headlines. At the time. I was speaking I noticed a smile on the face of the Minister of Defence, and referred to it. When I came to that part of mv address I inserted this headline, "" The Smile of Joseph."" Surely the honourable member could not object to a headline of that nature? In another part of my speech I referred to the "" Road to Salvation."" Is there any objection to a headline of that kind appearing in the reprint of my address? I take it that no honourable member would use a headline which would be offensive. His pamphlet would be read by persons of all shades of political belief, and, therefore, for the sake of his own reputation, he would take care not' to offend the susceptibilities of any readers. I do not think that there could be any objection offered to what I put on the outside of my pamphlet. I might as well be frank and state that I indicated on the outside where the speech was delivered, and used these words,. "" Kindly pass this on when read."" Surely there is no objection to an honourable member doing that? week, when the honourable member for North Sydney was leaving the chamber, he asked me if -1, would give him a pair on any question in which I was voting against the Government, and I very gladly did so; but on Thursday afternoon, unfortunately, a misunderstanding arose about the pair which I wish to clear up. Being anxious to be here while the Old age Pensions Bill was being discussed,, even from the first clause, in connection with an amendment 1 was opposed to,, and having to leave at a quarter to 6 o'clock, I said to the honourable member for Riverina, who was sitting next to me, "" I s it safe to go?"" "" O h , yes,"" he said; "" I will look after, that allright."" I took the honourable member to mean that he would see that the debate COOK -The honourable did not close before half-past 6 o'clock,, as I intended to be back at a quarter to 8 o'clock. Unfortunately, a division took place before half-past 6 o'clock, and the Government Whip informed my honourable friend that I had paired with the honourable member for North Sydney. No division having occurred up to that time, I never thought of mentioning the pair to any of my colleagues who sat near me. The honourable member thought I was simply anxious to vote on the subject, and said that I had asked him to look after my vote. That was a misunderstanding which might easily happen. I want to clear upthe matter, and to show that it was a mistake on the part of the honourable member in construing my words. HadI beenhere, I should have observed the pair, and the Government Whip was not wrongin stating that I had paired, nor was the honorable member for Riverina knowingly wrong in saying that I instructed him tolook after mv vote.

I spoke to the honourable member for Gippsland, and he very kindly agreed lo pair with me. I was satisfied that he would honorably carry out any arrangement he made, and I am equally satisfied to-day. The explanation shows clearly that it was a misunderstanding such as will sometimes arise. There is no reflection in my mind, or, I am sure, in the minds of other honourable members, on the honourable member for Gippsland. promised a pair to the honourable member for Cowper. When the division came on, the honourable member for Gippsland was absent, and the honourable member for Flinders was here. I naturally thought that if the honourable member for Flinders had been asked to. give the honourable member for Gippsland a pair, he would have done so on account of what happened a week or two before. 1 thought that instead of the honourable member for Flinders and myself standing out, it would be just as well if the pair with the honourable member for Cowper was transferred from me to the honourable member for Gippsland. That accounts for me not giving the honourable member for Cowper a pair as I promised. It arose through the misunderstanding between the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Riverina. I have never .broken a pair or refused one wfien there was a legitimate reason for giving it. I do not believe in sitting in the House to do busiinterjection or a letter, and other honorness and letting other honourable members go home to their beds; but I have always been prepared to give a pair when a""sked for it on reasonable grounds. I am glad I was present to hear the explanation of the honourable member for Gippsland, because i l is perfectly correct. He made no mention to me of a pair, but he did mention his desire to be present. He said he was called away until after 6.30. He asked if it was safe to go away, and, knowing that I intended to speak, I said, "" Yes; I will see that no vote is taken until you return."" I gave him .my word, and felt obliged to see that his vote would be recorded, as I understood he desired it to be. Then there was a desire on both sides that the debate should close before 6.30. The honourable member for Newcastle-the Opposition Whip-spok e to me about it, and I replied that I was in duty bound to speak, and lo carry -out my word as given to the honourable member for Gippsland, unless a pair could be arranged for that honourable member during his absence. I consented to the arrangement suggested, only on condition that the pair of the honourable member for Bass was transferred in the manner which he has described. able member that the honourable members for Gippsland and North Sydney were paired. rect. But the honourable member for Gippsland did not tell me. He made no mention of a pair at all. He certainly did mention his desire to be present before the vote was taken, and I naturally thought that he wanted to vote, and was perfectly free to vote. Having given him my word that he would have an opportunity to do so, I did, in the circumstances, what I would do again if similar circumstances arose. [ n . 16] I have had one or two speeches reprinted from Hansard, but I never altered a line of the reports, nor did T put in a cross-heading. It is remarkable to hear the Treasurer state that he has ordered the Government Printer to cease putting in cross-headings because they are an interference with Hansard, when he himself admits that he has been guiltv of altering that record. I never took out an able members like mvself have not interfered with Hansard at all.
