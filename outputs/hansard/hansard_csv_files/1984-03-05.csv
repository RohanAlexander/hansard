I refer again to my the sense that I have defined it is out, as promised own State. If the Tasmanian people want to have by Senator Ryan. We then come to clause 33, a this type of legislation, let them persuade their very tricky clause, which says: Tasmanian Government to legislate. Nothing in DivisionI or 2It is interesting to note that whilst members of under which clause 26, of course, comesthe Government claim-I think that the honourrenders it unlawful to do an act a purpose of which is to able member for Melbourne ( Mr Hand) was the ensure that persons of a particular sex or marital status or last one who claimed it-that they had a mandate persons who are pregnant have equal opportunities with to introduce this sort of legislation, let me remind other persons in circumstances in relation to which provision is made by this Act. the Government that in Tasmania the Tasmanian Liberal Party went to the people on a mandate I believe that this clause means that any man saying that it would not introduce this sort of discriminated against may lose any claim in the legislation. So that is what Tasmanians wanted matter if the purpose of the discrimination was to when they voted for a Tasmanian Liberal give a woman equal opportunity. It is true that afGovernment.

SoI believe that that has been inserted quite contrary to the assurances In summary, I cannot support this Bill. The given by the Government that affirmative action reasons I oppose it are: It is still badly drafted, it would not be included. It is very much alive, at has omissions which could lead to serious conseleast to the extent that clause 33 does give authquences, particularly as the legislation affects the ority for it. That is why I accuse the Government rights of individuals. It has concealed provisions of introducing hidden objectives. This is a sneaky for affirmative action which we have been assured clause which has been placed in the Bill to allow have been specifically excluded.
