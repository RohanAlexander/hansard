The Opposition fact, the Medicare decisions, which were made in spokesman on health has made an interesting this chamber and which to some extent have been claim about increases in costs. I think honourable made by the community, are being reworked by members opposite have to share the responsibility the Opposition. I guess that is fair enough because in this place and in the wider community. When it is part of the role of this place. It is also part of Medicare was introduced-honourable members the role of this place for honourable members opopposite should bear in mind that Medicare was posite to bring out areas in which they believe we one of the issues on which we went to the electorcould make amendments to improve the overall ate and it was a matter on which the electorate picture. gave us a clear indication of its preference, and it I wish to take up one or two items which I think was voted through the Parliament of Australiadeserve some comment. The Opposition spokesthe doctors were unwilling to accept the real imman on health matters talked to some extent plications of Medicare. Some honourable about the role of choice of doctor in relation to members in this place assisted the doctors in their patients. I think that is a spurious argument. It is refusal to co-operate with the effective arrangespurious in the sense that it is one argument which ments of Medicare. So when the Opposition talks has been heightened considerably by doctors and about cost problems relating to Medicare, it must to some extent by some commentators in the polhave a clear look at itself. I think honourable itical arena when they say that that is the be all members opposite have to make an assessment and end all of the Medicare linkage. In fact, we do and say: 'Have we adopted the widest possible not want to remove the choice of doctor, and to opinion and view about Medicare?'. I think the some extent we have not done that.
