(2) Why was it not possible to provide the Coroner with any explanation of how and why documentation was not available to the inquest. (3) Has the relevant documentation now been located; if so, has it been forwarded to the Coroner, if not, why not. (4) Has there been an investigation into why key documentation was missing and unavailable to the Coroner; if so, (a) who conducted it, and (b) will he table its findings in the Parliament; if not, why not; if there has not been an investigation (c) why not, and (d) will he now establish an investigation and report its findings to the Parliament; if not, why not. (5) Has any process been undertaken to identify actions to change or improve procedures for record keeping following this case; if so, (a) what is that process, (b) what are the actions identified, and (c) have they already been implemented in full; if not, why not. (6) Will he table all documents relating to the disappearance of the documents on the detention of Mohammed Yousef Saleh prior to his death and relating to efforts to locate these documents. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) All departmental files and all other documentation that could be located were made available to the Coroner. The initial search failed to locate one file, which was subsequently found and made available to the Coroner. The documents on the file were administrative in nature and were not materially relevant to the issues before the Coroner, who has returned the file and made no comment as to any significance of the material on the missing file. It should be noted that in his report into the circumstances of Mr Saleh’s death, the Western Australian State Coroner noted that it would “appear unlikely that the placement of the deceased [in Juliet Block] at that time had any significant bearing on the circumstances of his death.” (2) The Department has not been able to establish how the file went missing. However, the Department wrote to the Coroner and forwarded the file immediately after it was located. (3) See (1) above. (4) A formal investigation into why the file could not be found initially was not performed at the time. Enquiries undertaken at the time could not establish why the file was missing. The Minister does not consider this matter justifies a formal investigation, particularly given that the file was subsequently found and provided to the Coroner. (5) (a) to (c) As with all Commonwealth departments, there are formal processes for the recording and retention and eventual archiving of relevant documentation.

No. Centrelink: Youth Allowance Payments (Question No. 2017) Ms Jackson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 16 June 2003: (1) Is it the case that a student who is in receipt of a scholarship to cover the cost of fees faces a reduction in Youth Allowance payments because the scholarship is regarded as income; if so, why. (2) Is it an anomaly that students in this situation are penalised financially by reductions to their Centrelink benefits. (3) In the electoral division of Hasluck, how many students, or their families, have had their Centrelink payments reduced because the student receives a scholarship and for each case, is the Minister able to say (a) the type of scholarship received, and (b) the amount of any reduction in Centrelink payments. (4) Will the Minister consider amending the Social Security Act 1991, to ensure that scholarships are not classified as a ‘valuable contribution’ under that act; if not, why not. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Scholarships received by students are generally counted as income for social security payments, including Youth Allowance. Where a part of the scholarship is to reimburse for specified ‘out of pocket’ expenses (such as photocopying, postage and printing) this part is not treated as income. Some scholarships are not assessable under the income test as discussed in the response to question (4). Under the current income test rules students in receipt of scholarships may also be able to receive social security payments. For example, Youth Allowance recipients have access to a generous ‘free area’ before their payments are affected. A single student can have income of up to $236 per fortnight before their payment is reduced. For each dollar of income over the income test ‘free area’ the allowance is only reduced by 50 cents for income between $236 and $316. Income above $316 per fortnight reduces payments by 70 cents in the dollar. In addition, Youth Allowance recipients have access to an income bank of up to $6000. This means that the combination of the income free area and income bank means that a student receiving additional income will always be better off than a student without the extra assistance. The generosity of the income test rules for Youth Allowance means that in the majority of cases additional income will have a minimal effect on persons’ entitlement.",110,Questions On Notice
227,Mr Downer,The following is the answer to the honourable member’s question:,111,Questions On Notice
228,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the followIn general, the social security income test uses the gross ordinary income of people and measures income from all sources. The Social Security Act 1991 (‘the Act’) specifies that all income earned, derived or received for a person's own benefit, is counted as income. The definition of income includes ‘valuable consideration’. (2) No. (3) Centrelink has two regional Customer Service Centres located in the Hasluck electorate-at Gosnells and Midland. There are less than 20 students with Gosnells or Midland regional office codes that currently hold a scholarship. The precise number cannot be given for privacy reasons. These students hold a variety of scholarships that are funded by a range of corporate, educational and philanthropic organizations. Further data is not easily accessible from Centrelink records. (4) As a part of the Government’s Higher Education Reform Package, passed by Parliament in December 2003, higher education institutions will be able to offer ‘fee-exempt’ scholarships that exempt a student from the full higher education fees. These scholarships will not be counted as income for social security payments, including Youth Allowance. In addition and as a transitional arrangement contained in the Higher Education Reform Package, the Government also legislated to exempt scholarships offered by higher education providers that waive all the fees of a fee-paying student from the social security income test in the 2004 calendar year. The former Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone advised the Senate on 11 September 2003 that the Government was reviewing the social security treatment of scholarships. Telstra: Services (Question No. 2137) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 26 August 2003: (1) How many Telstra exchanges are (a) not presently compatible with ADSL and (b) what proportion of subscribers are affected. (2) What is the likely timetable to ensure that all exchanges have access to ADSL services. Telstra, is as follows: (1) (a) & (b) Telstra advises that there are 4048 exchanges that currently do not provide ADSL, but this is not to say that they are not compatible with ADSL, rather that no decision has been taken to ADSLenable the majority of these exchanges at this time. For the majority of these exchanges a low customer base and high enablement cost do not make it economic for Telstra to install ADSL. However, there is also a number of exchanges with a larger customer base that have yet to be considered by Telsta as to when ADSL will be installed. Currently, about three quarters of all telephone services in Australia can access Telstra’s broadband ADSL network. (2) Telstra advises that a further 39 additional exchange sites will be enabled by the end of 2003/04. However, there is no immediate plan to ensure that all exchanges have access to ADSL. Primarily, additional areas will be enabled according to customer generated demand for ADSL in their area via the ADSL Demand Register. This provides a means whereby customers are able to inform Telstra of their desire to obtain an ADSL service. Telstra’s ISDN service is also available to about 96% of the population and offers internet access at higher speeds than standard dial-up.",111,Questions On Notice
229,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question, based on advice fromMigration Agents Registration Authority (Question No. 2194) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 12 August 2003: (1) Is it the case that sanction decisions made by the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) are not published until the finalisation of any appeal by the agent concerned to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and, if so, what is the basis for this arrangement. (2) How many appeals against MARA sanction decisions have been lodged with the AAT to date and, of these, how many (a) proceeded to a hearing with the appeal being dismissed, (b) were withdrawn by the agent prior to a final hearing, (c) proceeded to a hearing with the appeal being upheld in whole or in part, (d) were conceded by MARA without a final hearing, and (e) remain before the AAT at present. (3) What was the average period of time that elapsed before completed appeals were (a) withdrawn by the agent prior to any hearing or (b) determined by the AAT. (1) Yes; section 305 of the Migration Act requires that cancellation and suspension decisions be published in newspapers after prescribed periods have expired and appeals processes have been finalised. I am developing legislation that will: A. enable the MARA to flag on the Register and publish the details of decisions to caution, suspend or cancel a registered agent and the details of any stay orders immediately these are made; B. enable the MARA to publish a list on their web site of agents who are no longer registered; C. ensure that s300 does not apply where agents have been suspended or cancelled by the MARA and have appealed to the AAT or courts, unless the AAT or courts overturn the decision or do not substitute a different suspension or cancellation decision; D. ensure that s300 does not apply where agents have had their registration refused by the MARA (either before or after the expiry of their current registration); and E. clarify that a decision by the MARA to sanction an agent is not affected by a subsequent decision to grant or refuse an application for re-registration. I will be introducing these legislative changes at the earliest possible time. (2) As at 1 December 2003, 70 appeals against MARA sanction decisions (including refusal decisions) have been lodged with the AAT since the MARA’s inception in March 1998 and (a) 21 proceeded to a hearing with the appeal being dismissed, (b) 12 were withdrawn by the agent prior to a final hearing, (c) 8 proceeded to a hearing with the appeal being upheld in whole or in part, (d) 10 were conceded by MARA without a final hearing, and (e) 19 remain before the AAT at present. (3) (a) 176 days. (b) 266 days. Centrelink: Income and Assets Review (Question No. 2231) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 12 August 2003:",112,Questions On Notice
230,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) How is it determined which recipients of a Centrelink benefit receive the Income and Assets Review form. (2) How many recipients of a Centrelink benefit in the seat of Hunter were requested to complete the Income and Assets Review form in the financial years (a) 2000-2001, (b) 2001-2002, and (c) 20022003. (3) How many recipients of a Centrelink benefit failed to return the Income and Assets Review form within the prescribed 21 day period and as a result had their Centrelink benefits cut off. (4) How many recipients of a Centrelink benefit that failed to return the Income and Assets Review form within the prescribed 21 days and had the Centrelink benefit cut off were over the age of 85 years. (5) Of the people over the age of 85 years who had their benefit cut off, how many had their payment reinstated to the amount it was prior to receiving the Income and Assets Review. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Income and Assets Reviews are conducted to fulfill the legislative eligibility requirements for all Means Tested pensions (Carer Payment, Disability Support Pension and Age Pension along with Wife and Widow pensions and payments). In January 2003, Centrelink introduced a new system known as “Service Profiling” to determine Age Pension customers who should receive an “Income and Assets Review” form. The selection is based on customer characteristics (eg. customer has not advised of any variations in value of assets for the past five years) which identify the need for interaction with the customer and to update their records. The use of Service Profiling enables Centrelink to ensure the customer receives their correct entitlement to government services and payments and that government service and payments are provided to those most in need. (2) (3), (4) and (5) The detailed information required to answer the honourable member’s question is not readily available in consolidated form. I do not consider it appropriate for the expenditure of the resources and effort that would be involved in collecting and assembling information for the sole purpose of answering questions of this nature. It should be noted that although customers are requested to return the “Income and Assets” review form within 21 days, should this not occur, payments are not “cut off” immediately. If the review form has not been returned after 42 days, a “reminder” letter is sent to the customer and a further 28 days is allowed for the customer, or someone acting on the customer’s behalf, to return the form or to request an extension. Centrelink provides assistance to those customers who need help to complete the forms or require more information. Centrelink: Student Financial Supplement Loan Scheme (Question No. 2234) Mr Organ asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 12 August 2003: (1) How many (a) students, (b) mature age students, and (c) mature age students with dependants are expected to be affected by the closure of the Student Financial Supplement Loan Scheme in the financial years (i) 2003-2004, (ii) 2004-2005, (iii) 2005-2006. (2) What is the likely or expected impact on (a) course completions and (b) course completion dates for the affected students. (3) What modeling has Centrelink done to determine the likely impact of these changes on (a) course enrolments, (b) failure rates, and (c) non-completion rates.",113,Questions On Notice
231,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the follow(4) If no modeling was undertaken how were the potential impacts evaluated. (5) How are the impacts of the changes to be monitored. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) On the fortnight ending 15 August 2003, 18 064 people received the financial supplement for 2003. (b) FaCS data does not define ‘mature age’ students. As a result, it is not possible to provide information on numbers of mature age students. (c) As FaCS data does not define ‘mature age’, the number of students in the overall SFSS customer population with dependents has been provided. On the fortnight ending 15 August 2003, 3075 students with dependents received the financial supplement for 2003. (a) (b) (c) (i) (ii) (iii) As the Scheme operates on a calendar year basis, it is difficult for the Department to extrapolate these figures into future financial years. As a consequence, the Department is unable to provide this information due to doubts as to its potential accuracy. (2) Conclusions about the expected impacts of the closure of the SFSS upon course completions and course completion dates cannot be drawn from the available data. (3) No modeling has been done by Centrelink in these areas. (4) The Government considered a range of data including evaluations, declining applications and the increasing cost to taxpayers of unpaid debts. (5) The Government will continue to monitor program outlays according to normal administrative arrangements. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 2349) cultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 9 September 2003: (1) Has Australia at any stage received a request from Iran for the return of Massoumeh Mastipour to that country; if so, (a) when was that request received, (b) from whom, (c) by whom and (d) what steps has the government taken to process the request.

234,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs(1) (a)-(d) I understand that a request was received by the Australian Federal Police from Iran for the return of the child. The Australian Federal Police is in the best position to respond on how it deals with requests of this nature. (2) I am unable to confirm the statements attributed to Mr Ruddock in the article on ABC On-line on 27 August 2003. However, I can confirm that the child had been found not to be owed protection obligations by Australia and was available for removal. Consequently, my Department had a legal obligation to remove the child from Australia as soon as reasonably practicable. The child was reunited in Iran with her custodial parent. (3) The child was removed from Australia in accordance with section 198 of the Migration Act 1958. The Iranian Government determined that the responsible custodial parent had approved the return and consequently issued a travel document. This then triggered the Department’s obligation to remove Matin under s198. There was no other legal impediment to her return. (4) The Shiraz Family Court in Iran ordered that this child be in the custody of her mother. The terms of the court order were that Mr Mohammad Amin Mastipour was to return the child to her mother, Ms Ahmadi-Jafari. The court order also stated that Ms Ahmadi-Jafari had custody of the child until the age of seven. The court order was made on 13 October 2001. Legal advice indicated that after the child reached the age of seven, an application would have to be made to a court to vary the existing order. (5) The Department sought a range of legal advice regarding the child, including from the department’s Special Counsel, the Attorney General’s Department and a legal provider in Iran. (6) A departmental officer escorted the child to Tehran on 23 July 2003. Upon arrival, the child was reunited with her mother in the presence of departmental officers. (7) A departmental officer from the Embassy in Tehran last spoke to the child’s mother on 27 July 2003. At that time, the child was is in her custody. Centrelink: Payments (Question No. 2405) Mr Organ asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 16 September 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2027 (Hansard, 8 September 2003, page 18981) in respect of statistical collections by Centrelink, does Centrelink record any information on the period of time it takes to process applications for benefits from the date of application to the decision to grant or refuse a benefit payment; if so, what information is collected. (2) Will the Minister table the Business Partnership Agreement with Centrelink. (3) Will the Minister provide details on the timeliness standards for payments and services for the 2002-2003 financial year, as set by the Agreement. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The timeliness of payments and services that Centrelink is required to meet is documented in the Outcomes, Strategies and Performance Protocol section of the Business Partnership Agreement 2001 2004 signed between Family and Community Services (FaCS) and Centrelink. (2) If the Honourable member would like a copy of the Business Partnership Agreement, I refer you to FaCS Internet site: www.facs.gov.au. (3) Each payment type Centrelink delivers on behalf of FaCS has its own timeliness standard. Centrelink has delivered all FaCS payments and services within the agreed standard for the year 2002-03, with the exception of the Low Income Card which was 1 percent outside the Key Performance Indicator.",115,Questions On Notice
235,Mr Anthony,"The Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community ServicesImmigration: Detention Centres (Question No. 2497) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: (1) Did the use of Juliet Block and the treatment of detainees in that block following the riots of January 2001 constitute punishment and humiliation putting Australia in breach of its obligations under its own and international laws. (2) Was he aware of the treatment of detainees in Juliet Block; if not, why was he not properly briefed. (3) Was Mr Saleh denied medical treatment appropriate to his condition and were his medical needs ignored as part of a punishment regime of neglect during his stay at Juliet Block. (4) Are depression and post-traumatic stress disorder “illnesses” for the purposes of his department’s policies in respect of the health of detainees. (5) In respect of the apparent loss of Mr Saleh’s treatment records whilst he was in Juliet Block, is the Minister able to say whether (a) the Detention Centre’s claim as noted by the Coroner that they had been destroyed by rioters is correct, or (b) the records were provided to the Coroner. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. The use of Juliet Block and the treatment of detainees in that block following the disturbance at Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC) in January 2001 did not constitute punishment or humiliation, and consequently did not place Australia in breach of its obligations under local or international law. (2) Mr Ruddock was advised of the disturbance at Port Hedland IRPC and the need to transfer a number of detainees to Juliet Block, either for behavioural management reasons or due to a lack of other available accommodation at the centre due to damage caused by detainees during the disturbance. The treatment of detainees in Juliet Block at this time did not constitute punishment or humiliation. (3) There was no punishment regime of neglect for detainees in Juliet Block. Any detainee who presented with a medical complaint or condition was assessed and appropriate treatment was prescribed. A nurse attended Juliet Block twice daily. (4) In relation to medical issues, the Department is guided by advice from appropriately qualified medical professionals employed by the detention services provider or in external health care facilities. All detainees are provided with necessary medical or other health care when required, including treatment for mental health conditions such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. (5) All relevant records that could be located were provided to the Coroner, including both medical treatment and administration records. This included a file that could not initially be located, but was subsequently provided to the Coroner. It should be noted that in his report into the circumstances of Mr Saleh’s death, the Western Australian State Coroner noted that it would “appear unlikely that the placement of the deceased [in Juliet Block] at that time had any significant bearing on the circumstances of his death”. Telstra: Line Rental (Question No. 2514) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 7 October 2003:",116,Questions On Notice
236,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs(1) In respect of Telstra line rental charges, what was the effect of line rental increases on Telstra’s total domestic fixed-line revenue for 2002-2003 taking into account any rebalancing of call costs. (2) What was the effect on Telstra’s 2002-2003 revenue of the cancellation of the neighbourhood call option. (3) Has the Government or Telstra modelled the effects of line rental increases on low income earners; if so, can the details of that modelling be provided. (4) What proportion of Telstra’s domestic customers use HomeLine Budget, HomeLine Complete and HomeLine Plus. (5) Is it the case that HomeLine Budget is not means tested and wealthy holiday house owners could take advantage of the comparatively lower line rentals offered in that package. (6) In respect of the HomeLine Budget package, has any research been undertaken by Telstra or the Government to establish whether lower line rental costs actually help low income users given the significantly higher call costs associated with that package; if so, can a copy of that research be provided. (7) Is the Minister able to say (a) what proportion of Telstra’s customers pay more for monthly line rental than they do for monthly calls under the new 2002 price control arrangements, and (b) how this compares to the former price control regime. (8) Under the Government’s new price control regime, is the Minister able to estimate what will be (a) the highest amount Telstra will be able to charge consumers for monthly telephone line rental fee by mid-2005, and (b) in the event that the 2002 price control regime rolls over into 2005-2006, the highest amount Telstra will be able to charge consumers for monthly telephone line rental fee by mid-2006. tion provided by Telstra, is as follows: (1) Telstra has advised that it regards this revenue information, to the extent that it could be estimated, as being commercially sensitive information. Telstra has therefore declined to provide this information. Telstra has, however, advised that its audited financial statements for 2002-2003 show that total domestic fixed line revenue increased by 2.1 per cent in 2002-2003. This compares to a Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate over the same period of 3.1%. The revenue increase reflects a variety of business factors, including demographic changes, together with various price changes and specials over the year. Telstra has indicated that basic access revenues over this time increased as a percentage of Telstra’s domestic fixed-line revenues, and call revenues have reduced as a percentage of Telstra’s domestic fixed-line revenues. According to Telstra, the line rental increase is consistent with the Australian Government’s price control arrangements and has been accompanied by a fall in overall call charges. Telstra has advised that fixed line call prices overall have decreased by almost 40 per cent over the last four years. (2) Telstra has advised that it regards the impact of any single business decision on individual revenue streams as being commercially sensitive information. Telstra has therefore declined to provide this information. Telstra has, however, advised that its audited financial statements for 2002-2003 show that total domestic fixed line revenue increased by 2.1 per cent in 2002-2003. This change includes a variety of factors, including the effect of the reduction in the local call rate and removal of the Telstra Neighbourhood Call.",117,Questions On Notice
237,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question, based partly on informa(3) The Government is committed to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to protect lowincome earners from the effects of any line rental increases. In its Review of Price Control Arrangements 2001, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) undertook a thorough assessment of the best means of protecting low income earners from line rental increases. As part of this review the ACCC analysed the impact of line rental re-balancing. The ACCC’s report is available on line from its website (www.accc.gov.au). Some of the ACCC’s report is commercial-in-confidence. In addition, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts consulted extensively with stakeholders on the ACCC’s Review, investigated overseas approaches for protecting low-income earners and provided briefing to the Government on the implications of rebalancing for low income earners and appropriate protection measures. This investigation identified that the best approach to protecting consumers from any negative impact of re balancing was to target measures at low-income earners who may be affected by line rental increases. As a consequence, the Government has adopted a needs based approach to protect low-income earners. The Government requires Telstra, as part of its carrier licence conditions, to have in place a package of products and arrangements for low-income earners to appropriately protect them from the effects of line rental increases. Telstra’s low-income package has been endorsed by the Low-income Measures Assessment Committee (LIMAC), comprising representatives from the Australian Council of Social Service, The Smith Family, the Salvation Army, Anglicare Australia, Council on the Ageing, Jobs Australia, the Australian Federation of Homelessness Organisations and the Department of Family and Community Services. Telstra is required to actively market its low-income package, based on an approved Marketing Plan. Telstra must also maintain and resource the LIMAC, which is responsible for assessing proposed changes to the Telstra package, approving its Marketing Plan for the package and reporting to Government annually on the effectiveness of the package and Telstra’s marketing of the package. Telstra is unable to make any line rental increase affecting low-income earners unless it has complied with its licence conditions. It must obtain the ACCC’s consent to any line rental increase and the ACCC must be reasonably satisfied about compliance before giving consent. Telstra has advised that it assesses the effect of its new low-income package, “Access for Everyone”, via an extensive research program. Elements of the research are commercial-inconfidence as Telstra uses this information to develop products and services targeted at the needs of low income groups. The LIMAC has commissioned independent research to understand and benchmark low-income and disadvantaged Australians’ needs and expectations in relation to telecommunications services. Telstra has advised that this benchmark research shows a positive reaction from target consumers towards the “Access for Everyone” initiatives and a recognition that the initiatives satisfy a significant need within the community. (4) Telstra has advised that it regards the comparative take-up of various consumer products as being commercially sensitive information. Telstra has therefore declined to provide this information. (5) The Government requires Telstra, as part of its carrier licence conditions, to have in place a package of products and arrangements for low-income consumers, to appropriately protect them from the effects of line rental increases. The low-income package developed by Telstra, and endorsed by the LIMAC, comprises initiatives that address a wide range of low-income consumer needs. While it contains measures especially targeted at holders of Pensioner Concession Cards, Health Care Cards and Low-Income Health Care Cards, it is a largely self-selecting package, enabling all those in need of assistance and benefits to claim them. In line with this approach, HomeLine Budget is not means tested and any customer can take advantage of the comparatively lower line rentals offered in that package. However, customers would have to take the higher call costs for HomeLine Budget into consideration to ensure that the plan is suitable for them. (6) The line rental for HomeLine Budget is $17.50 per month, compared with $23.50 for HomeLine Complete and $26.50 for HomeLine Plus. Given the additional call costs for HomeLine Budget, customers may undertake their own calculations to determine whether this product is most appropriate for their needs. Telstra has advised that it proactively contacts new HomeLine Budget customers where it identifies that, based on their calling patterns, HomeLine Budget may not be the lowest cost service. Discussions with the customer generally cover other benefits of the plan such as the low fixed component which allows the customer to have greater control of their spending. Telstra has indicated that, in some cases, customers have decided to move from the lowest line rental plan to HomeLine Plus which has the lowest call rates, however the majority affirmed they were happy with their original choice. (7) (a) and (b) Telstra advised that it has not specifically monitored the proportion of customers who pay more for monthly line rental than they do for monthly calls under the current or former price control arrangements. As noted above, Telstra has a licence obligation to resource and maintain the LIMAC comprising representatives of welfare associations. The LIMAC must report annually to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on the effectiveness of Telstra’s lowincome package and its marketing of the package. The LIMAC has commissioned independent research to understand and benchmark low-income and disadvantaged Australians’ needs and expectations in relation to telecommunications services. Telstra has advised that this benchmark research shows a positive reaction from target consumers towards the “Access for Everyone” initiatives and a recognition that the initiatives satisfy a significant need within the community. (8) (a) and (b) Under the retail price controls, Telstra is required to reduce prices for a basket of fixed line telephone calls by 4.5% in real terms, on average. Telstra is able to increase line rentals to gradually achieve cost recovery in the provision of the customer access network. Whether Telstra chooses to increase line rentals by the maximum amount is a commercial decision for Telstra. The rate of rebalancing permitted is CPI plus 4% for a basket of line rentals, which means that the revenue-weighted average price of this basket of services must not increase by more than 4% each year in real terms. The maximum line rental fee cannot be estimated now because of the large number of variables involved: Telstra is able to increase line rentals at different rates for business and residential customers and for different rental plans within each category. Immigration: Detention Centres (Question No. 2520) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 7 October 2003: (1) How much does it cost per day to hold someone in the Baxter Detention Centre. (2) How much did it cost to transport the Sawari family from Launceston to the Baxter Detention Centre, including the cost of the (a) charter flight, and (b) personnel who accompanied them. (3) What was the cost of the Migration Tribunal proceedings in relation to the Sawari family after their apprehension and detention in the Baxter Detention Centre. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The average cost to the Commonwealth for detention per person per day at Baxter Immigration Detention Facility (IDF) in the 2002-03 financial year was approximately $415. This amount covers the contract costs as well as certain medical services, and other administrative costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the management of the detention facilities. (2) The Sawari family was transferred from Launceston to Baxter IDF by private charter. Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) staff accompanied the Sawari family during this transfer. The total cost of the charter flight was $11,660. There were some additional incidental costs incurred such as accommodation for the DIMIA officers, which came to a total of approximately $1,320. It is not possible to attribute personnel costs in relation to the DIMIA officers that accompanied the Sawari family, as the officers were also involved in location, compliance and other activities. (3) The Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) has advised that the cost to the MRT in relation to proceedings concerning the Sawari family is $11,376. The Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) has advised that the cost to the RRT in relation to proceedings concerning the Sawari family is $3,362. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 2642) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 16 October 2003: For each of the last two financial years, (a) what was the cost to airlines for unauthorised air arrivals placed in detention centres, (b) what was the cost to each airline to return unauthorised air arrivals back to their countries, (c) what was the average time that the unauthorised arrivals have remained in detention, (d) how many unauthorised air arrivals lodged immigration applications, and (e) how many unauthorised air arrivals had successful migration outcomes and, of these, (i) how many were successful protection visa applications, and (ii) from which countries did they originate. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (a) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) does not keep separate figures for detention costs of unauthorised air arrivals for airlines. Generally, these costs are low as most persons refused entry to Australia are removed within 72 hours. (b) Under section 213(1) of the Migration Act, airlines are liable for the cost of detention and removal of non-citizens refused immigration clearance in Australia. A notice under section 217 of the Migration Act requires an airline to transport a person who is refused entry from Australia. The airline is required to comply with this notice within 72 hours. The cost to each airline to return unauthorised air arrivals back to their countries is unknown. However, it is known that airlines will often use the return portion of an unauthorised arrivals ticket. (c) The majority of unauthorised air arrivals are removed from Australia within 72 hours. Of the 1193 unauthorised air arrivals refused entry in 2001-2002, 1108 persons (93%) were removed within 72",118,Questions On Notice

(2) What should a parent do if he or she finds they have paid more to the CSA than they were required to according to the terms of their assessment. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 s.64 requires CSA to reconcile an estimate of income after the estimate period has ended, where a parent has underestimated their income for the estimate period. During the estimate period, a parent may advise CSA that their financial circumstances have changed. CSA will then increase or reduce the income used in the original assessment to reflect the parent’s changed income. When a parent estimates their income, they are informed of the need to tell CSA about any changes in income. (2) CSA will have a record where a parent has overpaid child support according to the terms of their assessment. The parent should advise CSA if they want the overpayment recovered and CSA will do so if appropriate.

National Security: Terrorism (Question No. 2824) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: (1) What was his department’s travel advice for Turkey on (a) 14 November 2003, and (b) 19 November 2003. (2) After the terrorist attack on 15 November 2003 what action did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other government authorities take to review Australian travel advice for Turkey. (3) Was the travel advice for Turkey changed between 15 and 19 November 2003; if so, to what; if not, why not. (4) Did the Government consider that the terrorist threat had increased in the wake of the 15 November 2003 attack; if so, why was the travel advice not changed; if not, on what basis was this decision made. (5) After the terrorist attack on 20 November 2003, what action did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, ASIO and other government authorities take to review the travel advice for Turkey. (6) Was the travel advice for Turkey changed after 20 November 2003; if so, to what; if not, why not. (7) Did the Government consider that the terrorist threat had increased in the wake of the 20 November 2003 attack; if so, why was the travel advice not changed; if not, on what basis was this decision made. I table the advisories relevant to the questions raised by the Honourable member. Established procedures for reviewing travel advice were followed throughout the November period, including consultation between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Embassy in Ankara and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), and review of available threat and related security information. The travel advice during November reflected current threat assessments and stated clearly that there continued to be a risk of terrorist activity throughout Turkey. The overall threat level for Australian interests in Turkey, as assessed by ASIO following the 20 November attacks, remained at HIGH. However, the fact of two sets of large-scale terrorist attacks in the space of five days led, as a precautionary measure, to an upgrading of the travel advice to recommend the deferral of non-essential travel. This change was accompanied by the warning that “there continues to be a risk of terrorist attack throughout Turkey, as underscored by the attacks against the British Consulate General and HSBC Bank in Istanbul on 20 November and those against synagogues in Istanbul on 15 November”.

This advice should be read in conjunction with our General Advice to Australian Travellers at http://www.dfat.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/General. Safety and Security Australians in Turkey should exercise a high degree of caution, particularly in commercial and public areas, including those known to be frequented by foreigners such as public transport facilities, hotels, bars and shopping areas. There continues to be a risk of terrorist activity throughout Turkey, as underscored by attacks earlier this year against Western interests in Istanbul and Izmir. Australians should also be aware that Turkish government buildings and foreign embassies in Turkey have been targeted by terrorists in the past. Australians are advised to avoid demonstrations and large public gatherings and to monitor events that might affect their safety. Particular care should be exercised in south-eastern Turkey given the heightened risk of terrorist activity. Australians should defer travel to the border region between Turkey and Iraq, given the hazardous security situation in neighbouring Iraq. As in other major cities around the world, Australians in Istanbul should be alert to the possibility of pick-pocketing, bag-snatching and minor assault. There have also been incidents where foreigners, including Australians, have been drugged and had their passports and other personal effects stolen after being befriended by English-speaking strangers of various nationalities offering drinks, food, chewing gum or confectionery laced with drugs. Prior to travel, Australians should ensure they have a variety of financial options available to them including credit cards, travellers cheques and US dollars cash.

Australians should only carry sufficient cash for their daily needs, secure their valuables against theft and avoid displays of wealth at all times. Photocopies of valuables such as passport, tickets, driving licence and travellers cheques should be kept separately. Particular care should be exercised when driving. Travel at night on most country roads, other than major freeways, is not recommended due to inadequate lighting, poor road marking and local driving practices. Snow and ice compound the danger in winter. In the event of a natural disaster, Australians should follow the advice of local authorities. Turkey is in an active seismic zone and is subject to earthquakes. Local Law and Customs Australians are reminded that when overseas, they are subject to local laws. A violation of local laws may result in a jail sentence, served in a local prison. Drug offence penalties are severe and include imprisonment.

Australians travelling to these areas are strongly encouraged to register their travel plans with the Australian Embassy in Ankara. Explicit authorisation is required for the purchase and/or removal of Turkish antiquities and other cultural artefacts. A receipt and an official certificate are needed to legally export an item. Entry and Exit Requirements Australians travelling on ordinary passports arriving in Turkey for tourism may obtain a tourist visa upon arrival for approximately USD20.00. Holders of diplomatic or official passports or Australians intending to visit Turkey for purposes other than tourism should also seek advice from a Turkish Embassy or Consulate before travel. Visa conditions are subject to change however. For up-to-date visa information, Australians should contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate of the Republic of Turkey, well in advance of travel.
