We want to work on this issue; we want changes. This debate has special significance for me as I have experienced family violence as a child. Child abuse, as you know, is not just limited to sexual abuse but also includes physical and emotional abuse and neglect. The victims and survivors of child abuse suffer a great deal over their lifetime and this suffering manifests in many ways. Disturbing research published in the journal Psychiatric Services report that 76 per cent of women and 72 per cent of men with severe mental illnesses have been abused as children. The member for Fowler on 4 September 2000 called on the government to: ... urgently focus more resources in implementing a national approach to the prevention, repair, intervention and research into child abuse. It is pleasing to see that the Minister for Community Services has responded to this and other members’ calls with the announcement of several programs designed to achieve these aims. It is a shame that the minister has failed to continue the funding for the peak women’s domestic violence body in Australia-an issue we will be talking to her about. As a founding member of the PerthWest Domestic Violence regional committee, I am aware of how limited the funding was to address the issues and community education campaigns. The funding was effective in raising community awareness in Western Australia, developing preventative programs including a men’s phone service to assist the perpetrators to stop their behaviour. Child abuse does not occur within a social vacuum. Child abuse is about family stress; it is about families in crisis; it is about families lacking communication, life skills, practical support and resources to deal with stress. A report from South Australia found that 82 per cent of referrals came from the bottom two socioeconomic categories. With 100,000 extra Australian children living in poverty, one has to ask questions. More parents are poor; poorer parents get less relief from constant child rearing. They tend to experience higher levels of conflict, family disruption, substandard and crowded housing. They simply do not get a break and their stress becomes a pressure cooker environment. Jon O’Brien in the Australian Journal of Social Issues gives a strategy for a prevention program: planned respite for families both at risk and in crisis. Research examining links between social support and child maltreatment has consistently shown that social support lessens the impact of social and economic stress, reducing rates of child maltreatment. So getting a break from the kids to recoup and deal with their own issues stops parents reaching breaking point. Government can improve family life and improve child care with a range of increased funding. I support the call of the various major children’s groups for a children’s commissioner. I support the call for a coordinated and resourced national policy and strategy for the protection of our children. I call for sustained funding for the projects in our community that achieve this aim. I call on the government to redress the impact. (Time expired) Child Abuse House have worked together to stand against the abuse of children in our cities, our towns and our communities across Australia. I am proud to join with my colleagues this morning to tell the world that we totally reject the abuse of our children and that we will continue to work",145,Notices Act To Amend The Motor Vehicle Standards

332,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (9.43 A.m.),"In recent years parliamentarians on both sides of theWednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28775 together to eradicate it from the daily reality of lives of children in Australia. In June last year, I reported to the House that, in a certain region of Queensland, it was estimated that 50 per cent of children within the juvenile court system in one region were victims of incest. To the shame of us all, I reported that innocent Australian children were being bashed, raped, mutilated and neglected on a large scale and, in some communities, their plight was being ignored by those who have a moral duty to protect them. In October last year, I reported to the House that, in 1998, 84 kindergarten and primary school children from a prosperous suburb of Melbourne had been assessed as having deviant sexual behaviour. These children had been referred to a children’s clinic for treatment. Most of the 84 children had used force to trap or to trick other children into having sex with them, and some of these children had been victimised themselves. Each of these reports referred to communities that were thousands of kilometres apart: one referred to a remote indigenous community and the other a salubrious urban area in one of our major cities. The two studies were unconnected. What concerned me about these two reports was a common contributor to sexual assault, not reported anywhere else as far as I could identify: the impact of pornography, a cause or trigger of sexual assault that people prefer not to address, or prefer to deny. Although the Aboriginal Coordinating Council brought the link between pornographic videos and child sexual assault to the attention of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991, it has been ignored. Then in 1999, the Robertson report-the ATSIC Women’s Taskforce on Violence-revealed cash on delivery orders of $4,000 to $5,000 worth of pornographic videos being delivered to isolated communities. One community, with a history of pornographic video usage, had the highest rate of men in prison for sexual offences. In the other case, it was found that while most of the children in Melbourne treated at the clinic came from homes where the parents were under stress from divorce or illness or other types of disruption, the trigger that damaged their sexual development, that sexualised these children at such a very young age and turned them into abusers, was their exposure to sexually explicit material in the form of sexually explicit videos. I raise the issue of pornographic videos and child abuse once again because I know of no domestic violence programs that are addressing this issue. If pornographic videos cannot be banned then, as a responsible government, let us put large health warnings on these videos and increase the penalties for those who allow our innocent children to view them. I continue to commit to work with my fellow parliamentarians to eradicate this national shame. I also support the call from Senator Heffernan for a commissioner for children. is the honourable member for Ryan. Child Abuse Ms SHORT (Ryan) (9.46 a.m.)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As a former dental therapist, I worked with children in the school dental service for 10 years. Through the close clinical contact that I have had with schoolchildren, I am aware that many health professionals and teachers possess special information about them. Mandating people in specific occupations to report suspected abuse will lead to increased help for children who may otherwise suffer serious harm. However, mandatory reporting has been the subject of vigorous debate throughout the world. Each state and territory of Australia has interpreted the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child differently. For example, in Queensland, section 159 of the Children and Young People Act 1999, No. 63 of 1999, contains a comprehensive list of persons-including doctors, dentists, nurses, teachers, police officers, counsellors, child-care workers, family day carers, public servants, community advocates, official visitors and prescribed per-",146,Representatives Main Committee
333,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"And now making her debut in the Main Committee28776 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 sons-who must, as soon as practicable, report to the chief executive the name or a description of the child or young person and the grounds for the person’s suspicion. In Western Australia, referrals about possible harm to children are facilitated by a series of reciprocal protocols that have been negotiated with key government and non-government agencies rather than mandatory reporting. But, in the ACT under section 103(1) of the ACT Children’s Services Act 1986, any person who suspects on reasonable grounds that a child has suffered physical, sexual, emotional abuse or neglect may notify ACT Family Services. In my opinion, there needs to be a more coherent national approach to mandatory reporting. However, it is only one part of a greater strategy to prevent child abuse. Responsibility for keeping children safe from harm and providing for their long-term well-being falls on all adults, both as family members and as members of the community. Defence Force: Operational Headquarters of Queanbeyan that for quite some time now-in fact, over a five-year period-I have been lobbying for the operational headquarters for Australia’s defence forces to be located in Queanbeyan. From the operational headquarters, the Department of Defence will coordinate the combined forces, maritime, land and air force elements for operational deployments such as those that occurred in East Timor, Bougainville and the Solomons. It is a project that has been on the Department of Defence’s drawing board for a number of years. Rather than making my intentions and representations public, instead I chose to work quietly behind the scenes and wait until the project actually became a reality and could be confirmed. That certainly occurred in the most recent budget, and it was part of the white paper as well. I also waited until I knew that Queanbeyan had a good chance of being considered for this strategic project. I now believe that Queanbeyan has a good chance with respect to this project. We have got the space; there are numerous sites around Queanbeyan which are large enough for this facility. The Lanyon Drive area, close to Jerrabomberra, is just one of those possible sites. Our local contractors are more than capable of being involved in the construction of such a project. Our residents and local traders are ready to put out the welcome mat for a work force injection of many hundreds of staff. While a number of locations in New South Wales are under consideration, I believe there is strong support within the federal government and the Department of Defence for this strategic facility to be based in the Canberra region. Many people believe that Queanbeyan is the perfect site. The support I have received from the Queanbeyan City Council has been integral to our strong position in vying for this project. I refer to Mayor Frank Pangallo and his public servant relocation taskforce, which includes businessmen Rod Studholme and Bernie Baz, together with the council’s general manager, Hugh Percy, and the council’s manager of economic development and tourism, Simon Mitchell-Taverner. I also thank Joe Murtagh and the Queanbeyan Age for their excellent reporting on the benefits that projects such as this would bring to the region. A decision on the location is expected to be considered by cabinet in the not-too-distant future. Certainly, in the weeks leading up to that decision, I will continue to push to the utmost Queanbeyan’s strengths and qualities, and the reasons why the operational headquarters for Australia’s defence forces should be located there. Child Abuse Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (9.51 a.m.)-Last night I, along with a number of my parliamentary colleagues who are here today, attended a dinner and meeting of an organisation that I had never heard of before-the Kids First Foundation. Kids First deals with an issue that we are all aware of, although perhaps not as much as we should be-child abuse. The Kids First",147,Representatives Main Committee
334,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (9.49 a.m.)-On Monday of last week, I informed the residentsWednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28777 people did not launch into graphic or sensational descriptions of the children they come into contact with-much to my relief, I have to say-but they did talk about these children in a very calm, matter-of-fact manner which made the issue very real and urgent to me. Last night we were given examples of some of the dimensions to the problem. We were told that in Australia 107,000 new cases of child abuse are reported each year, and that most of these cases are later substantiated. Most abuses are carried out by a person known, and usually known well, to the child concerned. Eighty per cent of women in prison today were the victims of child abuse, and one-third of youth suicides are related to child abuse. There are so many dimensions to the problem that it is hard to know where to start talking about the issue. The number of reports per year is currently about 107,000, but this figure has doubled in the last five years, and the obvious question is: why is this so? Several theories were put forward last night, including that maybe there is actually an absolute increase in the number of abuses taking place, but maybe there is an increasing awareness in our community of the problem and, therefore, more preparedness to report abuses-or maybe the answer to the question is a combination of both of these factors. The next scary bit for me was the fact that child abuse is carried out by a person known to the child in most circumstances. This puts paid to that strangely comforting warning we used to give our children when they were kids, that they should ‘beware of strangers’. In preparing for this speech today, I talked about the issue with a teacher that I know. He talked about the difficulty he faces in trying to tell his students that abuse is not okay. He tells his students that if they are uncomfortable about a situation or behaviour they are involved with, they should talk about it with someone they trust. The difficulty, of course, is that the person who the child would often turn to when they need support or advice is the person who is actually meting out the abuse. This teacher is encouraging his students to dob in, if you like, their father, mother or a relative, to somebody else. I was thinking about the breach of loyalty involved in doing this, and about the determination and courage that a child needs in order to take this enormous step into what must be unknown territory for them. It was pointed out last night that if we were to ask anyone in our electorates about the issues that are important to them, we would hear about health, education, unemployment and the environment. We would not hear about child abuse. The beginning of the answer to this problem is increasing the awareness of the problem, acknowledging that the problem exists at every level in our society, and accepting that we are all responsible for doing something about it, and doing something now. Adelaide Electorate: Islington Site Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (9.54 a.m.)-I am pleased to have the opportunity to provide an update on the progress of the once very badly contaminated land at the former Islington rail yards site in my electorate and to ensure that the good news is recorded on the parliamentary record, just as the extraordinary struggle to achieve the right outcome has been recorded. In 1994, Jack Watkins and Tony Ollivier came to my office with a seemingly insurmountable problem. On9 December 1994, I raised the issue in the House of Representatives-and again on 20 and 26 June 1995-explaining that a 12-hectare area north of the workshops and close to housing had effectively been used as an uncontrolled landfill. As I explained then, about 200,000 tonnes of waste-including asbestos, solid cyanide, acids, lead and arsenic-had been dumped. On 18 December 1996, after a change of government, I was able to announce that there had been very good news in the budget which would ensure that there would be funding for the clean-up. On 10 February 1997, I advised that a good, safe plan was being developed. In 1998, Transport South Australia requested that the Land Management Corporation manage the environmental remediation of the Islington site on 28778 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 a fee-for-service basis. It was able to do that because of the $5.5 million funding from the federal government which I had squeezed out of the relevant ministers at the time. The strategy resulted in the creation of a five-hectare area suitable for industrial use, which would provide an economic benefit to the state in the form of future lease revenue. In addition, the strategy provided a significant community benefit in a 250-metre wide landscape buffer zone between the industrial area and neighbouring houses. Work commenced on that site in July 1999. We are preparing for the opening later this year of what has become parkland and open space-something which will be of enormous benefit to the people who live in that area. I could not be more pleased. I pay tribute to former transport ministers Sharp and Vaile. It has been one of the longest struggles in my electorate, and I am pleased to be able to report a favourable outcome. the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 24 May, on motion by Mr Slipper: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr O’CONNOR (Corio) (9.57 a.m.)-The Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001 that we are debating here today provides for an increase in the passenger movement charge from $30 to $38, with effect from 1 July 2001. This particular increase in the passenger movement charge is being used by the government to fund a $600 million addition to Australia’s quarantine and border patrol measures. This extra funding will be shared between the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Australian Customs Service and Australia Post. This new spending will raise in the order of $70 million a year and it will fund a series of new quarantine initiatives that the Minister for Justice and Customs recently announced. The shadow minister for small business and tourism, Mr Fitzgibbon, will be following me in this debate and, in the course of the time allocated to him, he will be moving a second reading amendment related to areas of his portfolio responsibility. I mention that because he is in another place at the moment unveiling a plaque to the recently deceased Greg Wilton. We all know that the shadow minister was a good friend of Greg’s, and Mr Fitzgibbon would have led this debate in this chamber had he been able to be here at this time. I mentioned the range of initiatives that this measure will finance in the quarantine area, and they are measures that we on this side of the House do support. We are fortunate here in Australia that we are free from many of the exotic pests and diseases that have devastated agriculture in other parts of the world. Of course, any funding that can be allocated to the quarantine task to strengthen arrangements to protect Australian agriculture from the ravages of exotic pests and diseases is welcome. I will make some comments later on the manner in which the government has chosen to fund this particular initiative and why it has chosen this route, but if we go over the particular expenditures that are being undertaken over a period of some four to five years-this extra $600 million-$5.7 million is being provided for AQIS until 30 June 2001 to fund extra measures introduced in February due to the UK and European outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease. I am quoting here from the minister’s press release: $281 million from 2001-02 to 2004-05 to AQIS border operations; $238.8 million from 2001-02 to 2004-05 to ACS to support AQIS quarantine services; $68.8 million for new infrastructure at international airports and international mail centres, and ongoing costs for Australia Post, to allow greater scrutiny of incoming mail, passengers and goods;",148,Representatives Main Committee
335,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with standing order 275A,Wednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28779 $1.2 million over four years to strengthen risk management and preparedness arrangements for FMD and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), being coordinated by a high-level industry and government management group; and $0.5 million for the purchase of reagents to allow the rapid testing of suspected FMD cases as part of Australia’s surveillance program. That is a very comprehensive response by the government, and it is one that we wholeheartedly support. It is timely, because we have recently received an audit report-and I will refer to that report a little later-that really rang the bell on the gaps in our quarantine preparedness, our border control measures and other measures that we take to insulate ourselves against foot-and-mouth and other exotic pests and diseases. There are some fairly significant gaps in that and it has taken the foot-and-mouth outbreak to bring to our attention the necessity to strengthen the nation’s defences in this regard. I suspect that these measures that the government brought down were not only in response to the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the United Kingdom and the spread of that disease through Europe, but partly as a response to the rather adverse Audit Office report that showed some very significant gaps in our preparedness to meet the ravages of this and other diseases. Foot-and-mouth is a disease which has inflicted enormous costs on British agriculture and the British economy and other economies throughout Europe. It has had an absolutely devastating impact on the beef industry in the United Kingdom. There have been varying estimates of the cost of this particular outbreak, but in May of this year, the President of the UK National Farmers’ Union, Mr Ben Gill, gave all farm leaders an update on the devastating footand-mouth disease outbreak, in a release that was issued by the NFF. He said the disease could cost the UK as much as $A25 billion. Recent estimates are as high as $A30 billion. That is nearly equivalent to the amount that this government has shrunk the surplus, in a very short period of time. That gives you an idea of the dimensions of this. Mr O’CONNOR-It is about as much in current dollars as the deficit that the Prime Minister left Labor back in 1983. That will give you an idea of the extent of the economic impact of this disease. He said it could cost the UK as much as $A25 billion, and was far from being under control. In May 2001 he indicated that there have been 1,593 cases confirmed, and an average of six new cases are still being confirmed each day, compared to 43 a day in March. More than 2.65 million animals have been slaughtered and a further 75,000 head of stock are tagged to be killed. This is the devastating impact of this disease on the UK beef industry. It is not the only cost, though, that will have to be borne by the British public because of this outbreak. There are ancillary costs associated with the impact on the national export performance of the British economy. There have been devastating impacts on local communities and massive social dislocation. And there have been huge impacts on the tourism industry, which is also very important to the British economy. In addition you have the significant environmental costs that are associated with the clean-up. If we did suffer a similar outbreak in Australia our livestock industries would face similar devastation. Dr John Weaver, a prominent South Australian, said in an ABC News Online bulletin on Tuesday, 5 June that an outbreak in this country would take some six to 12 months to control. In his view, with agriculture accounting for a much greater proportion of Australia’s GDP-20 per cent-the impact here could be much more dramatic. He had this to say: I think the problem comes if the disease gets into a big sheep market and gets dispersed throughout the country, it’s the nightmare scenario … It is really a nightmare scenario, one which any minister for agriculture anywhere has to contemplate. From my conversations with former Labor ministers for agriculture Kerin, Crean",150,Representatives Main Committee
336,Mr Baird,"Not as much as we have shrunk the deficit.28780 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 and Collins-very prominent members of the Labor Party-I recall that one of their great fears was of being in the driver’s seat during one of these exotic disease outbreaks. With the best intentions we do attempt to insulate ourselves from these sorts of incidents, but we live in a world where increased trade is taking place. We now have an export based economy, not only in manufactured and processed goods but also in livestock and certain raw materials or commodities from the agricultural sector. We import many foodstuffs, and with the movement of passengers to and from Australia there is great danger that exotic diseases may be brought unintentionally into this country. The nightmare for those agriculture ministers was-and, I guess, is now for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry-that one of these exotic disease outbreaks might occur on the minister’s watch. I have never been one to play heavy politics over this issue. Despite the best intentions of any minister and despite whatever enormous resources the government might put into this task, there is always the possibility, the danger-the reality-of an outbreak that could have a devastating impact. Australia’s livestock industries are very sensitive on this matter, as they should be. We on this side certainly support the measures that the government has put in place. They are sensible and timely, although some could say that they are long overdue and prompted not only by the particular outbreak but also by some aspects of an audit report that pointed to significant gaps in our preparedness. I will quote from page 16 of that report, Managing for quarantine effectiveness, in which the Australian National Audit Office rang the bell on the fact that this situation had been allowed to drift. The report had this to say: The value of current border effectiveness measures is limited as they do not address the likelihood of seizable material approaching and breaching the border, or the potential consequence(s) of such an event. The ANAO has undertaken estimates of the former, using available AFFA data. Estimates of the latter, that is how ‘risky’ the material escaping detection is, could not be made because of the absence of relevant AFFA data. The ANAO estimates indicate that almost 90 per cent of seizable material arriving by mail, and more than half arriving carried by international airline passengers, enters Australia undetected. These rates, and differences in the rates between entry routes within these two programs, suggest aspects of border operations warrant priority management review and action, including assessing the consequences of barrier breaches, and appropriate cost-benefit options for dealing with them. That report was undertaken long before the government announced these particular measures. I would imagine that the minister and the government had wind of the report. Some of the measures that have been announced by the minister are specifically designed to overcome some of the problems that have been identified in this report. So the minister’s response is timely-firstly, given the outbreak that has occurred and the dangers to Australia as a result of that and, secondly, in light of this Audit Office report. Although we have strengthened the frontline-what we would call the first tier-of defence against this particular disease and others, I think it is very important to give some consideration to what the industry terms the second-tier defences. A letter was sent to me by a young student in a veterinary course in a New South Wales university recently. Unfortunately, I left it in my electorate office when I came here. I would have liked to have quoted from that letter in my speech. I am referring to the issue that was raised by that student, although I do not have his name with me at present. The student was bemoaning the fact that it was increasingly difficult to attract students into veterinary courses and that our universities were contracting resources to students in this area. This student recognised a very important gap that we are facing in what we call the second-tier defence. It relates to our preparedness to cope with a major exotic disease incursion once that outbreak has occurred. We have that frontline defence, but a second-line defence is required if an outbreak should occur in Australia, with effective infrastructure in place to contain that outbreak and to limit its damage. Over the last decade we have seen a declining number of what we would call ‘large animal’ vets. These people are very important to Australia’s livestock industries. We have also seen Wednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28781 generally a declining number of vets in rural and regional Australia. We have also seen state government veterinary and livestock offices in Australia’s rural regions being run down. There has been a consequent decline in our ability to manage a large-scale exotic disease outbreak. These are very important issues that will need to be addressed by any future government, because it is not just the frontline defence that is important; the second-line defence is also very important. In conclusion, I want to refer to the funding issue, because we ought to note in this debate that the government is using a passenger movement charge to fund these expenditures. They are, if you like, new taxes. No matter what way you dress them up, they are new taxes. It is a bit like the milk tax which raised about $1.9 billion for a restructure package for the dairy industry. It is a favourite technique used by the Howard government to raise money in the face of the fact that it has blown the surplus. I think we need to address the issue of funding of these sorts of expenditures head on. The Prime Minister said that he would never, ever introduce a GST. After spectacularly breaking that promise came his promise not to introduce any new taxes and not to increase existing taxes. The Clerk of the Senate prepared a document recently that indicated that 113 new taxes or tax increases had been instituted by this government. The increase in the passenger movement charge that we are debating here today increases that figure to 114-114 broken promises on the taxation front. That is a spectacular backdown on the government’s position that the Prime Minister put to the Australian people-that he would not introduce any new taxes or increase existing ones. These expenditures would have been, I would imagine, financed out of the budget surplus which was trumpeted by the Treasurer in the 1998-99 budget, when he said that that surplus would amount to $14.56 billion in 2001-02. Well, honey, he shrunk the surplus; it is now down to $1.5 billion, and heading south. Mr O’CONNOR-I mention this because you portray yourselves as great fiscal managers; really, you could not run a country dance. Here it is: in 1998-99, $14.5 billion. ‘Honey, I shrunk the surplus; it is down to $1.5 billion.’ You come into this House and introduce a new tax, a new passenger movement charge. (Time expired) Corio’s speech on the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001. It was quite amazing to hear him attack the level of the surplus that this government has instituted, having brought about an $80 billion total debt through the deficits that Labor produced in successive budgets. Yet he criticises us for the size of our surplus. Hypocrisy, your name is Labor! I also found it very interesting that he thundered on about using this mechanism of the passenger movement charge to raise revenue, because I checked when the passenger movement charge was introduced. In fact, it was introduced on 1 January 1995, levied at a rate of $27 per departure. By whom was it instituted and introduced? None other than the government that was in power at the time, represented by the member for Corio. It only takes them a couple of years before they say, ‘How shocking, how dreadful to use the passenger movement charge to raise revenue.’ And who instituted it? The Labor Party when they were in government. It is a breathtaking level of hypocrisy. He was going along all right. He said this was a good approach; that, in terms of bipartisanship, we needed to take all these measures; and what a problem would be caused if these pests and diseases entered this country. Of course, he went on to say, ‘You can’t use this measure.’ We remember the l-a-w claims-that they would never increase taxes during Mr Keating’s time in office. What did they do? Of course, they increased the wholesale sales tax right",151,Representatives Main Committee

338,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.17 A.m.),"I was particularly interested to hear the member for28782 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 across the board on everything. So it is just stunning when we hear these claims being made. It is as if none of us can check what the details were. It is also particularly interesting to listen to the member for Corio speak about the impact of foot-and-mouth disease on Europe. It has been devastating right across Europe. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been lost, and very large percentages of herds have been culled, with a devastating impact on the farming community not only in Britain but in many other countries in Europe. Not the least of the impacts has been the impact on tourism. I heard the member for Corio say that there has been a massive impact on the tourism industry. We recognise this, and this is one of the reasons why the action was taken and why you would use the passenger movement charge as a vehicle to recover the cost of instituting these changes. I notice that the member for Hunter, who is going to speak in this debate in a very short space of time-it is just a pity that we did not have the pleasure of listening to his hypocrisy as well-said in relation to the decision to increase the passenger movement charge by $8: ... so you can imagine their angerthis was after the budget came downwhen theythe Australian Tourist Commissionlearned that notwithstanding the fact they had been denied additional funding in the budget, the passenger movement charge had been increased, though not to assist tourism but to fund the government’s foot-and-mouth program. This is the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for tourism, saying this. If he does not know what the impact would be if foot-and-mouth disease came into this country, he should be ashamed of himself. Here he is, the person who is supposed to be the shadow spokesperson on tourism in this place, decrying the facts of this. I know that there is a particular tourism group that has been expressing the view that, yes, what the government should do is put up the passenger movement charge and that that could simply be used to fund an increase for the ATC. The change was made and the increase was there, but it went to an absolutely vital part of the tourism industry. SoI want to say to the member for Corio and the member for Hunter: let us get this argument on an appropriate basis; let us consider what the impact is across the board. It would be devastating for the agricultural sector if we did not see these changes and it would be devastating for the tourism industry. We would see that instead of the increases that we have been seeing. I note the press release that was issued this very week by the federal Minister for Tourism, Jackie Kelly, which said: The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Survey of Tourist Accommodation March Quarter 2001 revealed a 5.2 per cent increase in the supply of guest rooms in hotels and a 9.4 per cent increase in the supply of serviced apartments, compared with the same period last year. What would be the situation if we saw an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in this country? We would not be seeing these figures; we would be seeing a massive drop, so if ever an industry sector should be pleased by the initiative the government is taking it is the tourism industry. I actually hosted a function at which key representatives of the tourism industry from around Australia met with the Treasurer to discuss their concerns. I have to say to you, in all honesty, that not one of them raised this as an issue. Why didn’t they raise it? Because they are aware of the importance of this program for the industry. So much for the hypocrisy I hear from the member for Corio and the member for Hunter, who I understand is going to make a change to this. He is going to put an amendment so that we increase the passenger movement charge further-this is despite the member for Corio claiming this was inappropriate-to give a funding increase to the Australian Tourist Commission, which is funded to the order of $100 million a year and of course is part of a four-year program. This government increased fundWednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28783 ing to the Australian Tourist Commission by some $50 million over a four-year period and so it receives about $100 million a year. That is an overall record in terms of funding-and we have this political charade going on. I am very pleased to see that the former minister for tourism has entered the chamber, because he was the minister who lobbied to get this $50 million increase over a four-year period for the ATC. We are coming to the end of the four-year period. The increase in funding over the four-year period was very significant and well received, and the then minister was applauded by the tourism industry. He is the one who organised the increase in funding and he did a great job for the tourism industry. This is an important piece of legislation. I congratulate both ministers. I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on suspending imports of all products from FMD affected countries and on providing extra scrutiny of travellers who have recently visited a farm or abattoir and ongoing monitoring of AQIS and Customs border control procedures under the new conditions. It is a first-rate initiative to protect our borders, our livestock and of course the interests of the tourism industry. It is an initiative which I believe serves the country well. X-raying the baggage of all those who have been in affected areas overseas and more intensive checks are appropriate. I know that my colleague the member for Pearce will speak at some length in her usual incisive way on the same issue. In summary, I believe this is a great initiative. It is about protecting Australia’s borders, it is about protecting our livestock and it is about protecting the tourism industry. The games being played by the members of the opposition when they know this is a great initiative, when they know the intent of the bill, are breathtaking in their hypocrisy. The people of Australia know what the situation is and they will remember. When I have my Sunday morning consultations, people say to me, ‘If the Labor Party gets into power, are we going to have another $85 billion racked up in debt?’ I say, ‘Well, this is their track record.’ Mr Martin Ferguson-What is your track record on infrastructure? will be, even in your dreams. I shudder at the thought of you being in charge of anything to do with transport in this country. You read all your speeches when you come into the House. Not a single new initiative have I heard come out of your mouth. In the time you have been the shadow minister for transport I have not heard one new initiative come out of your mouth. In responding specifically to the member for Batman and his lack of any knowledge about transport, the rail linkMr Martin Ferguson-The financial world tells me about you, and you are a failure. member for Batman and address his remarks through the chair. very proud of that rail link and the people of Sydney are very proud of it. I am very pleased to listen to the member for Batman. He not only reads every single word when he comes into the House but also has not made one statement about transport that anybody can remember. I look forward to his pronouncements in the future. But what we have with this bill is a minister who knows what he is doing. The minister has brought forward real initiatives and is protecting not only the livestock and agricultural industries but also the tourism industry across this country. Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001. In doing so, I would clearly indicate that the opposition does regard this as an important bill. This is also a debate about the government suggesting that a tax is not a tax. The facts will show that, contrary to what the Prime Minister has said in the context of the recent budget, this actually represents a major and dishonest increase in taxation and an endeavour by the current government to create a smokescreen that",153,Representatives Main Committee

342,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.29 A.m.),"I rise to address the Passenger28784 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 there have been no increases in taxation. I want to also make it clear that we just heard one of the world’s greatest hypocrites when it comes to public accountability and a waste of taxpayers money, a person who is committed to rorting the Australia parliamentary superannuation system to gain two parliamentary pensions at the expense of ordinary Australian taxpayers. When they talk about superannuation reform, he is awfully silent on these issues. The passenger movement charge bill clearly is an important bill. We have had enough of the hypocrisy of the previous speaker. We are talking about a very substantial increase in the passenger movement charge from $30 to $38. Obviously, the charge is collected by airlines and shipping companies and is supposed to recoup the cost of customs, immigration and quarantine processing of passengers, as well as the cost of issue of short-term visas. The increase in the charge, as we all understood it, was announced in the budget as ‘a quarantine measure’ by the government. It was a quarantine measure to protect the country from footand-mouth disease and other risks to our environment and agriculture. The opposition will not be opposing the bill at this time. However, in commenting on the bill, I am going to expose the hypocrisy and doubletalk coming from the government about the rationale for this increase. I say hypocrisy and doubletalk because this government says one thing and does another thing. If you listen to the minister for agriculture, the reason for the quite substantial increase in the passenger movement charge of 21 per cent-even better than the GST hit of 10 per cent-is to fund the fight against the threat of foot-and-mouth disease spreading into Australia. However, what the government has persistently and conveniently failed to mention is that it was already creaming off the top of revenue from the charge of about $80 million per annum and then putting this into consolidated revenue prior to the increase of 21 per cent from $30 to $38. In essence, the government, through the passenger movement charge, was already creaming off Australian taxpayers’ funds to the tune of $80 million through the surplus collected as against the outlays for the original intent of the passenger movement charge. So much for honesty and integrity from the Howard government in terms of budget processes. In the words of the department in Senate estimates, there was an over-recovery of the charge of $80 million. They did not discount that $80 million in working out the increase of 21 per cent; they actually took that and desired and intended to take more-more creaming by the current government. Moreover, not only was it revealed in estimates that there was an over-recovery of some $80 million, but also it was revealed that the charge is not a charge at all; it is actually a tax. Irrespective of what the government would like the Australian taxpayers to believe, this is not a passenger movement charge. It is a tax, hence the creaming of $80 million per annum into consolidated revenue. The facts will show that it is a tax that the government has tried to deny. This denial is part of the government’s permanent state of denial when it comes to telling the truth about taxation and most government initiatives. Let us consider, for example, just the context of last month’s budget. When you go to those facts, it was a pitiful and rather embarrassing spectacle of the Prime Minister getting out there in his post-budget spin cycle and trying to claim, as he did on a number of occasions, that he had not increased any taxes in the 2001 budget. I will just give you a couple of examples. On 27 May on Meet the Press the Prime Minister said: We do not intend to increase tax. I mean, we are a tax cutting government. We are not, as Mr Beazley falsely alleged ... the biggest taxing government. We are taking a lesser amount of tax than the previous government. We do not intend to increase any taxes in our next term, full stop. When he was asked later about the increase in the passenger movement charge-which is a tax, as confirmed by the department in Senate estimates-what do we find? The Prime Minister was suddenly at a loss for words, and this is what he had to say: Wednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28785 Yeah, well that is, I mean, something like that, I mean, I don’t know about things, and I’m talking about … a tax is something which is a regularly occurring impost on the Australian public. And when I say we’re not going to increase taxes, I mean income taxnot passenger chargesI mean indirect tax, I mean petrol excise, I mean company tax, I mean Medicare levies. Strangely, the department itself actually says that the passenger movement charge is a tax. The Prime Minister misled the Australian public, in the context of the recent budget, in statements about so-called ‘no increases in tax’. The debate today is about an increase in tax. It is about an increase in taxation of 21 per cent on one single item in the current budget processes. We have had the spin doctors, led by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and all the willynillies on the backbench on the government side trying to suggest to the Australian public that there will be no increases in taxation. Well, today we have a debate about ‘when is a tax not a tax?’ The passenger movement charge is a tax, and it has been increased by 21 per cent. Even worse, the Prime Minister then had the gall to try to accuse the opposition leader of slithering around on the tax front. The Australian people know full well that there is only one person who has perfected the art of slithering when it comes to broken tax promises. It is like ‘never, ever’: ‘We will never, ever have a GST.’ We all remember that statement, don’t we? Now, in the most recent example, we have the ‘never, ever’ statement that ‘I’ll never, ever increase taxes in this term, in this budget’. We are debating such an increase in taxation today despite another statement by the Prime Minister that ‘we aren’t increasing taxation’. Never, ever-what a load of rubbish. It is more like ‘never, ever tell the truth’ on the other side of the parliament. The point is-and this is important-that this charge was intended as a cost recovery device for the purpose of covering customs, immigration, quarantine and the issuing of shortterm visas. That was the intent of the passenger movement charge. The problem is that this government has turned it into a tax and has used it to pad consolidated revenue to the tune of $80 million, and it has not been up-front and honest about that. It was only as a result of questioning by the opposition in Senate estimates that we established those facts. The bill, therefore, is increasing a tax on the whim of the government, with no proper accountability but with an endeavour to suggest that it is for other purposes. The time has come for a bit of honesty and integrity in government. Australian taxpayers are prepared to pay their way. They are prepared to put their hands in their pockets and front up to the requirements of this country, such as those on the quarantine front, such as those trying to keep foot-and-mouth disease out of Australia. But they want politicians to tell the truth about the basis of charges going to our need to have programs in place to make sure we protect our country. Our capacity as politicians should be to bring the Australian public along on that front, be it expenditure on quarantine, health, education or the need for detention centres-whether or not it is now questioned by some on the other side of the parliament. Australians are prepared to pay their way, provided politicians are prepared to tell the truth and be up-front about the charges and the way they are allocated in the budget processes. I also believe that the worse aspect of all the government’s hypocrisy and doubletalk is its failure to distribute any of the revenue gleaned from the charge to the industry that arguably is the most affected by the increase-and that is tourism. I also note the cheap shot made by the previous speaker about the fact that the member for Hunter is not here at the moment. I simply acknowledge that the reason the member for Hunter is not here today is that he is in attendance at a ceremony to honour the passing of the former member for Isaacs, Mr Wilton. Mrs MoylanMr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My colleague did not criticise the member for Hunter for not being in this chamber; he simply said that it was a pity that the order of the debate was the way it was-and I want that on the record. 28786 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 vise him that the member for Corio did make that explanation. an explanation, yet the previous speaker chose to take issue with it. this to continue. Please get back to the content of the bill. with respect to the content of this bill, and there was no point of order with respect to the member for Pearce. But continuing: not only is this government out of touch and mean of spirit-and it is your government, Mr Deputy Speaker-but it is a short-sighted government. government. He should be fully aware that occupants of the chair itself have no government and no party. Confine your remarks to the government itself, not to the chair. now in attendance. The coalition government, which includes representatives for many northern river seats in New South Wales, is a mean-spirited and short-sighted government. It is not as though the passenger movement charge has not been linked to tourism before. In 1998 the charge was increased by $3 to raise the revenue for the added cost of moving people and equipment to the Olympics. At that time this increase was linked to Australian tourism-surprise, surprise-by the coalition government. I will tell you why it was linked: it was linked to help with the extra work in the lead-up to the games. However, the Tourism Commission no longer receives this money. Tourism, one of the keys to regional economies, was dudded in the budget, and the tourism sector has been practically ignored by the Howard government. The passenger movement charge was increased by 21 per cent, but the tourism industry was once again left out in the cold. So much for support for regional tourism by the Howard government. The Australian Tourism Commission was asking for an extra $10 million over the four years that would mainly go to advertising overseas to potential visitors our great tourism destinations, including regional Australia-because tourism is exceptionally important to regional economies and employment in regional Australia. I believe that this lack of funding poses a serious threat to the future viability of the tourism sector and has grave implications for tourism jobs, particularly in regional Australia and many regional economies. The Australian Tourism Commission is struggling, as we all appreciate, to compensate for the decline in its purchasing power because of the declining dollar-another achievement of the Howard government. We all know that inbound tourism is a huge generator of jobs and opportunities. Inbound tourism generates about 40 per cent of jobs outside capital cities and 38 per cent of the jobs of young people. There are 100,000 small to medium businesses of 20 or fewer employees in tourism. Tourism is Australia’s fourth largest export industry. In 2001, $2.5 billion will be spent in regional Australia as a result of tourism. I would simply note that, with operators struggling to afford the costs of marketing their products internationally, the government’s lack of initiative places at risk the creation of an estimated 75,000 new jobs in this sector. All the ATC wanted was $10 million, and it needed that $10 million to bolster its international advertising efforts in the face of a sliding Australian dollar. I believe that, through its inaction, the government is jeopardising future tourism growth. But then, would you be surprised? It is only jobs and regional Australia-issues that are not very important to the Howard government. I go again to the issue of honesty and integrity. When you talk about honesty and integrity in government, I believe there is a requirement for more transparency from this government with respect to these issues.

348,Mr Martin Ferguson,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I note that the member for Hunter isWednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28787 esses to reveal the extent of the skimming of this tax. I call on the minister to reveal exactly how much of this additional $8 passenger charge, an increase of 21 per cent, will actually go to the fight against foot-and-mouth disease. There is no doubt that we support the fight against the potential dire and catastrophic consequences of the disease, but the Australian public does not support hidden tax hits. For that reason the minister must reveal to the parliament and in this debate precisely how much of the $8 will go to the campaign and exactly how much will go to consolidated revenue over and above the additional $80 million that was already being skimmed off as a result of previous government initiatives. I understand the government has an amendment to ensure that the extra $8 is charged on tickets sold after 1 July this year. The opposition supports this amendment, as it corrects another very dishonest and tricky act of this government with respect to this bill. In the budget the government thought that it could get away with not making transitory arrangements for pre-sold tickets. In the absence of those arrangements, the airlines alone-and some of those airlines are doing it exceptionally tough at the moment-stood to lose millions of dollars because of the impracticality of recovering the extra $8 from pre-sold tickets. I am pleased that as a result of their lobbying efforts and the support of the opposition an arrangement has now been agreed with the board of airline representatives, but not without a concerted effort and a campaign from the airlines. In supporting the amendment to fix this issue, I assume the minister will also tell the parliament how much that attempt at trickiness and dishonesty meant in dollar terms until the government was exposed and forced to back-pedal. The bill is important. The Labor Party supports the endeavours to make sure that our shores are protected. But I will tell you what is also important: people are looking for honesty from their governments. This government and this Prime Minister have not been honest in the way they have dealt with the increase in the passenger movement charge. However, despite that dishonesty by the Howard government, the opposition is supportive of the fight against the spread of foot-and-mouth. As I said at the outset, it is a worthy fight and for that reason we will not be opposing the bill. But we are moving a second reading amendment condemning the government for, firstly, ignoring the concerns of the tourism industry and its lack of consultation or viable funding options for the Australian Tourist Commission and, secondly, breaking its promise not to increase taxes. That is what it was-it was a promise to the Australian community not to increase taxes. The department has said that the passenger movement charge is a tax. It has been increased by 21 per cent-far higher than the CPI or any other indexes that are sometimes used by all three levels of government in Australia to justify increases in taxation. Never let it be forgotten that the passenger movement charge-and I am waiting for the opposition’s explanation, including from the back bench, with respect to this issue-is not a charge. It is, in fact, a tax-a tax that the Howard government has increased. I look forward to some honesty and transparency from the minister to at least confirm that the extra $8 will be used for what he is says it will be used for. That is why we require a full explanation about how the $8, an increase of 21 per cent, will be spent, on what it will be spent and, importantly, whether or not there is any surplus like the current $80 million that is being skimmed off due to existing arrangements with the passenger movement charge. If it is not for that purpose, I look forward to the minister doing the right thing by the tourist industry and spending some of the extra money collected to help them out in their current time of need. If we can find $5 million to restore old pubs in regional Australia, then I would have thought we could find $10 million to promote tourism in regional Australia and generate jobs and prosperity. One would venture to suggest that $10 million spent on the promotion of tourism in regional Australia is money better spent than $5 million spent on pork-barrelling and the renovation of old pubs in regional Australia. (Time expired) 28788 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 had to say. He gave a very impressive speech up until the time he got political about it. I was surprised because I know the opposition are going to support this bill. I did not think the member for Corio did himself any justice in becoming political about it. I listened to the shadow minister for transport who said this debate is about tax. Well, it is not about tax. He wants to make it about tax, but it is not about tax. It is about protecting every Australiantheir health, their financial well-being and the future of this country. That is what this bill is all about. Quite frankly, when I see the level of debate that is carried on in this chamber I understand why the public out there are cynical, because I am sick and tired of it. With the claims and the counterclaims, it is no wonder the public feel disenchanted with the way this place operates. I am not going to have a lot to say. I do not want to add to this politicisation and the claims and counterclaims about promises that have been given or broken, because we can find such problems throughout history. WhatI want to make a note of is that the shadow minister for transport calls this a tax. It is a tax, but who introduced it? The Labor Party introduced this. He talks about a 21 per cent increase. This is an increase at a time when we have seen one of the worse episodes in the world of foot-and-mouth in the UK this year, and we have seen high levels of passenger movement due to the Olympic Games-more than Australia has ever seen-so a 21 per cent increase is not unreasonable. The notes prepared by the information research services of the Parliamentary Library give a little history on the levying of what was called a departure tax. It used to be called a departure tax. No-one is hiding from that fact. But who changed the name in 1995 from ‘departure tax’ to ‘passenger movement charge’? It was the Labor Party when they were in government. It changed in 1995. They changed the name of it. They wanted to hide from the Australian public that this was a tax. There is no need to hide this, because the Australian public know the reason for this charge being levied, and in this case the reason for its increase, is for the good of every single Australian. There would not be a person out there in the street that you would canvass who would say that this was not a responsible thing for government to do. It was the Labor Party that introduced the tax and it was the Labor Party that changed the name of it from a departure tax to a passenger movement charge. In 1988 the charge was $10. What did the Labor Party increase it to? In 1991 the rate was increased to $20. It was doubled, and there were not the sorts of circumstances that we have experienced in recent times that justify this small increase in the passenger movement charge. Talk about disgraceful hypocrisy! With this level of debate, I understand why the Australian public are cynical about what goes on in this place. We are here to debate the proper protection of the community’s interest, not to politicise it in this way. In 1994, the then Labor government further increased this charge to $25. From a $10 charge in 1991 they doubled the charge to $20. Then they changed it again to $25 and in 1995 they changed the name from ‘departure tax’ to ‘passenger movement charge’. I rest my case on that. I am having nothing more to say about attempted scoring of political points in this chamber this morning. We all looked on in horror as the graphic reports of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom earlier this year highlighted the importance of Australia’s quarantine laws to this country and to every member of the Australian community. Not one person would be unaffected if the Australian government did not implement appropriate measures to ensure that that outbreak did not occur in Australia. The cost of the outbreak in the United Kingdom was immense, but more than a dollar value can be applied to the heartbreak and tragedy in the UK. There was the heartbreak and the distress of the people who had to destroy their livestock and breeding herds. While there was financial hardship for those who were both directly and indirectly employed in the livestock industry, I imagine that many Australians were, like me, touched by the heart-rending stories of farmers who said, ‘We knew every animal in our dairy",158,Representatives Main Committee
349,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (10.50 A.m.),"I listened intently to what the member for CorioWednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28789 herd by name. They were part of the family.’ You could not but be touched by the human tragedy, distress, concern and hurt of the people who had to destroy their animals. The financial cost to the United Kingdom was estimated at the time to be around $12 billion. The member for Corio pointed out that it has been estimated that that cost could escalate to $25 billion. That is an immense amount of money and it has caused huge financial hardship and lost production. In addition, the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK cost the tourism industry something in the order of $7 billion. They are the figures that I have seen. Who can tell? It will probably go beyond that. I know that many important events, including sporting events, had to be cancelled throughout the UK because of the outbreak of this disease. It was certainly a tragic year for UK farmers, food producers and the tourism sector. At the end of the day, not one life is untouched in some way by such an event. Australia has always had a rigorous quarantine service, and it is imperative that our reputation as a clean food provider be maintained. This government has taken a responsible decision to ensure that, in these unusual circumstances, funding is there to provide for continuing improvement of quarantine services in this country. The value of the livestock industry in exports alone is estimated to be about $15 billion, or about 19 per cent of our total exports. The threat of this disease makes everyone shudder in my electorate of Pearce in Western Australia, which has a large number of primary producers. We produce some of the best cheeses in the world. In Western Australia and, in particular, in my electorate, we produce some of the best fine wool in the world. This adds greatly to economic and social stability in the electorate of Pearce. It would cause devastating losses if foot-and-mouth disease were introduced into my electorate. We export a large amount of beef and lamb. This is very valuable to the community of Pearce and to Australia because its adds to our capacity to export. The government has done a great deal to strengthen the protection barriers. Almost $600 million was allocated to safeguarding Australia’s borders in a package recently announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in order to prevent the introduction of exotic pests and diseases. So it is not just foot-and-mouth disease that we have to be concerned about. We live in a highly mobile community and in a time of rapid transportation. It means that we have to become more and more vigilant about our quarantine measures and the protection of our borders. The value of Australia’s agricultural and fisheries exports is about $24 billion, so there is a great deal at stake. These measures include things like strengthening border operations and quarantine services infrastructure at airports and international mail centres. The number of AQIS and Customs border staff will be increased by about 1,200. There is a lot of talk about where the money is going to go. An increase of almost 1,000 quarantine inspectors, people on the ground, has been announced as part of this measure. There will be an additional 49 X-ray machines, on top of what is already there. I do not think I mentioned the dog detector teams. There will be quite a substantial increase in dog detector teams. They have been very effective in airports, international mail exchanges and seaports. They are going to triple in number. With the new X-ray machines in place, it is proposed that all cargo and mail entering Australia will be inspected or X-rayed. All arriving passengers will be screened and in most cases their luggage will be inspected or X-rayed by AQIS officers. Improved risk management responses and rapid testing were addressed as part of the improvement to Australia’s surveillance program. This bill builds on these other measures taken by the government to provide improved quarantine services. As I said, we live in an era of rapid transport and of great mobility of people, which increases the risk of introduced pests and diseases. It is important that Australia remains vigilant at all times; that the public understand the risks-as they appear to do, from what I hear when I travel around my electorateand that they cooperate with the government, particularly having regard to the problems in the 28790 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 nd that they cooperate with the government, particularly having regard to the problems in the UK over the past few months. There has been a lot of cooperation when extra measures cause some delays to passenger movement and also to the delivery of freight. I think that indicates that the public view this as a very serious issue, and they expect a responsible government to act, to be responsive, to be flexible and to be able to put in place the measures that are required at particular times when these problems emerge. No government can predict these kinds of events. They occur from time to time. We would hope that they do not, but they do. So we have to take every possible action to ensure that we protect the public against the spread of these diseases in Australia. In order to deal with the cost of this extra activity, to ensure that we remain free of footand-mouth disease, the government has introduced this bill in order to increase the passenger movement charge-or the departure tax, as it used to be called. It proposes to implement an increase in the charge in relation to passenger movement to be levied under the Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978. This charge is to be levied on all passengers leaving Australia for an overseas destination, and it will be collected by airlines and shipping companies as part of the ticketing arrangements. It will be administered by the Australian Customs Service. The current charge, as we have heard, is $30 per passenger departing Australia, and the purpose of the bill is to increase that by $8 per person. As always, the usual exemptions will remain in place for crew members, diplomats and children under the age of 12 years. The experience of the United Kingdom illustrates that the relatively modest increase in the passenger movement charge is money well spent. Not only does it offer some additional protection for the livestock industry and the many people employed in it but also it protects the interests of the tourism industry, which is vital. I met with a large group of tourist operators recently in this place and they have been doing well. I think they recognise that this is an important measure. I did hear some criticism from a small group, but I think that criticism is short-sighted in terms of the damage the introduction of the foot-and-mouth disease into Australia could do to the tourism industry, as we saw in Britain. I have already mentioned that it was estimated that Britain lost about $7 billion. I am sure that it is probably going to blow out beyond that. So many major events had to be cancelled and that caused a loss of thousands of tourists into the UK during that period. Not all of the cost is financial-it is the distress of the loss of milking herd and the needless destruction of animals, which was very distressing to everyone who witnessed it. The $8 increase is a small price to pay for the insurance against such an event occurring in Australia. I am sure the measures taken by the government are welcomed by all Australians, whatever industry, occupation or position they hold in our community. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease would affect all meat, dairy and live animal industries as well as a large section of the food production industry. As we saw in Britain, we had to ban from our shelves certain UK products that contained animal product. So it would also have a big impact on our growing food production value-added industry, resulting in extensive business closures, loss of jobs and tremendous financial hardship. The small amount of discomfort and delay that may be caused to passenger and freight movement and the small increase in the levy are a very small price to pay for a rigorous system to ensure that Australia remains free of foot-and-mouth disease. I think the Australian public do not want us in the House to be pointing the finger at each other, making claims and counterclaims on such an important issue. They want us to be responsible in government, to take the decisions that are necessary to protect every Australian. in the chamber during this debate because as a former tourism minister-a very good tourism minister-he will understand only too well the challenges facing the tourism sector, but I will return to that later.",160,Representatives Main Committee
350,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (11.08 A.m.),"I am pleased that the member for Wentworth isWednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28791 The Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001 gives effect to the Treasurer’s budget announcement: that quarantine protection to Australia’s arrival points will be strengthened to protect the country from foot-and-mouth disease and other risks to our environment and agricultural sectors. The opposition supports the principles of the new arrangements announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry last month. As a result of these arrangements, all cargo and mail entering Australia will be inspected and passengers and luggage arriving by air will be screened and/or inspected by AQIS officers. Indeed, the spending measures associated with this initiative are vital to ensuring the integrity of Australia’s biodiversity and the viability of the country’s agriculture and tourism industries. I want to move on to the issue raised by the member for Batman and others, and that is the issue of the revenue measure and associated taxation arrangements. Therefore, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) ignoring the concerns of the tourism industry in this matter; and (2) failing to consult on viable funding options for the Australian Tourist Commission, and breaking its promise not to increase taxes”. I believe the amendment has been distributed. The opposition has reservations about the way in which the government will fund the measures identified in the bill-measures which I have pointed out that the opposition supports. In order to fund the measures, the government will be increasing the passenger movement charge-which in legal terms is a tax-levied on passengers departing Australia. The increase is of the order of 21 per cent, from $30 to $38. It will come into effect from 1 July this year. I appeal to the government to listen to the concerns of those who operate in the tourism industry, particularly the airline sector, which is concerned about the fact that it is going to have difficulty recovering the additional charge from those who have purchased tickets pre 1 July for use after that date. The government have proved, and are still proving, how absurd their pre-election promises not to increase taxes were. Their sweeping statements about never, ever increasing taxes are starting to sound very hollow indeed. Since the 1996 election, if my count is correct, there have been over 120 instances where the coalition have increased taxes. I am sure the Australian public would not be surprised by this tally, especially those in the small business community, who have borne the brunt of the Howard government legacy of broken promises on the GST. Of course, 85 per cent of the tourism sector is composed of small businesses. This segment was promised that, as a result of the GST, it would enjoy greater profitability and greater cash flow benefits. There is an almost universal consensus in the sector, amongst accountants and the peak small business and tourism bodies, that that has not been the case; that, indeed, the GST has had a detrimental impact on cash flows and a detrimental impact on the profitability of small firms, including those operating in the tourism sector. We all remember only too well those taxpayer funded television advertisements which were run to the tune of Joe Cocker’s Unchain my heart. People were breaking free from all the constraints of life, including the constraints of government taxation. How ridiculous those as now look in hindsight, after almost 12 months of operation of the GST. It appears that the objective of this increase, under the guise of a foot-and-mouth protection raising activity, will follow the tradition of previous passenger movement charge increasesthat is, to feather the government’s consolidated revenue nest. During the most recent round of Senate estimates it was revealed that, before the latest passenger movement charge increase, revenue collected from the passenger movement charge exceeded cost recovery by about $80 million a year. In other words, the government is raising $80 million more annually than it needs in order to undertake customs, immigration and quarantine processing of inward 28792 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 needs in order to undertake customs, immigration and quarantine processing of inward and outward bound passengers and the cost of issuing short-term visas. So the questions that arise-and I heard the member for Batman raise this point-are: where is the money going? How is the government using this additional revenue? Why isn’t the government accounting for this over-collection? Where is the fiscal responsibility and honesty that this government promised the Australian community prior to the 1996 election? I suggest that the government has made a new art form of deceiving the Australian community on these revenue and expenditure issues. The associated issue is that, while the government is collecting this revenue, it is not distributing any of it to the industry which is arguably most affected by the tax levy-that is, the tourism industry. If the tourism industry is being milked to combat foot-and-mouth disease, why shouldn’t some of this money be redirected to promote Australia’s clean, green image? Why shouldn’t some of the revenue raised by this increased tax be distributed to the industry which is arguably most affected by the tax being levied-the tourism industry? Certainly, it is an industry that has been adversely affected by the introduction of the GST, particularly given that outbound tourism is now more cost-effective than domestic tourism. By international agreement, we do not pay GST on international airline tickets. Therefore, it is now cheaper to go to Fiji, Bali or New Zealand, in relative terms, than it is to travel to the country’s centre, Cairns or similar places. So, in relative terms, outbound tourism has become more attractive for Australian tourists than visiting the very good tourism attractions on this continent. Tourism in Australia really is at a crossroads. The sector has many opportunities before it but it also faces very many great challenges. Like agriculture and manufacturing, tourism has faced and will continue to face significant economic adjustment over the next 10 years, and a falling Australian dollar is but one component. The relevance of this is our ability to purchase overseas advertising in those countries from which our tourists traditionally come and in those emerging markets from which our tourism will come in future. Some people will say that, if the dollar is low, tourism is happy and it should be booming. That is not true for probably three or four reasons. The first is that you will find that most people residing overseas do not have a clue about the value of the Australian dollar and do not really factor that into their travelling decisions. Indeed, you will find that most people contemplating an international trip do so at least 12 months in advance of that trip. Therefore, the value of a fluctuating dollar is not a large component in terms of their decision making process. Further, the overwhelming majority cost of an international trip is the cost of the airline ticket and, as you know, the value of the Australian dollar is irrelevant to the cost of that airline ticket. So if you are coming from the States, the airline ticket is going to cost you the same, whether the Australian dollar is at 50c or 70c US. That is a matter of fact. Sure, when they arrive here they might have some additional money because of the lower value of the dollar, so they can spend some more money, which is a good thing. Overwhelmingly, a lower Australian dollar does not cause people from other markets to come running to Australia, but it does impact upon our purchasing power overseas-our ability to market our nation overseas on the television screens of Americans, those living in Asia, those in Spain and those on the European continent generally. The second challenge is the GST. I will not dwell on it because I have already mentioned it, but certainly there is no doubt that the GST has had an adverse impact on this tourism sector. While I am not advocating it-I have to be careful here; it is a very expensive thing to ensure that all tourism exports are zero rated for GST-it remains true, notwithstanding that, that tourism remains the only export in this country that attracts a GST, and that is an inherently unfair thing. Wednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28793 The third challenge is with new competitors emerging, particularly in the Asian region. New five-star hotels and resorts in the Asian regions not known a decade ago are posing a real new level of competition for the Australian tourism sector. The fourth is increasing environmental pressure. Certainly, our tourism product is not a finite resource, and we all have to work to ensure that tourism in Australia is sustainable. But, notwithstanding that, it is true that these rising environmental pressures have placed pressure on the tourism sector. So all of these things are combining to pose new challenges for the tourism sector. But while we are very quick to hand over government money to assist our more traditional sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture and mining-not that I begrudge them that assistance; it is eminently supportable-we seem reluctant to acknowledge the challenges faced by one of Australia’s largest export industries, an industry currently earning Australia some $16 billion a year in foreign exchange. Too often people counter this view of mine by saying, ‘But we have growth in tourism. Tourism is growing; it is going okay. It doesn’t need this additional assistance.’ But we would expect that tourism would be growing; we would be very concerned if that were not the case. It is a question of whether it is growing enough. Is it growing enough to meet our expectations? Is it growing enough as an important segment of the services sector to deliver the jobs we will require over the next decade and beyond to replace those jobs that are being lost in more traditional industries where we do not have a comparative advantage and, no matter what government does in terms of economic and industry policy, those jobs are unsustainable? The tourism sector is asking for some help. The tourism sector has acknowledged that growth is going to slow and we are not going to meet forecast expectations. It was hit by a double whammy: it was hit by the fall in the Australian dollar, which I have talked about already, and at the same time it was hit by the cessation in the supplementary funding it secured in recognition of the opportunities presented by the Olympic Games in Sydney during the year 2000. That supplementary funding, by the way, was raised through a $3 increase in the passenger movement charge, a $3 increase which is still in place despite the fact that that supplementary funding has come to a halt. Fully conscious of this crisis facing the sector, the tourism sector went to the government and asked for help. What did it ask for? It asked for a mere $10 million over four years. It is well documented now that this government, the Howard government, is spending around $20 million every month on television, radio and print media advertising promoting its so-called initiatives to the Australian people in a desperate bid to pull itself out of the very deep political hole in which it finds itself. Yet when the tourism industry asks for $10 million over four years to provide Australians with jobs, particularly Australians living in rural and regional Australia-overwhelmingly younger Australians looking for employment opportunities in the services sector and looking for good, highly skilled jobs-the government says no, it cannot afford it. Let us have a look at the impact of this. I point out that the amendment says ‘Australian Tourism Commission’ when it should read ‘Australian Tourist Commission’-our mistake. I note that for the Hansard record before someone accuses me of not even knowing the name of one of the important tourism bodies in this country. Australian Tourist Commission television advertisements will be withdrawn in France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and the UK, leaving only China, India, New Zealand and Singapore. ATC activity in emerging markets will be cut from five countries back to one country. This is a critical point for Australia’s economy generally and a critical point for Australian tourism. In 1998-99, as I said, the coalition increased the PMC by $3 from $27 to $30 to raise revenue for the Olympics. In Labor’s 1995-96 budget, the Australian Tourist Commission received $80 million. Based on this year’s forward estimates and the 2000-01 budget appropriation, the Australian Tourist Commission’s budget will be only $84 million in the year 28794 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 2003-04. This represents a mere one-half of one per cent growth over eight years-not even anywhere near keeping pace with inflation in this country or in any of the markets in which tourism is critical. Unlike the Howard government, the Australian tourism industry is pulling its weight. Between 1992 and 2000, contributions from the private sector-their attempt to grow tourism in Australia-have increased from 23 per cent of total ATC revenues to 32 per cent. Over the same period, the government’s contribution fell from 72 per cent to 67 per cent. So the private sector is showing its recognition of the need to put more money into tourism promotion in Australia. But rather than have the Howard government say, ‘We welcome your contribution as an enhancement of our contribution,’ what does the Howard government do? It winds down its contribution. So there is no net benefit. There has been only half of one per cent growth over eight years. The government should be welcoming it and saying, ‘Thank you. This is going to enhance our efforts,’ and, if anything, increasing its own efforts as a means of encouraging greater effort again by the private sector. Alas, that has not been the case. But then I suppose there is not much spare money after the Howard government has funded its GST related roll-backs. We are now counting $20 billion of budget surplus gone in 12 months. There have been roll-backs on petrol indexation, and changes to the business activity statement and beer excise. The list goes on and on. We support roll-back, but we support rollback that reflects the cost of the GST-roll-back that would not have been necessary if the GST had not forced petrol excise and beer excise up and imposed such a burden on the small business community. What does the tourism industry have to do to prove its case to the government? Tourism export earnings, as I indicated, are around $16 billion in foreign exchange, but tourism export earnings are forecast to grow from $15.4 billion to $20 billion in 2004-05. In this financial year alone, an estimated 175,114 jobs were created by inbound tourism. For every $1 billion in tourism export earnings, 11,367 jobs are created. Those are not bad statistics for an industry that is practically ignored by the Howard government. I had Minister Kelly challenge us in the House in question time last week, I think, about not having much to say about tourism. She does not say much, so she does not leave us much to criticise. I do try very hard to take a bipartisan approach to tourism, because it is one of those sectors where political point scoring can only have a detrimental effect on its growth. I try very hard, but if Minister Kelly wants a debate on tourism, we are inviting her to participate in this one today by moving this amendment. Where are we going with ATC funding? The government made it quite clear that it would not be providing additional money in its 2001-02 budget. So the tourism sector was looking towards the passenger movement charge. It had identified it as a possibility. It said to the government, ‘If you will not give us the mere $10 million we are asking for over four years, will you look at an increase in the passenger movement charge, so that we can live up to expectations and provide the sort of growth we are looking to provide to create those all-important jobs?’ You can understand why, on budget night, the tourism sector was angry to learn that the government had increased the passenger movement charge by 21 per cent, without any consultation whatsoever with the sector. In doing so it denied the tourism sector that opportunityA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.29 a.m. to 11.42 a.m. was talking about lost opportunities in terms of Australian Tourist Commission funding and, in particular, zeroing in on the total lack of consultation by the government with the tourism",162,Representatives Main Committee
351,Mr Fitzgibbon,"Before being most rudely interrupted by a division in the House, IWednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28795 sector before imposing the additional charge. But to rub salt into the wound, I have it on very good advice that those in the sector went to the government, having heard rumours that there may be an increase in the charge, and said, ‘Look, if you are going to increase it by $8, increase it by $10. If you need the full $8 to prevent foot-and-mouth disease from entering Australia, give us the additional $2, because we desperately need this.’ I understand that cabinet had, in effect, agreed to that measure, but somehow in the process that decision did not translate into the appropriate amendments to the draft bill. I invite the minister, when he summarises this debate, to explain to the chamber and the Australian community whether or not it is true that cabinet had agreed in principle to give the tourism sector an extra $2 out of the additional charge but failed to do so due to a breakdown in the process. Funding for the Australian Tourist Commission has to be addressed. I pointed out that we have had growth of only half of one per cent over eight years. What is an appropriate level of funding for the Australian Tourist Commission? The fact is that we do not know; we have no international benchmarking. We do know that the city of Las Vegas spends more on promoting itself overseas than the whole Australian nation does. A cursory look at the figures would indicate that we actually fund the Australian Tourist Commission very well, but are we factoring into that assessment the tyranny of distance and our relatively weak branding as compared to a Paris or a Tuscany or some other similar European centred destination? Of course we need to be spending more on an international basis, but where is the comparison, the benchmarking? This government needs to hold a review into funding for the Australian Tourist Commission. It needs to give away these arbitrary exercises of meeting a demand for an extra $20 million, $10 million or $5 million and for the first time get a real handle on what is an appropriate level of funding for the Australian Tourist Commission. At the same time, we need to get better at assessing the value of the Australian tourism sector to the Australian economy. We need to get better at measuring the on-benefits-the benefits that flow, for example, when a London based tourist goes back to the UK and continues to buy Australian wine for the rest of his or her life because they enjoyed that wine experience while in Australia. That is a very difficult thing to measure. But we can get much better at measuring the value of our tourism sector and, when we get better at it, we will also be better placed to determine what is an appropriate level of funding. I want to say something about the Australian Tourist Commission because, in my almost three years as the shadow minister for tourism, I have grown very fond of it and developed a high regard for those who work within it; they do a fantastic job with very limited resources. Driving the commission while I have been in the job-and for a long time before that-has been Mr John Morse. Now, sadly, he has decided that it is time to move on and he has left the commission. But as he has taken up the very important position of Chairman of Tourism Victoria he will not be leaving the sector, and I know that he will continue to play a significant role in the industry, as he has done for more than 20 years. So my thanks to John Morse for all the work he has done. RecentlyI was fortunate in being able to attend the Australian Tourism Exchange in Brisbane, a magnificent event. Much of the credit for it goes of course to John Morse and his team. John will be sadly missed at the ATC but, given his new role, I expect him to be involved in the industry for a long time. Due to John Morse’s departure, we welcome Mr Ken Boundy as the new CEO of the Australian Tourist Commission. Mr Boundy joins the ATC with 25 years experience in international marketing, export industries, global operations and government. So he brings a vast amount of expertise to the sector and, if you like, a different perspective. Mr Boundy does not bring to the ATC the same expertise in tourism that John Morse had; he brings a different sort of talent, something that I think will be good for the commission. SoI welcome Mr Boundy. I thank the Australian Tourist Commission for the wonderful work it continues to do, and I congratulate it again on a magnificently successful Australian Tourism Exchange in Brisbane. 28796 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 I appeal to the government to open their eyes to what is happening out there. I ask those opposite not to stand in the chamber and say, ‘Well, tourism is experiencing X growth and therefore everything is fine.’ The fact is, as I said earlier, that the sector recognises that that growth is about to slow. That means that, over the next 10 years, we will grow at a level lower than expectations, and that can only be bad news for the Australian economy. SoI appeal to the government to accept the need to boost the ATC’s funding-but again I invite them not to just do so on an arbitrary basis. Obviously the $10 million opportunity has now passed, given the way that the government have wound down the budget surplus. But I appeal to the government to start thinking seriously about doing some proper international benchmarking, a proper assessment of what the ATC requires, in order to live up to our expectation of that very significant jobs growth over the next 10 years and beyond. I ask the government also to recognise the growing contribution that the private sector is making to the ATC’s funding and, rather than wind back its own contribution as a result of that, say thank you for that-thank you for enhancing our contribution. As part of the review process, maybe the government could even consider a rewards based system in which government contributions grow in response to increased private sector contributions. Let us have some sort of ratio so that, every time the sector itself makes an additional effort, that is recognised by an enhanced effort on the part of the government. That would need to be capped, of course. We cannot throw money at the commission forever, regardless of the circumstances of the day. But the government could give the sector an incentive to make an investment in the sector itself, rather than discourage it by reducing government funding every time the sector itself makes an additional contribution. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.50 a.m.)-I second the amendment to the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001. I rise to support the amendment. Whilst we are not declining to give the bill a second reading, we are very concerned about the two issues that the shadow minister has raised and the two points that are in our amendment. One is that we are concerned at the government ignoring the concerns of the tourism industry in this matter and that it has failed to consult on viable funding options for the Australian Tourist Commission. The other is the breaking of its promises on tax. The legislation, as such, increases the passenger movement charge from $30 to $38. That will take effect as of 1 July this year. It has been put to us that this legislation is to combat foot-and-mouth disease and protect the Australian agricultural industry which is a very important thing to do. In noting actions to protect Australia from foot-and-mouth disease, I must mention the activities of the Maritime Union in the Hunter where they refused to take some contaminated farm machinery from one of the ships that came into the port. Their action did a lot to help protect Australia and keep foot-and-mouth disease out of this country. In moving on, I would like to mention that this passenger movement charge will be collected by the airlines and the shipping companies. That will happen at the time or point of sale of the tickets. There is an agreement with the Commonwealth that the airlines and shipping companies will then pass that money on to Customs. I do not see this as a charge: rather I see it as a tax. As the amendment that I just read points out, this government has promised not to increase tax, but in fact it is one of the highest taxing governments that Australia has ever seen. It is the government that introduced the GST that is a tax on all Australians every day of their lives. It taxes Australian people in every way on every day.

This is what this government is delivering with this legislation. The really unfortunate part of it is that the tax will be collected by the tourism industry and none of that tax is going to that industry. I have already acknowledged the importance of protecting Australia from foot-and-mouth disease, but I think it is very important that we look after what is one of the growth industries within Australia. It is the industry that is the tax collector for the government in this instance. It is an industry which will be affected by collecting the tax and an industry that stands to benefit in no way whatsoever. In 1998-99 the government increased the passenger movement charge by $3 to meet Olympic related costs of people and equipment movement. That money went directly to the industry: the industry collected the money and the industry benefited from the money. The Olympic Games are over and that $3 tax is still in place. It was supposed to be a temporary measure, but it has become permanent. The money is now being directed not to the industry but to consolidated revenue. The tourism industry has missed out there. The tourism industry is such a vital industry in Australia. I find it very sad that we have a government that does not have a commitment to the tourism industry. It is only giving $10 million over four years. It is so disappointing-really disappointing-that the government did not consult with the Australian Tourist Commission or the tourism industry at all before implementing this legislation. I understand that, initially, the airlines and the shipping companies were very concerned that they would have to wear the cost of the increase on tickets that had already been sold. This has been sorted out, but other issues have not. The tourism industry see the government as being arrogant in the extreme-arrogant in the way that it does not consult and it does not listen. It is a very self-righteous government, a government that is imposing things upon the Australian community and Australian industries with no consultation. We all know that the best results are achieved through consultation. The best results are always achieved if you talk to people and to industries and you bring them with you. Unfortunately, yet again-and, since I have been here, there have been many incidents like this which we have seen in this parliament-we have this government, the Howard government, pushing something through without adequate consultation. Prior to the budget, there was talk that the tax would be $10 and that $2 of that would go to the tourism industry. It was only talk. The government obviously did not get back to the industry. When the tourism industry saw the budget papers, they were outraged. I do not think they would have been as upset if there had been some consultation, if they knew about the money that they thought they were going to get for their part in collecting the tax for the government. But to find out in this sneaky way, they felt that they had been tricked by the government. The industry feels that its viability is being threatened. It is an industry where we should be promoting growth and export earning. It is an area that I know most of us have targeted within",168,Representatives Main Committee

Australia has some very unique features which make it an excellent tourist destination. What we should be doing is getting behind the tourism industry and supporting them in every way we possibly can. We should be looking at the tourism industry replacing some of the industries that have declined over time. The way I see it is that it is of considerable concern when we have a government that is undermining an industry at every opportunity it can, and we only have to look at the financial commitment that the government has given to the tourism industry, through the Australian Tourist Commission, to see that the advertisements that are being conducted overseas have had to be cut. I was absolutely astonished when I heard the shadow minister for tourism speaking of the impact that the slide of the Australian dollar has had on promoting Australia overseas. It really brought home to me that, whilst Australia may be a cheaper destination now, we still have to advertise our country overseas and we still have to let people that live in other countries know about what we have to offer. This has all been jeopardised by this government’s action. As I have said, this is one of the industries that are most important to the Australian economy, and I am very upset about the government’s lack of commitment to it. We have a minister who has really not been in touch with the important players within the industry, and this is having a major effect on the future of this industry, which is vital to the Australian economy. When the shadow minister was speaking about advertising, he was saying that $84 million has been put aside for the year 2003-2004 and that $10 million has been given over four years. I then thought about advertising and what this government are spending now on advertising their own policies, advertising that is designed to get them re-elected. ThenI thought: $20 million a month on self-promotion yet they can only allocate $84 million for the year 2003-2004; $84 million to create jobs, develop an industry, stimulate our economy and support the Australian people; $20 million a month for their own re-election campaign. So $20 million to see that they are re-elected and $84 million to promote tourism-it is a very sad state of affairs. WhilstI have concentrated to a large extent upon the impact that this legislation will have on the tourism industry, upon the government’s failure to actually support that industry and upon the fact that this is another tax, an example of this government’s broken promise, and a return to an effective 21 per cent increase, it is also important to acknowledge that Australia should be protected from foot-and-mouth disease. We in the Labor Party are very supportive of that. We do not want to see here scenes of what happened in Britain; we do not want to see here examples of what happened in Britain, so that part of the legislation we support. But we are terribly, terribly, terribly disturbed about the fact that the government has not consulted and that this legislation could have an impact on the tourism industry that the government has not accounted for. Why do we have to look at this measure? It is because the government has whittled away the surplus by trying to buy votes. This came about when they got a bit of a scare in Western Australia, when they became hysterical in Queensland after the results there which just about annihilated the Liberal Party, and when they were defeated in the Ryan by-election. Over 12 months the government has decimated the surplus by pulling $20 billion out of it. They have done this with their roll-back or roll-over whereby they have removed the excise on petrol, done an enormous backflip on the beer excise and moved to some extent to deal with the complaints of small business. The GST has had an enormous impact on small businesses because they are the tax collectors for the government, and now the government is making the tourism industry the tax collectors for the passenger movement charge. This is a government that just reacts and, as you can see from what I have just said, it reacted to the voter backlash in those areas. It does not Wednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28799 plan. As the shadow minister for small business and tourism was saying, we need to have a review of the tourism industry, evaluate it and put in place proper plans. We should not just react to whatever is the flavour of the month, but that is what this government is best at-it is best at reacting and trying to trick the Australian people. When this government is faced with a problem, it looks at a way to impose a new tax on the Australian people. This is a high taxing government and one that outsources tax collection-and in this case it has outsourced it to the tourism industry. This is a high taxing government which presents itself to the Australian people as one that is cutting taxes, when in fact it is increasing taxes or slipping in new ones at every possible opportunity. The Howard government tries to trick the Australian people whenever it can. It is a mean and tricky government. This legislation on passenger movement charges will be sold as a government initiative to combat foot-and-mouth disease when in fact it is an increase in the tax on tourism. It is a tax which the tourism industry collects, one which it gets nothing for, and one which the Australian people pay for. stration) (12.08 p.m.)-in reply-What an amazing contribution from the honourable member for Shortland! Ms Hall interjectingvery few members of parliament could support the line of argument that she adopted. It is interesting to look at the remarks made by the honourable member for Shortland. She talked about this government reacting to what people are saying. Unlike the Keating government, which was grossly arrogant, this government is responsive to community needs. We did not create the economic black hole that we inherited with the $10.3 billion budget deficit which was there in 1996, but we did accept responsibility for fixing it. When this government was elected to office, we were confronted with a situation in which the former government had told the Australian people during the election campaign that the budget was in surplus. Ms Hall-Go to the shopping centres and talk to the people. election, the mandarins from the Australian Public Service gave the bad news to the incoming government that, far from there being a surplus, there was a $10.3 billion deficit. It is one of the reasons why this government put through the parliament the charter of budget honesty legislation. That was done so no government could ever again deceive the Australian people in the manner that the Keating government successfully did prior to the 1996 poll. We find the member for Shortland coming in on this debate and accusing the government of making changes in response to a voter backlash. She criticises us for listening to the Australian people. She criticises us for reducing the excise on beer and for cutting the excise on petrol. Obviously she is not happy with the benefits for retirees and the way in which we have assisted small business. I challenge the member for Shortland: is she in favour of a higher beer excise? Is she in favour of a higher petrol excise? Does she want to return to the days of Labor’s indexation of petrol prices? Does she want to rip away the benefits that we have given to retirees and pensioners? Does she want to get her political knife into small business in the same way that the Labor government did? The member for Shortland is entirely out of order and she is entirely out of touch. I believe that her own constituency would be as appalled as those members in the chamber are today by her contribution to this particular debate. She says we whittled away the surplus. Through sound economic management during the period this government has been in office we have turned the economy around. We have firewalled the economy from the Asian economic crisis.

362,Mr Slipper,"You should listen, my friend. What happened? On the Monday after the28800 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 member for Shortland and her colleagues, but we will be very proud at the end of the year to stand up before the Australian people and be held accountable for the very effective economic management we have brought to this country, along with very responsible social policies. Government members-Hear, hear! the Minister for Community Services, Mr Anthony, for their very strong support of the diligent and effective representation by the government of the Australian people over the five years since we were elected to office. This legislation implements the decision announced by the government in the 2001-02 budget to increase the existing passenger movement charge from $30 to $38, with a date of effect of 1 July this year. This increase announced by the Treasurer will help meet the additional passenger processing costs associated with the increased screening of passengers as part of Australia’s response to the threat of the introduction of foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic pests and diseases. We are not going to apologise to the chamber for maintaining the highest level of vigilance against foot-and-mouth disease. We are concerned about the tourism industry and we have a very proud history of support of tourism. An outbreak of foot-andmouth disease in Australia would be an unprecedented calamity for the tourism industry. Let us look at Britain. The tourism authorities have estimated that foreign tourism revenue losses resulting from the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in that country amount to as much as 3,000 million. It is only fair that the tourism industry, along with other sectors, contribute to funding the foot-and-mouth disease measures. Indeed, the total cost of these measures to protect Australia from foot-and-mouth disease will exceed what the industry will contribute through the passenger movement charge increase. The government is very conscious of maintaining Australia’s image and reputation as a welcoming and healthy destination for tourists. The government has just delivered the fourth instalment of $91.9 million of the record Australian Tourist Commission allocation of $361 million over four years to bolster Australia’s position in the international marketplace. These record levels of government funding and ATC marketing performance have delivered unprecedented inbound tourism growth: a record 4.9 million overseas visitors arrived in Australia in the year 2000-and many of them came to the Sunshine Coast. This is an increase of more than 11 per cent over 1999. The ATC’s global 2001 strategy includes the launch of over 90 tactical advertising campaigns worth more than $45 million involving 200 industry partners promoting holiday packages to potential visitors and an aggressive $6 million direct marketing campaign. Honourable members would want to know that, with the appointment of Mr Ken Boundy as the Managing Director of ATC, the organisation is very well placed to convert the unprecedented interest in Australia after the Olympics into further visitor arrivals and expenditure. The honourable member for Batman, who spoke in this debate, queried how much of the $8 increase in the passenger movement charge will go to increased inspections for foot-andmouth disease and how much will go to consolidated revenue. It is a pretty fair question. I am pleased to assure the honourable member that all of the expected increase in revenue from the additional $8 will be used to offset the cost of increased quarantine inspections of passengers by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Australian Customs Service. The original estimate was that the additional $8 would raise $288 million over four years. With tickets sold before 1 July to be exempt from the increase, the estimate is $279 million. The cost over the same period for Customs and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service will be $283 million. So the honourable member for Batman can rest assured that all of the money raised, and more, will be used to protect this nation from the scourge of foot-andmouth disease.",171,Representatives Main Committee
363,Mr Slipper,"I thank my honourable colleagues the members for Forde and Petrie andWednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28801 The honourable member for Hunter, before doing a bolt and running from the chamber, claimed that the government did not consult with the tourism industry before increasing the charge. I think the honourable member for Shortland made a similar allegation. Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, you have been around for a while; you would be aware that this government consults widely as part of the budget process. Mr Albanese interjectingoutstanding member for Menzies and he will be returned with an increased majority at the next election. It is not appropriate to ask permission of the Tourist Commission to increase the passenger movement charge; nor is it proper to reveal this before the budget is handed down. Honourable members opposite would be aware that cabinet discussions are private. This government has consulted widely in the Australian community and we do report after consultation. The bill that is before the chamber is certainly a responsible response to what is a very major threat to our tourism industry, as well as to agriculture in Australia. The honourable member for Hunter moved a second reading amendment which sought to criticise the government for ignoring the concerns of the tourism industry on this matter, suggested that we had failed to consult on viable funding options for the Australian Tourist Commission and that we had broken promises not to increase taxes. During the initial stage of my summing up, I pointed out our care and concern for the important tourism industry in Australia, stressing that we have consulted widely. Also, it ought to be recognised that the increase in the passenger movement charge is a response to a specific threat to Australia and that, if foot-and-mouth disease were to arrive, it would greatly endanger the tourism industry in this country. Foot-and-mouth disease has had an enormous impact on the tourism industry in the United Kingdom. We are not going to resile from our very strong determination to make sure that Australia is protected from foot-and-mouth disease. The transitional arrangements to exempt from the increase those passengers holding presold tickets are beneficial both to passengers and to the airlines which collect the charge under formal arrangements with the Commonwealth.

There is one amendment: an amendment to exempt certain departures from Australia on or after 1 July from the increase in the passenger movement charge to $38.

I am pleased to commend the government amendment to the main committee. Amendment agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with an amendment. 2001 Consideration resumed from 23 May. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. Since its election in 1996, this government has sought to implement its commitment to a simpler and more coherent social security system that more effectively meets its objectives of adequacy, equity, incentives for self-provision, customer service, and administrative and financial sustainability. That commitment can be met in part by seeking to ensure that social security legislation is routinely reviewed both to improve its readability and to ensure that it facilitates the implementation of current and new policies. Last year this parliament passed the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, which was a major step forward in achieving these objectives. The act substantially simplified the technical rules and provisions of the social security law. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001 is a further step towards meeting the government’s objectives to achieve a simpler and more coherent social security system because it represents a major simplification of the law relating to concession cards. As a result of this bill, all law relating to concession cards issued by the family and community services portfolio will be consolidated in the social security law. As part of this process, existing administrative rules and practices will be codified to ensure that those who currently have a concession card continue to qualify for that card on the same basis as they currently qualify. This has been done to avoid having winners or losers from the process of making transparent the law relating to the issue of concession cards. Access to a concession card is a fundamental component of the government’s welfare safety net. Access to a concession card is a significant benefit to those who qualify. At the Commonwealth level, the concession card provides access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits under the National Health Act 1953. It can also be used to access a range of other benefits provided by state, territory, local government and many businesses. The law currently governing concession cards issued by Centrelink on behalf of the Department of Family and Community Services is highly fragmented. This causes confusion for social security customers and Centrelink staff who issue the cards. Some provisions are contained in the Health Insurance Act 1973, others in the National Health Act 1953 and yet others are under the social security law. For example, the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act contain provisions that specify who is entitled to concessional pharmaceutical benefits. However, appeal rights in relation to concessional",173,Representatives Main Committee
366,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister for Community Services) (12.22 p.m.)-I move:Wednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28803 pharmaceutical benefits for pensioner concession card and health care card holders are covered by the social security law. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs recognised the problem in its 1997 report entitled Concessions-who benefits? Report on concession card availability and eligibility for concessions. The committee recommended that the legislative framework be rationalised to include the bulk of concession entitlement provisions in the social security law rather than in legislation administered by the then Health and Family Services portfolio. The only significant policy change made by the bill relates to foster care children. In future, a child will be entitled to a health care card if the child is in foster care and the child is living in Australia with an Australian resident. The more significant of the minor policy initiatives implemented by the bill relate to: making a person’s entitlement to concessional pharmaceutical benefits dependent on the person’s status as a holder of a concession card issued under the social security law; using the social security and family assistance law definitions of ‘dependant’ and removing the need to rely on definitions of ‘dependant’ in the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act; using the social security law definition of ‘resident’ rather than the National Health Act and Health Insurance Act definition. This makes the question of determining who is qualified for a card much simpler to administer and ensures that there is consistency between qualification for a social security pension or benefit and qualification for a card; conferring administrative review rights in relation to decisions on health care cards for persons receiving carer allowance. Such decisions are not reviewable at the moment under section 4CA of the Health Insurance Act; providing a power for the minister to declare a person eligible to receive a health care card in limited circumstances; and utilising the machinery provisions of the social security law in relation to pensioner concession cards and health care cards in a manner consistent with current administrative practices. This bill demonstrates the government’s commitment to the ongoing review of the legislative basis underlying the social security system so as to achieve a simpler and more coherent system. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. (Concession Cards) Bill 2001 is aimed at consolidating the legislative provisions and administrative guidelines regarding concession cards into a single part of the Social Security Act 1991 because currently there are five concession cards which are issued by the Commonwealth government. Centrelink issues three separate cards: the pensioner concession card, the Commonwealth seniors health card and the health care card. In addition to this, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs issues the gold repatriation health card and the white repatriation health card. All these cards share a concession under the PBS. The changes in this bill, as the Minister for Community Services has pointed out, arise from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs 1997 report. That is significant in itself in that it has taken this government four years and two terms since the report of their own committee which they control to actually turn its recommendations into legislation. That is of some considerable concern. One of the concerns that we on this side of the House have when it comes to the area of family and community services is that, while the legislation is often inequitable, it is the administrative incompetence of this government whether by actions which are mean-spirited in their nature or inaction such as",174,Representatives Main Committee
367,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (12.27 P.m.),"The Social Security Legislation Amendment28804 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 represented in this bill. This is a government that does not deserve to be re-elected by the Australian people later on this year. As a background to what is essentially a housekeeping bill, I think it is worthwhile to examine the government’s record on concession cards. Since being elected, this government have systematically dismantled, eroded and undermined the services and entitlements available to Australia’s pensioners, retirees and other low income Australians through their concession cards. They were elected on the basis of saying, prior to March 1996, that no-one would be worse off. We all know that is not the case. If you examine their record on concession cards, then the administrative tidying up which this bill represents does not cover the inequity of five years of government meanness and neglect because in their actions with regard to concession cards the government have diminished the real value of any income support payments that these concession card holders may also receive. I want to give some examples to the House during this debate. Firstly, of course, they have removed free hearing aids and hearing services for Commonwealth senior health card holders-an inequitable, mean-spirited decision, which has had a devastating impact on a section of our society which already feels discriminated against, let alone not deserving the actions of a government in taking away their eligibility in this important area. They have also, of course, increased the concession card co-payment for prescription medicines by 50c per script. Fifty cents might not be much to members of the House of Representatives, but it is certainly a lot to pensioners out there, many of whom struggle to get by from fortnight to fortnight and who have multiple scripts. The adding up of 50c upon 50c can add up to an extra $10 or $15 a fortnight for these vulnerable Australians who already incur additional costs due to their disabilities and the need for them to service their health needs. The government have also removed scores of medicines from the PBS free list, making people pay full price. That is of great concern. Speaking on a personal basis, I have a mother who is now an age pensioner, but was an invalid pensioner-rheumatoid arthritis crippled her at a very young age. She requires a whole lot of medicines which are off the PBS list. She is in a position whereby I can support her, but many vulnerable older and unhealthy Australians are not in that position and they need the medicines which have been taken off the PBS concession free list. Many of these people will make a choice based on their financial position rather than upon their health needs. They will take a drug which might not be as good for them in terms of pain relief or side effects, which has other negative impacts, rather than take the appropriate drug. What we should have with regard to health care in this nation and with regard to the application of concession cards is that everyone gets equal treatment, regardless of their economic position. But this government do not believe in economic equality of opportunity. They have also increased the intervals for the fitting of new hearing aids for pensioner concession card holders, once again meaning that many Australians have to wait for their new hearing aids, changing the way in which they are able to participate in our society. At the same time, they have increased the hearing aid maintenance charges. Way back in 1996, concession card holders first missed out on access to free dental treatment with the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program. This $399.4 million cut can only be seen as having a very devastating impact on those people. That is what defines this government: mean-spiritedness. The issues I have gone through in terms of the loss of services that were provided to concession card holders were all about saving money for the government at the expense of those people who were and are most vulnerable. That is, the government saved $399.4 million with the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program, $308 million with the 50c prescription increase, and $11.7 million with the hearing services changes. These cuts have been on top of cuts to public hospitals of around $800 million and Wednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28805 the closure of some 84 Medicare offices around Australia, including three in my electorate. These were, again, introduced as savings measures. We should not be surprised at that. I emphasise to retirees that when the government increased the income test limits for Labor’s seniors health card, it dumped free hearing aids as a standard feature. Of particular interest to pensioners would be the government’s decision to increase the pharmaceutical copayment by 50c per prescription. This is not just a financial matter. It broke the nexus that previously existed in which the pharmaceutical allowance fully covered the cost of the copayment. Now, pensioners must pay the difference out of their basic pension paymentsomething that they did not have to do before. There has been a lot of debate in recent weeks about the adequacy of the pension in light of the GST, and about what the real value of the pension was under Labor and is under the coalition. Putting aside other issues-like the failure of the government to ensure that the pension would remain at at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings-the example of the hike in the copayment for concession card holders highlights how the Howard government has eaten into the real value of the pension by making pensioners pay for things previously covered by concessions. It is part and parcel of the way that the Howard government has dealt with pensioners, retirees and other low income Australians. It has dudded them. It has made a habit of implementing sneaky savings measures. I remind the government that this is in clear breach of its 1996 election promise not to reduce the real value of social security concessions and entitlements. The Prime Minister, the ministers and the other members of the coalition should be ashamed because their government has taken every opportunity to claw back anything which it has given to social security recipients. You can be sure that if there is a handout from the government then there will be a hand in the pocket stealing any gains that have been promised. A great example of that is clawback-the infamous clawback. To quote the Council on the Ageing: The Government was loose with the truth by telling older people they were getting a 4 per cent pension increase – with a view to maximising the acceptability of the GST to this crucial part of the electorate. Of course, on 20 March, two per cent of that four per cent pension increase was clawed back by the government. That is the government’s mean and tricky approach. The government’s excuse was, ‘Well, it was in the fine print.’ It was somewhere on page 425 of one of the documents that it sent out with Age Pension News. Notifying older Australians of changes in their pension eligibility and in regard to concession cards is something that the government is not particularly good at-as always when it comes to detailed changes to legislation that affect those people’s lives. There were no as on TV saying, ‘You’re going to have to pay extra for your pharmaceuticals,’ or, ‘We’re going to claw back two per cent of your pension increase.’ There were no as on TV with regard to the cuts to the Commonwealth dental program, or speaking about the $800 million cut to public hospitals. And that is the concern that the opposition has. The implementation of these savings measures has been rubbed in by the fact that this government is spending $20 million per month, between now and the election, advertising-in a blatant, partisan manner-its campaigns. Every Sunday night, when they turn on the television, older Australians will know that half a million dollars of their money is being spent on advertising. Government as include: $5 million on the abolition of the FID, $1 million on volunteerism, $10 million on gap health insurance-of which $1½ million is going straight into the pockets of the advertisers for placement-$4.7 million on a citizenship campaign and $2 million on an aged care campaign, as well as an uncosted welfare compliance campaign in the second half of the year and an uncosted BAS4 instalment payment campaign. But that is just on top of what has already been spent: $12½ million on the BAS2 and BAS3 changes to the GST, $3.4 million on the New 28806 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 Apprenticeships scheme and $27 million on an illicit drugs campaign, of which $7.6 million went straight into the pockets of advertising firms as ad placement-$7.6 million on that infamous ad where the nuclear family all talk together, where everyone talks honestly and the parents and the kids all suggest that they should talk about drugs. An admirable thing, I must say. Unfortunately, many of the children in my electorate-as, I am sure, in all the electorates that we represent here-are simply not in that position of having a solid family base where they can talk to each other about the difficulties of drugs at school. It missed the mark. It might not have missed the intended mark, parents who are voters, but certainly it missed the mark with regard to kids and the message that we need to get to them with regard to the danger of drugs. Then we had Don Burke on TV-$3.9 million on greenhouse advertisements as a little bonus on top of increasing his profile and increasing the ratings on his show-and $4 million spent on a Job Network campaign. Before the recent budget we could not actually afford to spend anything on intensive assistance in terms of labour market placement, yet we could spend $4 million advertising on the Job Network campaign. No wonder people are angry. Way back, on 5 September 1995, John Howard as Leader of the Opposition spoke in a press release about a ‘massive $14 million of taxpayers’ money’ being spent prior to the election$14 million. We are getting $20 million spent per month every month between now and the election. As the parliamentary secretary to the shadow minister for family and community services, I believe very firmly that that is money which could have been used to increase benefits for family and community services. That money could have increased the real value of what social security recipients could get from the concession cards. It could reverse the funding cut to the Commonwealth dental program, it could reverse the pharmaceutical increases, it could ensure that there were early intervention programs with regard to family responsibilities-it could do all that. But the government has made a choice, and that choice is to be meanspirited and tricky. With regard to its advertising, these changes should be advertised-and the opposition does not begrudge this-in a rational and informative way, and we do not have a problem with that. The government sends out Age Pension News, and all senior Australians get it in their mailbox. It provides an opportunity to provide real detail on things such as the changes to the concessions cards. In the March-April 2001 issue of Age Pension News, the advertisement for insurance on the back page was paid for by the HIH group. Who else? While the government was getting these as from the HIH group, it did not bother to ask whether the insurance would actually do anything for pensioners and whether coverage would be there for them. The government was asleep at the wheel. That is exactly the case with this bill-the government has again been asleep at the wheel. A 1997 report by its committee recommended changes to and consolidation of these cards and yet, some four years after that report, we are finally seeing the legislation. It is not good enough. And it will not be good enough for the people of Australia come the end of the year. The Labor Party will be supporting the amendment that the Democrats will be moving to this bill. I understand that the minister is also likely to support it. We will give him a bit of guidance and a bit of help-and the member for Richmond sometimes needs a bit of assistance; and I travel to his electorate at every opportunity to make sure that he gets it. We will give him a bit of advice: accept the amendment from the Democrats as it will improve this particular piece of legislation. This piece of legislation will have the support of the Australian Labor Party because of its nature, which is largely administrative. The bill provides us with an opportunity to once again point out to the government the cuts that have been made in real terms to concession cards and to the real value of concession cards. It gives us an opportunity to once again point out how much money is beingREPRESENTATIVES wasted by this government on blatant political advertising, and MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28807 also to point out the hypocrisy of that. Apart from anything else, the as are boring. If they were more interesting, perhaps they would be more acceptable. However, a number of Australians will not forgive this government for what they have done to Joe Cocker, as no-one will ever be able to listen to Joe Cocker and feel the same way again. I can foresee a time when people will not use umbrellas because of the Medicare ad. It will turn them off umbrellas so much that, every time they get one out, they will be reminded that this government has ripped the heart out of Medicare. This government has Medicare in shreds which are disconnected by the cutbacks that have occurred-including cutbacks to concession card holders with regard to the Commonwealth dental program. We remind the government of the hypocrisy of being a government which focuses on being mean-spirited and tricky. It will probably say that this is a reform, but there are no savings, no expenditures and no economic implications in this bill. The government had a choice in its budget, and the government does have a choice-spend money on older Australians or spend money on advertising. The government would rather line the pockets of its mates in the advertising industry than assist Australians who rely upon concession cards and social security and who have made an outstanding contribution to this nation throughout their working life. They deserve our respect but, more importantly, they deserve financial support. I commend the bill to the House and I look forward to making further contributions during the consideration in detail stage when the bill comes back to the House. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.50 p.m.)-I rise today to speak to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2001, referring to, amongst other things, the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. BeforeI go on to the technicalities of the bill, I would like to correct a couple of hypocritical statements made by the previous speaker, the member for Grayndler. The member for Grayndler spoke about the dental health care program, a four-year program that was put in place by Labor. We continued to commit funding to that program, which was basically a catch-up program. The honourable member knows that the states were unable to cope with the demand on dental health care, and it was put in on a short-term basis. If Labor were very serious about this program, they would have put it in their forward estimates before we came to office. There was no such mention of it in their forward estimates. He also spoke about a number of other topics, including health. I would like to correct him on a number of the statements that he has made here in the chamber today. Firstly, Australia has one of the most generous pharmaceutical benefits schemes in the whole of the Western world. The pharmacy items on the PBS list are some 30 to 40 per cent cheaper than anywhere else in the world. As a result of that, the PBS was costing $3.6 billion a year but has now risen to about $4.4 billion. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is an independent body that advises the government on how pharmaceutical products should be listed and on what basis. It makes a number of decisions. Last time. I checked, I believe there were about 18,000 drugs listed on that program, but every year new drugs are introduced, including new life-saving drugs and, particularly, drugs that help older Australians such as the new drug Celebrex. I know for a fact that Celebrex is 50 per cent cheaper in Australia than in any other country in the world. The need for newer drugs for cancer and for conditions like arthritis is always there, and Australians should have access to them. In terms of the drugs that the member spoke about earlier and the increase of 50c in the prescription price, generic drugs are available that are of no cost to pensioners if they are able to receive them on the PBS free list. In cases where, for example, pensioners or older members of the community cannot use the generic drug, all that their general practitioner has to do is ring up and get an authorisation and then the patient can 28808 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 27 June 2001 go on the other drug. The misconceptions that were being peddled around do not exist. We have a very generous Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is available to older Australians. I would like to speak on a number of the areas that were mentioned, including some health areas. Pensioners have one of the highest uptakes of private health insurance. Of all governments, we are the first government to give 30 per cent health insurance rebates to pensioners. Many of them do a considerable amount to ensure that they stay in their health fund, and it is important for them to have it and to have that choice. Some of the fallacies that were being peddled here by the member for Grayndler were absolutely preposterous, particularly the fallacies about advertising. I want to comment on advertising. I have a marginal electorate, and we have given up counting the number of phone calls we get from people seeking information from us, because the phone runs off the hook continuously all day long. Despite literature being sent to people, there is still a large number of members of the community who need information, and sometimes the best form of getting that information to them is through the electronic media. I am pleased to say that some of those campaigns have ensured that they have got benefits and information that they have been entitled to. Not everyone will sit down and read the social security booklet that is being sent out, but they will listen to the radio and they will flick through a magazine and see that they are entitled to certain benefits and bonuses. I was at the opening of a Carelink office on Saturday. It was kindly opened by the Minister for Aged Care, Bronwyn Bishop. This will add to the list of things that we have provided for older Australians, in that they now can ring a 1800 number and have access to home and community care packages. Relatives and older members of the community wanting to go into aged care or retirement villages, or wanting information about personal care, shopping or home care can now go to that 1800 number. WhyI mention that is that I met one of the staff at the Carelink office, who told me that they had been inundated by inquiries from pensioners-and this is outside their scope-wanting to know about the $300 one-off payment that we have given and when they would be receiving that. The comments made by the member for Grayndler illustrate that people are hungry for information. You can never give people enough information, and from what the Carelink office staff member told me, it seems there is a huge need for people to have information. They were able say, ‘You can ring the Centrelink office for further information about the program and your payments will be coming in by the end of the month.’ SoI do not begrudge advertising. I have come from a business background where it is an essential part of doing business and it is an essential part of keeping consumers informed. This is no different. People deserve to know what is out there and what they are eligible for. I think that, particularly in the business sector, there have been some changes. People need to know what they are. We have been responsive to the business community and I certainly do not begrudge this government spending money to tell people what they are entitled to. They have that absolute opportunity. The bill consolidates a number of pensioner concession cards, senior health care cards and health care cards that exist in separate pieces of legislation. The legislation has the support of both the opposition and the Democrats in the Senate, essentially because it seeks to clarify and simplify a very complex area of social security law, specifically when it comes to health care cards and concession cards. Each of the acts that I mentioned earlier contains different provisions and entitlements, and produces myriad requirements to ensure compliance of health care cards and concession cards. The objective of the bill was therefore to bring all of those provisions together to enable a much clearer and more concise process. It must be noted that the bill will not reverse the eligibility status of anyone who is currently entitled to a concession card. The bill is welcomed for its desire to provide clarity in providing health care Wednesday, 27 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28809 cards and concession cards while highlighting the important role that these cards are playing in assistance and service to people in the area of need. One of the chief advantages of this legislation is that it provides an opportunity to improve the health outcomes for foster children and their carers. The Commonwealth recognises that financial assistance for foster children is the domain of the state government; however, in honouring a commitment to supporting and encouraging foster carers, the Commonwealth has introduced greater flexibility in the health care card rules for foster children, and simplification of the eligibility rules for foster carers claiming parenting payment. Considerable prior interest in this legislation has prompted the Commonwealth to ask the states for information on foster carers and foster children and the available assistance. Foster carers and foster parents have an important role to play in the foster process. It must be acknowledged that not all foster children come from families of low socioeconomic status and, under the current requirements, there are two requirements for a foster child to be eligible for a health care card. They include that the foster family of the child must qualify for family tax payment benefit, and that the child’s family of origin must also qualify for a health care card. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 12.59 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Department: Overseas Staffing Levels (Question No. 2588) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 24 May 2001: (1) On1 January 2000 how many (a) refugee and humanitarian and (b) other permanent residence applications were there at (i) Ankara, (ii) Nairobi, (iii) Islamabad, (iv) Beirut, (v) New Delhi, (vi) Wellington, (vii) Manila, (viii) Moscow, (ix) Athens, (x) Bangkok and (xi) Tehran.

368,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Australian Consulate-General: Chicago (Question No. 2605) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 June 2001: (1) Was the Chicago consulate closed in the early 1990s; if so, what one-off costs were involved with the closure. (2) What one-off costs are anticipated with the decision to re-open the Chicago consulate. (1) As part of a restructure of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) representation in the United States, management of the Consulate General in Chicago, and the Consulates in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston transferred to Austrade in mid 1993. Subsequent to the transfers, it was determined that Austrade’s corporate goals would be more effectively advanced through representation in Atlanta rather than Chicago. The Chicago office closed on 6 August 1993. One-off costs for the closure amounted to $66,545. (2) Estimated one-off costs associated with the opening of Chicago are $851,000. (Question No. 2641) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 5 June 2001: (1) Is he able to say what steps the British Government has taken to become a party to the 1995 Unidroit Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects. (2) What steps has Australia taken to become a party to the Convention. (1) The UK Government has decided not to sign the Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects (under the auspices of UNIDROIT), done at Rome on 24 June 1995. Instead, I am advised that the UK Government has decided to sign the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, done at Paris on 17 November 1970. (2) Australia participated in the negotiation of the UNIDROIT Convention, and is currently considering accession to the Convention. The matters covered by the Convention come within the portfolio responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator the Hon Richard Alston, and his Department is responsible for progressing domestic consideration of the Convention. In line with Australia’s treaty making process and practice, the matter of accession by Australia to the Convention will require consultation with State and Territory Governments as well as with relevant Commonwealth agencies, and consultation with key stakeholders including industry and public collecting institutions. My Department has been advised by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts that accession to the Convention would also require changes to the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. It is proposed that a process of consultation regarding accession to the Convention will commence in financial year 2001-2002.",182,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
