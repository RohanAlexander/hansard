Let me state very bluntly are not providing the services they commitwhat we are putting in this motion. We are ted themselves to provide and therefore are saying to the two airlines, Australian Airlines in breach of the two airlines agreement. That and Ansett Airlines of Australia, that if they breach is a fundamental breach, a substantial cannot deliver the goods they should close breach and a breach which is sustained and up shop and let someone else in who can prolonged.

It all tiate with the Australian Federation of Air follows logically from two clauses of the Pilots has obviously prolonged the breach. agreement.

The first course is to allowed to operate domestic passenger servgive a notice under clause 6 (1) (d) and let ices over trunk routes throughout Australia. other operators in.

But what we have now is a another example of the axis which has been situation where on any test Australian and drawn by the Opposition front bench with Ansett are not providing services over the the Australian Federation of Air Pilots in trunk routes of Australia. Even if we accept order to deprive Australian citizens of their their own case, they are not providing the services.
