Petition Received And Read. . Transfer Of State Debts. Surer If There Have Been Any Negotiations With The State Premiers, Especially Since The Premiers' Conference, In Regard To The Trans","fer of State debts, to the Commonwealth. If there have been such negotiations, how i soon will he feel free to take the members of this. House into his confidence upon the subject t no negotiations with the Premiers of the States upon tiie subject. Mr O'MALLEY -Will the right honourable and learned gentleman, before entering into negotiations to take over any part of the debts of any State, obtain an absolute agreement from that State that it will not borrow any more money except through the Commonwealth ? glad to do what I can in that direction, but my honourable friend is asking me to perform a very hard task. My inclinations run in the direction he has indicated, and I shall be very glad to carry out his views if I have the opportunity. Home Affairs lay upon the table a statement showing the number of electors in each of the new subdivisions of New South Wales1 for all the Sbates of the Commonwealth. tain information in respect to all the States of the Commonwealth until the work of subdivision has been completed. With regard to the State of New South Wales, although I know what tbe number of electors in each electorate is, I have not received any official information upon the subject, and if the honourable and learned member for Werriwa will refer to the Electoral Act he will find that the Minister has no power to compel the Commissioner to give him information until after the expiration of the month which is allotted for the lodging and consideration of objections and suggestions. Directly the. previous subdivision of New South Wales was completed, I gave the' information to the press, but the law to which I refer was not then in existence. Under existing circumstances, I am powerless to compel the Commissioner to give me information until he supplies it to me officially. know'if bhe South Australian Commissioner has finished bhe subdivision of that Statei graph in one of the newspapers to the effectthat the subdivision hod' been completed, and a reporb forwarded to my office. Commissioner was waiting for an intimation from the Minister. Sir. WILLIA M LYNE I have not received any information -from South Australia. A telegram was sent to the Commissioner there yesterday, to inquire if the work had been completed, but I have not yet had a reply to it. It is the Commissioner's duty to issue the necessary maps, and give all the information required by law, bub I am powerless to compel him to do more than his commission instructs him to do. us whether the figures which have been published in one of the Sydney newspapers are correct 1",12,Setup

Debate resumed from 26 th May (vide some of the replies that the Prime Minister page 66) on motion by MrL . E. GroomThat the following address in reply to the honourable friend. These points, according Governor General's opening speech be now to the Prime Minister, were of no conseadopted:MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in some cases hardly in keeping with ordinin Parliament assembled, beg to express outary common sense. The Prime Minister loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, found fault with the leader of the Opposiand to thank Your Excellency for the Speech tion for having given three different reasons which you have been pleased to address to why the Judiciary Bil l was not passed Parliament. -The leader of the Opposition has ex-each other. The first of these reasons, in hausted entirely the f u l l measure of complithe order in which the Prime Minister gave ment that it is expedient or desirable for them, was that tlie Opposition had prethe Opposition to lavish upon the Governvented the passing of the Bill because of ment, and therefore I do not presume to the fear of the appointments being made in add anything in that direction. Indeed, I recess; the second was, that the Government do not know that I could conscientiously neglected to push on with the measure; add very much, or suggest anything that and the third was that the Government did could be construed as being of the nature of not wish to pass the B ill because they could flattery. A cynical Frenchman once said not spare Senator O'Connor from another that, provided meals were served regularly, place.

The Government of government one lived. That was did not push on with the Bill primarily, a philosophical view of the case that because they did not wish to lose SenatorI should possibly entertain, but for the O'Connor. Having thus neglected to push fact that it could hardly apply, even in on with it, they brought it to the end of the the case of the cynical Frenchman, to the session, when the sense of the Opposition, Barton Government. I think the gentleas expressed by its leader, was that it was man referred to would have found that undesirable that the Bill should be passed something better than that might be looked at that particular time, so that the apfor, even though meals were served regupointments would be made during the larly and trains were punctual. The Prime recess, when the eyes and the voice of ParMinister has made some kind of answer to liament could not be brought to bear upon the speech of the leader of the Opposition. them. A fourth reason might have been He began by saying that, except as to the adduced by the leader of the Opposition matter of the six hatters, my right honorhad he thought of it , namely, that the able friend had touched upon no measures Government did not push the B ill through of the Government, past or present. say that.

34,Sir Edward Braddon,"However,precious to the people of that State. The right honourable gentleman also charged the leader of the Opposition with having entered into an unholy combination with some mysterious body which desired to secure the introduction of cheap labour by opposition to the passage of the Immigration Restriction Billa statement which is absolutely opposed to facts and to common .sense. What is the unholy combination into which the leader of the Opposition entered for the purpose of carrying out the scheme suggested ? W it h whom did he make the combination ? Those who voted for the Act in its present form included the members of the ' labour party and all save six members .of the Opposition. Are they the special representatives of capital ? I was one of the six who voted with the Government for the Bill in its original form, because I held that I was pledged by my utterances in Londoni n 1897, when the matter was being discussed with the Secretary of State for the Colonies. I late on the lines of the Natal Act, and upon my return to TasmaniaI introduced and passed through the State Parliament a measure framed upon those lines. Accordingly', it was only consistent that I should take the same stand last session. That, however, does not justify the charge made against the leader of the Opposition of entering into an unholy combination in an endeavour to defeat the passage of the. Immigration Restriction Bill. What did he do ? He endeavoured to make that measure effect what it was intended to accomplish according to all the opinions expressed throughout Australia. He endeavoured to introduce .the colour, line in order to secure a white-Australia by. a straight-out policy of exclusion. expression to trade upon. there is a cry for a white Australia, and it is only reasonable to insist that we should that they come to Australia voluntarily if have that term clearly defined by providing they come under, .an agree'ment.

The honourable Regarding that measure it seems a little and learned member for Northern Melbourne extraordinary that whereas on 10th May, s a i d 1901-the day after the opening of Parliament-Senato r O'Connor made a mistake tarily seek to make their homes here for the in saying that the colour line would be purpose of engaging in manual labour or anything applicable to all coloured aliens exelse, so long as they belong to civilized white cept British subjects, to whom an eduraces, and are themselves desirable immigrants. cational test would . be applied, and As I understand it, we have never in Australia that the Bill had already been drafted and presumably discussed by the Cabinet, that remarka remark of the most striking character-escape d the attention of ' the Prime Minister until a day or two ago. This seems to indicate that the method of drafting a B ill of that great importance was, at any rate, a very haphazard one, which does not reflect particular credit upon the administrative capacity of the Government. The Bill was amended in committee at the instance of the honourable member for Bland, and as a result of that amendment the notorious case of the six hatters has arisen. I maintain that both this House and the Seriate were clearly led to understand that the amendment-qualifie d as it ' was by other portions of the Bill-coul d not be interpreted as it has been since. innocent.

50,Mr Reid,"What a nice occupation forwere the members of that House themselves, should be prevented by a federal law, passed without the knowledge of the people, from landing. Wales Attorney-General, who is no special ally of the leader of the Federal-Opposition, said he was sure every member of the New South Wales Legislative Council must sympathize with the sentiments expressed by Mr Hawken. Mr Wise admitted the sentiment that was properly entertained by members of the House; but he appealed to honourable members not to bring forward in that Chamber a matter over which as a Parliament they had no control, and with which they had no concern. that it was a matter about which they knew very little. Mr B. R. Wise would not pretend to know as much about this matter, or perhaps any other matter, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports; but still that was the view which Mr Wise took, and it was a view largely taken inEngland. On this latter point, the honourable member for Wentworth will no doubt be able to give us some information. It is a view natural enough, surely, in a case in which six of Our fellow Britishers, our fellow countrymen,.free men and unionists men. man who is under a contract. bond slaves. man sacrifice his freedom when he agrees to take a certain wage for a certain work ? are none of us free men. the honourable member for Bland speak about free men when he is himself paid under a contract? moment. the contract ceases to be in force. extenuating plea I have heard for this policy is that there is a similar enactment, in America. But the Americans do not exclude Americans; they exclude aliens. Britishers. clude fellow Britishers. honourable member for Bland suffer a few moments in patience. The point is. that America carries out this policy with justification possibly, because she excludes, not fellow countrymen, but people who do not belong to her. But, in spite of the fact that America has over 80,000,000 of: people, the immigration to the United States to-day is hundreds of thousands, in the year, and it is admitted that, but for this immigration, thenaturalized and born Americans would, in the course of some years, deteriorate to a. very considerable extent. The influx of -new blood in America is a physiological necessity, owing to the climate of a greatpart of the country, as it will be found to be a physiological necessity in Australia,, where we tr y to shut out immigration. Is Australia fully populated ? Have we the number of citizens within the Commonwealth we ought to have to push our industries and develop all our wonderful resources? Ought we to suffer any law toremain on our statute-book that excludes any immigrant who is a desirable man to have amongst us 1 I think not. I suppose the Prime Minister referred to me when hespoke of the duty on potatoes and oatsbeing maintained on a high principle. There is something in that reference, and I did say something to thafc effect, and I did so advisedly. I was apologizing to my audience for what might appear to be'a lapse from the path of the free-trader,, the audience being free-traders for the most part; and my explanation was, I think,, thoroughly justifiable. I said that seeing that Tasmania made large sacrifices to enter the Commonwealth, and to purchase her way into the five ports of Australia, New Zealand, which had every opportunity of coming in, and which was courted and entreated to come in, should not, as a matter of justice,, have the same rights as Tasmania. That was not because Tasmania imports one bushel of oats or one ton of potatoes from New Zealand, or is ever likely to do so.",17,Governor General S Speech Becaus E That Is The Unfortunate Posi Address In Reply

70,Sir Edward Braddon,"W ill th&When I was Premier of TasmaniaI proposed to strike the duties off potatoes, oats, and cereals of all sorts, for the very simple reason that the duties were there for no particular purpose, inasmuch as we collected no revenue in the absence of any importation. But when it became a question of our being federated, and making considerable sacrifices for federation, then I thought it right ancl fair that, so long as New Zealand stood out, that colony should not have accorded to it all the privileges that Tasmania had bought. We have lately had an invasion of Tasmania by Ministers. ""We have had the Prime Minister, ancl also the Secretary for Home Affairs-the latter of whom is going over again-and we have the honorary Minister, Sir Philip Fysh, there now. a meeting in Launceston to-morrow ; that is his parliamentry business at the present time. If one were an evil-minded critic it might be supposed that Sir Philip Fysh was there, and that his colleagues had gone there, in 'view of the impending elections ; but if so, I think they are very much wasting their time. I do not think that thenbeing there will have any particular effect on the electors of Tasmania, or banish from their minds the bitterly hostile feeling that Ministers engendered early in their career. The Prime Minister yesterday spoke about my unkindness towards my ex-colleague, the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh. There is no unkindness of mine ; the unkindness is that of the Government in having placed the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, in the position in which he now finds himself. Ministers went to Tasmania and said"" We are the men who want to secure to you a proper revenue from the customs and to save you from an income tax."" The incoine tax at the time was very unpopularin Tasmania, and Ministers played on that fact when they said"" Do not listen to the Opposition, who will force an income tax on' you : listen to us, who will save you from it . "" That is a good card to play if only the Government do not get found out, and the people do not discover that the cards are marked. I. have no feeling of hostility towards the honorahle member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh. He was my colleague; and I ' hope I was loj'al to him so long as he ancl I were of the same political complexion. The honourable member was a free-trader, and I was a free trader; but after 65 years' experience ho 1 2 has become a protectionist. It is said that a man who never changes his mind is a fool, but a man who goes on for 65 years a fool in being of any political complexion, and then changes his mind so late in the day, does no good for himself. I want to show how extremely false is the position in which the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, has been placed. The other day at Hobart, speaking after the Prime Minister, and echoing what had fallen from the right honourable gentleman, he said This high Tariff is therefore a revenue Tariff, and not a destructive Tariff. Boots and hats would yield a little more at 10 per cent., but in connection with almost everything else, I am in a position to say that-the duties aro not destructive, even if they clo enable the manufacturers of Sir Philip Fysh has to address these States to supply a certain number of Australian people. It is not a fact that a lower Tariff produces more revenue. When Mr Reid says that he will secure the same amount of revenue from a lower Tariff, 1 say that he does not know what he is talking about. That is the honourable gentleman as a protectionist, who, while he says that low duties do not secure a larger amount of revenue than high duties, tells his audience in almost the same breath that if the duties upon boots ancl hats had been reduced from 30 to 10 per cent, they would have yielded a greater return. He goes on to saySo far as Tasmania is concerned, I will tell vou this: ThatI strove to get the highest TariffI posaibly could, because I wanted to stive you from direct taxation. There was give ancl take on both sides, and we secured a Tariff which is about as reasonable as we can expect. You have no business to pay a higher Tariff. I ask honourable members to mark that statement. No doubt the electors of Tasmania will do so. Although he told them that they had no business to pay a higher Tariff, he again and .again voted during the consideration of the Tariff for duties much higher than those which were agreed to. The Tariff which is now in force is not the Tariff which was brought down by the Government. It bears only a very faint likeness to it , and is incomparably superior to it, in that it is infinitely more moderate. it as a half-caste bears to a blackfellow. now ask the House to listen to what the honourable member, Sir Philip Fysh, saidwith my complete concurrence, and knowing that I should endorse every word he uttered -whe n Treasurer of my Administration in",18,Governor General S Speech Becaus E That Is The Unfortunate Posi Address In Reply

72,Sir Edward Braddon,"I will1897-8. In a Budgec speech which he delivered upon 14th October, 1897, he saidIn .1882 ad valorem duties of 10 per cent, mid minimum specific duties, added to a beer duty of 3d. per giillon, produced on a population of 102,834, a revenue of £302,954. Iii 1896 a maximum ad valorem duty of 20 per cent., and maximum specific duties, plus 4d. excise on beer, pro£1,000 a"" year, and of six assistants at a duced on a population of 106,113, £347,925. The difference is £44,971. The increase of population, without any increase of duty should, and probably would, have yielded £113,523. If that can be fairly assumed, then the increased Tariff is a loss and not a gain to the revenue. Can any facts more forcibly convince that our Tariff is baneful to the people without securing the revenue intended V In his next Budget speech he saidAVe admit that our experience of high Tariffs is that they too often defeat their primary object, times the amount the right honourable genand revenue is not gained. That is a fairly explicit statement in favour of low duties. Now, as to direct taxation. Speaking in 1897, the honourable gentleman saidIn 1882 Parliament was influenced to give relief to the taxpayer through the Customs, which the Treasurer of the day said then bore the relation of 70 i>er eent. to the total taxation of the country. I find that it was nearer 81 per cent., and I believe that policy of relief to be sound in principle. In 189fi tion could have done so. the relation is nearly 75 per cent., and in 1897 it will be much higher. That policy of 1882 was directed on principles which called to the aid of the revenue the land tax and the dividend tax of 1880. It finds its origin in the policy of the simple matter to arrange, inasmuch as in British Mouse of Commons, and if we are unable to adopt the Imperial fiscal policy in its entirety, we may accept it as a guide in regard to general principles. The Parliament of 1882 and 1892 accepted the necessities and equities of these proposals, and the people have been loyal to the compact. Yet a cry of repeal rises from the few who pay income tax, in disregard of the many who bear without a murmur all the other extra burdens I have named. The total repeal of the incoine tax would be a sin against the people, a breach of the canons of polibical economy, and a repudiation of an equitable adjustment to which all classes of the taxpayers have been parties. In conclusion, he saidNecessiby and a statesmanlike policy of fiscal reform alike brought into existence the income tax. I am showing what a complete change of front in regard to direct taxation by means of inconie tax there has been on the part of the honourable gentleman. the opportunity now afforded us to point out the grievances, more or less heavy, from which thc people suffer as a consequence of maladministration. was any hope of improvement I would once Sir Edward Braddon. more urge the absolute necessity for a larger measure of economy in administration than is now apparent.

A man who could not make a more economical arrangement with the States has no right to be a Minister. Then there are little pinpricks of administration which might very well be removed by the exercise of more consideration and expedition. I have two complaints which I specially desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs. One is in regard to the extravagant bonding rents which are now exacted, and which have been heavily increased since federation ; and the second is in regard to the delay which exists in getAVe can all take ting complaints heard.

He must know how bitter the feeling is throughout the trading world in regard to the administration of the Customs department. feeling to exist. right honourable gentleman has not looked far for a manifestation of it . There is considerable delay in obtaining replies to communications pointing out cases calling for redress. I do not complain about the Minister being quick to collect duty where it ought to be collected : but I think that he should be quicker in refunding duties which ought not to have been collected. I brought such a case under his notice many weeks ago, but, up to the present time, J have received no sort of answer to my letter. 1 was a little amused the other day to see how the Minister held himself up for public admiration as the Customs Minister who has received more conscience money than any other. I did not know that there was so much childlike and bland innocence in his composition. He appears not to see that, even if the fact is as stated, he does not receiveall the revenue which might be expected. If a merchant make a mistake in his entries now, he dare not own up to it. If he is an ultra-honest man, he has to send an anonymous letter to the Commissioner. the Minister know that it is not a fact that conscience money is sent in under these circumstances? a man points out a slip that would otherwise pass our notice, he is certainly not punishable for it. many persons have had a contrary experience. although it has been so stated for political purposes making these statements for any political purpose, but I am pointing out what is a popular belief, namely, that it is dangerous to point out mistakes in entries, because those mistakesare seized upon by the Customs authorities, and fines are inflicted. , Addressi n Reply. 133 that is wrongly entertained. have stated is laid down in the Customs Act as it is administered. kind in the Act. to me that the Minister does not know the Act which he has to administer. I wish to direct attention to one or two matters relating to the Post and Telegraph department, which 1 presume is represented here to-day by the Prime Minister. Although these are small matters they sliould be remedied as soon as possible. In the first place, a surcharge of l d . is now made upon letters which are posted in trains. In civilized countries which have developed their Postal departments to the fullest extent the trains afford the principal means of distribution, and the common practice is to post letters in trains, have them sorted on the journey, and . delivered at their several destinations along the road. This surcharge of l d . has been imposed upon letters posted in trains which are, therefore, now subject to a postage rate of 3d. I also wish to call attention to the rate for the delivery of private mail bags. These bags had previously been, treated as private letter-boxes, and recently the fee charged has been increased for no apparent reason, except that it will probably offer some inducement to people who now have private mail bags to discontinue them, and thus cause loss to the revenue. . In Launceston there is no delivery of letters received by the Inter-State mails arriving at that place on Saturday at noon until the following Monday. This may in vol ve very considerable trouble and anxiety to people other than those who can afford to have their private letter-boxes. Letters addressed to private individuals are, as a whole, of greater immediate concern than are business communicaA good tions, and I am glad to be informed that the Postmaster-General has the matter under his consideration.

121,Sir Edavard Braddon,"Thethat we shall not see the Bill during the life of the present Parliament. I hope that when it is submitted it will not be in anything like the form which has been outlined by the public press. I trust that it will not contain an invasion of the rights of British steam-ship companies trading to these ports, which would be unjustifiablewhich could hardly be justified by any process of reasoning whatever. It has been hinted that it will contain a provision declaring that the sailors of these vessels while in Australian waters shall be paid at the Australian rate of wages. What right have we to prescribe the rate of wage which these great shipping companies shall pay to their men ? Their vessels enter our ports for a week, ten days, or a fortnight, but they do not belong to us, and are we to discourage them from coming here ? To my mind, it is evident that we should encourage their presence as much as possible. orable member do if they remained trading upon our coast for months ? treat them exactly the same as if they remained here only for a week. twelve months, I suppose the same treatment would be meted out to them ? steamers of the P. and 0. and Orient Companies are very likely t'o remain here twelve months at a time, are tliey not ? The course suggested would not only be prejudicial to our interests, and constitute an interference on our part with the conduct of business by the great ocean-going steam-ship companies ; but it would also be against the interests of the sailors who come here, and still more against those of our own seamen, who might count upon it as a fact that if such a provision were enacted there would be an influx of sailors to enjoy the higher wages in comparison with which the entry of the six hatters would be something utterly trivial and unimportant. say so. say so by-and-by.

The speech statesThey will gladly take advantage of any opportunity thab may offer of bringing these subjects, before you, but they are not sanguine of being able to do so in the course of this session. Here is a matter which has been a most, urgently pressing one with the great bulk of the people of the different States ever since we federated. Indeed, one of the great reasons for federating was a desire that the State debts should be taken over by the Commonwealth together with the customs duties out of which the interest is paid. We have already been waiting for two years to witness-some step made in this very desirable direction, and we are now told that Ministers have been considering it,, I would but see no chance of doing anything in connection with the matter during this session.

This is not the time to refer to 12^per cent, to 20 per cent, for the our fiscal views or to urge the merits o? one express purpose of obtaining more revenue fiscal policy or the other ; we are not now on account of the straightened condition dealing with those views, and no arguments of the finances. However, these are little could have any effect. That being the case, lapses to which I suppose we are all more we should all agree to give the present or less liable.

W it h that knowledge and experience, we should in the course of a few years have an excellent opportunity of framing a Tariff suited to the permanent requirements of the Commonwealth. after three years-""D o not disturb these infantile industries."" those are my views. No one in this chamber respects the leader of the Opposition more highly than I do, and I am very sorry that he is determined to plunge the Commonwealth into another Tariff struggle. That would be done without any information other than we have at present, and it would only mean the disarrangement and paralysis of Australian trade, commerce, and manufactures for another two or three years. I venture to say that Australia is not in a position to stand anything of the kind. We havo suffered sufficiently from the disarrangement of trade in the last year or two, and also from the effects o£ the disastrous drought. I sincerely hope that the' leader of the Opposition will reconsider this matter. I venture to say that almost every person who has the interests of the Commonwealth at heart, whether he favours a free-trade or a protectionist policy, will agree that we ought to have a little commercial rest for a time, and give the present Tariff-althoug h I admit it does not satisfy either partya fair trial before attempting to disturb it . There was one other matter to which the leader of the Opposition referred, and about which I desire to say a word or two. I should be the last to say anything at this stage against the projeetwhich our friends from Western Australia have so much at heart-the Inter-State Rail way. The leader of the Opposition last night urged the Government to proceed with a survey. M°r. A. M c LE AN -There has been a trial survey. had not been a trial survey. If there had been I should not have made the observation. MrA . M c LEAN over and over again that the State Government of Western Australia have made a trial survey. survey made by two engineers, Messrs. Muir and Stewart, who have reported to some extent in favour of the practicability of the line. Mr AM c LEAN I hope that a full investigation may justify me in supporting It would he the same old cry this project, but at the present time the only salient features that stand out in connection with it are that it is estimated to cost over £5,000,000 sterling; that the line runs for the greater portion of its length through a desert-though I am almost afraid to say so in the presence of the Minister for Defence-and that when completed it will have to compete with water carriage, which can almost always undercut railway carriage. Before we do anything in the way of committing the Commonwealth to the expenditure of £5,000,000-whic h is no trifling sum-w e should have the fullest information that could be obtained. I listened very carefully to the Prime Minister last night, and I tliink I can say without flattery that I never heard him in better form. Most of the statements he made were extremely effective, and I agreed very largely with what he said. But as there are spots on the face of the sun, so I think there were some weak points in the Prime Minister's arguments. In referring to the case of the six hatters who were denied admission to the Commonwealth, until the intelligence had been cabled not only over the British Empire, but over the whole civilized world, the Prime Minister waxed indignant at any person attempting to criticise the Immigration Restriction Act. If the Prime Minister had confined himself to a defence of his own administration of the Act, he would have been on sound ground, but when he went on to defend the Act itself, he was on anything but a firm basis. I know that the Prime Minister did no more than administer the Act in accordance with its strict letter, and I am not one to evade my share of the responsibility as a private A trial survey. member for having permitted such an Act to get on the statute-book.

140,Sir Edmund Barton,"There hasabsolutely right-au d I did not see my way to offer any strenuous opposition if that was all that was intended. I fully believed, from what we had been previously told by several members of the Government, that the Act would be administered in that spirit. It will be remembered that when the Bill containing the education test for immigrants was under consideration, it was pointed out over and over again that the provision, if strictly enforced, would shut out, not only numbers of reputable Europeans who would make most excellent colonists, but might also shut out hundreds and thousands of British subjects. There are numbers of British subjects who could not pass an educational test, and who nevertheless might be industrious, reputable, honest people, and would make desirable colonists. When these facts were pointed out we were told over and over again that if this power were given to the Government they would undertake that it would be applied only in the case of coloured aliens or objectionable immigrants. With that assurance, I for one took it for granted that the Prime Minister would administer the provision in regard to contract labour in the same spirit, and that it would be resorted to only during the progress of an industrial dispute. Mr A. M c LEAN No ; the Prime Minister did not say that it would be only so applied. that I would not apply the education test to reputable Europeans. MrA . McLEAN -When the Prime -Minister accepted the provision^in regard to contract labour, I thought he would see his way to administer it in the same way as the provision for an educational test. HadI thought it would be used for the purpose of shutting out the most desirable class of irami»rants that could possibly come to Australia, I should have opposed it to the very utmost of my power, and I believe a great number of honourable members would have done the same. The Prime Minister seemed very land, the Agent-General for New South ""Wales, had dared to say that the exclusion of the six hatters would affect our credit in the mother country. I must certainly express my surprise that it was necessary for the Prime Minister or any other member of the House to go to Mr Copeland for that defeat local labour ? information, which was as patent as the noonday to every business man in Australia. What are the facts of the case 1 We know perfectly well, and every man whose opinion is worth having will tell us, that Australia can never become a prosperous nation without a large increase of our present population, aud a very large expansion of our present industries. Where is the population to come from ? We have already shut out aliens and objectionable immigrants of every kind, and I supported every measure to that end -no t that I am afraid of a small sprinkling of industrious, frugal people such as we sometimes have amongst us, but because of our close proximity to the teeming millions of the East, by whom, unless we adopt drastic legislation of the kind, our continent might be overrun, and the question arise as to which race should dominate. I consider it was absolutely necessary in the interests of the future of Australia that we should go that far, and I did all I could to support measures with that object. But, having shut the door to every undesirable class of immigrant, surely it was our duty to open it all the more .widely to every class of reputable immigrants who would be a desirable acquisition to our population. AYhat did the Prime Minister tell us last night t He told us that free men from Great Britain are welcome, but that bondsmen are not welcome-that men who come under agreement are not welcome. I can only say I never heard a greater desecration I never heard a greater prostitution of the terms, ""bondsmen"" and "" free men,"" than to assert that men who can get work and who will not leave work for which they are well qualified, unless assured of employment here, are bondsmen; while a member of the unemployed in England is -quite welcome to lea%e the old world and r to swell the ranks of the unemployed in the new world and perhaps become a burden on the people. That is a doctrine entirely new to me, and one which I think will never have my adhesion. I consider that the man who establishes a valuable' industry in our midst, and who at his own expense brings out labour to make the industry a success, thus furnishing employment, is a public benefactor. A t any rate such a man would be so regarded in any other country in the world except Australia.",26,Governor General S Speech Becaus E That Is The Unfortunate Posi Address In Reply

I feel that we are making a serious blunder, and that if wepersevere in ifc, as the Prime Minister 'said last night the Government intend to do, we shall strike a blow at the very root and foundation of our national life. Contrast our condition with that of Canada. on the subject as we have. MrA .

We should offer every inducement to useful immigrants to settle amongst us. It will be a fatal blunder to build a Chinese wall round the continent, but that is what we are doing. And while we are trying to keep out our countrymen from the old world, we are taxing our own people to such an extent that we are driving them out of the Commonwealth. It is a very easy thing to keep out reputable immigrants who would like to come here, but we cannot compel our own people to remain if they are not content with their conditions. Therefore, we find that while there is very little immigration to Australia, our own people are leaving us by the thousand. What else could we expect from our manner of treating them ? We are piling up taxation. helped to do that by supporting tlic Tariff introduced by the Government. He supported high duties whose effect must be to drive population out of the interior. MrA . M c LEAN I did not help to place upon the people the burdens to which A man would not I am about to allude. We are driving people away by encumbering them with taxation which they should never have been asked to bear. Take two of the subjects referred to in the Governor General's speech-the High CourtB i ll and the Inter-State Commission Bill. If those measures are passed, their administration will, when in full swing, cost the Commonwealth not less than £50,000 a year, and probably much more. Now, when the people of Australia were asked to enter into this union, the leading statesmen and writers on the press who advocated it told them that £300,000 a year would be the maximum cost incurred by federating. Committee of the Convention reported during the Adelaide Session that to put the Commonwealth into motion, with certain attributes which they provided for, would cost £300,000 a year, but it was not concealed by the advocates of federation thafc The other day the cost of administration would afterwards increase.

Those figures do nofc include the -expense of Parliament., which for the first two years and three months of federation amounted to £291,078, which seems an extraordinarily large sum. I fail to sec why the expenditure of the Department of Defence should have increased' since the administration of the separate departments of the States was amalgamated under the Commonwealth. T admit that it was necessary to spend a large sum of money upon the celebrations consequent upon the Royal visit, but I find that in the first two years and three months of federation the total expenditure of the department has been increased by £83,292. Sir honourable member get thosefigures? They were supplied by the Under-Treasurer. For the first six months of federation the increased expenditure of the department was £44,147. was spent in connection with the Royal visit. Mr A. M c LEAN was. During the financial year which commenced on the 1st July, 1901, the expenditure of the department was ±'24,433 more than under,.the administration of the States, anrl during the first nine months of the present financial year it was ±14,712 in excess. I am not allowing for any saving in the cutting down of troops, because I take it that that could have been done equally well while the military were under, the control of the Governments of the various States. The total additional expenditure of the Commonwealth last year, as shown by the Treasury figures, was £275,861. That was the expenditure for a full financial year, and I would rather deal with those figures than take the figures for the present financial year, which has nofc wholly expired. Those figures, however, do not show anything like the whole of the expenditure which the people have heen called upon to meet. vides for the creation of a white Australiaand which I supported, but of which I think fche people should know the cost, has led to the paying away in the shape of rebates for the last nine montlis of no less a sum than £61,266, which is at fche rate of £81,688 per annum. months includes fche season in which the cane is delivered at the mill, and the amount paid in rebates is consequently the total amount that will be required for the year. MrA . M c LEAN I am willing to accept that correction, but I wish to point out; that the expenditure must go on increasing. The Act does not provide for the total abolition of Kanakas until 1906. Last year only a little over 30,000 tons-of sugar were produced by white labour. But if we take the total production for the Commonwealth afc 150,000 tons^JOHN FORREST -Wher e did the 170,000 tons. Mr A. M c LEAN I accept those figures. That means that this Act alone will involve an expenditure of £340,000, or £40,000 more than the total outlay foreshadowed by the advocates of federation. In addition to that, we inserted one section in the Public Service Act relating to the payment of the minimum wage, which will also involve a heavy expenditure. Thafc was distinctly an A good deal of it. Act of the Federal Parliament, and I am nofc siying one word against ifc, but I am only showing whafc our legislation is costing the taxpayers. We have paid under this section during the last nine months £21,894, or at the rate of £28,658 a year, and this cause of expense, like the other to which I have referred, is in its iniancy only. It is estimated by the Treasurer thafc ifc will cost very much more. Whilst referring to these matters I cannot refrain from saying a word or two about the department of my honourable friend the Attorney-General. I think thafc thafc stands out as a shining example to all others, owing to fche smnll amount of expenditure incurred and the great amount of work performed by it.

The total cost of his department to fche CommonOne Act alone-that which prowealth for two years and three months has been only £5,037.

168,Mr Hume Cook,"How can the issuesdoubt the right honourable gentleman would enter upon a radical revolution of the Tariff; but I understood him to indicate that where certain lines involved a loss to the revenue, they must be abolished; but where duties were too onerous, even from a moderate protectionist point of view, they should be reduced, and that, at all events, a stand should be made upon the whole question of oppressive and wasteful duties at this time rather than five or ten years hence, so that industries established underthe Tariff may not in their opposition to revision rely upon the guarantee of acquiescence in their con tinuance, and so that we may not have to beat down vested interests created in large centres, such as Sydney, by the operation of inequitable imposts. It is fully understood that if protection is once allowed to develop in any country, it is hopeless to abolish it . I was also exceedingly glad to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Gippsland in reference to the establishment of the. High Court. I have previously expressed the opinion-and I repeat it nowthat the immediate creation of a High Court, manned by new Judges, is premature. I do not think that it is really required by our Constitution. It was absolutely necessary in connection with the American Constitution, because there was no Privy Council to whicli to appeal for the reconciliation of the conflicting decisions of the States courts. In the next place, some of the States courts had, in confederal days, point-blank refused to carry out the federal laws. learned member think that the provision in the Constitution which enables us to refer matters to the State courts covers all the ground that is covered by the High Court, excepting that court as a court of appeal 1 means I suggest will , be all that is necessary for the next generation to reconcile the divergent decisions of the States courts. In pursuing the reference which I was making to America, I may mention thafc the ""Executive had complete control over fche judiciaries of the several States. -Judges had a tenure of office in some cases at will, and in other cases from year to year, and as a necessary consequence the State courts really followed the trend of State politics, which for fifteen or twenty years was too often antipathetic to federal If opportunity arose, no power. The dependence of the Judges upon the Executive impelled the federalists of America, in the very first session of Congress, to constitute a federal court. It goes without saying that no such necessity exists here. Our. Judges hold their office during good behaviour, and, apart from that consideration, we have in the Privy Council one of the greatest tribunals that the world has ever seen, despite its occasional eccentricitiesa tribunal which is free from all political bias, free from all preconception which political Judges must have as regards the construction which should be placed upon the Constitution preconceptions it may be taken from the Convention in which some members who may be promoted to the'bench were particularly active. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, who made a very good speech in opening the debate, referred to the small business which the Supreme Court of the United States was called upon to do jluring the first fifteen or twenty years of its existence. It is somewhat significant tliat between 1790 and 1801-2, there were only six constitutional cases decided by that tribunal. Of course, a good deal of other business came before it , but the decisions upon the particular matters which in Australia call for the creation of a High Court did .not amount to more than six in the first twelve or thirteen years of the American Federation. As a matter of fact, during the period in which Chief Justice Marshall held office, .namely, from 1803 to 1835, the constitutional appeals averaged only two each year. They amounted altogether to 62. Of course, I am dealing with the honourable and the period referred to by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, who, on the question of business, took up a position which he thought strengthened the case for the establishment of the High Court, but which I think really I do. I think that the militates against its creation. Som'e time ago I called for a report upon the number of appeals made to fche Privy Council during the twenty years ended 1901. Honourable members may have seen that report, which was furnished last year. It showed that the total number of appeals during the The period indicated was 223-a n average of less than 12 a year. Our conditions of appeal to the Privy Council are almost identical with those which operate in the case of Canada. We have not abolished the appeal to the Privy Council.

171,Mr Glynn,"done so, I should say thafc the High Court ought at once to be created. But we have to deal with circumstances as they are. The High Court of Australia, if established, will not, at its own option, be the court of final appeal except in very rare instancesperhaps once in fifteen or twenty years. It can only prevent an appeal when a question of constitutionality arises between States and the Federation. It is substantially true, therefore, that we have nofc abolished the appeal to the Privy Council, and that the High Court will still be only an intermediate court of appeal. conditions are somewhat similar to those prevailing here, two-thirds of the appeals from the State courts go direct to the Privy Council. Owing to the respect in which that tribunal is held, and the greater expense of taking them into the Supreme Court, where there is no resident bar, and where the judges are actually compelled to reside, the hulk of the appeals go direct to the Privy Council. If honourable members care to look at the appeal cases, they will see that whafc I am stating is absolutely correct. If we establish the High Court, though there may be an average of. twelve appeals a year-takin g as a basis the experience of the last twenty years-probabl y not more than half of them will go to the High Court of Australia. I have already mentioned the number of constitutional cases which arose in America; and we must not expect that the States are going to be constantly wrangling as to moot points of constitutional law. If we allow that there will be only half-a-dozen appeal cases a year, I fail to see the necessity for creating the High Court immediately. The Bill introduced last year by the Attorney General, in the very excellent speech to which everybody has referred in terms of admiration, proposed to create a very large original jurisdiction, which can be given only by centralization and by ousting the jurisdiction of the State courts in matters with which they are competent to deal. I do not wish, at this stage, to amplify the objections to the creation of the High Court, but I do think that they should give honourable members pause. We ought to bow to the prejudice-if one may be permitted to use thafc term-of the electors of Australia against the creation of huge machinery before the circumstances clearly justify the necessity for its creation. public should have some tribunal to which they can appeal. right honourable and learned member's reference, but if we were to vest original jurisdiction with the State courts, and use that highly respected and justly revered body, the Privy Council, for the purpose of correcting divergent decisions, all that is necessary during the first twenty years of our national existence would be accomplished, and we should effect a saving of In Canada, where the £30,000 a year, according to the convention estimates, and possibly of £50,000. The Inter-State Commission B ill need never have been introduced if the Minister for Home Affairs had displayed a little energy in attempting to induce the Premiers to come to some arrangement in regard tocompetitive rates at the borders. I pressed this matter upon his attention last year, when he promised to endeavour to see if some such arrangement could not be arrived! afc. Later oh he informed the House that the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria had acknowledged the communications which had been forwarded to them, but that the Premier of South Australia had replied asking for further particulars. Letters were written by the Acting Prime Minister to the Premiers of the three States concerned, asking them to come to some arrangement similar to that which was entered into in 1895 for the voluntary abolition of these competitive rates. But, if the Acting Prime Minister had really wished that the States should do nothing, he could not have drafted a letter which was better adapted to attain that end than the one which he sent to South Australia. He practically accused thafc State of being the only sinner in the matter. The wording of the communication was so unhappy that the South Australian Premier had to ask in what respect that State had sinned, what were the particular rates objected to, and consequently the correspondence stopped, and nothing nas been clone since. I firmly believe, from what I know of the temper of South Australia and the apparent inclination of other States, that if an agreement similar to that which was entered into in 1895, for the abolition of these competitive rates, had been adopted, the, matter might have been settled without the intervention of an Inter-State Commission.

173,Mr Glynn,"I quite agree with the117 of the Constitution, which prevents rliscriniination between the States, makes the border rates absolutely unconstitutional. It requires only the act of the Executive to see that the -provisions of the Constitution are carried out. I notice that the Government are now considering the question of taking over the State debts. Some of us ""strongly -advocated the adoption of that course in the convention. It is only right ' that the primary liability as to the payment of interest on the debts should rest upon those who have the control of the Customs, which was the mainstay of the States' revenues. But I believe that if the debts are to be taken over, the power of the States to borrow further ought to cease. It is impossible to have seven different bodies dealing with the one set of -assets. A t the present time the States are mutually interested in each other's securities. All their assets are jointly taxable through the the various States after eliminating difFederal Parliament, and it is ridiculous to have six States capable, without mutual control, of dealing with one set of assets, and the 'Commonwealth capable Of imposing burdens nrpon the very same assets. The sooner we -obtain the power of checking the States in their borrowing the better. The result also would be consolidation. Instead of having six or seven classes of debts, we should have one only, and greater solvency would arise from the fact that the money lender in the old country would at once be able to understand what Australian securities really were. and learned member suggest that borrowing of the. States should be checked 1 tain amount of whispering humbleness, to make a suggestion to the Treasurer, not that there is much in it, but merely for -consideration, and I do so because in the Federal Convention I suggested an amendment which was not gone on with, in the direction of taking away the power of the States to borrow. If a State with less than the average indebtedness of the States were allowed to demand a loan through the Federal Parliament, no harm would be done. If a 'State has been economical-if by the conversion of its debts and increase of population, the indebtedness per head is less than the present average of all the StatesI should allow that State to borrow, as a right, through the Commonwealth. In Queensland I find that the indebtedness exceeds by £ 2 0 l is . 2d. per head, the average indebtedness of the States, while in South Australia there is an excess of £ 1 9 5s. 6d. per head. Under the circumstances such States ought to show cause why an application for a loan through the Federation should be granted; because the other States, as I have already said, have an interest in the solvency of the two States. other matters to be considered 1 detail, but the honourable and learned member is quite right. When I mentioned the average indebtedness I ought to have said the true indebtedness, because terms and interest must be taken into account, and the true indebtedness is easily enough obtained by reducing all the loans on paper to one common denominator. Having got the true average relative indebtedness of ferences of terms and rates of interest, a State, when its indebtedness exceeds the present average, ought not to be allowed to borrow as a matter of course. In Victoria the indebtedness is apparently under the average by the amount of £ 1 1 9s. lOd. per head, and under the circumstances Victoria ought to be allowed to borrow according to its own-desire. learned member does not take assets into account. does the honourable thing into account. I am merely making a the general suggestion; and, whilst various factors have to be taken into account, I do I was about, with a cernot desire to deal with particulars on an occasion like this. It may be, for instance, that the indebtedness of Victoria is higher than Vt appears. It has been said, though I do not know with ""what truth, that many of the municipal debts of Victoria are really State debts; that, however, is a matter on which I do not desire to say anything. These are minor matters of adjustment, and my only object at present is to indicate, possibly, some suggestion which may impose a check on State borrowing, and yet be satisfactory to the States. I very much regretthat there is no reference in the speech to the question of river navigation, seeing that the Federation, as well as the States, has an interest in the much vexed and important question of the rivers.

179,Mr Glynn,"On e cannot take everylast year, in regard to non-interference with diversions in the rivers, statedI t may be that no action can be taken nntil a law is passed dealing with navigation, or the High Court is established. Apparently we are to have no law this session on the navigation question. There is a huge B ill of about 600 clauses, to consider whi;h might occupy two years, and the greater part of which is probably borrowed from the Imperial Merchant ShippingA c t ; but the Government ought to have at once placed beyond doubt federal jurisdiction over the rivers by passing a short Navigation Act. Personally, I think we have jurisdiction without an Act, but on this point I remember that in the celebrated case of the Queen v. Keyne-the Franconia case it was decided that though the civil and municipal jurisdiction of England, by the acquiescence of other nations, extended to the 3-mile limit, that jurisdiction was only effective for the purposes of belligerencythat it was dormant for other purposes, until an Act of Parliament, exercising it had been passed. Legal members of the House will remember that in that case, owing to no Act having exercised jurisdiction, the captain of the Norwegian vessel, who was arraigned for manslaughter through carelessness, outside was acquitted, and that the year following, an Act was passed, exercising jurisdiction Following the analogy of that case, it is more than doubtful whether federal jurisdiction exists until an Act is passed : and that seemed to be the opinion of the Attorney-General, as expressed in the answer given through the Minister for Home Affairs. I again express my regret that, under the circumstances, nothing has been done by the Government. I would -appeal, on the question of the rivers, to the good sense of Australian representatives. I am bound to refer to this matter shortly, because we have, as federal members, a direct duty and responsibility in connection with the rivers, just as much as have the members of the States Legislatures. hold it would be a poor outcome of the loud-voiced enthusiasm which led to federation being, carried, if on tbe first occasion when an appeal is made to Australian sentiment and national spirit on such a question as that of the rivers, that spirit is found wanting. It is in matters of great difficulty, and not in matters of petty parochial K 2 politics, that real statesmanship is -tested. Minor matters can-be dealt with by men of moderate intelligence and a little luck if they have a complaisant majority behind them; but it requires men of high calibre to deal with questions of great difficulty which do not, perhaps, bring immediate benefit, from a party point of view, to those who advocate them. There is no doubt that the relative rights of the riparian States in the rivers, and the best use and just apportionment of the waters, is one of the biggest questions that Australian statesmanship can face. The difficulty and complication are not inherent in the question itself. The trouble arises from the mutual misunderstanding and suspicions of the States concerned, from the relative extravagance of their respective demands, from the idea which has been formed on an imperfect knowledge of the details that it is impossible to reconcile the interests of navigation and irrigation, and that all concessions to one interest or method of utilization must be altogether at the expense of the other. But I hold that if honourable members approached this question with a f u l l knowledge of all its bearings, and in a spirit which would actuate them if the Commonwealth were really a consolidation, a solulow-water mark tion of the river question satisfactory and just to the States and the Commonwealth could readily be found. All that is really neceswithin the 3 mile limit. sary is that we should get rid at once of the futile idea that it is impossible to reconcile the interests of irrigation and navigation, and that one must be given supremacy at the expense of the other. On that point I would recall the statements made by the Attorney-General and by the Minister for Home Affairs at the Melbourne Federal Convention. These honourable members then pointed out that, although the question was very hotly discussed, there was a possibility of a method of reconciling the two interests being hit on by the Federal Parliament, which they asked the Convention to trust in the matter. I should like to place before honourable members the posiI tion from a South Australian point of view. I may have to weary honourable members with a few figures which I feel it my duty to submit for consideration, although the significance of those figures may not perhaps be capable of immediate apprehension. The Royal commission appointed by the three interested States reported that there was an irrigable. area of'50,000,000 acres in Australia-that is, an area' capable of being irrigated if water were obtainable. The total irrigable area in New South Wales is given as 43,500,000 acres, in Victoria as 4,000,000 acres, and in South Australia as 2,500,000 acres. the Murray system ? flats? a certain distance of the river. Many persons reading the report of the Royal commission, or a newspaper synopsis of that report, would rush to the conclusion that there are tremendous opportunities for irrigation from this river system; but as a matter of fact the effective irrigable area is much less than that I have just stated. I do not know what the real area is in New South Wales; but the area in Victoria was reduced by experts to 2,000,000 acres as a maximum, and in that State there are not altogether more than 276,000 acres under irrigation. A very small proportion of even thab area is under intense culbivabion, bhe greater part being under irrigation by flooding, which is the least profibable and mosb wasbeful method. I am speaking now purely on the evidence taken by the Royal commission. not touch Queensland. much inberested in the matter except in one way. MrL . E. GROOM -Queenslan d supplies the water. irrigation are. not so great in Queensland as elsewhere, although that State really acts as a benefactor to the other Sbabes. The cabchmenb area in Queensland which supplies bhe river sysbems is far greaber bhan in any obher Sbabe, and we hope bhat Queensland will join in the Inter-State locking system. According to experbs, rivers for a considerable disbance inbo Queensland are capable of being made permanently navigable by a proper sysbem of locking, and I hope that we shall have the co-operation of our Queensland, friends in the federal policy. America shows what extravagant views are entertained as regards opporbunities for irrigation, when I sbate that in the arid region of the United States there are not more than about 3,500;000 acres irrigated. commanded by irrigation channels. Irrigation, which is, perhaps, one of the greatest authorities in America, and on another book, the name of which I forget. to whom I am much indebted for informal which are regarded as the leading States iu America, from the irrigation point of view, are California and Colorado, but in the former State there are only 1,500,000 acres under irrigation, and in the latter 1-2 per cent, of the total area of the State, or about a million acres. That does not show a very large capacity for irrigation. In Egypb irrigation has been in existence from bhe time of the Trojan war, and there are not now more than 5,000,000 acres commanded by the Nile. population. which keeps the population there, but if in Egypt, which is the greatest country in the world for irrigation, there are not more than 5,000,000 acres learned member know the reason why the area is not larger ? getting the water. never have been constructed conservation works to steady the flow and keep the water available. be urged as an objection; but in India there is not a very much larger area regularly under irrigation than there is in Egypt. In South Australiathere is a very great navigation interest which is imperilled by ah extravagant view of the possibilities of irrigation. There are something like 9t> vessels, representing an invested capital of £250,000, engaged in the navigation of the South Australian rivers. £250,000 is the Victorian estimate of fche value of the vessels. I believe that the figures were supplied by the firm of Permewan, Wright, and Co., but that Captain King's estimate is, I think in excess of that sum. member cannot speak of those vessels as engaged in navigation when they are lying at the mouth of the river.",34,Governor General S Speech Becaus E That Is The Unfortunate Posi Address In Reply

197,Mr Salmon,"The honourable and learnedwhich trade throughout the river system when the rivers are navigable. The Murray is navigable as far as Wentworth for, on the average, nine months of the year, but the apportionment which was recently suggested would destroy its navigability for the greater part of that time. The commission recommended that in any apportionment the navigation interests of the river which already exist shall be respected. On page 50 of their report the commissioners sayI t has been already shown that no apportionment of water ean be made between the States for irrigation and water conservation without regard to the requirements of navigation. Sufficent water must be allowed to pass down the rivers to maintain navigability as heretofore, and as some time must elapse before the construction of locks and weirs, it is"" important to decide what are the conditions which will secure this meanwhile. That is, the same natural discharge for the purposes of navigation as previously existed. I say at once that we in South Australia do not ask for that, and that it cannot be granted except at the expense of the demands of Yictoria and New South Wales. But we ask that compensation in the way of conservation to render our share effective should be given to us if we are to yield to the needs of the other States. What do the commissioners and the Premiers recommend? missioners periods, that from July to January, which aro considered the high-water months, and that from February to June, which are considered the low-water months. For the first period the upper States-Ne w South Wales and Yictoria-ar e to have a diverting power of 440,000 cubic feet per minute, and all the surplus over the navigable discharge at Morgan, and South Australia a discharge of 170,000 cubic feet per minute. That is, if the Murray at Morgan has a discharge of over 337,000 cubic feet per minute, the navigable discharge taken by the commission, any surplus is to go to the upper States. The compromise of the Premiers was this : The quantity to be diverted by the upper States was left at 440,000 cubic feet per minute, but that was subject to a condition which in some cases would be an impossible one. The diverting power of the upper States was made conditional upon there being a navigable discharge at Morgan. Now, during some of the high water months vou cannot givea diversion of 440,000 cubic feet per minute to the upper States, and leave a navigable discharge at Morgan. I will show honourable members what would be the effect upon the existing discharge of carrying this suggestion into operation, and for this purpose I will deal first with the period from July to January, and afterwards with the period from February to June, taking the discharge for the year 1900, which is adopted by the commissioners as a mean year, and for the year 1896, which was regarded as a typically low year, though I think, as I shall afterwards show, that it really was not so. The average discharge at Morgan for the period from July to January, 1900, was about 1,100,000 cubic feet per minute. A depth of 4 feet upon the gauge there, which is accepted by the Premiers as a navigable discharge, and which is the discharge to be submitted to t the State Parliaments for approval, is equal to a discharge of 460,000 cubic feet per minute. South Australia, therefore, gives up during the high-water months of a mean year a surplus of 640,000 cubic feet per minute. and learned member say that South Australia gives up that surplus, because not a drop of the water which"" is measured falls in her territory ? divide the year into two that question. It is a matter of morality, and may be a matter of law. Honourable members may challenge my position, and say that South Australia is not entitled to the rights, she claims. That is a matter of opinion. But, assuming that there is something in our claim, and that our rights may be recognised by the courts, then the-effect of the compromise of our lawful claims which is suggested by the Premiers is as I have pointed out. I am not going to object to it, but I intend to ask for compensation when we grant it a compensation which I am sure the good sense of honourable members will recognise. Let me now take the typical low year of the commissioners. In 1896 the average discharge at Morgan, during the period from July to January, was 649,429 cubic'feet per minute. A navigable discharge, according to the Premiers, would be 460,000 cubic feet per minute, so that the surplus given up in that year would have been 189,429 cubic feet per minute.

In addition, if there is any surplus, ten-eighteenths of it is to go to New South Wales, fiveeighteenths toVictoria, and three-eighteenths to South Australia"". The effect of. that distribution would be this: "" In 1900 the average discharge during, these months at Morgan, was 257,000 cubic feet per minute. The minimum suggested by the Premiers' Conference was 150,000 cubic feet per minute,., which, would give up an excess of. 107,000 cubic feet per minute. In the typical, low year-1896-the average discharge was 430,000 cubic feet per minute, so that the surplus would have been 2S0,000 cubic-, feet per minute. It will.be seen, that the figures for the typical low year are higher than those for what is regarded as a.mean. year. RutI have already said that I consider the figures do not justify it being called a typical low year. however, that, you cannot always give a minimum of 150,000 cubic feet per minute to South Australia. Australia get'her surplus water? into that, question. I acknowledge that the deavouring to lead up to. I should be the water comes from the other States, though last to obstruct a final solution of the two-thirds of it falls in Queensland. Do not wrangles over the rivers question.

Thus the minimum proposed would be ineffective for us, and it is to be given in exchange for the surrender of a large part of the navigable, discharge of the stream.

Let us look at the present position of Victoria. Very little diversion of water is made-by New South ""Wales, but in March of this year Victoria had a total diversion of-50,000 cubic feet per minute, the diversion in that month-from theGoulburn alone being 20,000 cubic feet per minute. A channel is now being constructed, and is very near completion, which will have a capacity of 103,000 cubic feetper minute, and which will enable the whole of the waters of the Goulburn to be diverted into Victoria. commission. Goulburn is sometimes as much as 1,500,000 cubic feet per minute. to go by is the discharge inlow years. It is in low years, not in years of. flood, that the diversion of water matters. In March, 1903, 21,000 cubic feet: per minute was being diverted from the River Goulburn; 18,000 cubic feet was being pumped from, the River Murray and at Mildura 13,000 cubic feet was pumped in March, the total being 51,000 cubic feet, although the discharge at Echuca at that time was only 40,000 cubic feet per minute, and the discharge at Renmark had fallen to 24,000 cubic feet per minute, ancl the water in the river there was not sufficient to permit of navigation by ordinary boats propelled by oars. year it has been. that the river question becomes most imwhat special object the money was spent, portant to every one; and within a few so long as the capital expended on wateryears it will be a difficult matter for Vicworks had to be wiped off to the extent of toria to get what she wants unless she joins £1,750,000. hands with South Australia.

We ought to expect production from settlement. be taken in conjunction. The period of production in many cases is followed by a number of months when the river is very low, and if the river is not navigable the produce cannot be carried to market. We know, for instance, that wool is kept on the upper rivers for twelve months and more because it cannot be removed to the markets. The cost of the proposed locking to Wentworth is put down at £760,000, or about £200,000 more than the amount which, was proposed to be borrowed by the Government under the LoanB ill dischargeofthe of last session. It may be that this work will not directly pay for some years, but it must be remembered that our railways do not at once pay the f u l l amount of interest upon the capital expended. I would ask also whether ordinary water supply systems pay. Victoria went in very largely for the creation of water trusts, and for carrying out irrigation works. In 1900 she had to wipe off over £1,750,000 which had been invested in irrigation works. dealing with the matter shows that the interest and capital which had to be wiped off amounted to the sum I have mentioned.

I still hold the opinion that I had previously expressed, that the proposal to build a new federal capital is premature. It will involve .very great expense, and will not realize the objects of those who wish to have a federal city apart from the present centres of population. Ottawa and Washington are neither of them models of political purity. The tone of politics at the former city is very largely influenced by the civil service, and the capital is run by third-rate pressmen, politicians, and civil servants. honourable member suggest that the federal capital should be ? should be located in Sydney rather than that it should be planted away somewhere in the Australian bush. I do not think that the removal of the seat of government from the present centres of population is likely to lead to any improved tone in tributing towards the navy. federal politics, or to exert any beneficial influence upon the legislation passed by the £106,000 a year, but we must remember Commonwealth Parliament, and I should that the British politicians are becoming not hesitate to support a proposal for an most importunate in their requests foralarger amendment of the Constitution, even if the proportional contribution by the colonies change involved the location of the federal towards the expenditure upon the British capital in Sydney. that.

Therefore it would be unfair to I think that the whole matter was put in a nutshell by the Saturday Revietu of 19th whether it is likely to May, 1900. It was pointed out that we were merely following the wretched precedent of the United States and Canada, whose capitals, state and federal, had no claim to recognition either as centres of intellectual, social, or business life. They asked how much of the interest taken by the best class of minds in the country would evaporate if the political centre of Great Britain weie transferred from London to some provincial town, and concluded by remarkingIt may be hoped that common sense may in time cause Australian political activity to gravitate towards some acknowledged centre of national life. I think that puts the matter very fairly, and I hope that this question will receive, from a wider point.of view than a merely parochial one, further consideration at the hands of Parliament. I am Sorry that I have to differ from the leader of the Opposition upon the question of the naval vote.

236,Mr Glynn,"Yes, we are contributingthe question to the recent Conference of Premiers, saidThe colonies haveenjoyed greataclvantages from being part of a great empire, but the privileges which we enjoy involve corresponding obligations. The responsibilities must be reciprocal and be shared in common. Speaking later on, and being apparently affected by the inadequacy of the promise to contribute £200,000, Mr Chamberlain addressed the Cape Chamber of Commerce in these termsThe colonies must be prepared to abandon the idea of forming part of the Imperial confederation, or be prepared to take their full share of the responsibilities which world-wide dominion entailed. Be wished to impress upon them the necessity of realizing their position and obligation. That was after the promise of the £ 2 0,000 per annum as an initial step. We must remember that Great Britain can ma'ke out a very strong case for a large contribution. We saw it stated in the press recently that the total trade of the United Kingdom amounted to £934,000,000. That is a very large trade for any country to reach under a free-trade regime. trade. is much larger. British possessions outside the United Kingdom are directly interested in about one-eighth. We send about SO per cent, of our exports to England, and if there is any protection to be obtained from the navy, we are interested as exporters to that extent in the trade of England. to England include the goods sent by us to Germany and other continental countries. tent. That opens'up the whole question of the preferential duties, because the amount of wool that is sent direct to foreign ports is now much larger than before. A few years ago over 97 per cent, of our wool intended for foreign consumption was sent through London; but now only 72 per cent, is forwirded to the United Kingdom, because Antwerp is challenging the position of London as the port for the reception of wool intended for continental use. WhatI wish to point out, however, is that trade amounting to £254,000,000 is represented by commerce between British possessions and foreign countries, or between one British possession and another. This trade, which never touches ""the shores of the United Kingdom, receives the protection of the British Navy. able and learned member arrive at those figures 1 figures taken from the blue-books, but the cable which was sent from England recently corrected some of these, and it is, of course, upon the corrected figures that I have spoken. honourable and learned member last referred includes that of all British possessions. quoted represent the trade of the Empire in which England has no direct interest, because it never touches her shores. the Indian trade? we calculate the white population of the Empire at 56,000,000, and the naval expenditure at £32,000,000that being the amount appropriated for the year 1901-2the contribution would be l is . 5d. per head of the white population throughout the Empire. The actual contribution to the navy by the people of the United Kingdom Of the foreign trade, is 15s. 2d. per head, whilst the white inhabitants of the rest of the Empire contribute 4cl. per head, and Australia's share represents between 6d. and 7d. per head. I say, therefore, that a very strong case can be made out by the United Kingdom when the time arrives for discussing the proportionate contributions. By increasing our present contribution, we shall begin to recognise a principle which will be pushed to its logical conclusion. The suggestion of the British Government was that we should contribute not £200,000 but £387,000 per annum. Even writers like "" Calchas"" in the Fortnightly Revieio state that Canada should contribute £4,000,000 and Australia £3,000,000 towards the ex penditure upon the army and navy. We find even the Cobden Club-whos e authority I am sorry to have to look to in this matter -condemnin g the colonies for not making a larger contribution, and pointing out that our true proportional contribution, combined with that of Canada, should be £6,000,000.

I should like to point out that it is impossible to adopt any commercial union of that kind which is not open to the very strongest objection.

267,Sir Edmund Barton,"That shows I was the whole of the discussion ; but surely the Prime Minister will not say that I cannot form a reasonable opinion from the perusal of the official blue-book which is published? Surely the Prime Minister does not say that the Executive would deceive the Empire by publishing an unreliable bluebook ? All I say is that the honourable and learned member cannot say that he has read the debate at the conference unless he has got that which is not yet allowed to be published.

Chamberlain's reply to Sir Wilfred Laurier as to the failure of the Canadian Tariff. There is ample material on which to form an opinion, because the special report presented to the Imperial Conference on the Canadian Tariff and rebates is presented with the published blue book. that report I find that in 1886 and in 1888, 40 per cent, of the Canadian imports were from the United Kingdom, and that in 1S95-7, the proportion had sunk to 28 per cent. Then the Canadians, in order to check the decline of English imports, offered the rebate, which in 1900 reached 33£ per cent. What was the effect? In 1901 the proportion had sunk to 23£ per cent., so that the policy absolutely failed in regard to the proportion of imports. blown to the winds. I have stated. Sir shown by the Canadian Ministers.

There is a total increase in the total trade, from Great Britain shrank since 1S86-8 from 40 per cent, to 23 per cent. greater increase of foreign imports at the same time, an increase of £11,000,000 in foreign imports as against an increase of Prom £3,000,000 in British imports. believe that the conclusion drawn by statishall are probably correct, namely, that the adoption of this policy would eventually involve the disintegration of the Empire rather than preserve its integrity.

286,Mr Higgins,"I hope that we have the application of the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act to the six hatters who were refused permission to land in Sydney. I cannot help thinking that the indignation of tlie honourable member for Gippsland was directed not so much against the Government-^the Administration-as against the Act. I do not think that any one has asserted that the Government did more than administer the A ct as they found it, and if there is anything for which I should commend a responsible Ministry, it is for administering the law, so long as it is the law, whether they like it or not. If there is anything which has marked the course of British liberty, it .is the insistence 'of the people that governments shall administer the law as it stands. Briefly the facts ""were these :-There is in existence an A ct which says that no person who comes to Australia under contract to perform manual labour shall be allowed to enter unless he obtains an exemption from the Government because of the possession of special skill required here, and any one -so prohibited is liable, to imprisonment if he lands. The Government, when they found that the six hatters were coming to'Sydneyi n defiance of the law, saved the men from the ignominy of being locked up in gaol, and said to them, "" We will wait before taking action until you show that you are entitled to land."" The person who brought the men out had made no application for exemption, and until such an application was made, no exemption could be given. When the application was very tardily sent in, the Minister looked into the case, and found that the men should be allowed to land, and they landed accordingly. I adhere absolutely to the words which were quoted by the right honourable member for Tasmania this afternoon. In my opinion it is not the policy of any Australian to exclude from this countiy white men ""who'come here free to accept or refuse engagements. The Government carried out the law. As for the Act itself, until I see further reason to change my opinions, I shall continue to consider it a right one. I see nothing unreasonable in saying that we welcome to our shores honest white men, but only such as come here' free to accept Australian' conditions amd rates'of wages. A man cannot be said to come here free who comes with a chain round his leg. If there were no such law, and a strike or industrial difficulty occurred, and there were men in Italy obtaining -£1 a week for work for which £ 3 a week was being paid here, hundreds of them could be brought out under contract to do it for £ 1 10s. or-£2 a week. But such a contract would really be made under constraint, and the men entering into it would be accepting conditions and rates of wages ""which were not Australian. There is nothing unreasonable in saying to people that if they come here they must not come under contract for three, ten, twenty, or any period of years. I listened carefully to 'the dialectical duel between the right honourable gentlemen who lead the opposing parties in this Chamber, and I was rather disappointed with it . It was a brilliant pyrotechnical display, but it failed to give the steady illumination which the country is entitled to expect at this very critical stage of its history. I do not think'that the electors are much concerned in finding out the discrepancies between the Prime ""Minister's statement at Maitland and his subsequent actions, or between the speeches delivered by the leader of the'Opposition at 'Sydney and at Perth. I did not hear the speeches which that right honourable gentleman delivered in Sydney, but I heard some of those he made in Perth, and I could a tale unfold if I were to tell tales out of school, which I am not going to do. Tf there is one thing which all Australians are anxious about, it is that the Pederal Government shall not incur expenditure which is not absolutely necessary, and that there shall be no waste of industrial resources through strikes and lockouts, which have done so much damage to us in the past. I understand that Ministers wish to use the powers of ""the Constitution to introduce a measure 'providing for conciliation and arbitration, and I shall welcome ""the introduction of such a measure, as I think all other moderate men will. After grave reflection, liowever, I cannot agree to ""three of "" the proposals of the Government-^to ""those to create immediately the Inter-State Commission and the High Court, and 'to that to pay £200,000 under a naval agreement. I should like to say something in regard : to the expenditure upon'the federal capital, but I cannot feel myself wholly free to refuse to give effect to ' the provisionin the Constitution inrespect to that matter, as it is 'part of a special stipulation upon the faith of which New -South Wales entered the Union. I am, however, free from responsibility for that provision. I opposed the acceptance of the Bill, and I thought the provision an unwise one; but as a bargain has been made, and one of the States was induced to enter the Union very largely"" upon the promise that the federal capital should be situated within its boundaries, we are bound to carry it into effect. I hope, however, that we shall find -a wise means of borrowing the money without interest, under Canadian system as has been suggested. ""With regard to the Inter-State Commission, I shall not speak at any length, but I desire to point out that the only purpose for which the appointment of an Tnter-State Commission is essential is the abolition of preferenof dealing with preferential railway rates. tial rates on the railways, the power to deal with this subject being contained in section 102of the Constitution. fringement of the Constitution, or of the laws made under the Constitution, may be dealt with in the ordinary courts. Inter-State Commission cannot make laws ; it can only adjudicate and administer the constitutional provisions and the laws made under them. The commission will have no power to prohibit anything Constitution or our federal laws do not prohibit, and its powers are absolutely restricted. tion provides that as to railways we may prohibit any preference or discrimination that is undue, or unreasonable, or unjust to any State, and that such preference or discrimination is not to be regarded as undue, unreasonable, or unjust unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Commission. I frankly admit that that renders the Inter-State Commission necessary, if there are preferences shown in connection with the railway traffic. nature of the preferences now given, however, have not been disclosed to us. On three occasions last session I tried to obtain from the Minister for Home Affairs information as to the cases in which preferential rates were charged upon the railways. each occasion he promised to supply particulars, but failed to do so. I do not blame the Minister, but I think the result shows that he found very great difficulty in discovering preferential rates. The instance quoted by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs with regard to the ratescharged upon cargo carried inships from Sydney to North Queensland, asagainstships from Brisbane to North Queensland, is not one Mr Hit/gins. which comes within the scope of section 102, which refers only to preferential railway rates, and that is the only matter for which we really require the Inter-State Commission. I object, therefore, to an expensive commission,, with a large staff, being created, and fixed upon us for a period of at least seven years. We do not even know of the existence .of preferential rates such as would render it necessary to call the commission the into existence. duced proposed to do more than deal with railway rates. commission is essential only for the purpose I feel that there is no machinery so bad as that which is adopted before it is really clear Any other inwhat is required. preferential railway rates are in operation The in Western Australia in connection with the distinction made between imported coal and that produced at the Collie fields. The position there is veiy serious. of inquiring into the condition of affairs in Western Australia some time ago, and I Section 102 of the Constitufound that special reasons were advanced for the difference in those charges. It was stated that certain coal was more expensive to carry than otlier kinds. If there are preferential rates on the railways to any extent, the whole matter mightperhaps be settled by constituting the Railways Commissioners of the various States an Inter-State Commission for the purpose of adjusting matters.

305,Sir Edmund Barton,"Except subject toa promise is made subject to our ratification, it is very awkward for a supporter of the Government to refuse his vote under certain circumstances. I hope, however, this question will be treated as an open one, and that our allegiance will not be submitted to too great astrain. In a matter of national Australian policy such as this, the wishes of honourable members should have been ascertained to some extent before anything was done. NowI come to the matter of the High Court. I find, by referring to Mansard, that during the debate on the address in reply at the opening of last session, I expressed, in substance, the same opinions as those I now hold. I cannot help thinking that the Eederal High Court is, under all the circumstances, unnecessary, and that we can easily delay incurring the expense that would be involved untilsome more suitable time. I was sorry to hear the leader of the -Opposition to some extent supporting the Government in this matter. The right honourable gentleman was determined to find fault with tbe Government in some way, and so he complained of their having delayed the appointment of the court. So we have the curious spectacle of the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition strongly advocating the creation of the court without further delay. Honourable members may think that I ' -do not know much about the InterState Commission, or naval matters, but I -do know a little about the High Court, and I do say deliberately, and after thinking the whole matter over very carefully, that its creation at this juncture will involve the placing of an unnecessary burden upon the people of Australia. The leader -of the Opposition stated that the country was crying aloud for the creation of the court, but I fail to find any evidence in support of his statement. I urge' honourable members to ask themselves what the High Court can do that cannot be equally well done by the Supreme Courts of the States, with the Privy Council over them to give uniformity. Several grave questions which have arisen in regard to our Acts and the Constitution have been very ably dealt with by our Supreme Courts. I do not think that the A t torney-General has cause to object to the last decision of the Victorian Supreme Courti n connection with a case in which he was interested. It has been said that the I admit all t h a t ; but if Supreme Courts of the different States may differ. That is so ; but at the same time we have the Privy Council which can make decisions uniform, and to which the Supreme Courts will, and must bow. The Privy Council can deal with constitutional points sent to it by the Supreme Courts as freely as it can with ordinary appeals. There is a provision in the Constitution that the Privy Council is not to deal with appeals from the High Court upon constitutional points except in very special circumstances, but there is no prohibition-and we cannot make one-agains t the Privy Council dealing with appeals from the Supreme Courts upon constitutional points. Council proceeding be too long in the settlement of trading disputes ? there would be any difference between the time occupied by the procedure in the case of the Privy Council and that of the High Court. How could there be 1 to obtain a decision from the Privy Council than from our own court. be a difference between the time absorbed in going to London, which involves a journey of a month or more, and that occupied in travelling to some place in the heart of New South Wales. Of course the idea underlying the establishment of the High Court is that we should have a tribunal to deal with appeals in the federal capital. But the members of tliat tribunal-fiv e of them-wil l gooncircuit to the different State capitals. They will have to travel a good deal, and I think that there must necessarily be long delaysbefore, a man in Western Australia, for example, could have his case settled by the High Court Judges. It would be far better to allow him to appeal to the Judges of the Supreme Court of his own State. I have carefully re-read the speech 'delivered by the Attorney-General last session in submitting the Judiciary Bill to the notice of this House. I did so for the purpose of ascertaining whether I could not modify my views upon this matter. After recognising the gracef u l diction, the charm of manner, and kindliness of feeling exhibited throughout that speech, I cannot help saying that when its columns are boiled down, the residual product of ground why this court should be",49,Edmund Barton Th E Facts Were The Public Mind As To The Probable Out

310,Mr Higgins,"Of course there wouldcreated now is very small indeed. The Federal Constitution is merely a new law interposed between the Imperial law and Colonial law. The Judges of the courts simply have to endeavour to apply this Constitution in place of applying only the State Constitutions. Hitherto the Supreme Courts of the States have had to deal with Customs Acts. They will now have to deal with one Customs Act only. The same remark is applicable to the Defence, the Public Service, and the Post and Telegraph Acts. ' Of course the Privy Council is not an ideal court. It partakes more of the nature of a chamber or a board than of a court, but, at the same time, it contains some of the best jurists in the British Empire, and there is a good deal to be said in favour of the contention that British law ought always to keep a connection with the parent stock. There is no system of law so great as was the Roman law, for the Roman Empire, except perhaps the British law. To hope that the principles of British freedom, which are involved in British law, shall extend all' over the Empire is a great ideal to cherish. In Canada they did not create a High Courtt ill ten or twelve years after the establishment of the Federation. It is quite true that our Constitution says in effect that a High Court shall be established, whilst in the case of Canada the provision was permissive. A t the same time. I would point out that in. the Canadian Constitution the power was obviously one which ought to be exercised. I should like to see it exercised in Australia, but there is no obligation on our part to exercise it immediately, at a time of transition, and when the States Treasurers are straining to meet their liabilities. When we find the whole of the Tariff revenue of the Commonwealth practically appropriated for the purpose of paying interest upon .the debts, and when we know that there is no great degree of prosperity at present throughout Australia, it is only reasonable to urge the postponement of the creation of the High Court for a time. In the case of' the United States there were special reasons why that court should be established without delay. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has referred to some of these. The Federal High Court was created in America because the courts of the States could not be trusted. In support of that contention I would direct attention to the following L z passage from Elliott's Debates, volume 5, page 331 :Mr Randolph observed that the courts of the States cannot be trusted with the administration of the national laws. The objects of jurisdiction are such as will often place the general and local policy at variance. The fact is that the courts ef the States in America at that time were not comparable in power and independence with those of our States. An instance of this occurred about three years prior to the holding of the Federal Convention in America. The legislature of Rhode Island had passed a law making paper a legal tender, and imposing penalties upon people who refused to accept it as such. A butcher declined to accept it. and an informer laid an information against him. The matter was tried before the Rhode Island court, and all of the judges held that the law was unconstitutional and void, because under the Constitution they could make only enactments which were consistent with the laws of England, and it was inconsistent to pass a law which directed that penalties could be recovered before a magistrate only as distinct from a jury. What happened 1 The Judges, I repeat, held that this law was unconstitutional and void. As a result they were hauled before the Legislature, and asked how they dared to declare one of its laws void. They explained that they were compelled to take that course in accordance with their oaths of office. A motion was tabled for their dismissal, for it must be borne in mind that they had not a permanent tenure of office. They were not dismissed, however, for the reason that they had to be elected every year by the Legislature, and the Legislature took good care not to re-elect them next term. But the difference between that case-whic h was rankling in Mr Randolph's mind when he spoke-and that of. the judges of our SupremeCourts, is that the latter have a life tenure of office during good behaviour, and cannot be removed. Surelyi t is not fair to say that because a special court was necessary under such a loose system as prevailed in Americai n 1789, it is imperative that we should immediately establish a Federal High Court in Australia. There are two objects for which, the proposed"" tribunal is to be created. One of these is that it ' may deal with Federal matters. I altogether dispute that Judges -with sn permanent tenure, such as is enjoyed by the occupants of the benches of our Supreme Courts, have any more sympathy with their respective States than they have with Australia as a whole. Any one who knows them, must admit that they have no State allegiance as distinct from their allegiance to Australia. chief ground upon which it is urged that we ought to have ar special court to interpret our Constitution is that its members should be in sympathy with the spirit of that instrument of Government. Now, if there is one thing which a judge ought to do, it is to dispense justice without fear, favour, or affection. I do not think thafc sympathy is essentially a good quality to possess in dealing with matters of law. A t the same time, when our Supreme CourtJ udges come to interpret a law made under the Constitution, they will deal with it as they would with a problem in mathematics, without any. sympathy one way or the other, and with a determination to do what is right. In conclusion, I want to reconcile my attitude with the attitude I took in the Federal Convention, where I voted -for a strong High Court. Right through I gave my vobe in favour' of the strongest High Court bhab could be creabed; bub I vobed in favour of there being no optional appeal to the Privy Council. I found that at the final drafting of the Constitution there was a clause omitted which prevented appeals to the Privy Council. The attention of the Prime Minister was called to the matter at the time, and Sir Josiah Symon, as well as the Prime Minister, gave expressions of opinion. If the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, who spoke on the subject or any one else will take the trouble to look at the report of the Federal Convention in Melbourne, volume 2, page 2455, they will find that Sir Josiah Symon said distinctly that there was no optional appeal to the Privy Council. Sir Josiah Symon saidIt appears to me that the point to whioh the honourable Mr Glynn has directed attention will not, in practice, arise at all. The intention certainly was not to multiply appeals, or to give an alternativeoption to an appellant in a State court to appeal either direct to the Privy Council of time, when our finances are inabetterstate, or to the High Court. We have dealt simply with appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council. Under clause 73, a general jurisdiction in regard to appeals is given to the High Court. The natural anxiety of the honourable member is that there should be a power in the Parliament to put an end to appeals direct from the Supreme Court of a State to the Privy Council without Mr Eiggiiia. going of course, through the High Court. It appears to me that under clause 73 the appeal direct to the Privy Council is practically abolished. The in England. discussion in England was as to appeals from the High Court, and not as to appeals from the Supreme Courts of the Sbabes. As bhe law ab presenb sbands in the Constitution, a man who is beaten in the Supreme Court in Melbourne or Sydney can choose his appeal court. That is a most unwholesome thing, because neither court is bound by the other's decisions, and an appellant always chooses the court which is most likely to decide in his favour. The effect' of the omission in the Constitution will be that most appeals in ordinary cases will go straight from the Supreme Court to the Privy. Council. If I had to advise, as I have often had to do, a beaten litigant in a Supreme Court, I confess that, having regard to present conditions and to the prospects in Australia with our existing population, I should tell him to appeal to the Privy Council in preference to the High Court. I should give that advice because in the Privy Council, there is certainty of finality, which is a great point. People do not enjoy going from appeal court to appeal court; that is a burden they would rather not bear. What is wanted by a litigant is finality, and, of course, success. He does not care about paying money in order to support the Constibubion, or bo supporb a High Courb; his only desire is bo win and gain money or avoid paying money. In 99 cases oub of 100, I am sure bhab litigants will choose to appeal to the Privy Council. I say, without doubt, that under present conditions there wili not be obtained for the High Court stronger men or better lawyers than are now in the Supreme Courts of the States. If we had a prospect of getting men of better calibre on the whole for the High Court than we have in the Supreme Courts, there would be a great deal to be said for bheproposalof bhe Governmenb. Inbhecourse I have no doubt we shall be able to get as much competition and as many men to select from as there are in England. Owing to the strong tenure and the exalted position which the Supreme Court Judges occupy, there is no doubt that the position",50,Edmund Barton Th E Facts Were The Public Mind As To The Probable Out

We have therefore to ask ourselves what is there to be gained by creating now a High Court1 What is there that the High Court can do that the Supreme Courts, with the Privy Council overthem, cannotdo? I speak strongly because I know there has been a great deal of glamour and mystery about this matter. One would think that the Federal Constitution was something mystic, and not merely a means to an enda means to order and progress. We do not want Judges to expand the Constitution; we want them to interpret it . It is with the people and not with the Judges, who are responsible to no one, that the expansion of the Constitution must rest. One of the greatest dangers is to commit to any bench -the members of which have their own idiosyncracies, and have no direct responsibility to the people-the moulding and shaping of the Constitution. expand the law 1 law ; I should not say that they expand it . which English Judges have expanded the law pretty considerably.

I think, however, that the country is grateful to the Government for having administered up to the present the laws as they stand on the statute-book. very able speeches to which I have listened,' dealing retrospectively with the work of the Government, I shall not add anything to the debate in that respect. I propose to confine myself to the speech of His Excellency, and only in such a way as to deal with general principles, leaving matters of detail until the various Bills are before us. I am very glad to hear the expression of opinion which came from so able a lawyer as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne on the matter of the proposed High Court of Australia. I was further pleased to hear the able remarks which were made by the honourable member for Gippsland [27 MAT , 1903.] Addressi n Reply. 165 to-day on the same subject. I regard this question simply from the point of view of economy, though I should not continue to do so if I thought the creation of a High Court would lead to any greater efliciency in the administration of the law. I attach great weight to the arguments which have heen put forward in favour of the view that this court can be done without for a time ; and, in passing, I may say that I think the creation of an Inter-State Commission might also be postponed. There is one matter which has so far not yet been touched on, and with which I wish to deal in a broad way. I refer to the proposal to introduce a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. In this proposal, it seems to me, there is a very great principle at stake, and, so far as I know, there is no precedent for federal legislation of the kind. The laws of the United States are quoted very freely in this House, and naturally so, considering that we have practically adopted the Constitution of that country, and I think I think they unfold the we may fairly look to the experience of that country to guide us in this matter. I shall not I know, a few cases in say anything at present in regard to the merits of courts of conciliation and arbitration, but confine myself to the desirability of confining their creation to State legislation. I find on reference to the excellent work of Quick and Garran, that there was great diversity of opinion in the Federal Convention as to whether the creation of these courts should be one of the subjects to be dealt with by the Federal Parliament. Quoting from Quick and Garran's book, I find that the present leader of the Opposition said-He believed in the compulsory investigation of trades disputes by State authorities, but he was of opinion that the proposed subclause would tend to enlarge the area of trade disputes, for the reason that the employers or the men might be disposed to extend the area of a dispute, in order to get the advantage of having it settled by the Federal tribunal. The arguments presented in opposition to the proposal were-that to interfere with the State in the settlement of trade disputes would be an undue and unnecessary intrusion on the local industrial life of the State. Mr Wise, who is responsible for the passing of an Act of the kind in New South Wales, is reported as sayingHe did not think that it would be prudent to create a Federal court having authority to fix the rate of wages for the whole of Australia.

So far as the general question is concerned, I may say at once that I will support the agreement, but that I should be very sorry to see the boats that are here now done away with, unless they are to be replaced with others. The Prime Minister last night referred to the attitude taken by Canada. I agree with him that Canada, so far as outsiders can form an opinion, has not taken a very broad view of this question. I hope, however, that that country will yet see its way to accept the idea that the British navy should be used for the general protection of the Empire. The position of Canada has been very clearly dealt with by Captain Mahan, so that I cannot understand the view taken in that country. Writing at the time of the Behring Sea disputes, he saidIt is upon the Atlantic seaboard that Great would be likely to accept, or that we would Britain will defend Vancouver and the Canadian Pacific. In the present state of our seaboard accept. With regard to the six hatters' defences she can do so absolutely.

I understood that this was done by the Prime Minister. that Mr Anderson was not asked to do anything of the kind, but that he came forward and acted very properly.

It appears that there was no infringement of the trades union rules in their agreements, but I do not see why that should in any way influence the action of the Federal authorities. The States have different laws relating to labour questions, and we find that in Victoria the value of labour is fixed to some extent by the minimum wage provisions of. the Factories and Shops Act, but the Prime Minister should not be placed in the position of practically dictating the labour conditions under which men should be admitted into the Commonwealth. subject to any dictation on the part of the trade unions.

East Sydney has not said that. more drastic. the time that all honourable members who desire to do so have spoken for me I shall be charged with inconsistency. speech to which I wish to refer is the disorganization of the mail service during the recent strike in Victoria. It seems tome that if there is no power within the Constitution at present to enable the Government to step in and insure the carriage of the mails, some authority should be sought by the Federal Government. I find that in the United States there is no such thing as a stoppage of the mails. No matter what strikes may take place, theFederalauthorities there have the necessary power to secure the carrying out of all contracts connected with the postal service. If we do not at present possess power we should acquire authority in some way. Quick and Garran, in their Annotated Constitution of the Australia/a Commonwealth, referring to the position of the Federal Government of the United States in this connection on page 964, sayIf domestic violence within the State is of such a character as to interfere with the operations of the Federal Government, the Federal Government may, without a summons from the States, interfere to preserve order. Thus, if a riot in a State interfered with the carriage of the federal mails, &c., the Federal Government could use all the force at its disposal not to protect the State, but to protect itself. These principles were conclusively settled iu the United States in 1895. If during the recent strike in Victoria an application had been made to the State Government by the Federal Government, the rolling stock and other railway plant and material necessary for carrying the mails probably would have been supplied to them, and the postal service might have been continued without interruption. I quite approve of the attitude taken by the PrimeM inister in connection with the recent strike, because Still less should he be the policy of non-interference qn the part of the Federal Government left them free to act impartially in the event of any application being made to them for their assistance in an extremity. But the federal authorities occupy a very humiliating position when they are powerless to prevent the stoppage of mails through strikes or other labour disturbances. ' During the recent strike a train started from Adelaide on Friday night, and did not reach here until Tuesday morning. States Government ever exercised its power with regard to the conveyance of mails ? ever been found necessary to exercise it . There has never been a stoppage of the mails. been stopped many a time through strikes, and the power referred to by the honourable member has never been exercised by the federal authorities. Government may not have exercised its powers, but I think it is clue to us that some control similar to that which bhey can exercise if they choose should be vested in the Federal Government.

In any ease some means should he adopted for obviating a recurrence of difficulties such as those experienced in Victoria recently. I need not deal any further with this matter. indicates that a large number of measures are to be brought forward for our consideration. We are to be called upon to deal with a Bill providing for the incorporation of New Guinea as a territory of the Commonwealth. I have been altogether opposed to any such course, and if we could honorably do so, we should retrace any steps that may have been taken in that direction. I fear that if we take over New Guinea, we shall be brought face to face with a very serious race problem in the near future. There are 350,000 natives in New Guinea, and I am afraid that we shall experience difficulties similar to those which beset tlie Cape Government in connection with the control of Basutoland. That Government found it desirable, after having assumed control of that territory, to hand it back again to the Imperial Government, and I understand that tliey now contribute +'18,000 a year towards the expenses of governing it as a Crown colony. It will also be a serious matter for us to depart from the conditions under which we now find ourselves in regard to having a continuous sea-coast border line. If we incorporate New Guinea within the Commonwealth, we shall have 1,500 miles of boundarv line contiguous to nations which are On the whole hostile to us, and we can easily imagine the possibility of serious complications arising under such circumstances. However, I do not consider it necessary to deal with these matters at any greater length at present. I shall take the opportunity when they are submitted to us in detail to discuss them more exhaustively. know that we can quarrel with the quality of the work outlined in the Governor General's speech, but I think that we may very well ask for a reduction in quantity. During last session a great deal of discussion took place upon measures which were eventually abandoned, and the whole of the time devoted to them was virtually wasted. I Address in Reply. have no objection to devoting attention to measures which we have a reasonable prospect of passing, but it is requiring too much of honourable members to ask them to ' spend night after night discussing measures which in the end are set aside for lack of time. It would be wiser, under the circumstances, for the Government to reduce the work of the session to the smallest The Governor General's speech possible proportions, and to confine attention to Bills which it is absolutely necessary to pass before the expiration of the present Parliament. I propose to deal briefly with a few matters which in _ my judgment are worthy of special notice. The' administrative work of the Ministry has been the subject of several compliments, and I think that we should specially recognise the splendid services which the Attorney-General rendered by his advocacy before the Pull Court of Victoria of the interests of the Commonwealth in the Customs case which was recently decided. The very great importance of the services he then rendered, and of the decision which he was instrumental in obtaining can hardly be overestimated. I think it is due to him that we should mention the appreciation which we individually feel for the very fine work indeed which he did upon that occasion. I wish also to commend the Government for the stand they have taken witli respect to one or two matters relating to assurance, which were mentioned here during the course of last session-matter s in which I was particularly interested. It will be within the recollection of honourable members that I submitted several motions .in reference to them, and I am exceedingly glad tliat there will now be no necessity to deal any further with two of them at least. I asked that the Government should take in hand the work of guaranteeing its own officers. I urged that the Government itself ought t<5 create a fund into which guarantee premiums could be paid, and out of which any losses might be made good. This has now been done, and I think that the Ministry, are to be complimented upon the step which they have taken. It is one which will eventually be commended upon all hands, and one which must bring about very good results. I understand, too, from a letter which I have received from the Prime Minister's department, that it is proposed to institute a system of fire insurance in connection with the properties and plant . of the Commonwealth. These two systems",57,Edmund Barton Affidavi T Or Tarily Seek To Make Their Home Here For The Pur
349,Mr Hume Cook (Bourke),"I do not to which I have referred have already been practically adopted, perhaps there may be some hope for the proposal which I put forward last year in regard to the establishment of a Commonwealth Life Insurance Department. That of course is a very much larger order It is a subject upon which there may be very wide differences of opinion, but it is within the recollection of honourable members that last session the principle was defeated only by the narrow majority of one, and the probability is that if the issue were made a direct one, the proposal would be carried. Under these circumstances I trust that the Government will anticipate any motion upon the subject and declare in the readiest mannerpossiblewhattheirproposals are: Perhaps one of thc most important statements made during the debate was that of theleaderof the Opposition last night in regard to his policy concerning the Tariff. Honourable members upon the protectionist side of the Chamber had hoped that that matter had been definitely settled for-some time at least. Personally I do not think that it should be touched again during the whole of the book-keeping period. But, from the right honourable member's statement, it appears that some of the items of the Tariff are to be made the subject of contention at the next general election. timber. that if the Tariff be re-opened at all, every honourable member who is interested in any particular item will want the duty upon it reviewed, and there will be no means of preventing that from being done. Por example, I might desire to see an increased duty upon nails, just as the honourable member for Barrier might wish to have mining timber placed upon the free list. But, though I was very sorry to hear the declaration of the leader of the Opposition, I am hopeful that now we understand exastly what he proposes, the result may be placed beyond doubt. As far as I can understand the electors of Australia, free traders and protectionists alike, are heartily sick of the Tariff question for the present. Therefore I hope that the electors will see that that matter will be left severely alone for a certain period at any rate, so that that peace may be conferred upon the community which is necessary to commercial prosperity. In the Governor General's speech a passing reference is made to the recent great utterance of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. -No further reference could be made to it in that deliverance, especially as the Government do not propose to re-open the Tariff question. A t the same time it is encouraging to find a great statesman like Mr Chamberlain at last indicating that he will put forward some proposition in respect of the matter of preferential trade. I do not know that we can give a preference of 5 or 10 per cent, to all classes of British goods. I have carefully thought the matter over, and it appears to me that the only way in which it could be dealt with effectively, would be by scheduling three or four items of commerce which might be advantageously admitted to Australia, and a similar number of articles which might be thus admitted into Great Britain. Amongst our chief exports are such articles of commerce as meat, wine, hides, tallow, and possibly wheat. These might be scheduled, and admitted to Great Britain at a lower rate than -would be charged upon similar articles coming from the continent and elsewhere. On the other hand, there are items which would correspond to the export value of those I have mentioned, and which might be admitted into Australia. Of course it is a matter for mutual arrangement but in that way I think we might arrive at the efficacy and practicability of reciprocal trade. I do not think that we should give any general preference to British goods, because a difficulty will always arise as to their origin. We know perfectly well that quite a number of articles which are imported as British goods are not made in Britain at all. They are made in Germany and elsewhere, and simply pass through commercial houses in the United Kingdom. By a system such as I have suggested,"" we could admit articles which are known to have been manufactured in Great Britain as a quid pro quo for the admission of"" certain articles from Australia into Great Britain. If the latter country is prepared to give us a preference representing £500,000 or £600,000 worth of her trade, we should be prepared to reciprocate. It is merely a matter of adjustment between the two countries. The question oE the establishment of a High Court has been discussed at some length. As a layman I am not the best qualified to express an opinion on the",58,Edmund Barton Affidavi T Or Tarily Seek To Make Their Home Here For The Pur
350,Mr Thomas,We ought to have free,59,Edmund Barton Affidavi T Or Tarily Seek To Make Their Home Here For The Pur
351,Mr Hume Cook,"The trouble issubject, but I do feel that there is a necessity for the establishment of that tribunal. I am therefore inclined to follow the Government, notwithstanding what has been said by such able lawyers as the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. Next to the Judiciary Bill the most important measure referred to in the Governor General's speech is the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. For the most part I endorse all that has been' said in in reference to that measure, and I hope to witness its speedy passage into law. Legisation of the character promised is in the interests of commercial peace, and will make for prosperity, amongst all classes in Australia. What will prove the chief topic of discussion, and the principal cause of dissension during the present session is the naval subsidy. By listening to what the Prime Minister had to say to a Melbourne audience upon this subject, and by reading all that I possibly could in regard to it , I have endeavoured to arrive at its true bearings, but I am not yet convinced that the Government have adopted the right policy in this connection. I feel that at this stage we are about to establish a precedent which, if followed to its logical coning a genuine patriotic sentiment in our clusion, must lead to further contributions towards supporting the Imperial Government. To my mind there is another ideal at which we should aim-namely , the control and management of our own naval forces, seeing that we have to find the money for our own defence. ThoughI do not definitely commit myself to oppose the Government in this matter, I feel very grave doubts as to whether they are asking us to take the right course, a n d , I shall, therefore, reserve my decision until the Bill is actually before us. worthy of notice, however, that, though we are told by the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth has not been committed to anything until Parliament ratifies the agreement arrived at, the additional sum which Australia is asked for has been placed upon the British estimates. which this House is asked to vote. sum which we are asked to vote has been command of a battalion or brigade at the included in the Estimates submitted to the encampment, and being senior officers they House of Commons, with an explanatory were, as I read the regulations, entitled to note co the effect that this money is expected to be received in accordance with the promise of the Prime Minister. It is also worthy of remark that men like Sir Charles Dilke and others affirm that this additional sum of money is of no value whatever to the British people. I cannot quote the exact phraseology, but the effect was that the spontaneous offering of the Commonwealth, and of the various States in connection with the African war, were of value, while the sum of money now asked for was of no value. I am inclined to agree with that opinion, because it is not exact!)' a question of money, but a question of principle. My aim is that all expenditure of money on our own defences should be controlled by ourselves, and that the men to be paid with that money to manage our ships should be Australians. Whether we take these ships for our defence on lease, licence, or conditional purchase, they should be officered and manned by Australians receiving Australian money, and under the control of the Australian Parliament, rather than the control of some other body thousands of miles away. That is my present opinion, which I shall venture to voice and maintain until I hear good reason to the contrary. Such a policy would do much more towards fosternaval defence force, than could possibly be created amongst Britishers imported in ships which do not belong to us, and receiving our money. merely in order to carry out a contract. We desire to stimulate an Australian feeling and sentiment in respect to Australian affairs, and that sentiment cannot be purchased, but must be created by giving a live and genuine interest in our own concerns. There is another matter in connection with the defences on which I should like to say a word or two. I was It is not altogether pleased or satisfied with the action of the Ministry in an episode connected with the Easter encampment. It will be recollected that as a result of the orders of the general officer commanding, two of our most highly trained and respected volunteer officers have asked to be placed on the retired list. Both are citizen soldiers, one with eighteen with 24 years' experience. So far as I am",59,Edmund Barton Affidavi T Or Tarily Seek To Make Their Home Here For The Pur
352,Sir Edmund Barton,"Not the money years' experience, and the other, I believe,",60,Edmund Barton Affidavi T Or Tarily Seek To Make Their Home Here For The Pur
353,Mr Hume Cook,"The additional able to judge, both were quite fit to takeclo so. But owing to some idea which the general entertained as to their incompetency to give instructions in camp, they were passed over, and a junior officer appointed. The volunteer officers naturally enough felt aggrieved, and protested ; but the Ministry, unfortunately, felt obliged to support the general officer commanding. A most regrettable result is that the services of these two officers are lost to the Commonwealth. It is deplorable that after men have given years of volunteer service at a cost to themselves of not only labour and time, but also of a good deal of money, they should by reason of what they conceive to be an affront be compelled to retire. Had a strong stand been taken by the Ministry there might have been a different result. A t this stage I do not wish to say more, because the question will arise again in connection with defence matters, when the subject of a citizen soldiery is being discussed. I am not devoting any more than passing attention to the men concerned ; it is the principle underlying their we have not seen any great evidence retirement and the slight put on the citizen soldiery which affects me. In the first Governor General's speech we were promised that in the Defence Bill special care would be taken' by the Government to avail themselves of a citizen soldiery. Emphasis was laid on that in the speech, but the first Defence Bill did not disclose any great evidence of the fulfilment of the promise, and the episode to which I have referred tends to show that the Imperial idea and regular soldiers are to have the consideration of the Ministry rather than the Australian idea and citizen soldiers whose conduct has been so lauded. The last, but by far the most, important point in the Governor General's speech to which I wish to direct attention concerns the finances of Australia. The Federal Parliament has been charged outside with passing Acts which tend to increase the burden of debt borne by the people of Australia. Nc later than to-day it was pointed out in debate that the expenditure is increasing, and that some of the benefits which federation was to bring about are not yet in evidence. That is quite true. graph expresses the opinion to-day that at no point can the Commonwealth be charged with extravagance. ture and federal extravagance are two different things, and I think the Sydney Daily Telegraph is right when it says we cannot be charged with extravagance, though it may be successfully maintained that the expenditure is increasing. But there must necessarily be an increase of expenditure when new departments ancl officers are created and new work undertaken. The proposals for a High Court, a naval subsidy, an Inter-State Commission, ancl the appointment of a High Commissioner, all prove that there is very soon to be increased federal expenditure. As one who strongly advocated federation, I feel I am not keeping my contract with the people whom I asked to support the Bill. We are not making some of those savings which I believe can and ought to be made. When the Constitution Bill was before the people, it was freely stated by the advocates of federation that by its adoption large sums would be saved. I then believed that to be so, I believe it now, and I was honest in advocating the B ill ; but up to the present of those savings. The only direction in which any reduction has taken place is in the military estimates. than under the State Legislatures. memory, -I think that in' the pre-federation days the expenditure was about £860,000, and is now about £700,000, showing a saving of £160,000. But the whole of that saving will be more than eaten up if the proposals for a High Court, a naval subsidy, and other matters have to be provided for. In view of these facts, what are we to do to keep faith with the public as' to the savings to be made? My opinion is that the savings ought to be effected by consolidating the loans of the several States. Almost every speaker in the course of this debate has made reference to the matter, but only two ideas have been put forward, first that there should be consolidation, and next that there should be restriction on future borrowing by the States. No suggestion has been made, however, as to how the consolidation should take place or how the restriction should operate. With consolidation there should, in my opinion, be some restriction, but not the absolute restriction indicated by the honourable and learned member forNorthern Melbourne. It would be ridiculous to tie up the States and render it impossible for them to borrow, seeing that",60,Edmund Barton Affidavi T Or Tarily Seek To Make Their Home Here For The Pur

357,Mr Hume Cook,"Speaking fromthey have had left to them matters of internal development and of social and domestic legislation which must necessarily entail the raising of loans in the future. The States have work to do which, as I say, can only he done by further borrowing,' though, on the other hand, almost all the States have now borrowed up to what may be called the limit of their powers. Taking it for granted that the loans are to be consoliclated, the restriction should take the form Of limiting future borrowings on a population basis; that is, any future debts contracted by the States might be at the rate of so much per 100,000 If tliat were taken as the basis for Victoria, and the raising of £1,000,000 allowed, for each 100,000 people, the future borrowing power of the State would amount to another £10,000,000. Victoria should borrow that amount, or any amount, I merely use these figures for illustration. lation basis may not be wholly scientific, but at any rate it is sound and safe. Other elements must necessarily enter into consideration. velopment in some States which are not in evidence in other States; but in the last analysis we come to the conclusion that the individuals composing the State have to pay the interest. burden; and if the population increases the State debts may increase, but if the population does not increase there must be no further borrowing. All future State borrowing should, in my opinion, be done through the Commonwealth. monwealth is going to take any interest in the matter at all, it has a right to see that the conditions as to the restriction are enr forced, and there is the more special reason that if the loans are floated through the Commonwealth agency, we shall be able to avoid conflict between State and. State and between the States and in the money market. would all tend to the benefit of the States. ing the Premiers' conference as a guide, that the Premiers of. the States are anxious for the Commonwealth to take over the debts of the States,, and to have unrestricted borrowing powers. What then should be the position of the Commonwealth ? Under the Constitution,, the Pederal Parliament may act in this matter upon, its own discretion ; there is no obligation upon it to act. That Mr Hume Cook. being, thecase, this Parliament will probably not interfere until it is asked to do so by the Governments of the States concerned. When the States learn that by utilizing the credit of the Commonwealth they can obtain an advantage which their own credit will not give them, they will probably be prepared to submit to the conditions which we shall seek to impose upon them, and we shall be entitled to impose conditions and restrictions if we lend them our credit, because credit is capital, and will be proved to be so, when the consolidations and conversions of State loans inhabitants. take place. Let us therefore consider what are the advantages of consolidation and conversion, and how they may be brought about. The opinion is held by a large number of people that a conversion cannot be brought I do not think aboutuntilthe due dateof the loan concerned, or somewhere near that time. That is a fallacy. I think the Commonwealth could The idea of a popubegin the-conversion of the State debts at any time, and convert any amount of indebtedness it, in its discretion, chose to so convert. That being so, the-States could at There are possibilities of deany time obtain the advantage which the use of the credit of the Commonwealth would bring to them. I do not know that many people recognise how much profit there is to be obtained by the conversion of State loans. On the units depend the I holdI may be wrong-that the Commonwealth could immediately begin to convert £300,000,000 of State debts. In converting that amount of State indebtedness there would be a very substantial initial profit. The average interest paid on the States' If the Comr debts to-day will be found upon careful analysis to be something like 4 per cent. Now, if we take the Canadian figures as a basis, the Commonwealth Government could convert the States' debts upon anin.terest charge of 2^ per cent. To be on the safe side, however, I will put the interest charge at 3 per cent., and. the difference of 1 per cent, tile-Commonwealth would give a clear saving upon £100j000,000 Such regulations of £1,000,000 per annum. That saving could be very largely supplemented by the The position seems to be, takprofit to be made by the conversion. Erom an analysis of the Australian stocks upon the London market at the present time, it will be found that the averageruling price isabout £ 9 2 or £ 9 3 . That is fairly high as stocks go, but I make bold to say that Commonwealth stock would probably bring £ 9 7 or £ 9 8 , a difference of £ 3 or £ 4 upon every £100. That would give, in the conversion of £100,000,000 of stock, a clear profit less charges and expenses of some £3,000,000. that the States do not immediately ask the Commonwealth to lend them its credit, so that the advantages I have pointed out may be obtained. But though those advantages can be obtained haps the advantage would not be so great at the present time, but the gain upon so large an amount in any case would be veiy substantial. I think, however, that the £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 of profit should not be handed back to the States' Governments to spend as they like, but should go to the immediate redemption of the States' debts, the total amount of their indebtedness being reduced by the profit secured. That would be the first step. The next step would be the creation of a sinking fund, such as has been outlined by the Attorney-General in his reply to the Premier of Victoria. ways of creating a sinking fund, and some of them are open to objection. It is suggested that the States should be asked to pay so much per annum out of their revenue account towards a sinking, fund which would gradually reduce their indebtedness, but I think that if that were done it would probably be found in the working out of the scheme that the States would actually be paying more than they are now paying. My suggestion is that the difference between the rate of interest which the States are now paying, and the rate which will have to be paid for the Commonwealth loan should be devoted to the creation of a sinking fund. If the average rate of interest now paid is 4 per cent., and the average rate charged, on Commonwealth stock is 3 per cent., the States would contribute 1 per cent, towards the gradual, reduction of. their indebtedness, and yet they would not be paying any more money on the whole than tliey now pay. That contribution should be vested, in. a board of commissioners, who would net be subject to the control of either this. Parlia-ment or of any of the Parliaments of the States. They in their, discretion should, have the right to purchase States stock; or otherwise invest the moneyintrusted to them as they deemed most profitable and fitting. Thus two benefits would accrue to the States from the conversion of. their loans. They would benefit in the reduction of their indebtedness by the amount of the profit made by the conversion, and. they That being so, I marvel would gain in the gradual reduction of their indebtedness through, the medium of a. sinking fund created and used in the way I have indicated. I do not suppose that matters of this kind will be dealt with during the present session, but I feel that it is not exactly a waste of time, to discuss methods of conversion and the proper conditions and restrictions to be imposed upon the Statesi n connection with them, because public opinion must be educated on the subject, and we must have the support of the people outside before any economic proposals can be put forward. The Commonwealth is in the position of being able to render the States a great financial service, but in. doing so it is entitled to impose conditions and restrictions such as I have outlined. All these matters should be placed before the public, and therefore, although the subject has not been given great proThere are several minence in the Governor General's speech, I have ventured to put forward two or three suggestions in regard to it in the hope that they may form the basis of further consideration. Having said so much, T will conclude by repeating, that, until some of the great and substantial savings which were pror vised to the electors when they were asked to accept the Commonwealth Bill have been obtained, we shall not have kept faith with them. Until this be done, this Parliament will hardly have justified its existence, notwithstanding, the fact the federation is growing in favour with the public, and that there is an increasing disposition to clothe the federal authority with greater powers and privilege. As a. Legislature, the people are getting greater confidence in us, but our chief aim must be to secure those financial and. economic advantages foe which federation was primarlv adopted. Until we do that, we shall not have made the progress we hoped, for;, nor have kept our promises to the electors! Mr F. E.

359,Mr Hume Cook,"I think so. Perbetween the opposing doctrines of free-trade and protection. However much we may have hoped at one time to settle the fiscal question during the first Parliament, nohonorablemember who took part in the discussions of last session, can have any reasonable hope that the question has been finally settled. I do not wish at this stage to advance particular arguments in favour of the reopening of the matter, but it appears to me that the high feeling which prevailed during the discussion of the Tariff in this Chamber, and the evident dissatisfaction shown in the States at the result of our labours, make it abundantly clear that it must be reopened, and that a more satisfactory must be obtained before anything like fiscal peace can rule'throughout wealth. I hope, however, that when the question is again referred to the electors, and dealt with in Parliament, we shall, after reasonable deliberation and discussion, reach a settlement which will last for some years. The programme placed before us by the Governor General brings very forcibly to mind the fact that we are very far from having work of federation, and that a great deal remains to be done before the federal machinery can be said to be in complete working order. I listened with a very great deal of attention to the speeches of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. ments in favour of the House pausing before committing itself to the great expense involved in the creation of a High Court. I am not prepared to express off-hand a definite opinion upon the subject; but such a pretentious establishment proposed to create does not seem to be called for by the necessities of the situation, and in view of the very serious financial strain which the people of the Commonwealth have been labouring under during the past year or two, we should be very slow, to commit them to any huge expenditure which is not absolutely necessary. I think that Ministers are deserving of very great censure for having allowed _ the citizens of the Commonwealth to remain for so many months without any legal redress against the Federal Government. passage of an Act of Parliament at the close of last session conferring federal juris-, diction upon the States', courts seemed to Mr F. E. McLean. constitute a sort of death-bed repentance on the part of the Government for long neglect of what should have been one of its first duties. We are assured by the Government that an early opportunity will be offered' Parliament for considering the report of the commission appointed to inquire as to the sites most suitable for the federal capital. I cannot congratulate the Government upon the measures they have adopted to carry out the compact between the States regarding the federal capital. There was absolutely no reason why the commission, if necessary, should not have been appointed within six months of the assemsettlement bling of Parliament,. but fully eighteen months elapsed, and it was only at the the Commonexpiration of last session that a roaming commission was appointed to obtain evidence which was already in the possession of the State Government. The commission should have been appointed at least twelve months before, so that the results of its deliberations might have been placed before the Parliament within a reasonable period. It is to be hoped that the Government will accomplished the constructive be true to their promise, and push on the selection of the federal capital site as a matter of urgency. I find myself in agreement with the Government and with the leader of the Opposition in the matter of the proposed subsidy to the Imperial navy, and I altogether dissent from those who think that we should at this stage take upon ourselves the responsibility of forming an They advanced very strong arguAustralian navy, wit-h all its attendant huge expenditure. I believe that questions of de: fence must necessarily assume an Imperial aspect so long as we remain a part of the British Empire, and I am certain that it is the desire of this Parliament, and of the vast as it was majority of the people of the Commonwealth, to remain a part of the Empire. I am satisfied that our most efficient means of naval defence will be provided by an I m perial squadron stationed in these waters, and it is our duty to the Empire and to ourselves to contribute as liberally as circumstances will, permit. I know that Sir Charles Dilke, and others, have urged that a contribution of £200,000 would be a paltry one, and that it would not materially help the Imperial Government, but I believe' that in our present circumstances that amount The is quite as large as the people of Australia are able to afford. We cannot burden the Commonwealth in these early days of its career with any extravagant expenditure, but I think we are bound to respond to the demand made upon us by the Imperial somewhat more liberally than in the past towards the maintenance of an efficient squadron in Australian waters. been urged by some honourable members that we should endeavour to create the nucleus of an Australian navy, that we should have our own ships and our own sons manning them. It is held that, in this way, we sliould build up a patriotic sentiment. But I would ask honourable members what they understand by those words ? It seems to me that every loyal Australian is a loyal Briton, and if our sons show their loyalty by desiring to serve in the Imperial naval service, they will be manifesting just as high patriotism as if they entered an Australian naval service. In this matter we must stand or fall together, as part of a great Empire, and the true patriotism we ought to encourage in our sons is one that will not be bound by geographical limits, but will embrace the whole Empire of which we form a part. It has already been pointed out that to create even a small Australian navy, which would probably be inadequate to the service demanded of it , would require a large initial' outlay. I am not prepared to say how much, but, knowing what we do of the large expenditure involved in the construction of first class battle ships, we can realize that some millions would be required to provide vessels, and that we should then have to incur very heavy expense for maintenance. If we can enter into an arrangement with the Imperial Government to give us an efficient squadron, we shall make an excellent bargain, and secure for the smallest amount of money the best service we could have. I understand that an arrangement has been made by which Australian youths can derive the ful l benefit of training in the Imperial navy. Sir visions in the agreement by which the crew .of one of the second-class cruisers shall consist wholly of Australians and New Zealanders. There are also provisions that the minimum crews of three training ships shall be Australians and New Zealanders, and that their reserves shall be similarly constituted, so that with active sailors and reservists we shall have about 1,600 Australians and New Zealanders among the men required to fully man the squadron. M Mr F. E. McLEAN -The provisional arrangement, entered into subject to the Government to contribute approval of Parliament, must' commend itself to us on the ground of economy, and as one that is just and equitable. WeI t has are bound by every consideration of Imperial patriotism to contribute to the defence of the Empire. Eveni f it were possible for us to provide a fleet for our own defence, theobligation wouldstill rest upon us to contribute if we could towards the maintenance of the Imperial navy, and the defence of our great trade routes and interests in far distant waters. I believe that in a general way our highest-duty to the Empire is to be discharged by our looking after that portion of it which has been committed to our charge; but we are not departing from that principle when we contribute to the maintenance of the Imperial squadron in these waters. We could not expect to be able to give our own people a better training than they would receive in the Imperial squadron, even if we had vessels of our own, and I believe the arrangements made as time goes on will secure the highest advantages to those Australians who wish to enter the Imperial naval forces. The Governor General's speech foreshadowed one of the most important measures that can come before Parliament. I refer to the Patents Bill, which I understand is to be introduced into this House by the Minister of Trade and Customs. I would urge the Government to press on with that measure at the earliest possible moment. No advantage that we can derive from the Federation is likely to prove of greater service than the establishment of proper patent laws. Already a large number of small inventors, who are not able to incur the expense of registering their patents in the various States, are waiting for the passage of this legislation, which, I understand, will reduce the cost of protecting pabenbs bo a material extent. At any rate, we are sadly in want of some The honourable member for Bourke has referred to a question in which the Attorney General is taking a very great interestnamely, that of converting the State loans into Commonwealth stock, and has spoken generally of the effect of such a course upon the finances of the various States. I think it should be impressed upon all the State Parliaments, as I am sure it has been upon the minds of honourable members of bhis House, thafc Australian credit is affected by the conditions prevailing all over the States. It is necessary that we should preserve the solvency of the weakest State in the unionthat in some way or other we should come to its assistance-because Australia is bouud to suffer as the result of State misgovernment or extravagance, or of any repudiation of State loan obligations that might be brought about by unfortunate Therefore, by assisting in the conversion of the State loans, the Commonwealth Government are in a position to very materially enhance the credit of all the States. it is obvious that this work must be proceeded with very cautiously. no forcing of federal. offices upon the State Governments. the Commonwealth is willing to undertake on behalf of the States can be undertaken only at the request of the State Governments, and at the present time there appears to be a.reluctance on their part to give the assurances required before the Oommonwealth can assume any obligations in this respect. I hope that this Parliament will pursue a policy of rigid economy in the administration of public affairs. said by some newspapers that so far the Commonwealth Parliament cannot be accused of any very great extravagance in the management of its affairs. I hope that it will adopt a similar course in the future, that manifested, and that it will afford an object lesson to all the States in the union. should be careful not to commit ourselves to any obligations on behalf of the States unless satisfactory assurances are forthcoming that the latter will not be guilty of extravagant borrowing. monwealth is to assume any responsibility in regard to State loans, there must be a limit put upon State borrowing. prepared to follow in the footsteps of the honourable member for Bourke, by declaring that we could limit the borrowings of the States proportionately to their population. After all, these matters must be determined by the credit of the States themselves, by the nature of fche works which have been undertaken with loan moneys, and by the revenue derived from those works. must be painfully aware of the fact that throughout Australia a strong feeling has been manifested that has not come up to expectations. may be a natural result proceeding from Mr F. E. McLean. high expectations. Possibly the people of Australia expected that the very existence of a federal union would itself enhance thencredit, improve their trade, and bring about conditions altogether favourable to them. If so,, there is naturally a feeling of disappointment. A t the same time, I think that much disappointment has arisen from the fact that the Government themselves circumstances. have not been firm in their administration in some directions, whilst tliey have been veiy much too firm in others. I cannot allow the question of the exclusion of the But six hatters to pass without expressing my very strong opinion that the Government in There can be that case strained the law very considerably. I cannot help thinking that, at the outset, The friendly services which they might have allowed the exemption which was subsequently granted, instead of exposing this Parliament and themselves to a very great deal of ridicule. The honourable member for Bland, who was responsible for the amendment under which the hatters were for a time excluded, has expressed himself as being in thorough accord with the Prime Minister upon that matter, and the latter has urged It has been again and again that he merely carried out the law. I hold that there should have been no hesitation on the part of the Government in admitting these men at once. The proviso which was introduced by the Attorney-Generali n connection with no great extravagance will be the amendment of the honourable member for Bland was intended to be used by the We Government in such a case, and certainly not after the rigid inquiry which the Prime Minister deemed it his duty to undertake.

361,Sir Edmund Barton,"Would not thetrade and occupation which they were about to follow, and the nature of the agreements into which they had entered. But the agreements into which they had entered bore on their face suflicient evidence that that class of labour was required in the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister cannot constitute himself a competent court to inquire into the necessity for obtaintaining men in a particular trade at a particular time. The very fact that a large manufacturer had sent to the old couutry to bring men to Australia, and contracted to pay them the current rate of wages, is in itself evidence that that class of labour was required. It was not cases of that kind that the amendment of the honourable member for Bland was intended to meet. It was designed rather to prohibit the importation of large bodies of men who might be brought to Australia under contract for the purpose of depressing wages here, or of interfering in times of strikes with the arrangements between masters and men. In the light of what has happened, however, it will be absolutely necessary for the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with the question of immigration again, and to liberalize the law so that no white British subject coming to Australia to work at an honest trade shall be prohibited from landing. ascertained without some sort of preliminary inquiry ? Mr P. E. M c LEAN any elaborate inquiry would have to be made to discover that. A man's agreement in itself is evidence that he is coming here to accept bona, fide employment. The honourable member for Blamd knows perfectly well that no manufacturer would send to the other end of the world to secure workmen, and agree to pay them the wages current in Australia, unless he believed there was a necessity for so doing. Naturally, upon starting a new industry a manufacturer would desire to obtain the most highly-skilled labour procurable, and, consequently, he -would go to those centres where men had an opportunity of becoming thoroughly efficient in their trade. are under contract is sufficient evidence that they are exempted from being under contract? Mr P. E. McLEAN -The fact that they are under contract at the rate of wages. M 2 current in Australia is evidence that their services are required here. Undoubtedly those men should have been admitted without exposing the Commonwealth to the ridicule of the whole world. Now the impression prevails abroad that Australia does not extend a hearty welcome to British workmen. So far from encouraging their presence here, we discourage them by leading them to believe that they wiil be exposed'to a kind of Ministerial inquiry as to their fitness before they are allowed to land. I suppose we are all agreed that Australia requires a very much largerpopulation to develop her resources, and to place her in a foremost position amongst the nations of the world.. But the Government have broadcasted to the world a notification that Australia does not welcome British workmen-that Australia is in no need of population. It is practically a placard to the whole world that Australia wishes the work hereto be shared amongst the men who are here. Every other new country in the world is seeking to attract population by offeringinducements to able-bodied men to come and settle. Here, however, we are pursuing a policy of discouraging such men. I am thoroughly with the Government in their desire to restrict undesirable immigration and in trying to prevent an influx of coloured and inferior races, or the landing liere of men not capable of existing by their own labour. Thus far, the Government will I do not know that find members of the Opposition supporting their policy as vigorously as honourable members behind the Ministerial benches. But when it comes to refusing to admit our own flesh and blood men with no blemish in health or character, who have a trade at their fingers' ends, and are coming here under contract to pursue that trade-it is time to seriously consider whether we have not gone too far, and whether we should not at once liberalize this A ct in such a way as to admit any free white man-o r free Britisher, at any ratewho comes here to earn his livelihood. The Minister for Trade and Customs is not at present in the chamber; but a great deal has been said about his administration of that department I do not propese to go further than express a hope that, for the future, the Minister will recognise that all the mercantile community in the Gommonwealth are not dishonest men seeking to _ defraud the Customs, and that they",66,Edmund Barton Ther E Are Procomprehensive Law Relating To Patents

This, however, is the first opportunity honourable members have had of expressing their opinions since last session on what must be considered the unnecessarily severe administration of the Customs Act by the Minister. one moment attempt to defend a person who may try in any shape or form to defraud the Customs revenue. Much as we may deplore the existence of so high a Tariff as has been imposed, and much as we may regret the mistaken policy that has been accepted by a majority of' honourable members, we still recognise that it is the duty of the Government that the duties are paid according to law. But it is no part of the duty of the Government to persecute and harass traders, or to treat mere clerical mistakes, which may be made by even careful men in any office, as if they were crimes. I hope that the Minister, without relaxing the severiby of his treatment of those who seek to fraudulently -escape their obligations, will at least show some consideration for those who, as his own officers know, have only made mistakes. number of subjects are touched on in His Excellency's speech which, it is unnecessary to say, this Parliament will have no opportunity of dealing with in the present session. other measures, which are in course of preparation, or are already prepared, but which, it is feared, there will be no time to consider ; and I join with the honourable member for Bourke in expressing the hope that the Government will not try to do too much, but will content themselves with passing measures which are absolutely Tf it is proved to the satisfaction of the House that a High Court must be established before the federal machinery is in perfect working order, let' the Bill' be pressed forward, and a decision come to at the earliest possible moment. repeat that the business of the session should be confined to measures which are absolutely Mr F. necessary.
