I do not know whether there is any significance in the fact that the honourable member has chosen to ask his question today when the Deputy Prime Minister of Bulgaria is an honoured guest in our country. AllI can say is that when I was invited last year to visit BulgariaI was treated in that country with every possible courtesy by the Bulgarian Government and by all other people whom I encountered. Minister for the Army. It is generally recognised that on a date to be determined the 3rd Battalion will leave the major South Australian training camp at Woodside for Vietnam? Has the Minister any plans for the further utilisation of the Woodside training establishment? Does he anticipate that other troops will move into the area or does he plan to use the Woodside army camp for some other purpose? term, the Army would prefer to have battalions of the field forces being trained in of policy and the Government has made a areas further north where they can be located together at places like Holsworthy, Enoggera and Townsville, but as the honourable member will know, building of the major task force base at Townsville is not yet completed and it is still, therefore, necessary to use some of the older camps and establishments throughout Australia. I thought originally that the 9th Battalion would be raised at Puckapunyal but, on investigation, we found that the married quarters situation in the Adelaide area was far better than in Puckapunyal and Seymour, and the 9th Battalion will be raised at Woodside. It is proposed that a major South Australia. In addition, the School of Military Intelligence, presently located at Middle Head, is going to be placed at Woodside for some years as an interim move until it gets its own permanent home. This will relieve the congestion in the Middle Head area. The waterborne, transportation and terminal units, which are very much overcrowded in the Middle Head and Chowder Bay area, will moveinto the accommodation released by the School of Military Intelligence. So there will be two quite major units at Woodside, at least for some time in the immediate future-the School of Military Intelligence and the 9th Battalion shortly to be raised. Minister for the Navy. Will HMAS 'Sydney' transport the majority of the increase of 1,700 service personnel to Vietnam? Is the Minister aware that although members of the ship's company have made several trips to Vietnam they are not entitled to repatriation benefits and war service homes benefits?

Will the Minister give an undertaking to the House that this situation will be rectified? tions from time to time from the families of members of the crew of HMAS 'Sydney' for the granting of full war service benefits to the crew while the ship is transporting troops to and from Vietnam. As the honourable gentleman would know, this is a matter determination on it. The determination is that any member of the forces who is posted to a special area on what is known as 'special service'-whic h includes Vietnamis entitled to certain benefits, among which are exemptions from taxation, war service homes benefits, the returned from active service badge and full repatriation benefits.

I remind the House that members of the crew of HMAS 'Sydney' while travelling to and from Vietnam on such missions are automatically covered by repatriation benefits for any injuries sustained from enemy action during those voyages. WOOL the Minister foT Primary Industry. Considering the serious financial position that many wool growers now find themselves in following the downward trends in wool prices, can the Minister say when the Wool Marketing Committee, set up by the Australian Wool Board, will release its report and when the full text of that report will be available to all Australian wool growers? member stated, the Australian Wool Board is obliged, under the Wool Industry Act. to set up a Wool Marketing Committee to examine and report on any changes in or improvements to wool marketing in Australia. Since the defeat of the floor price plan in 1965 the Committee has continued its work. The Wool Board has set up two sub-committees, one to examine private selling and the other to examine single bale lots, clip preparation and bulk classing. The Marketing Committee has reported to the Board. The Board has the report and will present it to the Australian Wool Industry Conference for consideration on 31st October. At the same time as it is presented to the Conference, it will be made available to wool growers, to newspapers and to the public generally. Has the Government considered whether Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities should pay the new Victorian stamp duty on income. If so, what decision has been made? If not, when will a decision bc made? returned to Australia 1 received a draft Cabinet submission on the problems mentioned by the honourable gentleman. I have approved of the Cabinet submission and it will be listed for discussion, I imagine, either this week or early next week. Miss BROWNBILLI address a question to the Attorney-General. Is the honourable gentleman aware that hundreds of garments, notably women's jacket suits, are being sold under what amounts to false pretences in that they are being sold as washable when they are in fact anything but washable, even with extreme care by hand? Is the Attorney General aware that the garments to which I refer have an underskirt with a dye that runs even in cold water? So that honourable gentlemen may properly understand the seriousness of this problem, I beg your indulgence. Mr Speaker, to ask whether the Attorney-General knows the difference between a petticoat and an underskirt. Is he aware that a petticoat is a garment nn its own whereas an underskirt in this context is actually sewn into the skirt and made with it as a sort of lining? Thus, is he aware that the skirt cannot be washed without the underskirt? Will the Attorney-General see whether action can bc taken to protect the public from this serious and unfair merchandising practice? Mr Harold Holt-D o not mini-misc the problem. ledge of this problem and I am asked not to mini-mise il. However, as I have a wife and three daughters, T do draw a distinction in terms of cost between these different garments. I know them from that angle rather than from the angles that have been put by thc honourable member. At a recent meeting of Attorneys-General various proposals to amend the Sale of Goods Act were discussed. Suggestions were circulated to various bodies, including universities, which might be thought lo have some particular interest in the subject.

Quite recently the Premier of South Australia wrote to the Prime Minister asking that the planning of this work should proceed. The Prime Minister replied to him stating that this matter would be given consideration as soon as details of the existing work between Port Pirie and Broken Hill were finally settled between the Commonwealth and South Australia. There is no doubt that in due course this work will be undertaken but it will depend on quite a number of considerations, including the budgetary position of the Commonwealth at the time the work is planned.

30,Mr Fairbairn,"My Department proto the Minister for Shipping and Transport. I refer to the current survey of road needs in Australia by a committee known as the National. Association of Australian State Road Authorities, which is a body constituted of representatives of the States and a representative of the Commonwealth in respect of the Territories. I ask: ln view of the disparity between the criteria being applied, which place country roads in a relatively unimportant category, and the Government's present policy of making Commonwealth aid available on the basis of 40% for country roads other than main roads, trunk roads and highways, will the Minister clarify the Government's attitude to the current survey? Further, will he confirm the Government's current adherence to the present guaranteed 40% of funds for country roads, as provided in existing legislation? of Australian State Road Authorities has no official standing with the Commonwealth in relation to its advice about roads. This body, ment attributed to fhe former Leader of which consists by and large of State representatives, although the Commonwealth Department of Works is represented, makes its own assessment of Australian road requirements as it sees them. The honourable gentleman may remember that just before tbe last Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement was introduced the Association had made an assessment of Australian road needs covering the 10 year period ahead. While this work was valuable it was not accepted in entirety by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will rely primarily for advice on a survey of Australian road needs currently being undertaken by the Bureau of Roads. The Bureau will undoubtedly make considerable use of the information which it will obtain from ticular criteria to this information and will advise the Government in due course. The Government, I should imagine, cannot be regarded as being irrevocably committed to the division of Australian road funds which requires 40% to be spent on rural roads other than main roads. It has been the custom for a long time to have this division; but the reason behind the setting up of the Bureau of Roads was to have a new survey of the entire road needs of the Commonwealth. Therefore I cannot give the honourable gentleman any assurance that the present formula or any other formula will be the basis of any new Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement. whether his attention has been drawn to the statement made in London by the former Leader of the Opposition in the following terms: Vietnam overshadows every other issue and on this occasion it must be neither ignored nor sabotaged . . . I hope that when the Federal Executive of the Labor Party meets next week it will lay down a strong, hard line for the campaign and see that this time everybody sticks to it. Will the Prime Minister accept the challenge? Has the Prime Minister noticed any change in the Opposition's policy on foreign affairs or Vietnam? did see a report in the Press of the statethe Opposition, and this was, of course, consistent with views which he has publicly expressed many times in this country. I agree with him that one of the outstanding issues-by no means the only issue but certainly one of the outstanding issues-whic h have to be resolved when we come to the Senate election campaign is thc foreign policy to be pursued by the parties in this Parliament, particularly in relation to Vietnam. I myself have not discerned any difference between the basic policy of the Australian Labor Party at the last general election and that which emerged at the most recent meeting of the Federal Executive of the Party. As I have previously said in this place, Labor policy remains substantially as it was and our policy has been consistently clear. Therefore, there does exist between the two sides of politics in this House a great gulf which the public itself must be called upon to resolve. I , for my part, accept that challenge willingly and, indeed, gladly, because we have recognised always the supreme importance for Australia of resistance to aggression in Vietnam, security, and stable progress in a peaceful environment arising out of a successful conclusion to that conflict.",18,National Service Training

Does the Department of Civil Aviation now accept as adequate a smaller flow and lower pressure of water for fire fighting purposes than were accepted in 1965? If so, why has the requirement been reduced? If, on the other hand, the requirements of the Department have not altered, how does the Minister explain the reply he gave to me last week, having in mind that a reply I received from the Minister's predecessor in 1965 stated that the water flow and pressure at the Kalgoorlie aerodrome did not meet the normal requirements of the Department and that the Department had under review a project to improve the flow and pressure so that they would meet those requirements? week contained the latest information availWill the right honourable gentleman conable.

After the presentation of papers, which is about to follow, question time having expired, I shall ask for leave to make a statement about flights of VIP aircraft. It will be supplementary to the statement that I made on 4th October. It so happens that as part of the material prepared for the statement that I intend to make today I have a quite voluminous document headed 'List of Accepted VIP Tasks', which sets out the applicant for the use of an aircraft, the port of embarkation, ports of call, where the aircraft is stationed, the aircraft travel, the number of passengers and the number of crew. I believe that this, together with the other information that I shall give to the House, will substantially cover the point to which the honourable gentleman's question was directed.

Currently the flights Squadron Fairbairn and other RAAF made are mainly for the purpose of VIP formations. transport, for training, for air tests, for ferrying, and for squadron support. But in a time of emergency there would be both a national and a defence requirement for fast, secure and independent transport and communication, for example, for the carriage of Service chiefs, for other direct Service purposes and for the carriage of persons directly connected with the defence side of government. This, of course, carries with it the need for aircrew trained for these services. It has been regarded as the function of the Air Force to provide and conduct this Squadron. Its operations clearly would, in an emergency, be integrated with other RAAF transport arrangements. In other words, No. 34 Squadron has, prospectively, a full defence role, in direct terms and in other ways directly related to the national defence effort Having regard and certain other charges may be considered properly attributable to defence appropThe Treasury has agreed, with the would be incurred in any event-that is to",21,Kalgoorlie Aerodrome

53,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"Prime riations. This is not to deny that VIP transOn this basis, the Treasury has been able to indicate the cost of VIP flights for the year 1967-68-that is the current financial year. Its estimate is an amount of approximately $450,000. The actual amount could be somewhat higher this year and will certainly be higher next year when the more modern aircraft are fully in operation. On the other hand, there will be gains in efficiency and considerable saving of time in the air on many flights for Ministers, their staffs and other users as the more modern aircraft come fully into use. The 1967-68 estimate provides for travel by senior Service officers to be regarded as a proper charge to the defence appropriations and not to VIP flights. Travel by the Defence and Service Ministers, however, is in this calculation being attributed to VIP flights even though their travel is in part directly associated with defence and Service assignments. I now move to the question of charging out of costs. As a general rule, it is not the policy for one department to recover from another department costs of carrying out functions for which it is responsible, except in respect of services provided to or by business undertakings such as the Postmaster-General's Department. This rule has, I understand, the general support of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Treasury suggests that this policy should be adhered to except in special circumstances. It goes on to say, however, that if recovery is to be made, it would not think that the costs should be recovered from every Department involved but rather that they should be met from a separate appropriation item of the Prime Minister's Department. This strikes me as being both practical and sensible. My own Department is the most appropriate in view of certain of its central responsibilities, and also since it is responsible for costs relating to visits of Government guests from abroad and for the travel costs of the Governor General. The Government has decided to adopt this procedure. These costs, therefore, will be charged to the Prime Minister's Department. Payments from the Prime Minister's Department will thereafter be credited to the relevant appropriations of the Department of Air. This will have the effect of reducing defence expenditure by the amount of the payments by the Prime Minister's Department. It is proposed to institute this procedure in 1967-68 with funds initially provided to the Prime Minister's Department from the Treasurer's advance pending additional estimates. Except for Service purposes any use of VIP aircraft must be approved by the Governor General in respect of his own use of them and that of his staff and by myself or the Minister for Air, in respect of all other use. Similarly passengers must be approved within the same group, that is by the Governor General for those in aircraft occupied by him and by myself or the Minister for Air in relation to all other passengers. A number of questions which have been asked in the Senate are also being answered today. This information will be available to members of the House of Representatives in Hansard. Some of the detail sought was so extensive that it did not seem appropriate to handle it in that way. Consequently, the details will be tabled in the Senate, and I propose to table them here together with the questions and answers which relate to them. I have handed one of the documents to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), and members who choose to study it subsequently will see why it has been handled in this way rather than incorporating the material in Hansard where it would occupy a disproportionately large amount of space. The answers to the questions asked in the Senate could have provided a piecemeal picture. Indeed, several of them were of a loaded character and could quite easily give an entirely misleading impression. I felt that they should not be answered until the general statement which I made eariier and this supplementary statement were in possession of both Houses. Then the replies to the questions, which have been answered quite fully, could be seen in proper context. Parliament is entitled to facts, if they can be procured, which will enable members to form a judgment as to the purposes served by the flight and the manner in which it is being conducted. My concern all along has been not to deprive the Parliament of information but to ensure that the Parliament was not given a misleading picture because of the type and range of questions put to Ministers. This prompted me to make my first statement to the House which I have now supplemented. I wish to add some further comments. I have stressed more than once that by his Government.

I cannot understand why for internal routes, in view of the great amount of purchases that Britian makes from us, we did not buy more civilian aircraft from Britain. I cannot understand, for instance, why the Trident or the BACIII should not have been purchased instead of the Boeing 727 or the DC9. At all events, we have the worse of both worlds. This is a lesson to all honourable members on both sides of each House. We have to be much more diligent in scrutinising purchases of service or commercial aircraft.

But I should think that charter aircraft would do equally well. I have drawn up my itineraries on the basis of scheduled commercial flights. SinceI became Leader of the Opposition I have taken off and landed in commercial aircraft in this country 200 times or more. I have used the VIP aircraft in only two circumstances; firstly, in tours of inaccessible areas and, secondly, in case of supervening demands. In the latter case honourable members will seeI bring the instances right up to date-ther e have been no more than five cases. election? reverend gentleman interjects about the by-election.

I shall state the only instances tp because the information was no longer the House. Between 24th and 28th April, a week when the House was not sitting, I went in a HS748 to Thangool, Mount Isa, Normanton, Karumba and Weipa. Mr Harold Holt-Wind up the apologia. No one is questioning the honourable gentleman. honourable member makes an interjection I am prepared to answer it. It would have been impossible to get to those places in connection with the brigalow, the beef roads, bauxite and so on by commercial services. Again, the next week when the Parliament was not sitting between 28th May and 4th JuneI went to Alice Springs, Darwin, Katherine, Gove, Groote Eylandt, McArthur River, the Ord, Port Hedland, Mount Goldsworthy, Wittenoom Gorge, Mount Tom Price, North West Cape, Carnarvon and Geraldton. It would have been impossible for me to visit those places by ordinary commercial services. The only other time 1 have made such a tour was to the Murray-Darling area a fortnight ago when the Parliament was not sitting. I had planned to set out from Adelaide by commercial services and then by car but the visit of thc Japanese Prime Minister supervened. On this occasion, as with the visit of President Saragat, my presence was desirable and my absence would have been improper. Mr Harold Holt-We do not mind. honourable gentleman does not mind, but if honourable gentlemen here or in another place are disposed to query any of these uses 1 for one am prepared to justify them anywhere. I make my itineraries on the basis of commercial flights. I have not used the VIP aircraft except on tours of inaccessible areas. Honourable gentlemen will see, firstly, that it would have been impossible to visit these places in sequence or at all in the time available unless there were non-commercial services available. Secondly, I had certain unforeseen representational jobs to do. To return to the general situation, the whole position has arisen because the Government declined from March and April onwards to give information which was available to it. It had declined to give information in answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Grayndler available. On this occasion the information was available and a new excuse had to be. devised. The information is now available and a new procedure has been devised. This is a good instance of the way in which Parliament can achieve a change. We were entitled to the information. The change which has been made is a desirable one. Mr Speaker, in order to preserve the rights of the House to debate this matter further, I ask that I have leave to continue my remarks. Mr Harold Holt-No, you have finished. I want to speak to the motion. Minister. Minister) [3.52]Mr Speaker Cannot we all buy in? be plenty of opportunity. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) has chosen to speak on this occasion when he chose not to speak when my main statement on this matter was presented to the Parliament.

75,Mr Harold Holt,"Yes. There will the Opposition said that he did not have the facts before him then. Now he is very much better informed and therefore he is coming in on this occasion. Mr WhitlamI said that the interest of all of us has been aroused by the Auditor General's comments. gentleman clearly made it understood that the reason why he was silent then but vocal now was because of what the Auditor General had to say on this matter. What was his other reason, if that was not the reason? He cannot say it was because of the delay which has occurred. The same delay had occurred when I made my first statement on 4th October-onl y a few weeks ago. The Auditor-General's report was presented to the Parliament on 17th August. So whatever specious reasoning the Leader of the Opposition may try to put to the House on this aspect, it disappears when one examines the facts. What really has happened since is that the honourable gentleman who took the responsible line which his predecessor had taken when he was Leader of the Opposition and exhibited that line in the way in which he handled my previous statement, has now found it time to get on the bandwagon.. He sees a little political advantage to be gained. His colleagues in the Senate have stirred up a little mischief on this matter. The honourable senator to whom he referred happens to be an independent member of the Senate who is facing an election in the near future. The motives for his inquiry are not all that obscure. In fact, I happened to share a dormitory at school with the independent senator and I was at the university with him later on. I know him very well indeed. He is about as much concerned with VIP flights as the man in the moon. But he is very much concerned with being re-elected as a member of the Senate for Tasmania. He finds in a mainland newspaper which circulates freely around his State a willing accomplice in a matter which brings into some discredit members of this Parliament in the use of their parliamentary privileges and opportunities. This is an old story. I can remember the days when an election issue was made of the construction by Stanley Bruce of a dog kennel at the Lodge. On that occasion we had to go through all the Press criticisms. depression. remember the misuse that members of the Party to which the honourable member belongs tried to make of this particular matter. We have gone through this business with the provision of motor cars for members, trips abroad for members and telephone and stamp allowances for members. Years ago members of this Parliament voluntarily reduced their salaries by £225 of the £1,000 which they were receiving. The first re-instatement of £50 of the £225 which had been voluntarily reduced was greeted with the great banner headline: 'The Midnight Ox Unmuzzles Itself. This is a very popular bandwagon to get on at any time. I regret that the Leader of the Opposition in this House has seenfitto take cheap advantage of the opportunity presented to him here today. I have tried to set out in a reasonable fashion what the facts are. I have been willing to accept sensible debate about the use of the flight and its purpose. The Leader of the Opposition made the suggestion that we ought to charter these aircraft. Does anybody seriously imagine that we should go about chartering appropriate aircraft for the varied purposes of the VIP flight from the commercial lines currently operating in Australia on the day to day or week to week basis on which the VIP flight is used? I have given the House details showing that there have been 481 flights in the period from lst January to September of this year. Does anybody seriously imagine that we could just charter appropriate aircraft to pick up Ministers or Leaders of the Opposition and their staffs to take them to the places they want to go? Landing grounds at some airports are unsatisfactory for some types of aircraft. For instance, the Mystere aircraft cannot land at several of the landing grounds around Australia. Therefore lhe smaller aircraft to which the Leader of thc Opposition has referred and to which he takes no exception have to be used. His only criticism, as I understand it, is directed against the BACllls. After more",27,Royal Australian Air Force To This The Capital Costs Of The Squadron

78,Mr Peters,That was in the days of the,28,Royal Australian Air Force To This The Capital Costs Of The Squadron
79,Mr Harold Holt,"Yes, but Ithan a couple of years of study of this problem in November 1965 Cabinet came to a decision regarding the obsolescent fleet which included DC3s that were 20 years old, Convair aircraft which at that point of time were 9 years old and a couple of second hand Viscounts. Cabinet decided what it should procure for a VIPfleetthat would last 10, 15 or 20 years. We did not come to some snap decision ourselves. We look ihe best advice that our Service personnel could offer. They gave us that advice not only in the light of the requirements of VIP clients but also in the light of the needs of the Air Force itself. They recommended a small, fast aircraft which was not capable of carrying some 30-odd people, as I saw one newspaper editorial described it. In point of fact if there are six people and their luggage in the Mystere it appears to be almost uncomfortably crowded. It is a very speedy aircraft but it is not a particularly comfortable one. I assure the Leader of the Opposition, as he will discover when he makes more extensive use of it, that it is not an aircraft in which one can comfortably work with dictation, typing and the other work that goes on in an office operation. As a Minister, and certainly as Prime Minister, I have to conduct office operations as I am going about thc business of this country. I have been authorised by the former Leader of the Opposition to make known his general view on this matter which he member claim to have been misrepresented? conveyed to my predecessor. He had been offered the use of an aircraft in the course of a by-election campaign. He said: IfI should need to avail myself of your kind ber. The reason is that whereas on this offer to use an RAAF plane, I will certainly get in touch with you but, on present indications, I occasion he gave me the full text of his will not need to do so. However, I do appreciate speech before lunch, on the previous occayour offer and 1 will understand, as I said on other sion he spoke from notes alone and I had occasions, that if you should use RAAF aircraft no foreknowledge of his speech. at any time it will be because of your heavy commitments. You will never hear any criticism from me for [4.3]I have never in all my experience in any use you make of an RAAF plane. That is the responsible attitude of a man who knows the pressures and demands to which the Prime Minister, Ministers and the Leader of the Opposition are subjected in the service of this nation. I have one word on the BACIII. The BACIII was, I repeat, recommended to us as a replacement for the Viscount and Metropolitan Convair aircraft. Viscount aircraft are no longer in production and even if it were possible to procure a second hand Viscount the spares would not be available indefinitely. The same applies to the Metropolitan Convairs which have gone out of production. The nearest replacement was the BACIII. The honourable gentleman asked why we did not choose DC9s. The DC9 happened to be a rather more expensive aircraft and it was felt that the BAC111 would serve the same purpose. It is true that when President Saragat visited Australia, because of the size of his party, which consisted of forty members of his own entourage and forty accompanying pressmen, our own VIP fleet was too small. But for visits by most prime ministers-and we expect to have an increasing number-and other people of VIP status for whom the Mystere and the smaller aircraft will not be suitable, then the BACUl will serve its turn. In the event of an emergency, no transport aircraft in the whole fleet would be more valuable than the BACIII. I do not seek to avoid criticism or discussion on this matter. I merely come back to what I said at thc conclusion of the statement. I made: If we are to give attention to the matter, let us concentrate on the pertinent and avoid the pettifogging. make a personal explanation on one point. made the point that I did not speak after he made his earlier statement on 4th OctoParliament, which is nearly 20 years now, seen a Prime Minister so sensitive and so touchy about a matter as is the present Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) on this issue.

I am wondering whether it may be due to certain omissions from the document he has tabled or to the validity of the criticism levelled against him by members of his own Party in another place who have lent their support, votes and",28,Royal Australian Air Force To This The Capital Costs Of The Squadron

If this is to be the only document we arc to be given in response to the Senate's supply the information and then by giving demands for more information, it will surinadequate information. I think that the prise me greatly indeed if the Government document tabled by the Prime Minister supporters in another place see fit to accept should be examined very carefully before this as a satisfactory answer to their we accept it as satisfactory. demands.

Surely the Treasurer need not have then there was no justification for the use used the VIP aircraft four times in 3 days, of the VIP flight. Therefore, before we f do not believe this for a moment, unless really understand whether the use of VIP there is some very good reason, and I will aircraft is fully justified, we need to know take a lot of convincing. I do not want to the departure times of these aircraft so that mention any names, but there is an entry we can ascertain whether commercial airin pencil on page 2 of one portion of this craft were available at those times. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition July and 20th July a VIP aircraft was used ( Mr Whitlam) that we do not express any between Essendon and Canberra. It seems criticism at all of tbe use of VIP aircraft by that the aircraft was stationed at Canberra the Prime Minister. The Leader of the and it travelled from Canberra to Opposition has made it perfectly plain that Essendon.

Apparently some time between 17th several pages numbered '2'. It is on one of this statement.

84,Mr Swartz,What page is this?,30,Royal Australian Air Force To This The Capital Costs Of The Squadron
85,Mr Clyde Cameron,"There arefeelings on the matter. To recapitulate my point of view, I see nothing wrong with the Prime Minister's using VIP aircraft in the course of his duties. I certainly see nothing wrong with a very senior Minister using them in the event of his not being able to get a commercial aircraft. I see nothing wrong with the VIP aircraft being used in the course of transporting members of a select committee of the Parliament to carry out its duties. I see nothing wrong with thc Leader of the Opposition who, I believe, next to the Prime Minister, would be the busiest man in the Parliament using these aircraft. However, what an absurd situation it is for an enormous aircraft with a crew of five to transport from Canberra to Sydney a junior Minister who is travelling alone. In other cases the information available indicates that the aircraft transported as many as twenty-two passengers. However, the names of these people were not given. Were they members of the Federal Executive of the Liberal Party? They certainly were not members of the Federal Executive of the Labor Party. But who were they? Let us find out who these unnamed people were. I have no objection to the Prime Minister's wife, family or daughters-in-law travelling with him on these aircraft if they want to. I am not churlish about these things. Let us accept the fact that the Prime Minister is entitled to be surrounded by his family. But surely the inquisitive public who pay the cost of this service are entitled to have their curiosity satisfied. They should be told who occupy the aircraft. We on this side of the Parliament have nothing to hide. Our Leader has told the Parliament openly and clearly where, when and under what circumstances he uses the aircraft. I hope not one member of the Government will criticise the use to which the Leader of the Opposition has put the aircraft, any more than we on this side have so far criticised the use to which the Prime Minister personally puts the aircraft. But I want to know why it is that memreferred to the situation when he said that bers of the Governor General's household today a number ef answers to questions -the information suggests that the which had been on the notice paper in the Governor General did not accompany them Senate and also in the House of Repre-ar e able to take long excursions into the sentatives would be sent round through the north and north-west of the Commonwealth normal channels. Indeed, acting on behalf in these aircraft, presumably at Government of the Minister for Air, I sent answers to expense. No-one objects to the Governorthose questions to the Senate today and the General and whatever number of staff he Prime Minister did say that copies of these wishes to take with him making such trips. However, I do not know what special rights or privileges they have or why the public should be expected to provide his staff with jaunts to the north. These things are deserving of fuller consideration and more information than we have had so far. For that reason, I hope this is not the last that we will hear of this and that the Government will unbend to the point of giving the balance of this information. I cannot believe that the people responsible for the compilation of relevant documents do not know the time at which aircraft leave. I cannot believe that any Tom, Dick or Harry can get on one of these VIP nights without his name being taken. For that reason 1 hope we will hear more about this matter in the future. for Civil Aviation) {4.15]-The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) referred to a number of matters, some of which, I believe, want clarifying. He queried the authority of individuals and also certain personnel attached to the staffs of Ministers, and even of the Governor General's household staff, to travel on VIP aircraft. As has been stated by the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt), and repeated today, the authority for the use of these aircraft is vested, firstly, in the Governor General and the Prime Minister for their own use. They have the authority to decide this. Also, if anyone outside of these two persons wishes to use the aircraft, authority can be given only by the Minister for Air( Mr Howson), who does so mostly in consultation with the Prime Minister, or on the authority of the Prime Minister himself. So, the situation in every individual case has been examined before such authority has been given. Thc honourable member raised a point concerning a number of answers required to questions which had been asked in the Senate and also raised in the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister",30,Royal Australian Air Force To This The Capital Costs Of The Squadron

He implied of this type of aircraft available, we would that VJP aircraft had been used at times not be able to get a service when we wanted when commercial aircraft could have been it. used. I do not doubt that the information required is available on the flight made a number of minor inquiries. He schedules of these aircraft and that referred to the proportion of one passenger this information could have been obtained to five crew. I hope he is not suggesting had it been thought desirable. However, that if, say, the Leader of the Opposition tlie information obtained was put together were travelling alone on a Mystere we in this form to try to cover all the queries should cut down the number of crew memwhich had previously been raised. This is bers because only one passenger was being one point which had not been raised before. carried. Of course, this is obviously a type of red herring with which the honourable member is reasonably familiar. It is not reaUy talking about junior Ministers. designed to contribute towards the constructive analysis of the paper before the House. When authority is given for perhad the privilege of using one of these airsonnel to use the aircraft, as I have said craft and was travelling alone, naturally we before, each application is considered on could not cut down the number of crew its merits at the time. Of course, there will members, because safety of operations be occasions when commercial aircraft would not permit this. move into localities which are used by VIP aircraft. Also, situations can arise where commercial aircraft can cover part teU us about the passenger who flew withof a particular trip for which VIP aircraft out any crew? are used. But VIP aircraft are used to save time or for convenience to cover two or list on which that notation appears. I will three trips which would have to be made confirm this later, but it appears to me that by commercial aircraft. On the question of someone has merely put a tick on that list chartering commercial aircraft, I can speak to indicate that the crew was the same as with particular knowledge. It would be utterly impossible to cover the type of serthe crew for the previous flight, which was vice which the VIP flight provides outside made by the same aircraft. The fact is that of its service capacity by a normal charter a typographical error was made in leaving operation. In fact, the very point made out the figure '5' for the number of crew by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr members. I can see nothing sinister in that.

Ministerial Statement Territories)-by leave-Discussion s on the constitutional future of the island of Nauru have been proceeding between representatives of the Nauruan people and of the three Governments-of Britain, New Zealand and Australia-whic h are at present responsible, under United Nations trusteeship, for the administration of the island. My colleague, the Attorney-General( Mr independent requires consideration in the light of Bowen) and I have represented the Australian Government in these talks. The British and New Zealand Governments have been represented by their High Commissions. The Nauruan people have been represented by delegates of the Nauru Local Government Council headed by Head Chief Hammer DeRoburt, OBE. The conclusions reached in those discussions are recorded in a joint statement subscribed to by the representatives who took part in the talks. The text of the statement is: Discussions between representatives of the Nauruan people and representatives ot the governments of Australia, Britain and New Zealand on the constitutional future of Nauru were recently resumed. At the earlier discussions held in June this year ments will make every effort to adhere to the date proposals by the Nauruan delegation seeking the agreement of the partner governments to Nauru becoming an independent state on 31st January 1968 were considered. At that time the governments agreed that it was appropriate that basic changes should be made in the government of Nauru but they put forward for consideration alternative arrangements under which Australia would exercise responsibilities for external affairs and defence but which would otherwise give the Nauruans full autonomy. At the resumed talks the Nauruan delegation said that they remained grateful to the partner governments for the careful thought that had been given to the problems of the political future for Nauru but that the particular proposals suggested by the partner governments presented substantial difficulties from the Nauruan point of view. The Nauruan delegation envisaged that Nauru should in the future maintain close links with all three partner governments. They proposed that the relationship with Australia would remain a closer one than that with any other country. The Nauruans would wish to maintain a Nauruan office in Australia as a main channel of communication with the outside world and would be happy to see an Australian office established in Nauru if this were desired. They hoped that Australia would agree that the High Court of Ausby Mr Snedden) tralia should hear appeals from the Supreme Court of Nauru and that Nauruan students could continue to come to Australia. The position of the Nauruan delegation was however, that the nature of the future Jinks between Nauru and the three countries which were now the administering authority should be determined by agreement after independence had been attained. The primary objective of the Nauruan delegation was tbe attainment for Nauru of full and unfettered sovereignty. The partner governments responded that they would respect the views put forward by the Nauruan delegation. The partner governments were therefore agreeable to meet the request of the Nauruan delegation for full and unqualified independence. The date on which Nauru will become the steps that are necessary to enable the change to be made. The partner governments have agreed to take the necessary steps to seek from the present United Nations General Assembly a resolution for the termination of the trusteeship agreement upon independence being achieved. The Austrahan Government has agreed that the passage of legislation by the Parliament should be sought during the current parliamentary session so that Australian law will cease to apply in Nauru upon a date to be proclaimed, this being the date agreed upon for independence. The Nauruan delegation is now engaged in examining in detail with a working party of officials the arrangements required to enable a constitution to be drafted for discussion by the Nauruan people and the many other administrative sleps that need ta be taken to prepare the way for a smooth transition from trusteeship to independence. In the light of progress made a date for independence will be agreed upon. The Nauruan delegation and the partner governof 31st January 1968 if this is found to be practicable. At the same time both the Nauruan delegation and the partner governments place importance on proper consideration being given to the drawing up of the constitution as well as ensuring that the essential administrative requirements to enable the Nauruan people to take over their own government are met. The partner governments hare undertaken to co-operate with the Nauruan representatives to the fullest possible extent and to provide all possible assistance that may be needed and sought by the Nauruan representatives towards tlie achievement of their objectives.",32,Royal Australian Air Force To This The Capital Costs Of The Squadron
91,Mr Barnes (Mcpherson,"Minister forThe agreement that has been reached is an historic one and is of far-reaching importance to the Nauruan people. The choice of full independence is theirs. We wish them well. If after independence the Nauruan Government wishes to continue close links with Australia, as forecast by the Nauruan delegation at these talks, the Australian Government will be ready to respond and to consider sympathetically any requests that may be made for assistance. I expect to introduce in the House in the near future thc Bill referred to in the joint statement. Opposition)-by leave-It is appropriate that the Minister for Territories ( Mr Barnes) should have made this momentous statement on United Nations Day, since it is under the charter of the United Nations that Britain, New Zealand and Australia accepted obligations to lead Nauru to independence. This is tbe first of the Territories for which Australia became responsible to which Australia has helped to give independence. The association between Australia and Nauru has extended over half a century. The arrangements which the Minister has just announced are very satisfactory indeed. The negotiations have been long, but they have been friendly. Nauru and Australia will always be neighbours and there is every reason, to believe that they will always be friends. One can hope that in due course there will be a similarly satisfactory outcome for the New Hebrides, for which Britain and France are jointly responsible; for the Solomons and Fiji, for which Britain alone is responsible; for eastern Timor, for which Portugal is reponsible; and above all, for Papua and New Guinea, for which Australia is responsible. My Party joins with the Minister in wishing the people of Nauru well in their future, economically, politically and socially. Report of Public Works Committee Speaker, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1933J966, I present the report relating to the following proposed work: Stokes Hill Power Station, Darwin-Stag e 4 Extension. Ordered to be printed. leave-In view of the rapid increase in the population of Darwin, which is growing at the rate of 9.4% per annum, and the rapidly growing export trade through the port there, I am very pleased to hear that the Public Works Committee has recommended that work proceed with Stage4 of the Stokes Hill Power Station. I can only hope that the work will go ahead with expedition. Bill presented by Mr Anthony, and read afirsttime. Second Reading for Primary Industry) [4.34]I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The basic purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision, announced in this House on ISth March 1967, to extend the limits in which Australia has exclusive rights over fisheries from 3 to 12 miles. There is at present legislation, namely, the Fisheries Act 1952-1966, that controls fishing in proclaimed waters beyond the 3-mile territorial limit. However, the existing legislation does not apply to foreign nationals whose operations are based outside Australia and the external Territories. The Bill now before the House would exclude foreign vessels and foreign fishermen from operating within the new 12 miles exclusivefishingzone off Australia and the external Territories unless the vessels andfishermenwere licensed under the Act. Provision is made in the BiU for substantial penalties for illegal fishing in the exclusive fishing zone by foreign vessels. The inclusion of these new penalties has necessitated some technical amendments to the provisions of the Act relating to the jurisdiction of courts to try offences against the Act. Australia, in common with Britain, certain Western European States, Canada, New Zealand, the United States of America and other countries,has continued to adhere to the 3 miles limit as the breadth of the territorial sea and it is not intended to change this situation as far as Australia is concerned. However, many countries, including Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, have extended their",33,Nauru

95,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Ministe rfishing limits to 12 miles. The Attorney General( Mr Bowen) has advised the Government that this action and that now proposed in the Bill are in accordance with international law. In these circumstances I consider that Australia should secure for its fishing industry the advantages that international law permits. In practice the adoption of a 12-mile exclusive fishing zone will have the effect of further protecting our fisheries and encouraging development. The crayfisheries, which form the basis of a valuencourage settlement in. the north. The able export industry, will be given a very substantial measure of protection as will our developing prawnfisheries.In implementing these proposals the Government is of the opinion that, where it can be established that operations by foreign vessels have been carried on for a number of years in the zone that will be protected by the legislation, the practice of permitting a phasing out period adopted by overseas countries should be applied. There is no evidence of any substantial degree offishingby foreign based vessels having taken place within our 12-mile zone, but the Government considers that in any appropriate case a short phasing out period may be allowed. With the consent of the Nauruans, Nauru also is included in the scope of the legislation. Provision is made for the Minister for Territories or his delegate, who will, in practice, be the Administrator of the Territory, to issue licences with respect to persons thereof: 'this House is of opinion that the Suppleresident in, or boats operating from a base in, any of the external Territories. This will enhance the already flexible administration of the licensing provisions of the Fisheries Act 1952-1966. Provision is also made in the Bill for any licence fees collected in respect of persons or operations based on the Territories of Papua and New Guinea, Norfolk Island or Nauru to be paid to the appropriate Territory. A further amendment is proposed in the Bill to bring processing vessels-factor y ships-withi n the licensing provisions of the Fisheries Act. At present a vessel used solely for processing fish and not used for actualfishingoperations is not subject to licensing. Unless the Act is amended in this way foreign factory ships could operate in waters between 3 and 12 miles off shore provided they were not engaged in the catching of fish -Also it is proposed to extend the scope of the Act to include Australian factory ships. In view of the rapidly growing interest being shown in the development of our northern prawnfisheriesand the increasing use of processing vessels, it is essential to be able to control the activities of such processing vessels if the industry is to be developed along rational lines. Honourable members are no doubt aware of the developments taking place in the north and will recognise the need to encourage the development of land bases to provide permanent establishments, which in turn will uncontrolled activities of factory ships could have a serious effect on the development of a substantial permanent industry in the north. This Bill provides for further protection to our developing fishing industry and recognises specific needs of the external Territories. I commend it to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr Patterson) adjourned. Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 October (vide page 2129), on motion by Mr Adermann: Tbat tbe Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Dr Patterson had moved by way of amendment: That all words after That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place mental Sugar Agreement 1967 should be amended to provide that(a) in order to end the discrimination against consumers located fai Central and North Queensland because of the geographical location of Brisbane in the extreme South East corner of the State, the seaboard towns of Rockhampton and Townsville be included in the base price system applying to Australian capital cities as well as Launceston; (b) the costs of any additional freights associated with the inclusion of Rockhampton and TownsvUle in the base price system be borne by the Queensland Government from the substantial profits made annually by the State on the Central and North Queensland Railway Divisions, so that these costs are not in any way made a charge against the sugar industry which is already being charged excessive freight rates in Central and North Queensland; and (c) Clause 10 of the principal agreement be deleted as it is meaningless unless specifically defined, particularly' as substantial losses are being currently incurred by sections of the sugar industiy due to the low price on the world free market'. Australian sugar industry is facing a great crisis. The Commonwealth Government is giving unprecedented assistance m an effort to relieve the economic burden confronting all sections of the industry. The legislation before the Parliament is designed to amend the Sugar Agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland so that a rise in the price of sugar may be approved. The price rise in fact, came into operation on 19th June last following decisions reached by both Governments. The Government's request for approval by Parliament is a machinery matter in view of the concurrence to the proposal by the two Governments involved. Already the sugar industry is receiving valuable benefit from the price rise. Although any rise in prices of commodities that affect the cost of living is regrettable, there can be no denying that this is a justifiable, reasonable and timely decision. The plight of the sugar industry, brought about by the calamitous state of world markets, warrants all possible help from the Australian consumer. Safeguards in the price structure are necessary to ensure that no decline in consumption results from the rise in price. The position is one of simple arithmetic. The rise which we provide by virtue of the Agreement and the legislation approving it is He per lb. This increases the wholesale price by $26 a ton. This increase is of tremendous importance to the sugar producer. The Opposition has indicated that it supports the proposal. Leading for the Opposition, the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) said that the Australian Labor Party fully supported the principle underlying the domestic price arrangements for sugar, in fact, he said it time and again in his speech. Perhaps it is no exaggeration to say that he may have said it twenty-five times. But having said that I was surprised that he then proceeded to make strong claims that the rise should not have occurred until 31st August this year. He said: Why did the Government not wait until the Agreement terminated on 31st August 1967 and then increase the price of sugar if it wanted to, the indusiry, but does it do the industry any providing this was ratified by Parliament? He said that the rise which took place on J9th June was in fact illegal. He said that it was not competent for the Government lo amend the Sugar Agreement. He said that the Government had broken the Agreement and was asking the Parliament to condone its action. One can conclude only that the honourable member is opposed to the sugar growers receiving this increase. If he were not why would he make this charge? It is ludicrous to suggest that the Government's action is in any way illegal. The alteration of the Agreement has been the result of negotiations between the Commonwealth and Queensland, and both Governments have agreed to the alteration. This is a perfectly normal process and one that should be fully understood by any honourable member representing sugar interests in this Parliament. It is incredible that the honourable member for Dawson should make this charge and many others against the Government and at the same time deprecate the status of the sugar industry and those engaged in it. Let me turn, firstly, to the action taken by the Government. Clause 4(2.) of the Agreement provides that the increase in price shall operate from 19lh June 1967. In seeking the consent of Parliament it is well understood by the industry, as it is by the Government, that to seek Parliament's consent prior to the rise in price would cause sugar buyers to rush to buy before the price was increased. What a ridiculous situation would then arise. This would defeat the purpose of the increase, which is to improve returns to the depressed sugar industry. It would also disorganise refining and marketing arrangements. The honourable member for Dawson surely could not overlook these fundamentals when he asserts that the Government's action has been wrong, that it has been timed wrongly and that the process is incorrect. I hope that the sugar industry will not be misled by the references which the honourable member has made in this regard. How can any reliance be placed on his statements, here or outside the Parliament, when he makes many wild and unfounded claims. The sugar industry is in a serious position. Nobody associated with the industry is under any illusions concerning the plight of service to accuse industry leaders of lack of support within their industry and to say, as the honourable member said, that the Queensland section of producers had",34,Fisheries Bill 1967

Only 36%, claimed that he had told fairy tales. I think we in this Parliament should indicates a very great difficulty in the marrealise that we are dealing with the interests keting structure. Prices on the free market of a great primary industry, one which have been severely depressed since 1964. sustains about 30,000 worthy Australians. The average United Kingdom price over It is up to honourable members on both the 9 years to the end of 1964 was only sides of the House to try to understand the £slg38 4s 6d a ton.

These levels are well asked to approve this important developbelow production costs anywhere in the ment in the fight to save the industry at a world, particularly in Australia. time of real crisisa fight in which the Government has already committed $3Sm. Assistance of this kind means maintenance for the period since this calamitous fall in of a degree of stability for the industry the world price. Because we have a great when world sugar prices are at a disastrously dependence on tbe free market, the low low level. The Government's assistance is prices obtainable have produced a very low designed to help the industry while marketaverage earning within the mill peaks, the ing problems are being grappled with at the figure of $86.5 for the 1965 season being international level. Yet the Government's the lowest for some 10 years. In 1966 the action has been criticised by the honourable figure was down to $77.13 a ton, the lowest member for Dawson. The history of the sugar industry is one the 1967 average result might be even less of dynamic development. The industry began than thefiguresthat have been indicated. little more than 100 years ago. Production Because of the dependence of the industry since then has increased in thc train of on these forms of assistance-the price remarkable progress in the industry. The arrangement that has now been made and figures speak for themselves. In 1863 the the special $35m Commonwealth assistance first 20 acres of cane were grown at -the payment to the producer has been at Ormiston, near Brisbane. In 1864, 2 tons least $8.56 greater than it might otherwise of sugar were produced, followed by 3 have been. tons in 1865. But increase in production in following years was tremendous. By the 1900s we were producing 200,000 tons a lightly in this House. This assistance is unyear. By 1930 production had increased precedented in the history of the sugar to 800,000 tons a year and in 1962 producindustry, but the Opposition has claimed tion rocketed to 1,800,000 tons. In 1966 we that the agreement is not being presented produced 2,200,000 tons, making Australia to the Parliament in a form that is in the one of the leading sugar producing best interests of the industry. This, of deals with the home market price. In order or 613,000 tons, of our 1963 production was sold on the free market. This, of course, Depressed returns have beset the industry since 1951. If there had been no home price increase and no Commonwealth assistance This is not something that we can treat course, is sheer humbug. The proposition with wbich we are dealing is one which has the support of the official organisations of the cane industry-the two producer bodies and the millers. It is the result of very careful negotiations between all of the parties involved in the management of this great, efficient and important primary industry. In the face of the world wide problems that confront it what bas been done is without a doubt the most effective answer to the difficulties with which the indusiry is concerned. There have been suggestions that the Government is responsible for what has occurred. The honourable member for Dawson has frequently made this assertion, but there are other members from Queensland. The honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Fulton) and the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Hansen) speak in a much more practical way. They talk with some understanding of the industry and some realisation of the factors that are part and parcel of the operation of this great and important industry. I think this is well understood by the industry and by those who represent it at the official level. The criticisms are not soundly based when we hear persons like the honourable member for Dawson criticising the Government for the existence of the situation and then criticising the Government for what it has done to meet the situation. In 1964 the London price opened at £Stg88 a ton. There was every indication that this level would be maintained for the season. Shortly thereafter this indication was Singapore, of 273,000. All of these confirmed because the price rose to £Stg93 15s a ton. But then dramatically tbe price dropped to as low as £Stg24 15sa fall of over £Stg63 a ton on the opening price in 1964. No country could foresee that development. The world industry was not able to assess the position as likely to arise and accordingly there was no way in wbich the matter could be grappled with at the international level. Since then Australia has been in the foretion, I think as far back as 1915. Since front of the attempts to re-negotiate the world sugar agreement. Every effort has been made by this Government and, in particular, by the Minister for Trade and 'effort to try to encourage the re-arrangement of a world sugar agreement. The sugar industry in Australia is highly developed and efficient. It is backed by leadership, management and great skill. If it were not for this, the position today would be far more disastrous than it is. However, it is a pity to find criticism in a situation like this. On the other hand, I trust that thinking people will encourage the industry to meet its problems with the very practical and sound kind of approach expressed in this legislation which provides for the pricing of sugar sold to the Australian consumer at a level that will surely mean that there will be no fall in the Australian consumption. The industry bas pitted itself against the gigantic problem that is confronting it. Thanks to Australian leadership it does appear that we will be in a sound position to meet the problem and to be able to participate in negotiations which are being put in hand for the sugar agreement. Of course, statistics are not an issue in this debate. Suffice it to say that of our production of 2,300,000 tons of sugar we sell in Australia about 650,000 tons, lt is in respect of this proportion of the production that the price rise provided in this legislation will apply. We sell to the United Kingdom about 500,000 tons, of which 335,000 tons is sold at a preferred price under the Commonwealth sugar agreement. We sell to North America about 323,000 tons. There is a special preferment in respect of 182,000 tons to the United States of America. Japan, under its agreement with us, takes 597,000 tons, leaving a balance sold to other nations, including New Zealand, Malaysia and arrangements are the result of almost a lifetime of work on the part of the industry itself and its leaders and of encouragement by governments of all political coloursgovernments which have been in office in the Commonwealth and in Queensland. What we are doing in this legislation is to amend the Sugar Agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of Queensland. The first agreement came into operathen a great deal of care has been taken to ensure that the best possible arrangements have been made in the interests of the sugar industry. In fact, no other industry enjoys a provision similar to that which applies to the sugar industry. This is a situation in which the Commonwealth and the States",36,Sugar Agreement Bill 1967
97,Industry ( Mr Mcewen) Who Has Spared No,"concerned-in this instance Queensland and portion of New South Wales-provid e within the Constitution a framework for sugar pricing which is adhered to by the Australian nation. They provide a basis for a sensible arrangement, a negotiated arrangement and an arrangement that cannot be broken. But of course we find the honourable member for Dawson moving an amendment to this important legislation. It is an amendment that proposes nothing of substance and offers nothing to the sugar industry. I deal only briefly with it because the proposition is one that scarcely deserves very much attention. In the first instance he speaks of the discrimination in the price of sugar against certain sections of the Queensland community and he asserts that the metropolitan area of Brisbane gains an advantage. I say to the honourable member that this is a disservice to the sugar industry. As happens with so many other primary industries, the price near the point of production is very often a little higher than the price on a metropolitan market. This can apply to bananas and to a variety of commodities. There is a good reason for it. It is not one that all of us relish or like to see, but we must be conscious of the fact that the bulk of the consumers are in the metropolitan areas. In Queensland the bulk of the consumers of sugar are in the city of Brisbane and it is important to ensure that this consumption is maintained and that the price attained is the highest possible figure. I ask throughout every other State and in every for leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Mr Snedden1 apologise to the House contained in the amendment.

Speaker, naturally I regret the reason for the interruption of this debate earlier today. I will proceed now to conclude my remarks on this measure. The amendment to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time was moved by the honourable meinber for Dawson (Dr Patterson) and, as I indicated earlier, proposes an alteration in the basis of the costing of sugar prices in the State of Queensland. I believe that this is a very wrong approach to a vital matter concerning this industry. I suggested earlier that everyone would like to see a price that was equalised throughout Queensland, town, village and country centre. But I put forward the view that there is good reason for the present situation. This is, after all, the fact that the metropolitan areas are the bases of the major consumption of comI fail to see how the Commonwealth Queensland.

The measure before the The net price as a result of the increase ing worse, .the Government can adopt even more sympathetic measures, then the Personally, as one who represents a sugar for us to approach the problems confronting the industry in the future. As1 have said, I support the measure. I oppose the Speaker, the Australian Labor Party would be breaking away from a long standing tradition if it did anything other than support this measure. On behalf of the Opposition, the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) has proposed an amendment to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time but it in no way affects the actual increase in the price of sugar or the general purposes of the agreement, which is a renewal of the agreement accepted by this House in 1962. To some extent I can understand the opposition of the honourable member for Cowper( Mr where necessary. Robinson) to the honourable member for Dawson although the by-election for Dawson was held almost two years ago. That by-election resulted in a Country Party seat becoming a Labour seat. But I cannot understand why the honourable member for Cowper has attempted to misrepresent the honourable member for Dawson by saying that tbe honourable member for Dawson made a disparaging statement about the Chairman of the Queensland Cane Growers Council, Mr Frank McAvoy. In speaking on this measure last Thursday the honourable member for Dawson quoted a headline 'Northerner*. The honourable member has shown me the newspaper and I have seen the headline. He then quoted the newspaper report of a statement by one of the largest cane producers in the Mourilyan district that the chairman of the Queensland Cane accused of telling fairy tales at a meeting of farmers in the Mourilyan mill area a few weeks earlier. It was suggested that even children would laugh at what the producers were being told. This suggestion was made by Dr Dom Rigano. It was he who made the statement to which I have just refened; it was not made by the honourable member for Dawson. The honourable member for Dawson was quoting from this newspaper report when answering a query by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Lee) who had asked: Ts the position so bad? Why is it so gloomy? Is tbe industry in such a precarious state?' The honourable member for Cowper has acknowledged that the industry is in a precarious situation and that there has been a movement throughout the industry, particularly among cane growers, because of something should be done to remedy the situation. The unrest which is evident in the Mourilyan area is becoming apparent also in southern districts. An article in the 'Isis Recorder' stated: A meeting of growers from six of the mill areas was held to discuss the present position of the canegrowing industry and the imperative necessity of improving theirfinancialposition. They stated that it is not purely a matter of bettering their position. It has become a matter of sheer and utter survival. The group intends to make every endeavour to help sugar organisations where possible and urge The article goes on to say that the group is not intended to become a breakaway group. It continues: It is desired to join farmers in a combined effort to bring the canegrowing industry back to sound business footing. Loans as added debts are not the answer. Constructive moves are being made towards overcoming the growers' present position. An advertisement inserted in the same edition of the newspaper by the Secretary of the Inter Area Canegrowers Action Group states that the group was formed to press for immediate positive action by existing organisations, and a request for nnancial which appeared in the assistance was made. I believe that the sugar industry is an example to all primary industries in Australia. The original legislation dealing with the industry was brought down in 1915. If should be realised that people who now support legislation for the sugar industry might not have done so at that time. The reports show that when the legislation was introduced in 1915 by the then Attorney General, Mr Joe Cook said: 'Come on boys; let's all get on the Socialist bandwaggon'. It is true, and has never been denied, that the sugar industry is an example of socialised industry. There is control of the amount of production in various areas and there is a guaranteed price. The measure which we are now debating guarantees that the grower shall receive not less than a certain minimum price for his product. It is able to achieve this by guaranteeing the domestic price of 620,000 tons of sugar which is consumed on the Australian home market. The measure also guarantees payments to the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee by guaranteeing the payment of rebates to processors of fruit products which are manufactured in Australia for consumption here or for export,",39,Sugar Agreement Bill 1967
102,Mr Hansen (Wide Bay) [8.8],Mr its plight. People in the industry feel that,41,Sugar Agreement Bill 1967
103,"Growers Council, Mr Mcavoy, Had Been","provided that the manufacturers of these products pay for their fresh fruit no less than the price fixed by the Committee. The sugar industry, through its centralised control, has been able to ensure that fruit growers who are producing fruit for canneries in southern States, particularly Victoria and Tasmania, will receive a certain price for their fruit. This has very much to recommend it. The fruit growers would not receive a guaranteed price if the sugar industry were not controlled. It should be borne in mind that control of the industry has been agreed to by all people associated with it. In 1962, when a measure relating to the sugar agreement was last before the House, honourable members also had before them a report from a committee of three which was headed by Sir Mortimer McCarthy. This committee of inquiry into the sugar industry investigated the industry in 1960 and at that time suggested a reduction in mill peaks and a reduction in the domestic price of sugar. Although some time had elapsed between the report being presented to Parliament and the Bill coming before the House, if the Parliament at that time had implemented the report's recommendations the Australian sugar industry would not have expanded as it did; the industry would have contracted at a time when the sugar industry in all other sugar producing countries was expanding. Honourable members will recall that at about that time there was some trouble in Cuba, where the sugar crop had been lost because of cyclones and economic disturbances. As a result of this situation there was a shortage of sugar on the world market and the Australian sugar industry was able to take advantage of the high price obtaining at that time. The position has now reverted to one in 1966. Again, whereas in the 5 years between which we are now selling more than half 1948 and 1952 field productivity was 3.24 our production of sugar at world prices. tons of sugar per acre it had increased to Although only a small proportion of it is an average of 4.05 tons in the 4-year period sold on the world market, the price we from 1963 to 1966. Honourable members receive in other markets is governed by the will appreciate from thosefiguresthat the prevailing world market price. Because of industry has done much to help itself by the expansion in the AustraUan sugar the introduction of improved varieties of industryI do not suggest that the people cane, better methods of farming and imwho are responsible for the expansion did proved milling techniques. not act in what they thought to be the best interests of the industry and the country at that time-man y towns and cities along the pool sugar which is the sugar required for Queensland coast and in northern New domestic consumption. It makes provisioa South Wales depend very much on the for a guaranteed price for sugar sold in tha economy of the industry. At the time that this expansion occurred some felt that the industry should have expanded a little more slowly and perhaps over a greater period. Others felt that there was no time to lose, because other sugar producing countries were developing their industry at a fast rate. But because of the sugar industry's greater dependence on the Australian market and because of the depressed price for sugar on the world market, not only the canegrowers and others in the industry are dependent upon the economy of the industry but also the towns and cities to which I have referred are largely dependent upon it. In my own area of Wide Bay there are two large foundries which manufacture most of the sugar milling machinery used throughout Australia, and they manufacture also for export. In addition, in Bundaberg we have what could be termed the headquarters of the machine harvester industry. Machine harvesters manufactured in that area are marketed not only in Australia but also in other countries. The people who are employed by these manufacturers and in the foundries are also dependent on the economy of the sugar industry. Unless there is a sharp rise in the world price for sugar they face a very serious problem. I would point out that over tbe years the sugar industry has endeavoured to adopt the latest techniques. It has improved milling methods in order to increase the quantity of sugar extracted from each ton of cane and it bas adopted improved farming methods to increase the production of cane per acre. The thirty-one Queensland mills have undertaken considerable capital expenditure since 1961 to improve their crushing rate from 118.25 tons of cane an hour in 1961 to 184.95 tons a The Bill before us relates only to No. 1 capital cities of Australia and the city of Launceston and here I wish to deal with the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Dawson.

The Labor Party is not alone in its thinksoever on the agreement other than to place ing on this matter. The Queensland Chamsome responsibility on the Queensland ber of Manufactures supports our point of view. In fact, it goes even further than does the honourable member for Dawson who suggests that Rockhampton should be the port for central and central western Queensland and that Townsville should be the port for north and north western Queensland. I pointed out a while ago that something in the base price system. Clause 10 of the proposed agreement As I. said before, we support the measure suggested and which have no effect what-",41,Sugar Agreement Bill 1967
104,Mr Hansen,"It is a long story and a The Queensland Chamber of ManufacturesGovernment. Speaking of responsibility, 1 should like to emphasise that if a wheat grower, a dairy fanner or a cattle raiser cares to work a given acreage, that is his own responsibility. If he increases his proearners who would be prepared to accept duction, he does so voluntarily and takes the risk that prices may be low when he markets his products. If the market is high, he wins the gamble; if it is down, he loses. The sugar industry is in a different position increase of $8.56 per ton for No. 1 pool in that both the cane growers and the millers sugar, and the loan of $ 10m that is being are under an obligation to produce a certain quantity of sugar. When expansion was suggested some growers were reluctant to participate in expanded production because they remembered what happened in 1960 when the bottom fell out of the market and they were left with half their crop standing in the field. Growers who had this fact in mind did not want to go in for expansion. This applied particularly to growers used. They have endeavoured to keep down in the Maryborough mill area, where there were no new assignments whatever. Some growers in that area did not want to participate in the expansion. Other growers agreed to accept increased assignments. The point is that a certain tonnage of sugar had to be produced, and if these growers had said that they did not want to participate in this expansion other growers would have accepted increased assignments. In other words, if growers in one mill area had not accepted increased assignments growers in another mill area would have done so. These growers had an obligation to produce sugar. It was a matter of their participating in the expansion and accepting responsibility to the industry. The same position applied to millers. I point out that 40% of sugar mills are cooperatively owned. That means that they are owned by the growers themselves. The growers had to find the money with which to provide additional milling equipment. They provided this money knowing full well that there might be certain risks in doing so. But they knew that if they did not do it, some other mill area would do it. As I have indicated, the growers were obliged to produce the sugar. It is only right and proper that the Commonwealth should come to their aid by granting an increase in the price which they will receive for their story but it is rather inclined to bc one of sugar. The effect of this legislation will be that this year the growers will receive approximately $86 per ton. This is getting very close to cost of production. In fact, at one of their meetings growers stated that $86 per ton is getting back to the 19S1 level. There would not be too many wage wages that obtained in 1951. The money provided under this legislation in no way represents a gift to the industry. The loan of $20m last year, which meant an provided this year will have to be repaid by the industry. We support this measure because it will give some relief to the growers. The people associated with the industry did not make this request for assistance very lightly. They are well aware of the competition they are receiving from synthetic sweeteners; they know the extent to which synthetic sweeteners are being the cost of sugar to their largest consumers, such as breweries and fruit processors, by selling and delivering sugar to them in bulk. The growers have absorbed costs as much as possible in order to compete with artificial sweeteners and to maintain an increasing rate of consumption of sugar in Australia. The sugar industry is very important to Queensland. As I have already said, to a large extent it is responsible for decentralisation in that State. It has allowed a greater number of farmers to be concentrated in a given area of land. No other industry would allow such concentration. We have moved an amendment which, as I have said, in no way affects the principles contained in the Bill. We believe that the amendment, if accepted, would bring some measure of justice to the people in northern Queensland. I support the measure and ask the House to support the amendment which we have proposed. afraid that I cannot approach this Bill with the same degree of interest as did the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Hansen). He said that there is a long story to be told and that it is a sweet one. AllI can say from the point of view of Tasmanian industry is that it might be a long bitter gall.

105,Mr Pearsall (Franklin) [8.35],"I amaffected by any increase in the price of sugar. The Bill proposes simply to extend for 1 year the only form of agreement which has been in operation and which has not been altered substantially since 1923. I suggest that if the purpose of this legislation is simply to extend for 1 year the operation of the 1962 sugar agreementthe extension for 1 year presupposes a change in either the agreement or its effect on allied industries-it would appear to me to be a matter for sincere regret that it happens to be accompanied at this stage by a substantial rise in the price of sugar. I believe that the time is long overdue few minutes ago whether we would like to when a thorough investigation should be go back to the wages that were paid prior made of the effect increases in the price of to 1951.

In January 1933 the price of sugar dropped to £32 10s per ton and the rebate dropped to £2 4s per ton. From 1932 until 1960 sugar prices varied from the lowest price of £32 10s per ton to as high as £80 per ton. But from 1933 to 1960 the rebate stood at £2 4s per ton. As a direct result of the price fluctuations for sugar, the cost per dozen 24 oz cans of jam fluctuated by between 3s 2d and 8s. From 1960 the domestic rebate has remained at £5 per ton. Today this figure is £1 5s Id less than that which applied prior to 1932. The honourable member for Wide Bay asked a The sugar industry receives the protecating alarmingly.

The cutting I have is now a little sear and yellow, but the arguments in the editorial are precisely as valid now, 7 years industry in the State which I represent. later, as they were when the editorial was written. I believe that the article succinctly covers the situation we are discussing at which waited earlier this year on the present. It appeared on 7th April 1960, and it stated: It goes without saying that if the price of sugar the purpose of saying if the price of sugar is increased-as seems very likely-ther e should hedoes in fact increase these are some of a corresponding rise in the rebate aUowed to the offshoots and the problems that will be fruit processors.

This is something that should not be laughed at by honourable members representing the sugar interests because here is a large and, we hope, a lasting market. I may be considered to be drawing a long bow from the point of view of the industry which is strongly represented in my electorate. In case any honourable members may consider that I am doing this and in case they may be of the opinion increase in the price of sugar was taken only that the industry itself has not taken the after a very close examination of a fully-detailed precautions and actions that it ought to case submitted by the sugar industry through the have taken in its own interest when there Queensland was the threat of the price of sugar of the representations made by your Associaincreasing, perhaps I can convince honourtion on 20th April.

It was taken into account, and this telecost industry this State about $40,000 and would gram was followed by a letter which was kill the Tasmanian berry fruit industry when written by the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony), who was acting in the portfolio, to the general secretary of the Australian Canners Association in the following terms: I refer to your letter of 27th June to Mr Adermann requesting that the rate of the domestic sugar rebate be increased by $25.60 to $35.60 per ton to compensate for the recent increase in the price of sugar. The domestic sugar rebate and the price of sugar are established under the Commonwealth Queensland Sugar Agreement and so are not matters subject to control by the Commonwealth alone.

Under circumstances am unable to assist you in your request that sugar be made available your industry at conHaving related from my own personal cessional prices. Minister for Primary Industry. Mr J. R. Fraser-The previous one. There have been three Ministers involved in these approaches which have been made from time to time. Time does not permit me to mention to whom each approach was made. This was the decision that was reached. That is the main point. Now we come to this very well documented letter in which it has been pointed out that every lc increase in the cost of sugar would have a detrimental effect on the price of canned fruits and jams throughout Australia. I will quote the two passages of this letter that are relevant and important. Under the heading of 'Sugar Rebates' these people made a very trite and proper statement in the following terms: Over the years the Fruit Industry has had a reasonably happy relationship with the Sugar Industry, and it acknowledges that, through the rebate system the sugar industry has been of assistance, particularly in the export field. This, of course, is the export rebate, not the domestic rebate. The letter continues: On the other hand the fruit processors have been of assistance to the sugar industry by providing a sure market for a valuable tonnage of sugar. The plain facts are that the fruit industry would be unable to maintain even its present position without the rebate system, and any deterioration in the fruit industry as a result of sugar pricing policies will ultimately have its repercussion in Australian sugar sales. To those who want to interject let me say that maybe the Australian public, helpful as it is, will be prepared to see another $35m poured into the sugar industry, but this will never get my support while I am in this chamber, nor will such an unsympathetic attitude by those who do not have any concern for the welfare of the interests of other industries. Another quotation from the same letter reads: We acknowledge and sympathise with the sugar in its problems, but we believe that a transference of any part of the financial difficulties of one primary industry to another primary industiy will not, even in the short run, help the overall position of either. precisely what I ask the Minister to give. experience what has happened and what has been the history of this industry over the years, beset with these constant problems that the fictitious prices of sugar have created in Tasmania and which have had such a detrimental effect on the fruit industry of Australia, I believe that the time has come when a proper and more reasonable approach should be made. I have called the attention of the House to this matter as the member representing the Franklin electorate. It has been done before, no doubt far better than I have managed to do it tonight. This is an industry which, in my opinion, is worth protecting and I think that we should be able between us to find a solution that lies somewhere between the justice that is given to the sugar industry on the one hand and the injustices that occur to the food industry on the other hand. I urge the Minister to set up a departmental and industry inquiry into the whole of the problems associated with sugar and the domestic rebate and that he do so as a matter of urgency. I hope that such a committee could make an immediate investigation and, should it be established that this sugar price increase will detrimentally affect the industry, the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee should then be given sufficient funds to allow it to give a domestic rebate that is in keeping with the price that applied last year. This surely is not an unreasonable request to make on behalf of the sugar industry.

128,Mr Pearsall,"The previous one.the new year a full scale inquiry which would be able to take all of these matters into account. 1 believe that this inquiry should, by predetermining the position, be able to establish a formula for the domestic rebate which in the years to come will be directly related to any fluctuations in the price of sugar itself. This, as I see it, is the only solution that can be found for the welfare of the fruit industry, which provides a large market for the sugar production of Queensland. I would hope that honourable members would see this industry as a ready and large market. If it is killed, as it will be killed surely if this situation is allowed to prevail^ the Queensland sugar industry itself will suffer together with another primary industry in the State of Tasmania. I am sure that the Queensland sugar industry does not want to see a situation such as this develop. We do not want to see more people driven off the land in our State. This is a marriage and a partnership between two considerable industries in Tasmania and one should not go to the wall for the sake of the protection that becomes necessary for the other. ThusI argue the case strongly on behalf of the berry industry. It has been argued over the years but as yet a successful solution to the problem has not been found. The honourable member for Wide Bay mentioned the meteoric rise in sugar production. There is also, unfortunately, an equally meteoric drop in fruit production in Australia. Are we prepared to go along content with subsidising under a socialistic system one industry while we murder another one? able member's time has expired. port the amendment moved by the honourable member fbr Dawson (Dr Patterson) and ably supported by the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Hansen). I also congratulate the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Pearsall). I do not blame him for sticking up for an industry in his State. Tasmania is not the only State, nor is his electorate the only electorate, that produces canned fruits. After all, Queensland, too, produces and cans fruit. The honourable member for Franklin is flying off the handle about the assistance given to this wonderful industry, the sugar industry, which is good not only for Queensland but also for Australia from an export point of view. He refers to pouring 535m into the industry. This is not so. The amount provided is a loan and it has to be paid back with interest. The Government has realised that the industry as a whole will in the future be able to repay it. Whether the fruit industry could afford to take a loan of this magnitude and repay it with interest is another thing. I do not blame the honourable member for putting forward his case. He did so ably and I hope that I will be able to do the same for the sugar industry. I listened to the honourable member for Cowper( Mr Robinson) with interest, particularly as he is a member of the Australian Country Party who comes from a sugar growing area. I hoped that he would contribute some constructive opinions on the clauses of the Bill, but in his usual style he made a personal attack on the honourable member for Dawson. I do not know why honourable members opposite have such an obsession about the honourable member for Dawson. He seems to be a chopping block, particularly for some of the Country Party fellows, but I can tell them that the honourable member for Dawson has contributed greatly to the debates in this House and in the future he will do a lot more-probabl y more than the honourable member for Cowper will do. I do not think that the honourable member for Cowper understands the meaning of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson, which seeks to protect the cane farmer and the miller and to make satisfactory prices applicable to consumers, including manufacturers who use sugar. facturers. facturers, as the honourable member for Wide Bay reminds me. Apparently the honourable member for Cowper, who comes from New South Wales, fully supports the Queensland Government's policy of fleecing and exploiting primary producers and consumers in rural areas outside Brisbane. Is this the contempt which a member of the Country Party has for the cane farmer? It is little wonder that the cane farmer, in Queensland in particular, is just fed up",49,Sugar Agreement Bill 1967

132,Mr Fulton,"And soft drink manuwith the ineffectiveness of Country Party members and their lack of sympathy towards the sugar industry. Having dealt with two Government supporters who spoke on this matter, I should like to have some clarification on two questions. First, who sets the world price of sugar? Is it a tribunal, is it a commission or is the price just set by supply and demand? ]f it is set by supply and demand, why has not the price of sugar risen? The worse years of the sugar industry were from 1964 to 1965, when production was 67 million tons and consumption was only 60 million tons. Honourable members can realise the effect that would have on the price. However, in 1965-66 63.2 million tons was produced and 63.6 millions tons was consumed. I do not know how this comes about. But what has happened to the prices? Why have they fallen? Again, in 1966-67, 65.5 million tons of sugar was produced and 65.7 million tons was consumed. How does this situation arise? Does the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. or its stooges in England or somewhere overseas set the market price? Why do farmers have to produce cane for a return below the ptoduction cost? Surely the consumption of sugar must be going up. The population of the world is increasing daily, and we should be able to assume that consumption would increase. The honourable member for Cowper said that new growers in his area are quite satisfied, that they can obtain money and have no problems. I do not know whether this is true or not, but I can assure him that the new growers in the sugar industry have had to pay dearly for their land. These are the farmers who were encouraged into the sugar industry by the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government in order to increase the production of sugar in Queensland. Honourable members may recall that at that time a tremendous amount of money was being paid for sugar. The honourable member for Franklin pleaded for his farmers, and I wish to do the same for the sugar farmers. They are at present greatly handicapped by lack offinance.All the new growers who had to pay a tremendous price for their land put their life savings into the industry. They were people who understood canegrowing and understood the industry. They had faith in the industry. They were encouraged by the governments of the day to go into the sugar industry. What does this Government now expect them to do? Walk off their properties and throw away their life savings? These farmers are trying to hold on by taking other jobs until the price of sugar rises. If this type of producer in Australia does not need encouragement. I do not know who does. The banks will not loan the farmer money because they say that his equity is already taken up. This may be so at the present time. However, these farmers can be fostered along the way by a helping hand. Although the sugar price to the consumer will not greatly affect the cane farmer in his present situation, and the $35m loan, incidentally, will not directly help him, at least some of this money may come back to help him. Perhaps some sympathetic understanding will be given to the new grower who may have for instance, 1,000 or 2,000 acres of assigned land. He must grow cane knowing full well that he is not going to get back the cost of his labour, let alone the production cost of the cane. He is not allowed to grow anything else. Why cannot he be encouraged by allowing him to grow some other product on half of his assigned area? For instance, he could grow vegetables or some other product from which he could gain a profit. He could use half of his assignment to grow for the mills, although the mills may say that they geared to take a certain amount of cane and that the farmer must grow his assignment or they will not be able to meet their production figures. But if the farmer is not going to get the right price for his cane, why should he go to the trouble of producing it? Once these farmers get help, however, and if they are encouraged by the people concerned, whether it be the Central Sugar Cane Prices Board or thc Queensland Sugar Board, and can obtain a release from their assignments for a short period, the sugar industry will recover. I have always said this. Probably it will take 5 years, but no doubt the industry will recover. The sugar industry, particularly in Queensland, has always been known as a very efficient industry. The industry has been managed well and has kept up with the times. Overseas interests concerned with sugar have sent representatives to Australia, to Queensland in particular, to look at the management of the sugar industry. They have also looked at the processing side of the industry. These people have been astonished by the strides that have been made by this industry, not only on the growing side but also on the processing side. The expansion which has taken place in the sugar industry is costing the mills millions of dollars for renovations. The standards of the mills can be classed as the highest in the world. They are also keeping up with the latest harvesting methods. I believe that 48.5% of cane in Queensland at present is being cut by harvesters. No doubt the harvester itself is being improved every year. The industry will get over some of the difficulties that beset it at present in regard to cane that has been blown down or twisted by cyclones. This presents a problem at present, but no doubt it will be overcome shortly. As I said before, the $35m is not a grant to the industry. It has to be paid back with interest. The interest is not a slight amount -it represents a big sum of money that the industry will have to pay to the Government in a certain time. There will be no interest payable until 1970, but this is not going to assist the industry much, because the interest is going to start from that date, and the industry cannot overcome its difficulties in a couple of years. It will take 5 years at least before the farmers start to recover, and then they will have to carry on with the repayment of this capital and the payment of interest. As the honourable member for Wide Bay has said, the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson is supported by the Chamber of Manufactures and soft drink manufacturers. Why is it that two points in Tasmania are classified as base points and yet every other State has only one point? The honourable member for Dawson showed how Brisbane's geographical situation affected the position in central and northern Queensland. Queensland is a big State. The main provincial centres of population are Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns. I point out that Cairns is 1,000 miles from the capital city of Queensland. I go along some way with the manufacturers that there should be base points. However, I believe we cannot go the full distance with them. I agree with the honourable member for Dawson that Rockhampton and Townsville should be base points. Of course, I would also like Cairns, which is in my electorate, included in this. Rockhampton is the central point for the western and central areas and Townsville for the north. If these three points were adopted consumers in those areas would be better off. The honourable member for Cowper or some other honourable member said: What about the Brisbane area? It was suggested that Brisbane would be the best centre because it has the biggest population. I suggest that this does not make any difference. The costs will be the same in the other points as Brisbane, but the other suggestion would give the people in the north of Queensland, where the cane is produced, a chance to obtain sugar at a reasonable price. The worse area in my electorate to be hit is Thursday Island, because people there have to pay air freight from Cairns plus road or rail freight from Brisbane to Cairns. So Rockhampton and Townsville should be base points because of distance and population in these areas. I hope that members of the Government parties will take note of this proposed amendment and extend the base price system to two points in Queensland. I do not know how two points came to be established in Tasmania but the precedent has been set and if there are two base points in one State why can there not be two or even three in another State? Neither the grower nor the miller will be adversely affected. Instead, the consumers-her e I refer not only to individuals or families but also to manufacturers who use this sweet product-wil l be assisted. They are the people who are supporting this amendment. This is not a political matter by any means. tralise industry. the price of sugar will be more reasonable, not only in the coastal areas but in the western districts as well.

136,Mr Fulton,"Mount Isa is anotherpay freight on the sugar they receive. The growers do not receive anything out of the freight component; the Queensland Railways get it all. The honourable member for Dawson pointed outI will repeat it-that the railway system in Queensland is divided into three divisions, the Southern Division, the Central Division and the Northern Division. The Central and Northern Divisions have always shown a profit; the Southern Division has always shown a loss. The profit earned by the Central and Northern Divisions almost equalises the loss in the Southern Division. Is this not an occasion So the Opposition sayswhen the Queensland Government should come to the rescue of the sugar industry? After all, the industry belongs to the State. Why does not the Government bear the the past few years? rail freights to the other centres? Let me digress for a moment. It is strange that although the Central and Northern freights in a moment. The implications of Divisions of the Queensland Railways are that proposed amendment deserve to be showing a profit the State Government is explored and I intend to do so because in ripping up some of the lines in those areas. many ways this is the central theme of the If that is the kind of sympathy we can case which has been proposed by the expect from the Queensland Government, Opposition, and certainly of tbe case which then it is no wonder that the cane farmers has been proposed by my good friends the look for very little assistance. I. commend the amendment to the House. in the area in which these additional costs As the honourable member for Dawson will fall. It is agreed in the amendment that pointed out, clause 10 of the agreement is there will be additional freights. Of course redundant because under the agreement the the Opposition dismisses the additional costs Queensland Government should bear any by saying: 'Yes, but the Central and losses but it has reneged so the agreement Northern Divisions make a profit*.

When the debate on this BUl commenced I had not intended to participate in it. Quite not be divided. An attempt has been made frankly, I am not an expert on the sugar to divide administration costs. The industry as are the honourable members for accountants who are responsible for doing Cowper( Mr Robinson) and Leichhardt this kind of work know that no attempt ( Mr Fulton), but I should like to say a few has been made to divide costs in relation words in a friendly and non controversial to central yards of a railway system.

138,Mr Fulton,Why have they risen over,53,Sugar Agreement Bill 1967
139,Mr Kevin Cairns,"We wiU look atcommodities that are carried. If a railway system is doing rather well overall because certain commodities are very profitable, it is worthwhile looking at those commodities. We have in mind the long haul of wool, livestock, minerals, coal and so on. If one introduces a system which proposes a reduction in revenue or an increase in expenditure on a section of a railway system which appears to be profitable, one merely increases costs on the commodities which make those sections profitable. That is common sense. If additional freights have to be borne and if additional expenditure is pressed on a railway system-thi s has been done-that additional expenditure will fall on those four commodity groups I have mentioned. I can imagine why the Opposition would not worry about that aspect. After all, the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr These people transport nearly half a million Katter) and the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Corbett) whose electorates adjoin are more concerned about wool and livestock than they are about sugar. The areas they represent are not basically sugar areas. The proposal advanced by the Opposition is this: 'Let us press the costs on to those commodities which enable the overall railway system to be profitable'. It is worthwhile examining that proposal in further detail. I do not know whether the Opposition has advanced this proposal in ignorance. If it has, we will give it an opportunity to withdraw the amendment. I think it has been introduced mistakenly. There is another question. Why has the Opposition chosen to penalise the railway system? Why has it not chosen some of the other transportation systems in this part by. of Australia? An analysis of the transportation of sugar shows that the railway system is responsible for less than half of the total consider the honourable member who introsugar transportation task over the four basic sugar movements-fro m the farm to the mill, from the mill to the port, from the port to the refinery and from the refinery to the consumer-and in only one of those four sections do we find the railway system, which members of the Opposition would penalise, responsible for the major part of sugar transportation costs. So the road operators and the ship operators will go scot-free under the amendment proposed by the Opposition. I find this a fantastic proposition from the point of view of a fair pricing system, and I think I should try to induce those honourable members who have proposed this amendment to realise that if they hit one transportation system, the railways, they should hit the road operators and the shipping operators as well. I could understand this kind of amendment emanating from people in a party, who may not have been aware of the necessity for fairness as between pricing systems and who may not have been aware of the economics of transportation systems. Let us have a look at the shipping operators who will receive a proportionate advantage from the penalisation of the railway system. Who are they? First there is the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd, with its own ships. There is the Australian National Line, Associated Steamships Pty Ltd, Howard Smith Industries Pty Ltd. tons of this commodity each year, but no proposal is made in this amendment to cosh these operators. The proposal is only to hit the railway systems-and this is an amendment proposed by a Socialist party. Let us also introduce an element of fairness in dealing with some of the big road operators, who I understand are not completely dissociated from what is known as the Liberal Reform Group, which has a policy similar to that of honourable members opposite. Why does not the Opposition make some suggestions about the freight rates charged by the big road operatorsfreight rates which are not made public? I cannot understand why the Opposition proposes an amendment which contradicts all the principles which it professes to stand I can get some slight idea of how this amendment came to be proposed when I duced it on behalf of the Opposition. He has not, after all, had a very long history in his Party. In fact he has had a very short history, and he may not understand fully the Socialist tradition of the Party to which he came rather late in life. But that is a matter for him. I hope that he will reconsider the matter, in consultation with the old hands of his Party, so that they may decide whether they should adhere to the proposition that the railway systems should be penalised while the private operators go scot-free. Let us see whether all the other members of the Opposition would say: 'Let the shipping companies go free and let the road operators go free while we hit the government transportation system*. I remind the House again that the railway system is responsible for only a minor part of the total transportation requirements of the Queensland sugar industry. It had not been my intention, when this Bill was first introduced, to join in the debate, because I admit frankly that I am most inexpert in matters connected with the sugar industry. On the other hand, however, I think we should show a sense of fairness as between the different methods of transportation, and if either a State method of transportation or a private method is to be hit unfairly 1 will speak out, as I have spoken out on this occasion. I urge honourable members opposite to reconsider paragraph (b) of their amendment and to give serious consideration to withdrawing it. The philosophy into which they have been drawn by the honourable member who led for the Opposition represents a very strange way of thinking, particularly for people who profess to be concerned with decentralisation. Everybody knows that in Queensland expenditure on the railway system represents a bigger proportion of the State budget than is the case in other States. Everyone knows, too, that railway systems are more successful than road or sea transportation systems in promoting regional development and decentralisation, in providing employment opportunities fqr people in remote areas. Here we see a Socialist party, some members of which come from country areas, attempting to hurt a government railway transportation system and to reduce the secondary benefits which that system brings. Many a town along the coast, as we all know, depends on the continuance of a viable railway system for its livelihood. decessor suggested that if they decide, after lt is for these reasons, which I think are the matter back to the Minister for Primary fairly clear and pretty cogent, that I oppose Industry and ask for it to be re-examined. the amendment. I implore members such as the honourable member for Wide Bay and the honourable member for Leichhardt, who have a long history in their Party and is well aware, the present domestic sugar who know something of the Socialist tradirebate of $10 a ton has operated since tion of that Party, at least to appeal to the 1960. Prior to that the domestic rebate was honourable gentleman who led for the the same as the rate set in 1933-£ 2 4s a Opposition in the debate to withdraw the ton. So in 1960 there was some increase amendment, so that they will not deny the in the rebate. However, it must not be very philosophy which they have expounded forgotten by berry producers and by other over a number of decades. for Primary Industry) [9.36]I note that the Opposition sees justification for the increase in the price of sugar and supports that increase. However, it has moved an amendment which is loaded more with poUtical content than with good judgment or reasoning. Before dealing with the amendment I would like to refer to some of the comments of the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Pearsall), who made a strong and factual speech supporting an important industry which he represents, the berry fruits industry of Tasmania. This industry has not been enjoying what one might call buoyant conditions. Any increase in the price of sugar, which would add to the costs which must be borne by those connected with this industry, naturally causes some reaction amongst them. The honourable member for Franklin has told us what the effects on the industry will be. He made representations to my predecessor in the position of Minister for Primary Industry, the right honourable member for Fisher( Mr Adermann), together with the honourable member for Denison( Mr Gibson), Senator Wright, Senator Lillico and Senator Marriott, and expressed concern as to the effect on the berry fruits industry of an increase in the price of sugar. My predecessor said that he could not very well take action at the time as there were certain relevant aspects about which more had to be learnt. He pointed out that the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee will be meeting in November and will be fixing the price for fresh berry fruit supplied to the canneries, and until this price is known we cannot say whether the growers will be unduly hurt. My prethe price of fresh fruit is fixed, that they will suffer undue hardship, they should bring As the honourable member for Franklin honourable members in this House that",53,Sugar Agreement Bill 1967
140,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Ministe rthere is an export rebate to the canned fruit industry and to other industries which export their products. This rebate enables the industries concerned to receive sugar at the world parity price. However, I would like to say to the honourable member for Franklin and to other honourable members from Tasmania that this whole question will come up at the end of this year when consideration is given to a new stabilisation price. The present stabilisation scheme was extended for 1 year; therefore all facets of the scheme will have to be examined before the commencement of the new scheme in August next year. The domestic rebate is one of the matters which will have to be thoroughly examined before that date or before such time that the berry producers will be affected. The Opposition has moved an amendment to this Bill. The first paragraph of the amendment is as follows: (a) in order to end the discrimination against Government has no right to direct the consumers located in central and northern Queensland Government to allow any Queensland because of the geographical location of Brisbane in the extreme south freight concessions or to use profits which east corner of the State, the seaboard it may make on one railway line or another towns of Rockhampton and Townsville be to provide a concession to consumers of included in the base price system applying sugar in the Rockhampton or Townsville to Australian capital cities as well as areas or elsewhere. Therefore, this suggesLaunceston; For many years the Sugar Agreement Government and is out of order in this contained an arrangement to establish the House. In any event, I have never heard of same maximum wholesale price for sugar the Queensland Railways making an overall sold in specific cities. This system was profit. To provide this freight concession adopted in order to establish an equitable would load a heavier burden on to the arrangement between the various States railway system in Queensland. and the Northern Territory. It was designed to ensure that there would be the same ceiling price at base points. To extend the number of base points, as is suggested in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) on behalf of the Opposition, would be unfair to consumers in other parts of the country where this base price did not apply-in the This provision has been included in the south west of Queensland, for instance, and Agreement since 1923.

The provision also could assist the would fall upon the sugar industry itself. Queensland Government in exercising conAs honourable members are aware, the trol over production, which is a responsugar industry at the moment is going sibility undertaken under clause 11 of tbe through an extremely difficult period. As I mentioned in reply to the honourable member for Franklin, one of the ideas behind extending the Agreement for 1 year was to give us time to look at all the different points involved so that they may be brought up again for debate in this House in 12 months time. The second paragraph in the amendment moved by the Opposition is as follows: (b) the costs of any additional freights associated with the inclusion of Rockhampton and TownsviUe in the babe price system be borne by the Queensland Government from the substantial prolits made annually by the State on the central and north Queensland Rail v. ay Divisions, so that these costs are not in any way made a charge against the sugar industry which is already being charged excessive freight rates in central and north Queensland; I think the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns) answered this point very well. The fact is that the Commonwealth tion is purely a matter for the Queensland The third paragraph of the Opposition amendment states: (c) clause 10 of the principal agreement be deleted as it is meaningless unless specifically defined, particularly as substantial losses are being currently incurred by sections of the sugar industry due to the low price on the world free market. Agreement. The. fact that the State Government and not the Commonwealth Government accepts responsibility for any loss on sugar exports does not mean that the Commonwealth ignores financial difficulties encountered by the industry because of low prices on the free world market. The depressed state of that market and the industry's increased dependence on it have been among the basic considerations for the Government's decision to make repayable grants on concessional terms, in order to increase the returns earned in the 1966-67 season, and to agree to the home market price increase for which parliamentary agreement is sought in the Bill we are debating. Because of the reasons I have stated the Government does not agree with this amendment. Under the Constitution, the control of production is solely within the powers and the sovereign rights of the States. Therefore, the responsibility for any over-production of primary products lies with the State governments. The Commonwealth Government has tried to help the sugar industry. The Government is agreeing to this price increase as one means of helping the industry to obtain a greater return. The Government is making repayable grants to the industry as a. means of ensuring that it will get a minimum return of $86 a ton for stigar this year. People in the sugar industry cannot merely accept that the Government automatically does these things. These are matters which must be given a great deal of consideration. They must be weighed and considered exhaustively. It was only after the Government had fully considered these matters and assessed the likely consequences that it eventually agreed to do these two things to help the industry. The honourable member for Dawson suggested that by increasing the home price on 19th June the Commonwealth Government had broken the 1962 Sugar Agreement, as approved by the Parliament. He said that the Government should have waited until the Agreement was scheduled to expire on 31st August 1967 and then asked the Parliament for approval to increase the price under a new agreement. in the Sugar Agreement Act 1962 or in the 1962 Sugar Agreement to prevent the Commonwealth from agreeing with the Queensland Government to vary arrangements made between the two parties in the 1962 Agreement, although the new arrangement contained in the Supplemental Sugar Agreement 1967 is not conditional on the ratification and approval of Parliament, as is now sought. It was necessary to increase the home market price in June because, without the price increase and the Commonwealth's financial assistance, the sugar industry's foreseeable earnings from the sugar to be produced in the 1967 season, which commenced on 24th May, would have averaged only about the same as, and might even have been less than, the $77.13 a ton earned in the 1966 season-the lowest earnings since 1951. If the home price had not been increased until after the Parliament had approved a new agreement, much of the home market sales of 1967 season sugar would have been made at the old price, with resultant greater hardships for the sugar industry. The seeking of prior consent by the Parliament to a price increase would have led to exceptionally heavy purchasing at low prices and would have disorganised refining and marketing arrangements and produced speculation and irregularities in trading habits with respect to sugar. Any delay in implementing a decision affecting prices does this. We all know that new tax or excise rates are implemented immediately legislation is introduced and that ratification by the Parliament follows. The same procedure applies in this instance in relation to the sugar industry. If this proposal were to be announced and its implementation delayed, undue speculation would occur and the purchasers themselves would be hurt. The two Governments, at the same time as they agreed on the price increase, agreed that it would be appropriate to extend the 1962 Agreement for 1 year until 31st August 1968. This will allow a longer period for the re-negotiation of a full new agreement which, to judge by its predecessors, will be a comprehensive one, covering all the facets that have been mentioned by Opposition members and There is no provision particularly those that have been mentioned by the honourable member for Franklin.

Dr PATTERSON (Dawson) [10.1]-In order to facUitate the discussion of this BiU in Committee, rather than deal with a number of clauses individually I propose to .. 66 combine some of the points that I wish to 33 make on the various provisions. I wish to deal specifically with clause 3 of the BUl .. 33 which gives approval to the Agreement, and with the Agreement itself which is the Hughes, T. E. F. Schedule to the BUl. Clause4 of the Hulme, A. S. Supplemental Sugar Agreement 1967 is in Jarman, A. W. effect an amendment of Clause6 of the principal Agreement. I shall deal firstly with Katter, R. C. Clause6 of the principal Agreement Kent Hughes, Sir Wilfrid because it is really the whole basis of the Agreement. It determines or provides the Lee, M . W. machinery whereby during the agreed Lucock, P. E. period the State will fix or alter, as the case Mackay, M . G. may be, the price of refined sugar oi IA McLeay, J. E. grade or of refined sugar of IXD grade. Munro, D . R. R. Some of the points made by the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Pearsall), the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Snedden, B. M . Kevin Cairns) and the Minister for Primary St John. E. H . Industry( Mr Anthony) are very pertinent Street, A. A. to clause 6 of the Sugar Agreement. Let Wentworth, W. C. me deal firstly with the comments made by the honourable member for Franklin. Prices and freights are germane to the whole Erwin, G. D. Agreement. 1 respect the views tha! he presented. I would have thought that he might have taken the opportunity to move an amendment if he wanted to give voice Griffiths, C. E. in the Parliament to his opposition to the Hayden, W. G. present domestic price of sugar. However, I appreciate his problems in this matter. Nicholls, M . H . Nevertheless, the basis of the whole AgreePatterson, R. A. ment is the variation in the domestic price of sugar. But also germane to this price is Uren, T. the matter of freights which the honourable Webb, C. H . member for LUley and I and other members Duthie, G. W. A . of the Opposition have raised. There can be no doubt that the rail Whitlam, E. G. freights system in Queensland is vital to the Calwell, A. A. price of sugar. It is vital to this Bill and to Cameron, Clyde the price of sugar being received by the producers. I think the Minister for Primary Jones, Charles Industry said that he did not know when James, A. W. the Queensland railways system as a whole had made a profit. It certainly made a profit this year of approximately $4.5m. I have the figures here for everybody to see. In the last 10 years the central railways system-that is from approximately Bundaberg to Mackay-ha d an accumulated profit of $23m and the northern railways system had an accumulated profit of $30m. But the Brisbane and southern railways system had an accumulated loss of $69.8m. If we take account of the overheads referred to by the honourable member for Lilley, the cost of office staff, head office buildings and the honourable member that because the central yards is a small amount compared with the loss in tbe 10 years of $69,880,000. His point that other industries, such as the wool industry, would suffer if rail freights were reduced is without foundation. What would happen is that rail freights in Brisbane would have to be increased. In other words, the practice of subsidising cheap rail freights and fares in Brisbane would have to end. The other point that I would make with regard to clause 6 of the Agreement is that under the existing system of rail freights sugar producers are being penalised. Let me cite two examples to prove my point. The Cattle Creek and North Eton mills are being forced to move their sugar by rail, despite the fact that they could move it by road transport more cheaply. If these mills were to use road transport in order to move their sugar the Cattle Creek mill could save $60,000 this year and the North Eton mill $40,000. In effect these two producers are forced to pay $100,000 between them in order to support the railway system, which is already making a big profit. This is not fair. It is an imposition to ask primary producers to pay high freight rates in order to support the railway system, which is already making a profit. The two mills to which I have referred are paying $100,000 more than they would need to pay if they were allowed to move their sugar by road. But the Queensland Minister for Transport, Mr Knox, has refused to allow them to do so. Surely1 bave answered the case advanced by the honourable member for Lilley. I have referred to two specific cases and if required I can give more detailed information to show how more mills could save nioney. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Pearsall) said that the increase in the price of sugar will not affect the breweries. It will affect the breweries. Arguing the matter in economic terms, if you reduced the price of sugar to the breweries they would use sugar. Today the breweries -Carlton United Brewery for instanceare using hydrolised starch as a substitute for sugar. The important thing in this respect is to ascertain the price of hydrolised starch per ton of carbohydrates or fermentable solids, because this is the only way to ascertain the base price as a comparison with sugar. I agree with price of sugar has increased, the breweries have resorted to a substitute. Some are using hydrolised starch instead of brewer's sugar. So the increase in the price of sugar has had an effect on the breweries. If the price of sugar had not been increased the breweries might be using more brewer's sugar. 1 have made the point that the railway system is making a profit. I accept the argument of the honourable member for Lilley that overheads in respect of operations at head office and central yards must be taken into account. This matter has been thrashed out before. There can be no argument-Country Party members from Queensland know this-that the rural areas of Queensland-the western, northern and central areas-ar e subsidising cheap rail freights and cheap fares in Brisbane. Of course, this is a matter of politics, because the greatest number of voters live in Brisbane. The only other point I would like to make is in respect of clause 10 of the Agreement, which the Government has rejected. This is a clause which the industry itself wanted deleted from the Agreement. It was the opinion of the Queensland Cane Growers Council that the clause could be a legal impediment to a successful negotiation between the State and Commonwealth governments and therefore should be excised from the new Agreement. The principles involved in this concept should be the subject of a letter of understanding. Perhaps the Commonwealth Government, the State Government and the industry have agreed that the clause is necessary because it absolves the Commonwealth from blame in thc event of a drop in the price of sugar. The point that T am making is that the clause is meaningless as it is. worry about it? The terminology should be revised. If the Commonwealth is to be absolved from",55,Sugar Agreement Bill 1967
141,Mr Anthony,If it is meaningless why,59,Pairs
142,Dr Patterson,"Why not delete it?blame, that fact should be inserted in specific terms. The industry and everyone else would know what that clause means. I wish to amplify the transportation problem. There were two points in my argument appertaining to this. In no railway system can one sectionalise with complete validity. This case is not arguable anywhere in Australia. It is not completely arguable in Queensland. The railways make a profit or a loss in relation to the commodity groups which use the system. If an extra cost is placed upon a railway system that will hurt those commodity groups which enable the system to make a profit. So far as one can tell, the commodity groups which enable the Queensland railway system to operate profitably are wool, livestock, mineralsI only have to mention Mount Isa-coa l and so on. If extra expenditure is placed on a railway system to pay for a scheme such as that suggested by the Opposition the cost will be borne by the consignors of those commodities. This fact ought to be realised. I realise, of course, that the areas in which those commodities are produced might not be of as much concern to honourable members opposite as to honourable members on this side of the chamber. The second point that I made was quite simple also. Why is it proposed to place a burden on one part of a transportation system whereas the road transportation and ship transportation systems, which are quite large in the sugar industry, are allowed to go scot free? Why penalise one as against the others? I have been unable to understand the proposition, especially as it is advanced by the Opposition. It would deprive a government operated transport scheme while private operators, whether they are efficient or inefficient, would receive an unfair advantage. I believe that a fair pricing system between the private operators on roads and ships and the railway system should be established; none should receive an advantage. It is indeed strange that the Opposition should seek to hurt one and allow the other to take advantage of that action. Dr point I intend to rule on whether the honourable known. member for Dawson can continue to speak on this matter. Both the honourable member for Dawson and tbe honourable member for Lilley, in the Committee stage, have commented on something that has been referred to in the House and on which the House has made a decision by vote. This matter has been put forward by both honourable members, who have had a fair opportunity to discuss it. For the matter to be discussed further in the Committee stage would be to transgress the subject matter of the Bill. That is my ruling. I call the honourable member for Franklin. honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) suggested that perhaps I could have moved an amendment in respect of clause 6, which indeed affects most of the subject matter of my earlier discussion. I am in a quandary, but I do not hesitate to tell the honourable member that any amendment that I would move would be to increase the domestic rebate in respect of sugar. This would, in turn, obviously have a detrimental effect on the sugar industry. Despite the lack of correct interpretation of my earlier remarks, it is no wish of the industry on whose behalf I am speaking in this chamber tonight to take from a fellow primary industry simply for the purpose of conceding or giving to another. This is not, in fact, the purpose which we have to achieve. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony) was kind enough to mention one other rather pertinent and very important matter, that is, that we are not yet sure what the fixed price of this fruit will be. However, I have a feeling that the fixed price usually is based upon what the market will be able to return, and for this reason there is a limit to tbe extent to which the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee finds itself able to fix a price for the purpose and benefit of the small fruit industry. The second objection I have is that the crop is on the trees and all the expense has been undertaken by the people I represent, but they still do not know what returns they wiH receive from their fruit. Tbe Fruit Industry Sugar ConPatterson-On that particular cession Committee should meet early. However, there are difficulties associated witb",59,Pairs

145,Mr Pearsall (Franklin) {10.14],"Th eI sincerely hope that the ray of hope that the Minister gave in his speech tonight is an indication of the way in which the situation will be approached when the whole of the agreement is renegotiated. I hope that in that process we get back to the position we were in in Tasmania not many years ago when we had a direct voice on the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee. Upon his death a very important member, the Chairman of the Tasmanian Stone and Berry Fruits Board, was replaced by a citrus grower from Queensland. We, as very big producers of berry fruit in proportion to the quantity of other stone fruits that are produced, have no direct voice on this Committee at all; yet its decisions affect us materially. If we are to renegotiate and rethink the whole of this agreement and are to have another look at our Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee and the effect it has upon this industry in Tasmania and Victoria, then in the process of so doing I hope we will not detrimentally affect the industry for this coming year. It may be that in time and as a result of mature thought we will be able to get a permanent solution to the problem. I urge the Minister to have an inquiry made to establish to his own definite satisfaction that an injury is being suffered this year. A grave problem confronts this industry. I hope the Minister will look at the industry with the object of ensuring its future welfare. The industry is a big buyer of sugar and for this reason is important. The Minister should look at it with a long range view. In any renegotiation of the agreement regard should be had to ensuring that for this year at least there is no increase in the price above that which prevailed last year. This would give us the opportunity in 1968 to rethink the whole situation and perhaps to come up with a more just solution of the problem which, I think, we are half way towards solving. At present we have a fictitious price for sugar. While this situation prevails the only means of salvation to which the berry fruits industry can look forward is a direct tying of the domestic rebate to the fluctuating prices of sugar itself, because sugar plays such an important part in the processing of this fruit. I ask for thi.s because I believe it is the only avenue whereby we can save the berry fruits industry. It is worth saving. It is an important industry-a t least in Tasmania and it plays its part in the overall economy of the nation. Quite apart from other reasons, humane and just considerations ought to actuate the Minister to think in terms of enabling the growers to secure slightly fairer returns. Without some solution of the problem on the lines I have suggested, the industry is absolutely doomed. I would be doing less than my duty if I were not fo say so. Bill agreed to. BiU reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading leave-rea d a third time. Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 October (vide page 1798), on motion by Dr Forbes: That the Bill be now read a second time. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS (Yarra) [10.22]-Mr Speaker, the National Health Bill (No. 2) 1967, provides for the lending of hearing aids to persons in receipt of an age pension, an invalid pension, a widow's pension, a service pension, a tuberculosis allowance or a sheltered employment allowance. This service will be available also to the dependants of these pensioners. In other words, this Bjll provides the same kind of service for these pensioners and their dependants as exists now for children and repatriation beneficiaries who are deaf. It is expected that in the 3 years in which this legislation will operate about 100,000 pensioners and their dependants will be tested or examined and that about 36,000 hearing aids will be fitted. The examinations will be made by a qualified member of the staff of the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories and if it appears that the hearing of a person can be improved a hearing aid will be given provided that the pensioner pays a hiring charge of $10. The hearing aid will really be on loan and if the recipient keeps it intact, it will be maintained and adjusted without cost by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories. But where the hearing aid is damaged or is lost and has to be replaced a further $10 will be charged. I should",60,Pairs
146,Bill (On Motion By Mr Anthony),"b ylike to know whether this means that the pensioner will be charged that further $10 if the hearing aid has to be replaced for him or if it is replaced to the stock of the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories. The Opposition approves of this service and supports it. I should not think that it will take long for the House tonight to debate this Bill. However whilst we approve of this action, support it and welcome it, it is very little. The Government has done very little for pensioners this year. I sometimes think that it is the Government that needs a hearing aid to become aware of the needs of the pensioners and to respond to them. Perhaps it would be much better if the Government were to fit itself with an adequate hearing aid for this purpose. Although we welcome the assistance that has been given in this Bill, we say that the Government has done nothing in a year in which Australia is, according to the GovernDoes the Minister know whether the New ment's standards, extraordinarily prosperous and in which the nation could have afforded to do much more. So the Opposition does not receive the Bill without criticism and without pointing out that it does a little and service that this Bill provides? only a very little. Specifically the Opposition would like the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) to consider a few aspects of the legislation in detail and perhaps to answer the questions that arise from a consideration of these aspects. Firstly, the hearing aid remains at all times the property of the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories. What happens if the pensioner returns it, not requiring it any longer, or if it is returned on behalf of the pensioner, perhaps after his death? Does he or do his dependants receive back the $10 that he has paid? Secondly, it is quite possible that the payment of the $10 will cause hardship for a pensioner. I personally know many pensioners in need of a hearing aid for whom the payment of $10 would mean considerable hardship. I know that they now go without a hearing aid because they cannot possibly afford the retail price of one. I know that $10 is considerably less than the normal retail price of a hearing aid, but if the payment of the $10 will cause hardship can any assistance be given? Can the required payment of $10 be remitted if payment of this amount would cause hardship to a pensioner? Thirdly, the pensioner is required to provide his own batteries. The Minister recognised this in his speech. This can involve a very considerable cost. Is it possible for some arrangement to be made for the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories to supply batteries appropriate for the Calaid, the hearing aid that is assembled by the Laboratories, either at cost or at a concessional price? I should think that the provision of batteries will amount each year to a fairly considerable cost for the pensioner who uses the hearing aid. The New South Wales Department of Social Welfare, 1 understand, supplies hearing aids free for pensioners in that State. Will those pensioners who have been eligible to receive them in New South Wales now be required to avail themselves of the Commonwealth service and pay $10 for the loan of the hearing aid they receive? South Wales service will continue or whether the pensioner will henceforth be expected by the New South Wales authority to avail himself of the Commonwealth Another question arises from the fact that the pensioner is first required to consult his own doctor. The consultation will cost him nothing because he can use his pensioner medical card for the purpose. The doctor may then refer the pensioner to the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories where he will be examined to decide whether he requires a hearing aid. I should like to know what is the procedure connected with the carrying out of these examinations. At how many centres will examinations be made? Again, will pensioners who live in outer suburbs or country areas be required to travel to the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories or some other centre for examination? If they incur travelling expenses in attending for examination or to have a hearing aid fitted, which may require more than one attenddance, is there any provision for meeting the cost of their transport for them? The last point I make is that the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories do not manufacture the hearing aid; they purchase parts from private firms and assemble the aid, which is called the Calaid. Apparently this is derived from 'Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories aid'. To. date, 20,000 of these aids have been supplied to children and repatriation beneficiaries under the provisions of section 9A of the National Health Act. I have pointed out already that it is expected that over 3 years about 36,000 aids will be made available under this Bill. I should like to know whether the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories have investigated the economics of supplying 36,000 aids over 3 years would justify any departure from the present method of purchasing parts from private firms for assembly by Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories. Has any inquiry been made as to whether it will be more economical for Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories to manufacture the aids themselves? This is not a political ideological question of ' State enterprise versus private enterprise; it is purely one of the economics of the situation. If it would be less expensive for the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories to manufacture the aids there would be an unanswer3 years approximately 100,000 pensioners able case for the Government to adopt this course. AllI am asking at this stage is whether some consideration has been given to this point and whether the economics of the alternative method have been considered and weighed up. In fact, I wonder what it does cost to produce the Calaid. Could it be manufactured for a lower figure than it costs to buy parts and assemble them? If the Minister has not inquired into this, the Opposition asks that he do so and give us the benefit of his inquiries. There is no further matter of detail that I wish tb put before the House tonight with respect to this Bill. The Opposition is pleased to know that at last the Government has agreed to extend this service of providing hearing aids to pensioners and the important point we stress is that whilst we approve the measure we are concerned at the fact that probably a number of pensioners will find difficulty in paying the initial $10 necessary to obtain an aid. We specially want to know whether the Government will consider a way of remitting this $10 where hardship is in fact caused. this Bill to provide an additional benefit the life of the aid and, if it happens to for hard of hearing pensioners and their become damaged beyond repair, a new aid dependants by supplying them with hearing will be issued for an additional fee of $10. aids. Since the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories were established in about 1948, hearing aids have been provided to deaf school children, pre-school children, repatriation cases where the deafness is a result of war service and serving members of the defence forces, and some have been supplied as a social service benefit to certain people undergoing rehabilitation training and treatment. The extension of the operations of the Laboratories will now include a service for age, widow,invalid and service pensioners, in addition to those receiving a tuberculosis allowance or sheltered employment allowance. Dependants of these people will also be eligible to receive a hearing appliance under this amendment. Last year 970 hearing aids were provided to children by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories and a total of more than 20,000 instruments have been distributed under the existing scheme since it began. It is estimated that during the next will be tested and 36,000 hearing aids will be fitted. This, of course, will necessitate a substantial expansion of the instrumentality to cope with this demand. It will be necessary to increase the staff considerably and to establish branches in suburban and country areas to serve the additional people that this Bill will embrace. The pensioner will be given the choice of two aids, the Calaid E, which is a miniature instrument fitted to an ear mould inserted into the ear, and the more powerful Calaid T, which is a transistorised unit worn on the body. The pensioner or dependant classified under this amendment will have to seek the advice of his own general practitioner to ascertain in the first instance whether in the opinion of the doctor a hearing aid is advisable. He will then be referred to the Laboratories for an audiometric examination which will assess the loss of hearing to determine whether an appliance would be beneficial. If it is decided that an instrument should be issued a fee of $10 will be required and an individual ear mould will be taken to enable a correctly fitting instrument to be supplied. This will",61,National Health Bill No 2 1967
147,Mr Jessop (Grey) [10.35],"I support then be subject to free maintenance duringIn my speech during the debate on the estimates for the Department of HealthI referred to the fact that pensioners were restricted by this Bill to one source of supply and I said that only one make of hearing aid is available to them. I suggested that the Bill should allow for a widening of this choice by including suppliers in the industry, thereby giving the pensioner a freedom of choice not only of consultant but also of the type of hearing aid that is to be provided. I still feel that a pensioner could be sent to the Laboratories for an assessment of his hearing loss, if the Government considers that this is necessary, and be supplied with an authority for the supply of an aid, to specifications laid down by the Government, at a hiring fee of $10 or a straight out price which again could be laid down by the Government. I believe also that the person should have the choice of purchasing a more expensive type if he can afford it. The Government could make the same cash allowance in such a case and it could be deducted from the price of a better type of instrument. The Bill states that the Minister may through any acoustic laboratory established under the Acoustic Laboratories Act 1948 or in any other way arrange for the supply by the Commonwealth of hearing aids to persons over the age of 21 years who are suffering from defective hearing, being pensioners or dependants of pensioners, and for the maintenance otherwise than by way of provision of replacement batteries, of hearing aids so supplied. The Minister is thus given the necessary authority. I repeat that he may through any acoustic laboratory established under the Acoustic Laboratories Act 1948 or in any other way arrange for the supply by the Commonwealth of hearing aids to the persons I have stated. I again urge the Minister to reconsider his decision on this matter and give further thought to future extension of the legislation to include private industry. Private hearing aid consultants have branches throughout country areas as well as in city and suburban centres. They have been rendering a valuable service to the community for many years and appear to me to be geared to handle this work. Many country centres are served on a twomonthly basis, or even more frequently. Agencies are established to supply batteries and to handle any repair work that could be necessary. I am sure that if these people were given the opportunity they could handle the work for pensioners with ease, thereby avoiding the added expense necessary for the government laboratories to increase their staff and to establish additional branches to cater for the extra work generated by this legislation. I respectfully suggest that the Minister should take all these points into consideration with a view to including private enterprise in the coverage of the legislation, thus giving to pensioners and their dependants freedom to choose their own consultants, many of whom have been treating with complete satisfaction for a great number of years cases of the type covered by this legislation. very often that the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) receives praise from this side of the chamber. I disagree with him on such matters as foreign affairs and defence but I always listen with some interest to his speeches on domestic affairs. It is obvious that he puts into them a lot of thought and preparation of detail and they are certainly well worth listening to. Tonight he has raised the point that where pensioners are unable to pay the sum of $10 as the fee provided for in the Bill, no charge should be made to them. I think most honourable members would agree with his suggestion and I hope that it will be adopted in cases where the need arises. Since the present Liberal and Country Party Government came into office in 1949 much has been done to improve the lot of pensioners. During the debate this year on the presentation of the Budget Papers speaker after speaker produced figures fo show how, calculated as a percentage, pensioners are far better off today than they were under a Labor administration. The figures are readily available in Hansard and I do not intend to waste the time of the House tonight by citing them. They are factual. Many honourable members on both sides of the chamber were disappointed that due to defence commitments and other commitunable to see his way clear to raise the rate of pensions in the last Budget. However, in his Budget Speech he foreshadowed",63,National Health Bill No 2 1967

149,Ments The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) Was,"what 1 consider to be a very valuable extension of the social services at present available; that is the provision of hearing aids to pensioners and their dependants. As the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) has pointed out, there is to be an extension of the hearing aid service at present conducted by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories which supply Calaids on a loan basis to deaf school children and pre-school children, certain repatriation cases, members of the defence services, and social service recipients people who are not in need of an aid being undergoing rehabilitation treatment. Under this Bill the service is extended to people in receipt of an age, invalid or widow's pension, a service pension, a tuberculosis allowreputable hearing aid retailers. I have had ance or a sheltered employment allowance. The dependants of these pensioners will also receive the benefit. The Government, and particularly the Minister, are to be congratusection of the Myer Emporium in Mellated on this move. The provision of these aids by the Commonwealth will be of great assistance both physically andfinanciallyto the individuals concerned. It will enable them to play a more active and valuable role in the community. As the Minister has said, it is planned to implement the scheme progressively oyer a 3-year period. It is estimated that during this time approximately 100,000 pensioners and their dependants will be tested and about 36,000 aids will befitted.The benefit which pensioners will receive from this scheme will be of great value. It will add considerably to the generous health benefits already provided by this Government. No doubt honourable members on both sides of the House have received a letter from the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, submitted on behalf of the Chambers of Commerce of Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, attacking the Government's scheme to hire hearing aids to pensioners for $10. The Chamber claims that pensioners now comprise from 50% to 70% of the hearing aid industry's customers and that the present move could bankrupt a large number of hearing aid retailers and importers. The Chamber states that the plan is a duplication of the service already provided and is a large scale interference with the present business. I discussed this matter with the Minister and he informed me that in the opinion of his Department pensioners account for only 20% of the retail market, and that as the Government will buy approximately $500,000 worth of hearing aid components from the industry each year, this will be some compensation to the industry. The industry states that these orders will go largely to one firm which manufacturers hearing aids and that the retailers will gain no benefit. It has been claimed by some people that the hearing aid industry has a large number of unscrupulous operators and that it has no code of ethics or professional standing. We have been told tales about improperly tested and fitted with one at an exorbitant price. This may be true in some cases. But it is also true that there are many representations from one of my constituents who is not a retailer. He is an employee of 17 years standing in thc hearing aid bourne. He is most upset and concerned at the accusations that have been levelled at the industry. I spent some time with him in the Myer Emporium hearing aid department. He stated that never once had he received any inducement or commission to sell hearing aids. He pointed out that many customers of his department at Myers are recommended to his company by prominent and reputable ear, nose and throat specialists in Melbourne. He told me that Myers run a free clinic one morning per week for pensioners and that in all cases prospective purchasers are recommendedfirstto consult their own doctor. In addition, Myers reduce by 10% the price of a hearing aid purchased by a pensioner. I am quite sure that the Myer Emporium will not be one of thefirmswhich could be bankrupted by this legislation, but I am concerned that smaller and reputable retailersI stress the word 'reputable'-wil l have their business cut by 20%. I know that the honourable member for Yarra and other honourable members opposite would be most concerned, as I would be, if wharf labourers or any other group of unionists were to have their income cut by 20%. I think it is wrong that Government legislation, as it were, by the sweep of a pen, should be allowed to affect the livelihood of reputable traders who are rendering a service to the community. The fact that a pensioner who previously had to pay from $150 to perhaps $300 for an aid can now obtain one under this scheme for $10 is a wonderful step forward; but I would like to see the system rearranged so that the livelihood of reputable retailers would not be affected, if this could be done without extra cost to the taxpayer. I have been told that the Oommonwealth Acoustic Laboratories can test a person, assemble a CalaidT from imported and locally made parts, and fit that person with the aid for $22. It can assemble a Calaid E, which is a more expensive and intricate aid and which fits wholly into the ear, for $35. If this is so, one must seriously doubt whether the CalaidT and CalaidE are high quality instruments worthy of the elderly people to whom they are to be provided. I stated that' I would like to see the scheme introduced with as little harmful effect on the reputable retailer as possible. However, my main concern tonight is with the pensioner. Those who have experience of the British national health scheme, be they British migrants or merely visitors to Britain, have all complained of its defects. They have pointed out that patients under the British socialised scheme are often treated as paupers and made to wait in queues and for long periods for appointments, but as the patients have little or no freedom of choice they can do nothing about it. Our Australian national health scheme re-arrange the system to preserve freedom however has none of these defects. Here in of choice for the pensioner.

He has not the right to go elsewhere. The Minister spent some time in his second reading speech pointing out the personal attention that the patient would receive from the laboratories' highly trained audiological psychologists, and the psychological after sales service that the patient would receive from the staff of the Commonwealth Accoustic Laboratories. I am afraid, Sir, that the Minister has more faith than I in human nature. Most of us, at some time or another, have received brusque or off-hand treatment from certain self-important doctors or employees in government departments. But under the Australian national health scheme if we are not satisfied we can go to another doctor. Under this Bill this right will be denied to the pensioner.

Those two visits 'reputable'-approve d by the Government, amount of the true price of the Government's cost of production of the CalaidT or the Calaid E. If a pensioner feels that the CalaidT or the CalaidE is not to his satisfaction he should be entitled to purchase a different aid and still receive the Commonwealth subsidy. This method would not cost the taxpayer any more than the present proposed scheme and it would have the advantage of protecting to some extent the livelihood of the small, reputable hearing aid retailer. But above all else, it would protect the freedom of choice and the dignity of the pensioner. I notice, as the honourable member for Grey( Mr Jessop) pointed out, that clause 3 sub-clause 2 of the Bill reads: The Minister may, through any acoustic least 30% to 40% of them-who , man laboratory established under the Acoustic Laboratories Act 1948 or in any other way, arrange for and wife, would not be able to raise the the supply by the Commonwealth of hearing aids $20 that would be required.

The honourable member for Deakin( Mr Jarman) has put up a pathetic plea on behalf of the retailers. During my experience can speak for himself, but I will introduce as a former State parliamentarian I gained the honourable member to thousands of knowledge of the purchasing powers on a them. collective basis of the New South Wales Department of Social Welfare and I know that it was possible to purchase spectacles from certain majorfirmsfor approximately best of reasons.

The point is that they Health (Dr Forbes) precisely what the Comwell know the benefits available to them monwealth will be paying for these hearing aids when they are finally assembled. I venture to say that it will be considerably less than the amount that the honourable member for Deakin mentioned in his speech and that there will be a considerable saving of Commonwealth revenue. Of course, we can expect at all times from this Government the principle of winkling out a little from the little man. His money goes in grants in aid under section 96 of the Constitution, it goes under the medical benefit scheme, and of course, the same principle is to be applied in this case. I give the Government credit for extracting the maximum political mileage out of this proposal. We welcome it. But there are many pensioners to my knowledgeI would say at why should they be asked to do it?

154,Mr Connor,"They came here for theunder the British scheme and they well know the imperfections of the present Commonwealth scheme. They are very real indeed. When the national health legislation was first introduced into this House the coverage was supposed to be 90%. It was not 100% because some little percentage of the cost had to be paid by the patient as a deterrent. As for the rest, the propaganda went, the account would be fully covered by the medical benefits fund plus a matching contribution from the National Government. Today not less than 32% of the account has to be paid by the contributor, 32.2% is paid by the Commonwealth and 35.5% is paid by the fund. Some 8,846,000 people representing 76% of the population are covered by the present national health scheme. Last year disbursements amounted to $43m. As an approximation, $5 a person is being paid for medical services over and above the contribution being made by medical benefits funds. For the average family of five, that represents $25 a year. Let us add to that the contribution that has to be made to get coverage for a bed in an intermediate ward of a hospital. According to the rate schedule of the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria the yearly contribution is $77.64, the weekly contribution being $1.57. Add to that the $25 which has to be paid for the defective coverage under the present medical benefits scheme and we find that it costs $104 a year or £1 a week to meet charges levied by the doctor and the hospital. None of this is included in the consumer price index. It represents nothing more or less than a diminution of the living standards which are supposed to be taken into account by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when fixing wages. Let us go back and see what Dr Earle Page, the then Minister for Health, had to say about this. honourable member is getting a little away ningham also made great play about from the context of the Bill. Mir CONNOR-The Bill has a schedule, tions. However, he did not mention that a matter of some twenty pages, which conthese contributions are deductible for taxatains a mass of statistics relating to benefits tion purposes, though I admit that this is that are to be paid under this Act. The title a minor matter. of the Bill is 'A Bill for an Act to amend the National Health Act. . . in respect of into this debate in something of a critical which Commonwealth benefits are payable*. SurelyI can proceed having regard to the title of the Bill. ber is quite correct in that, but I do not think this envisages a full debate on the whole national health scheme. within the ambit of the measure. The point which I feel I am entitled to make is that when Dr Earle Page introduced this measure in 1953-thi s appears on page 157 of Hansard of 12th November 1953-h e stated that full coverage of charges made by doctor and hospital could be obtained for 3s a week. In today's currency this would be 30c per week or $15.6 per year. Today, $77.64 is being paid. This represents a 400% increase in what the average family has to pay in contributions to a fund to receive coverage. In contrast, the basic wage has increased in the same period by about 80%. That is the point I wanted to make with regard to hearing aids. One other angle is the cost of batteries for hearing aids. A few people who were privUeged enough to be able to secure hearing aids under legislation from the New South Wales Government approached me as a State parliamentarian and were bitterly critical of the racket in respect of the excessive cost of batteries. I believe that the Commonwealth is remiss in its duty in not giving some attention to providing batteries at cost, and by-passing the racketeers. like to disagree with two points raised by the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor). The honourable member refers to the high incidence of migrant population in his electorate and stated that these people were dissatisfied. I have a high percentage of migrants in my electorate of the sort he mentioned, and I do not find that this situation exists.

158,Mr Mcleay (Boothby) [11.7],"I wouldway, I support the Bill. At the same time, I feel disturbed, because I consider that the Bill has gone very close to being at least Sn some part a socialisation measuresocialisation of the hearing aid industry. I feel compelled to say something about this. But I realise that by opposing the BillI went quite close to doing this on these groundsI would be penalising the people who need to be helped. Nevertheless, I have two or three criticisms that I would like to direct to the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) who is at the table. Firstly, I was unable to find any reference in his second reading speech to the hearing aid industry at all or any indication that the industry may at some time in the future be given an opportunity to take part in this measure. Also, I could not find any recognition of the qualifications of audiometrists employed in the industry. I am sure that the Minister would agree with me that there must be as many, if not more, capable audiometrists not employed by the Commonwealth as are employed by it. I find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Cunningham on another point. This is the question of cost. It seemed to me that there could have been more investigation of the cost scheme. No mention was made, for example, of the cost of examinations and of the cost of the aids themselves. I could find no reference to the actual capita] cost of setting up and staffing the government clinics. We might face the danger here of the operation of Parkinson's law, with the Department of Health being built up into an even bigger bureaucracy. I do not like the idea of monopolistic, bureaucratic clinics with the inevitable development of the attitude of government charity, with no freedom of choice whatever for pensioners. This aspect was mentioned in detail by the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Jarman). At the same time, I would like to urge tbe industry to take steps to put itself in order. Certainly it should give consideration to the qualifications necessary to practice in increase the pension directly. I make that thisfield.I would like the industry to make some move towards setting up courses at a tertiary level. Possibly these could be given at the institutes of technology. I understand this has been done in New South Wales but only to a limited degree. It was attempted in South Australia but I believe that lack of funds prevented it from being successful. If we could persuade the industry to arrange these courses along similar lines to those established by the dental and other professions, it would be a move towards recognition. At the same time, if and when these courses are established, I would like to see them uniform so that there would be no problem about reciprocity as there is in otherfields,such as the medical, dental and pharmaceutical professions. There should be identical syllabuses. I urge the Minister for Health and the Government at least to leave the door open for the industry to act in the future. The Minister referred in his speech to the way in which a pensioner will consult his own doctor, obtain a prescription and then go to the Commonwealth Accoustic Laboratories for a detailed examination. I would like to see the day come when pensioners have the choice of going to a private clinic instead of a Commonwealth organisation. 1 think the industry would agree to the Government imposing reasonable conditions so long as it provided for this free choice. I admit that this is not possible now but it could be possible in the future. I believe that all practitioners, whether employed by the Government or not, ultimately should graduate from the sort of course I have described. I cannot believe that the services of psychologists are necessary, as mentioned by the Minister in his second reading speech. I believe that the use of psychologists would involve a wastage of professional skill. I do not wish to speak for too long in this debate but I want to point out the dangers that there are, in my opinion, in the practice of regularly expanding fringe benefits associated with our social services programme. If we expand fringe benefits the opportunity is lost to make direct increases in pension payments because the money is not available. I understand that it costs the Government $73m for every $1 increase in the pension. The more we increase the fringe benefits, such as the one we are discussing, the less we are able to suggestion to the Minister and to the Government. There may be some merit in giving pensioners the opportunity in future to decide on an order of priority and not leave this for the Government. I support the Bill. I am glad to have had this opportunity of presenting these minor criticisms. support the Bill, but like the honourable honourable member for Deakin( Mr with hearing disabilities therefore needs Jarman) and the honourable member for Grey( Mr Jessop) I want to urge upon the Government some suggestions for improving the method of implementing this scheme. The purpose of the Bill is to assist pensioners by providing them with hearing aids in the manner outlined by earlier speakers. My concern, Mr Speaker, is not merely for the pensioners who will benefit under this legislation but for every person in the community who is suffering from some hearing disability and is in need of treatment, aid and assistance. Tn recent years there have been great advances in the assistance and relief which can be given to those affected by hearing disabilities. As to the age group which will benefit most from the proposal outlined in the Bill, the commonest complaint affecting the hearing of elderly people is osteosclerosis, which is a disfunction of parts of the middle ear which communicate the sound waves to the inner ear, where are situated the nerve ends which receive and transmit the signals to the brain. An operation known as stapes mobilisation can in many cases restore hearing to those suffering from this ailment. Tn recent years, with the tisk of infection following this delicate operation being reduced by the use of antibiotics, the operation has been performed in a larger proportion of cases than was formerly the case. The cost of the operation in Australia varies but it approximates $200. This includes the surgeon's fees and the cost of hospitalisation. The actual net cost of this operation to a person covered by medical and hospital benefits funds is of the order of $20. Those who are benefited by this operation do not need hearing aids and so do not have to incur the expense of purchasing batteries. In this way the advocates of the operation have come into direct competition with those who tecommend the use of hearing aids for blockages in hearing caused by the ailment to which I have referred. On the other hand, hearing aids themselves have been improved greatly in recent years, so that today a hearing aid is described by some as an extremely simple piece of electronic equipment. The use of transistors as substitutes for electronic valves has resulted in remarkable progress in hearing aid design. The care of those comprehensive examination. Various fields of research are open. Various skills are needed to assess a person's hearing needs. There is a requirement for specialist medical attention-for specialist doctors capable of diagnosing the ranges and sources of hearing difficulties, recommending remedies and providing the remedies if they involve surgery. in addition to those skilled in tbe physiology of the ear there is a need for persons skilled in audiology, the psychological discipline concerned with helping persons handicapped by deafness, ln this regard one should refer to the Minister's second reading speech, in which if is stated that of an estimated 100,000 pensioners who will be examined over the next 3 years only 36,000 will be helped by an aid because it will be found that none of the remainder would benefit from a hearing aid. But these people are not helped simply by being told that an aid will not assist them. They need counselling by trained experts, and audiologists are the experts best fitted to advise and assist people suffering from deafness to adjust themselves to their disability. In addition, in assessing a person's hearing needs there is a requirement for an auxiliary assistant known as an audiometrist, a person who can use an audiometer to make an assessment of the patient's hearing disabilities. In the main the experience of hearing aid salesmen is limited to the use of audiometers. Some, by experience, are trained in the ability to advise and counsel people. But on the information that is available it is quite clear that the assessment of a person's hearing requires the assistance of team advice from the medical practitioner, the psychologist and the auxiliary assistant who can use such maehines as the audiometer. Like other honourable members who have spoken in this debate, I hope that private specialists, private psychologists and private audiometrists will be used to assist in this scheme. If the present decision to use the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories, firstly, to assess a person's hearing needs and, secondly, to supply a hearing aid is due to the present position of the hearing aid industry, I hope that the industry will be given the opportunity to adjust to the",68,National Health Bill No 2 1967

160,"Member For Boothby ( Mr Mcleay), The","advances that have taken place in the science of remedying hearing disabilities. Today a hearing aid can be described as a useful tool and the hearing aid salesman can be described as being similar to the salesman of any other similar piece of equipment. I believe that the hearing aid industry itself could produce hearing aids of a like standard to that being produced by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories at a comparable and competitive price. The honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. P. Cairns) said in his remarks earlier in this debate that if the economics of the situation justified the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories in saying that they could produce the aid as well as assemble it more economically than at present they should enter into the productionfield.1 do not agree with that. But that argument can be applied in reverse. If private industry can provide a comparable aid at a competitive price, the Government and the Laboratories should provide aids from private industry. I urge the Minister for Health to use the power that will be conferred upon him by this Bill to provide hearing aids not merely through the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories but in any other way. I urge him to use that power to allow pensioners the choice of an assessment of their hearing needs by the Laboratories or by private medical specialists, psychologists and audiometrists, provided that those people are of proven ability equal to or higher than that of the staff of the Laboratories. I also urge the Minister to use that power to allow pensioners the choice of aids from the Laboratories or from private enterprise, provided that those offered by private enterprise are of a standard equal to or higher than that of the aids provided by the Laboratories and are available at a comparable price and on terms under which replacement parts will be available and adequate servicing facilities will be accessible to the people using-the aids over a sufficiently long period, so that the aids have an effective and useful life. I mentioned in opening that my concern was not merely for the pensioners who will benefit under this scheme but for all people who have a hearing disability. I believe that if the industry, the medical profession and the medical auxiliary services were given the incentive that would be provided by affording them an opportunity to assist in the provision of hearing aids for pensioners and in the assessment of the needs of pensioners, we wouldfindthat the standards of hearing aids and of our hearing medical services would rise. The whole community would benefit from the improved standards, and all those in need of advice and treatment for hearing disabilities would receive that advice and treatment in a way that would allow them freely to choose the person or persons to assess their needs and afford them freedom of choice in obtaining exactly the kind of hearing aid best suited to their requirements. I urge the Minister and the Government to consider earnestly the need to use the power to be conferred on the Minister by this measure to raise the standards of hearing aids and of hearing medical services available to the whole community, while at the same time maintaining the spirit of our national health scheme and giving to the patient freedom of choice in selecting his medical specialist. Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a few brief observations before this debate closes. The Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories have been rightly praised for the work that they have done. The annual report of the Commonwealth Director General of Health devotes an entire chapter to the Laboratories and anyone who has visited them or had anything to do with the services that they provide would be quick to defend the quality of their service and to emphasise the appreciation felt by those members of the public who may have received the benefit of that service. For these reasons, I have very much pleasure in mentioning the excellent work that has been done in testing patients who have been referred to the Laboratories and in supplying hearing aids, and particularly do I mention with much appreciation the splendid maintenance service that the Laboratories provide. So no-one can rightly say that my remarks are in any way derogatory of this government service. We are rightly proud of what the Laboratories have done and I have no doubt that the present high standards will be maintained in any service that the Laboratories give in the future. I express my appreciation to the Government for its having undertaken to extend a service of this kind to pensioners suffering from hearing disabilities. I did not speak in the",70,National Health Bill No 2 1967
161,Mr Cleaver (Swan) [11.27],"M rBudget debate and I now take this opportunity to say that I applauded this decision when the Government announced it. I support the Bill because it is designed to help pensioners. I now pass on quickly to the reasons why I have taken this opportunity to support my colleagues who have spoken with such intelligence and earnestness and who have demonstrated to the House that they have made a careful study of this measure and all that is behind it. I support those colleagues because they have presented to the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) and the Government a very genuine request that this scheme be considered carefully lest it expand too rapidly into a wider area. My colleagues have said that there are ways and means of doing the things that have to be done and I believe that they have advanced some very sound suggestions. I support those suggestions, because I believe that great care must be exercised lest a government department or some instrumentality of this kind move into a fairly wide field. We are not dealing here with a narrow, circumscribed area. We are dealing with a large percentage of the needy members of the community. When one starts to provide service in afieldlike this, there is a very great temptation to widen the field still further. I believe that as we move into this fairly wide area we are offering an exclusive service that will be provided by the Government, and virtually by the Government alone, to the detriment of technicians who are already in the field. I draw attention to the fact that the they have endeavoured to do this selling Minister in his quite balanced speech, which or service, and it has invariably been to we on this side support as we support the the pensioner group that the Government Bill, refers, as my colleague from Sturt now is desirous of assisting. SoI carry no ( Mr Wilson), mentioned, to the fact that banner for an industry that may have been of 100,000 pensioners who will be tested guilty of such action. I believe that my under this scheme some 36,000 will have philosophy, which I want to express, is still hearing aidsfitted.I ask a question in relathat which I and my colleagues on this tion to the differential because I believe that side of the House jealously would preserve, I must be fair and suggest that the people and that philosophy is that government already in the field have had this kind should demonstrate how a service or an of experience, testing many and not fitting industry should operate fairly within a comall.

There is a It is some restriction on this service, if it temptation, when a government instruis going to be exclusive, that I advocate. mentality is concerned, to say: 'We absorb all that. As long as we are honest and hopes. I hope, Sir, that provision will be compare the final cost of the instrument made for the hearing aid industry to partiwe fit with that criticised cost of the instrucipate in this subsidised pensioner scheme. I ment fitted by the existing industry, we must be fair.' Representations have been made to me that if the cost of the fitted instrument in the past-and in a moment I will come to the point of admitting that there have been some rackets in thisfield-has been criticised as being high, let us not forget that nobody else was able to absorb the cost of unproductive testing but the people who were supplying the instrument, having done the unproductive testing. My friend from Grey( Mr Jessop), who opened the debate from this side of the House with a very fine speech indeed, and also my colleague from Sturt, have drawn attention to the words in the Bill which indicate that the Minister may, through any acoustic laboratory established under this Act or in any other way-and this we underline-arrang e for the supply of hearing aids. I am keen that the Minister should give an undertaking, if at all possible, without any amendment of the Bill, because these are the words that will enable him to give such an undertaking, that he will use these words as the authority to consider desirable alternatives to expanding this government instrumentality without some provision for other people. I make the point, as I promised I would, that I seek no protection for any organisations which may have overcharged, misled, oversold, given poor service or misrepresented the hire purchase cost that might have related to a hearing aid, as I conclude with an enunciation of these hope that a scheme might be instituted to license consulting rooms already in existence throughout the country but subject to stringent standards to test pensioners and issue a specification for a suitable aid. I hope that encouragement might be given to the industiy to become more competitive in respect of the price of the aids that are now being offered not only to pensioners but to the general community. Surely we should try to influence the industry to register an association and set acceptable standards for the registration of audiometrists. This has been said before, and I simply underline the very sound suggestion. With the implementation of this Bill and the operation in future months of this scheme I will be looking for co-operation on the part of the Government along the lines which I have suggested. I will certainly be one member from this side of the House who, with all the meticulous care of which I am capable, will look at the annual estimates of the Acoustic Laboratories as the next 3 or 4 years pass. I will carefuUy analyse the growth of the Laboratories. There is reference to the proposed estabUshment of some thirty-nine centres. I wiU be inquiring as to how many more centres are necessary and the cost of them. I will be looking carereferred to the cost of batteries. Batteries fuUy at the honestly calculated cost of every hearing aid supplied and at the cost of the organisation conducted by the Government to make those hearing aids available to pensioners. Dr FORBES (Barker-Minister for Health) [11.36]-in replyI thank honourable members for the support they have given to this Bill. Although some criticisms have been voiced about the provisions of the Bill, everybody is agreed that it will provide a section of our community with something of which they are greatly in need. This is .the reason for the Government's introduction of the legislation. The Government looked carefully at the problems facing pensioners in the health field. After closely examining all aspects of pensioner health services the Government decided that pensioners most in need of assistance were those suffering from less of hearing. These people suffer not only in the economic sense but also in the social sense. A person affected by loss of hearing who cannot remedy his deficiency loses in a very real sense his conof what we are doing in this sphere but tact with others in the social group in which he lives. In other words, he loses the thing that makes for a happy and satisfactory life. A lot of emphasis has been placed on the economic factor. This matter has weighed heavily with the Government but in addition the Government had regard to the very real social benefits that would be conferred on pensioners by this legislation. The honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) asked whether a pensioner who returned a hearing aid to the Laboratories for one reason or another would be refunded his $10. The answer is no. We did not envisage this situation. The sum of $10 is a hiring charge for the aid. We felt that it was reasonable that this sum should go to the Laboratories. The honourable member asked whether special consideration could be given to pensioners who established that the payment of the sum of $10 would inflict a real hardship on them. We propose administratively to deal with such cases. Where a pensioner claims that payment of the charge will cause serious hardship to him the case may, at the discretion of the Laboratories, be referred to the Department of Social Services for a determination as to whether the charge should be reduced or remitted. The honourable member also for the CalaidE hearing aid, with which it is envisaged 75% of pensioners will be fitted, are at present obtainable from hearing aid dealers and agents. These batteries cost about 33c each. The total cost of these batteries to the pensioner each year should not exceed $12. The CalaidT batteries can be purchased from retail stores and are not restricted to hearing aid retailers. Each battery costs 15c and the total cost of these batteries to a pensioner in a year should not exceed $4. So, the annual cost for the CalaidE battery should be $12 and for the Calaid T, $4. This would be the average figure. In the view of the Government it is fair and reasonable for the pensioner to bear costs of this order for the replacement of the batteries. The honourable member for Yarra also asked what will happen to the variousvery limited, I might say-Stat e schemes which exist in respect to the provision of hearing aids. AllI can say about that matter is that I have advised each State Minister at this stage details are not available as to what modifications to their own schemes the States propose. However, I expect very little difficulty in arriving at machinery for the provision of hearing aids to the hest advantage of the pensioners concerned. I should imagine that we probably will discuss this matter at the next conference of Commonwealth and State Health Ministers. The honourable member for Yarra also asked what would be the position of people in country areas and whether we were going to bear the cost of travel for tests. As I think I have already indicated, it is proposed to establish a number of centresboth permanent visiting centres and temporary visiting centres-throughou t the country areas of Australia. These will be selected on the basis of the distribution of the pensioner population. The centres will be reasonably accessible to most pensioners in Australia. It is not proposed therefore that the Commonwealth will meet any of the transport costs which ase incurred by pensioners in going from their homes to testing centres. HereI would point out that, traditionally, State governments have had the responsibility of assisting pensioners where costs are excessive for this type of service. No alteration to this practice is proposed in this case. Lastly, the honourable member for Yarra raised the question of the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories assuming responsibility for all manufacturing and assembling operations in connection with the production of Calaids. This of course has been examined as a normal exercise in prudence by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories but we are convinced that the present method of having assembly operations performed under contract is more economical and efficient than it could be if the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories were to undertake the whole of this operation. Quite apart from that, I would say categorically on behalf of the Government that the Government has no desire whatsoever to enter into this field. Indeed, as I said in my second reading speechand to some extent this is an answer to some of my friends on this side of the House who have been talking about Australian industry-w e hope that with the additional number of Calaids that will be involved under this scheme a greater incentive will be provided for Australian manufacturers to undertake tbe manufacture of parts which at present are imported and that the assembly operations wiU provide work also and will attract Australian manufacturers. In other words this is something that, looking at Australian industry in the broadest sense of the word, will benefit Australian industry. 1 point out that as far as I know the Calaids are the only aids which have Australian components and which are assembled in AustraUa. AU the aids provided commercially are fully imported. In conclusion I shaU answer generally a point made by my friends on this side of the chamber. They expressed the hopeabout which I am sympathetic-that we could find a way in which the hearing aid retailers could take part in this scheme. In dealing with the various points made by many honourable members perhaps I should reiterate that in performing its function of providing a hearing aid service for children the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories have developed a first class, integrated service comprising the counselling of deaf persons in regard to the nature of their disability, the extent to which they can be assisted by a hearing aid and, in appropriate cases, the testing of hearing and the fitting of an aid and subsequent maintenance. Many honourable members paid tribute to the Laboratories for this service. All these activities are undertaken by professionally trained persons and are directed not merely to the supply of an aid but to the overall task of giving a person with a hearing deficiency the maximum degree of assistance. The Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories service is much more comprehensive than that ordinarily given by commercial hearing aid organisations, and for this reason the Government thought that its objective of making the best service available to pensioners could be achieved only by the provision of the service through the Laboratories. At present the supply of hearing aids to the community is not subject to statutory requirements in relation to such matters as the maintenance of professional ethics, the standards of hearing aid performance and requirements for training of personnel for hearing tests, fitting and the maintenance of hearing aids. Statutory requirements in these matters would, of course, be a subject for State legislation. In observing that there are no statutory requirements in these matters, I make h clear that I am not suggesting that in general the standards observed by hearing aid suppliers are necessarily lower than they ought to be. However, the fact that standards in these matters are not laid down in legislation administered by an appropriate authority is one of the factors which the Government had to take into consideration in deciding on arrangements for the supply of hearing aids to pensioners. I assure the House that the standards in farce at the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories are fully in accord with the highest person in the community who was troubled standards which might be expected to be applied if legislation in this matter were introduced. In the course of discussions with me, representatives of commercial hearing aid suppliers have referred to their aspiration that statutory requirements on these lines should be introduced. I would certainly regard it as a worthwhile step forward if this were to happen. In a number of overseas countries special clinics are being developed at hospitals and other institutions whereby the community may secure proper counselling, bearing testing facilities and so on before the expense of purchasing a hearing aid is incurred. This type of development seems to me to be worthy of every encouragement, and I heartily agree with the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) in that respect. I should certainly like to see the general adoption, among hearing aid suppliers, hospital clinics and other interested organisations, of the principles foUowed by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories in relation to the supply of hearing aids to chUdren now to be extended to pensioners and their dependants. I am convinced that the general adoption of these principles would ultimately prove of tremendous benefit to every by a hearing deficiency. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Note: Any discrepancies between totals and sums of components are due to rounding. 3 and 5. In the period up to 1952-53, the formula employed for determining the annual amounts to be transferred from Consolidated Revenue to the National Welfare Fund produced amounts which greatly exceeded the exenditures from thc Fund. As a result, the balance in the Fund had increased to a substantial amount ($370.1m) by 30th June 1952. The Government decided in 1952 that, as from 1952-53, the annual amount to be transferred from Consolidated Revenue to the National Welfare Fund should be equal to the amount expended from the Fund in each year. At the same time, the Government decided not to vary the previous practice under which the balance hi the Fund was invested in 13753/67-if-[84 ) 4.

No. 652) Dr Patterson asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice: What total amounts of unemployment benefit were paid in the Sarina-Mackay-Proserpine District of Queensland in the six-month period from January to June in each of the last three years? able member's question is as follows: Amounts as shown hereunder were paid by way of unemployment benefit from the Mackay Regional Office of the Department of Social Services during the first six months of each of the last three years: 1965 1966 1967 These amounts include payments made in respect of some small centres in the Mackay region other than those mentioned by the honourable member. These amounts cannot easily be separated from the whole, but from experience, they comprise only a very small proportion. Commonwealth Aid Roads Payments (Quesdon No. 362) Mr Charles Jones asked the Treasurer, upon notice: Will he obtain from the State Governments the information on Commonwealth Aid Roads payments received by local authorities, which he did not give in answer to me on 19th May 1967 (Hansard, page 2479), in the same way as he obtained the information on Federal drought relief payments received by local authorities, which he gave in his answers to the honourable member for Dawson on lst September 1966 (page 754) and the honourable member for Werriwa on 28th October 1966 (page 2429)? ourable member's question is as follows: The drought relief payments to local authorities to which the honourable member referred were financed wholly from Commonwealth funds which were made available, for this purpose, to the two States concerned. In contrast to this, assistance provided by the States to local authorities in respect of roads is financed partly from Commonwealth funds and partly from the States' own resources. The provisions of the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1964 do not require the States to allocate any specific proportion of the grants received by them under the Act to local authorities and tbe extent to which roads assistance to local authorities is financed from the Commonwealth grants rather than a State's own resources differs from State to State. Moreover, a State may choose to provide assistance to its local authorities by direct expendiment by the Commonweal th-, Western Australia ture itself on road construction in the local authority areas rather than by payments to the authorities. Here again, practices differ from State to State. For example, some States meet the requirement that at least 40% of the Commonwealth grants must be spent on secondary roads in rural areas by paying to their local authorities amounts equivalent to almost the whole of the 40%, while other States meet it largely by direct expenditure on construction of such roads. Thus, it is not clear that significance could be attached to figures of payments of Commonwealth Aid Roads grants by the States to local authorities. In the circumstances I do not consider that an approach to the States to obtain figures of such payments to individual local authorities would be justified. However, I have set out in the table below the figures of total payments by each State to its local authorities in 1964-65 and 1965-66 from Commonwealth Aid Roads grants, as shown in returns submitted by tbe States in accordance $ with the requirements of the Commonwealth Aid .. .. 75,737 Roads Act 1964.

The Commonwealth has not provided any direct financial assistance during the past five years for the specific purpose of assisting with the general operation and upkeep of the leprosarium at Derby in Western Australia. The Commonwealth, however, assists the State of Western Australia, which is responsible for the cost of the operation and upkeep of the leprosarium, by way of financial assistance grants.
