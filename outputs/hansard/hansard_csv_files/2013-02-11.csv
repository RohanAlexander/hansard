This Labor the importance of this measure to the government has not made life easy for many Australian workers planning for their Australians planning their retirement and the retirement and, in light of all the fiddles and spectre of further changes still hangs over changes to the Australian superannuation their heads.

The industry is boosted by the give the impression that the coalition is compulsory nature of superannuation supportive of this government's constant contributions, currently at nine per cent-but fiddling, tinkering and threatening of legislated to increase to 12 per cent-and by additional taxation within the superannuation concessional tax treatment afforded to system-particularly of late as the savings in a superannuation fund. government seems to eye this superannuation There is only one measure from the nest egg as a way of addressing its enormous MRRT package that a coalition government budget shortfalls. will keep, despite the enormous shortfall in Many unexpected changes have been forecast MRRT revenue, and that is the made to Australia's superannuation system increase in compulsory superannuation from by a government driven by the need for nine to 12 per cent.

It Is A Reform That Follows The Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (15:50,"Icitizen's retirement, is in fact seized by the your control, as I will go on to explaingovernment and put into general tax revenue. payments have been made, in some cases, Regrettably, and quite extraordinarily, the just days before 30 June or days after 30 Rudd-Gillard Labor government has been June, with the result that the total amount content to let this situation fester for years being paid in a particular financial year while collecting tens of millions of dollars in exceeds an arbitrary limit and then very, very tax revenue in excess contributions tax each high rates of tax can apply. Let me explain year-much of that revenue collected how this can occur. The starting point is that essentially by tricking citizens. That is why the limit on concessional contributions into the coalition has moved an amendment to superannuation is $25,000 a year. I note that this bill which is designed to fix this this contribution limit has dropped very, very problem-which is designed to prevent sharply in the five-and-a-bit years of the citizens being tricked into paying punitive Rudd-Gillard government. For many citizens rates of taxation on monies which they it was $100,000; it is now $25,000. Of thought were going to contribute towards course, that sharp and continuing reduction their retirement income. in contribution limits has been a factor in I would like to speak to the amendment leading many citizens to be confused and and I want to make three points in the brief surprised and to find themselves time available to me this afternoon. Firstly, I inadvertently in a position where they have want to point out that the current rules are breached the contribution limits. The Ruddunfair and capricious in the way they Gillard government's poor administration of operate. Secondly, I want to highlight the the contribution limits has been a factor in fact that the Rudd-Gillard Labor government many citizens finding themselves caught up has allowed this situation to fester for a in this mess. number of years and has grabbed at revenue The second thing that happens is that, if which has been received from citizens under you make contributions which are intended a misunderstanding. An inadvertent error by to be in contact concessional contributions citizens has led to them paying excessive but exceed the $25,000 limit, then further rates of tax. Thirdly, the coalition, in the contributions are treated as incurring the amendment we are moving to the bill this excess concessional contributions tax of 31.5 afternoon, are proposing an effective and per cent. They then fall into your nonworkable solution to this problem. concessional contributions limit which is Let me turn, firstly, to the proposition that $150,000 in one year or $450,000 over three the current rules are unfair and capricious in years. The risk is that, if you are already at the way that they apply to citizens. When your non-concessional contributions limit, you state that a particular payment could then any dollar over the $25,000 which fails attract a rate of tax of up to 93 per cent, most to be treated as a concessional contribution Australians would be very, very surprised. picks up additional tax because you have They would be particularly surprised to learn also exceeded the non-concessional limit. I that you can be subject to a tax of up to 93 think you will agree it is crystal clear. Even per cent, not because you have made a as I explain it, it is very easy to see how deliberate attempt to obtain benefits to which Australians can inadvertently find you are not entitled but because, through themselves breaching these highly complex inadvertent error-and in some cases and technical rules. This is the situation that through factors which are wholly beyond a disturbingly large number of people find create, in any government, an urgency to fix themselves facing. it. You would have thought that no The key point is: you can breach these government would want to be in the position rules through no fault of your own, because, where it was, in essence, collecting taxes if a payment that you thought was going to from its citizens by trickery. But, be made by your employer by 30 June of a remarkably, the Rudd-Gillard Labor particular financial year ends up being made government has made no serious attempt to on 1 or 2 July, thus falling into the next fix this problem. Let us just look at the scale financial year, you can trip-wire these limits of this problem. In the 2008-09 financial in that next financial year. There is a whole year, 35,000 Australians breached the range of circumstances in which, for reasons contribution rules. By 2010-11 it was 50,954, wholly outside of your control, you can end and by 2011-12 it was 66,435 Australians up as an employee breaching these paying excess contributions tax-in many contribution limits. One situation is where an cases due to inadvertent error. And that individual has multiple employers and the dramatic increase from 35,000 to 66,000 in cap is breached without any possibility of three years is undoubtedly related to the fact rectification. Another possibility is where an that the Rudd-Gillard Labor government has employer contribution is a few days earlier systematically reduced contribution limits, or later than expected. There can also be the all the while incidentally, telling Australians situation of unexpected bonus payments or they were going to be doing the oppositeredundancy payments. So you might have all the while telling Australians that the developed a strategy to contribute up to the reduction to $25,000 was only temporary and $25,000 limit and no more, but then, that for those above 50 their contribution unexpectedly, you are made redundant, a limits would not be maintained at a low redundancy payment comes in during the level. financial year and then you are suddenly The Labor government, it is true, in 2010 rocketing through that contribution limit and passed some legislation which was designed that money, which ought to be your money, to give the commissioner a certain degree of is being seized as a very large percentage in discretion to deal with this matter. But the tax. Of course, another possibility is if a late degree of discretion is extremely limited. It voluntary contribution you intend to have is only available in respect of excess made in this financial year is not processed contributions of up to $10,000. What the by the superannuation fund or by your commissioner says is that citizens or financial institutional until the following taxpayers in that situation may be eligible for financial year.

And in explaining this problem would immediately 2011-12 the Rudd-Gillard government raised $174 million in excess contributions tax. It is So this is a large and growing problem-a clear that in significant measure some of this problem that the Rudd-Gillard government money has effectively been tricked out of has been quite happy to let fester. ordinary Australians seeking to comply with Will this measure have a budgetary the fiendishly complex rules governing impact? Potentially it will. I have indicated contributions and contribution limits, and that the revenue collected in the last full have found themselves-for reasons in many financial year was $174 million.

I us proposes and the challenges that will congratulate the Prime Minister and Minister confront us, particularly financial ones; and, Macklin, particularly, and thank them for thirdly, I would like to touch on a quibble I their work. (Time expired) have with the government regarding their designing governments from a blank sheet of matter, despite everyone's desire to put this paper today and determining what should be issue beyond partisanship. our priorities to fund from the taxes collected Let me start with the first item: the present from Australians, I think support for people state of disability support. I think everybody with disabilities would be among the highest. in this chamber knows that the system of Supporting people who, through no fault of support for Australians with disabilities is their own, are born with or acquire profound broken. The level of support a person with a disabilities must surely be one of the central disability receives can depend on numerous reasons for having a government. It must factors, such as what state they live in and surely be a mark of a modern and whether the disability is congenital or was compassionate society to be able to support acquired, and, if acquired, whether it was in such people. We do not collect taxes to put the workplace, in a motor vehicle accident or pink batts in people's roofs or to initiative in some other context. Workers gimmicks such as Fuelwatch or Grocery compensation and motor vehicle accident Watch. Rather, we collect taxes to do the insurance provide coverage in some states, things that cannot be done by individuals or but not all. But if you were born with a by civil society, such as public infrastructure, disability or acquired a disability later in life defence and environmental protection. I it can be a completely different story. What believe that support for those with that often means is incredibly long waiting disabilities, particularly profound disabilities, lists and queues to try to get some of the falls into the category where frequently their services you need. The result is that many needs cannot easily be met by family or by people with a disability are left without the civil society. assistance they need. This is a fundamental reason why I so Many people from my electorate have strongly support the concept of a national come to see me about the proposal for a disability insurance scheme, and it is one of national disability insurance scheme to the reasons why Tony Abbott says so discuss how it potentially would impact on strongly that the NDIS is an idea whose time them and their family. One such person was has come. The concept at least is to provide Adam Holleran, a 17-year-old man who adequate support for people with disabilities, came with his 22-year-old sister, Gemma regardless of how or when they acquired the Holleran, to speak to me about the disability disability. This will be the breakthrough of insurance scheme. Adam is a person with the scheme if it is properly funded and quite profound intellectual disabilities but is executed. still physically quite capable. He enjoys In the time. I have available today I would doing things such as horse riding and like to cover three points: firstly, the state of recreational activities such as swimming and disability support presently, and how an things like that.

This will enable the scheme to be Holleran said: properly launched and the agency to operate We need help now, not in two years, when the the launch in five trial sites across Australia, stress and strain has skyrocketed. Much more from July 2013. The first stage of the scheme needs to be done so that families get what they hopefully will benefit 20,000 people with a need and when they need it, and not after they disability, and their families and carers, reach the breaking point. living in South Australia, the ACT, I think the key point she raises there is that it Tasmania, the Hunter in NSW and in the is not just the key support for the individual Barwon area, near Geelong, in Victoria. The with the disability but, importantly, it is the trials will provide funding to individuals or support for the families, as well, who are organisations to help people with disability often desperately trying to do their absolute participate more fully in economic or social best to care for their loved one. I am often life through provision of an entitlement, told by older parents: 'I am not going to be enabling things such as aids, equipment, around forever, and my son or daughter I am supported accommodation or personal caring for will probably outlive us. Who is attendant care. An initial $1 billion has been going to look out for our child after that?' It set aside for these trials. is a very important question for them and While there is very strong support across one that they are greatly concerned about. the chamber for the desirability and concept We need a new system of support that is of the NDIS, the complexities of the scheme based on need rather than rationing, with the arise in the detail. For example, the core entitlement for support going to the mechanics of the scheme will be outlined in individual. The individual needs to be at the what are called the NDIS Rules, and these centre and in charge, able to pick the rules will specify and establish things such as supports, aids, equipment and service the eligibility and assessment criteria. The providers of their choice. This is the vision NDIS Rules consultation paper was released of the Productivity Commission's landmark late on Friday, 1 February, this year and report into long-term care and support for feedback closes on 1 March. I am concerned people with disability, and this is the vision that this is a remarkably short time period to of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. discuss what is a critical feature of the entire It is a vision that the coalition strongly NDIS-that is, the eligibility and assessment supports. criteria for who will be able to access the The bill in front of us does not itself scheme. The bill itself is very broad, defining deliver the vision of a national disability eligibility as someone with a permanent insurance scheme as outlined in the impairment which results in substantially Productivity Commission report. I think it is reduced functional capacity. How this is important to state this clearly, because I specifically defined will determine whether sometimes fear that expectations are being people can access the scheme, and the rules set by the government that cannot be met in consultation paper asks questions but does the near future. I think that is not a desirable not at this stage make any suggestions. The second challenge lies in marrying the Labor members, including the Prime existing state schemes with the new federal Minister and the minister, say that this is 'all schemes. Most disability support, as you about Labor values'. Well, with due respect, would be aware, currently operates through this is all about human values and I do not state schemes, and so it is critically think that anybody in this chamber can claim important to have state governments working jurisdiction over compassion and care for cooperatively with the federal government as those who are less fortunate than us. This the details are worked out-and that just scheme will probably take three to four terms adds an additional complexity when you, in to fully implement, and so we have a strong essence, have nine governments having to interest in ensuring that there is great work collectively and cooperatively together bipartisan support-not only at the federal to get this national scheme in place. level, but also at the state and territory levels. The third complexity is the cost. The To that end, the coalition has suggested that, government has allocated $1 billion over the in order to maintain that spirit of forward estimates for these initial trials, but bipartisanship and get the cooperation of the Productivity Commission says that $3.9 both the opposition and the government at billion is required initially. So there is a the same time and into the futureshortfall financially, and we are assuming regardless of who is in government and who that, following the passage of this bill, the is in opposition-we should establish an government will at least appropriate the NDIS implementation committee, chaired by additional funds in the upcoming May one person from the Labor Party and one budget. The full implementation of the person from the coalition. In that way, both scheme, though, is likely to cost closer to sides will always be engaged in the process about $10 billion per annum and, given the over what will probably be a decade-long state of the budget presently-in large deficit implementation process. I must say, I am and with a huge debt to pay off-funding disappointed that the government has sought this becomes so much more difficult. But we to not take up what I thought was a very need to do it. The fourth challenge is constructive offer and an offer which would implementation, and we need to ensure that see us through the terms of parliament in we have a rigorous implementation process front of us, when there may well be a so that mistakes are not made along the way. different government in power. In the last few minutes, let me touch on CanI finally just congratulate a few the third area that I wanted to speak on-and people for getting to the position we are now that was some quibbles which I have with with this scheme: firstly, all of those people the government in terms of how it has who suffer from a disability, or who have a approached the debate in relation to the loved one who suffers from a disability, who NDIS. I understand that the government is have been such strong advocates over the last proud to initiate the Productivity two years in pushing for this and getting it Commission report and to put this bill onto the agenda. Certainly the Every forward-and I commend Minister Shorten Australian Counts campaign, I think, has for the work that he has done to get to this been very effective. There have been many stage. But I think it is a disservice to the individuals in this parliament who have been disabilities community, and reflects poorly ardent supporters of it. I mentioned Bill on the government, when it seeks to Shorten. I should also mention the shadow politicise the scheme. Quite often we hear minister, Mitch Fifield, who I think has also, like Bill, done very good work in this area in he has always been a person in New South working with the disabilities community to Wales politics who was respected. ensure that we take their concerns on board. I recall when I was the member for Reid: The NDIS is an idea whose time has we had a very large disabled organisation come. This is the first stage with this bill and called Cumberland Industries based in there is still a lot of work in front of us. We Lidcombe, next to the Western Suburbs still have to find considerable funds to make rugby league ground of past years. Let us be it happen, but this bill represents a very good as kind as we can: that organisation first step. collapsed because of absolute and total (18:29): It is interesting to sometimes take a collapsed for other reasons. But it was an step back and actually watch some of these organisation which employed hundreds of debates and see the contributions by disabled people in a variety of work individuals who have a particular activity or companies.

Monday, 11 February 2013 Pearce Electorate: Australia Day Awards national honours are announced I cannot help but reflect on the thousands of men, women and children who make a voluntary contribution to their local community. Their generosity in sharing their time, talent and, often, money makes local communities better places to live. It was to acknowledge this contribution that I, early in my election to parliament, established the Pearce Australia Day Awards. Over the years, local people of all ages and from all walks of life have been nominated. This year, country people focus prominently although not exclusively, and 13 people were nominated for the Pearce Australia Day Awards. They are: Peter Winstanley, who established an after-hours justice of the peace signing service; Malcolm Roberts, who has been a justice of the peace in the town of Beverley since 1991 and who was awarded for over 12 years of volunteering in the town; Janny Harris, from York, has been responsible for leading a program to beautify the town and plant trees; Guydan Boyle, a young farmer in the district, raised over $100,000 for Kids Cancer Project and organised a separate big fundraiser for Zoe; Mark Palumbo has led a very successful York basketball team; Emily Mott-Hogan, head girl at the York District High School, had a year of achievements in sport, culture and citizenship and also won the high school citizenship award for 2012; Marshall Jones, a student who has mentored other sportspeople in tennis and basketball, the sport of his love, also received an award; Reilly Joyce is still at primary school and has provided a great role model through his swimming achievements; Jake Duperouzel showed outstanding commitment to the West Australian Water Ski Association and was the Western Australian under-17 champion; Adrian Lister was recognised for outstanding service to the York Golf Club; Sue Chapman was recognised for her achievements as a karate champion; Bernie Finestone organised the annual York children's Christmas street party, with great success; Tess Earnshaw donated her time and musical talent for the benefit of the local church and for community events. Each individual has achieved excellence in their own field of endeavour while demonstrating a strong commitment to positively shaping their local area. They are great role models for others, and their contributions make sure that their communities are great places to live, to work and to play. I extend my warm congratulations to all those who were nominated for the award.

220,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (10:30,"Every year as we celebrate Australia Day and themanagement at Smileys, and I again congratulate Lisa Godwin and the whole Smileys team for their winning program, which involved a thoughtfully designed and shared production of a beautiful picture book. The images in the book were a compilation of the children's colourings of the Smileys logo mascots, Sam and Sophie, which were sent to the children's friends and relatives around the world to be photographed and arranged in relatively exotic locations and then returned to the centre. Needless to say, the book was a hit, providing a rich learning experience for the kids and also acting as a wonderful community building initiative. The first couple of weeks of this parliamentary year coincide with the first fortnight of the school year in Western Australia, and I am very conscious that this is a time when many families get back into the rhythm and challenges of the work-school-childcare balance. That balance can be a difficult one, especially in the area of child care, and that is why this Labor government has worked hard to make the choices easier and more affordable, the services better and the whole framework of school and early childhood education more responsive to the needs of Australian families. I know that in my electorate of Fremantle there have been few more important reforms when it comes to supporting young families than the increase in the childcare rebate, from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs, and the almost doubling of the rebate, from $4,350 to $7,500. And, of course, the new National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care, introduced a year ago, is now operating to improve educator-to-child ratios, lift and support education and training for childcare educators, cut red tape for centre operators and provide more information and transparency for parents. This is a sector that relies to a great extent on the work and expertise of thousands of caring talented educators, many of whom are women. As with other sectors in which women are strongly represented, their vocational commitment tends not to be properly rewarded but, instead, leaned upon as a cost component that can be suppressed. This is not fair and it cannot continue. Educators, particularly in WA, cannot afford to live on the wages they receive and are being forced to leave the jobs they love and for which they are highly valued by parents who entrust their children to their care. As a supporter of the Big Steps campaign and as a person who knows that affordable, available, high-quality early childhood education is necessary if we are to liberate the productive energy and capacity in Australian families, with all the individual and community benefits this will bring, I know how important it is that there are professional wages and fair conditions for early childhood educators. I want to finish by acknowledging the role played by all the childcare centres in my electorate and by paying tribute to the operators and the early childhood educators who are giving so many kids such a caring and high-quality start to their learning journeys. Northern Australia leaking of the discussion paper on the development of Northern Australia. What this discussion paper sets out is, to me, only a natural extension of the evolution of our country.

221,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (10:36,"I would like to put a personal perspective on theAustralia it only makes sense that we do more in the tropics. But it is the relentless negativity of the Labor government which gets me the most. Straight away, the Assistant Treasurer, the member for Lindsay, ramped up the attack lines. He says there will be 'gold plated streets in Karratha'. He has obviously never driven the Bruce Highway! In an email to his Labor faithful followers, signed by David Bradbury as Assistant Treasurer, he says: You probably heard today about Tony Abbott's secret plan to put nearly 275,000 workers on notice. He wants to rip jobs and services from our cities and force hundreds of thousands of public servants to uproot their families and lives and move to northern Australia. What rubbish! This is the Assistant Treasurer. This is Wayne Swan's right-hand man; the man who would have the words 'I love Julia' tattooed on his arm if his wife would let him. He is standing in the House and also going on television telling all and sundry who will listen to him that he thinks development of the north is stupid. His words 'white elephant infrastructure' will surely be the death knell of his government in the north of the country. How dare he reap the benefits of what we bring to the table and then tell us it is a stupid idea to even consider this. This relentless negativity coming from this out-of-touch mob must stop. Even Tony Raggatt from the Townsville Bulletin seems unwilling to even consider this as an option. His article on the weekend had me completely flummoxed: he thinks it will never come to pass and doubts reign throughout, yet he cites the Ord River scheme, the Burdekin Dam and the rail line to Mount Isa as visionary. What must happen here is that we have to see where we can get the best return on government investment. In my region of North Queensland, around Townsville, we provide 0.8 per cent of the country's population and yet we provide nearly two per cent of the country's GDP. We continually punch above our weight, and we should be supported. If the future of the country depends on water, the Burdekin, Fitzroy and Ord systems must surely point the way forward. By the way, to the member for LindsayI say: we do not want to rip anyone out of the western suburbs of Sydney to live up north. We only want people who want to come. The rest can stay where they like. We want people who want to put in, not just take. Again, this is a discussion paper that we are talking about. Yes, the discussion should be serious, but it is about the next 30 years, not the next six months. Canberra Electorate: School Legends Awards Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (10:39): I am living proof of the transformative powers of education, so I spend as much time as possible engaging in the activities of schools in my electorate. In the first six months of my term I noticed there were plenty of awards for students who got straight As in maths or English or who excelled in sport, but there were no awards for those students who were what I call the quiet achievers. There was a real gap in the market for those students who overcome physical and personal challenges and yet still achieve their goals. In 2011, I introduced the School Legends awards. These go from the Little Legends awards for kindy students right through to the Member of Canberra awards for year 12 students. These awards were introduced as a result of the gap in the market that I saw. I noticed in 2011 when I first presented the awards that they were dominated by students who overcame physical challenges. There was many a tear shed when a little person, who had undergone brain surgery, emerged from the audience, yet still went to school and arrived with a big smile on their face despite the physical challenges that they had experienced. I also had a number of children who experience cerebral palsy and juvenile diabetes-all crippling diseases-yet they managed to overcome these physical challenges and arrive at school with smiles on their faces, happy to engage in activities and overcoming these challenges. This year was quite different. About 60 per cent of the students who received the awards had suffered significant personal challenges. It was a really marked contrast. I will talk about some tragic circumstances. The father of one of the boys I gave a legends award to had committed suicide early last year, and his mother had left him and his five brothers and sisters a few years earlier. As a result of the fact that his father had committed suicide all the siblings were with foster parents throughout Canberra. The boy turned up with his incredibly supportive foster parents and I met him and gave him his award. He is a mentor at one of the schools for the little refugee children, the kids from non-English-speaking backgrounds, and they just adored him. So, not only has this young man experienced an incredible personal challenge and overcome it but he is also mentoring those younger students who are also facing their own challenges in adjusting to a new culture. These are extraordinary young people who show resilience, courage and strength of character beyond their years. These awards boost self-confidence and self-esteem, and I have had incredibly positive feedback from parents and teachers. They are nominated by the school and they also send a very strong message that their school is watching out for them, aware of the challenges they are facing, supporting them and loving them. Sport reputation. It is something that has evolved over a century through the efforts of men like Bradman, women like Dawn Fraser, the great Murray Rose, Shane Gould, Dally Messenger, the Ella brothers, Arthur Beetson, Glenn McGrath, Rod Laver, Cathy Freeman and Greg Norman. The list goes on and on. Our reputation across the world is for hard play but fair play. It is a long and proud tradition. Every nation knows that if you come up against someone wearing the green and gold you will be in for one hell of a fight, but the guy or the woman wearing the green and gold will be playing it hard but fair. But last week, with one stage-managed press conference, that tradition and heritage has been destroyed across the globe. We now have the international media branding our entire nation as a nation of sporting cheats. At this press conference no sport, no club and no individual was named. It was simply a broad brush cast across the entire sporting landscape. Every single Australian sportsman and sportswoman has had this accusation brought against them. Simply by failing to give details they have labelled everyone as guilty. They have smeared every Australian sport. Until we get the full details every sport remains under suspicion. After these alarmist headlines, when we looked at the detail we found that the report the government relied on, which they called 'Australia's blackest sporting day' used weasel words such as 'maybe', 'could be' and 'suspected'. All we are left with is unspecified, hysterical assertions which slandered our athletes and our sporting institutions. No doubt, like any large group, there will be a percentage of wrongdoers. Some individuals will from time to time",214,Constituency Statements
222,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (10:42,"Australia has a long and proud sportingbend and even break the rules to maximise opportunities for themselves. And there should be an investigation; no-one disagrees with that. Why last week did we have such a media frenzy whipped up with a lavish and sensational media conference using sporting CEOs as props? This Labor government has done much damage to Australia but if it is found that last week their orchestrated emergency press conference was nothing other than a beat-up of a few isolated incidents or an orchestrated attempt to push Labor's other disasters off the front pages, I say God help the Labor Party because of the retribution they will receive from the Australian sporting community and lovers of sport. Camden Classic Carnival wish to note with appreciation the running of the 2013 Camden Classic Carnival on 3 February at Camden Oval in my electorate of Hindmarsh. I have spoken about the Camden Classic previously and I do so again today because it is an event that is held every year in my electorate, an event of considerable stature within the South Australian and even national athletics calendars. Camden Athletics Club runs a series of races which we outsiders collectively refer to as the Camden Classic, including races for under-14s, under-17s, under20s and over-35s. Distances range from 50 metres to the 1,600-metre race, and the actual Camden Classic is a 400-metre race for men. There is a women's Camden Classic also of 400 metres. These are the absolute highlights of the carnival. This year the winner of the men's Camden Classic was Matt Hargreaves of Victoria, who ran the distance in 48.41 seconds. That is an absolutely terrific time for the 400 metres at any level of competition. The women's Camden Classic was won by Yasmin Openshaw with a time of 54.64 seconds-again a great time at any level of competition. So congratulations to both Yasmin and Matt for their victorious wins in those two wonderful races. Camden Athletics Club has had a very proud history since its formation in 1931 and it is currently being well served by president, Shane Perry, vice-president Andrew Hreszczuk, secretary Frances Perry, and many others as well as the volunteers who give their time to ensure that they give to the community one of the greatest athletic races in our state of South Australia. One member of the Camden Athletics Club committee who is a terrific champion for athletics in our region and who volunteers for this wonderful event every year is Colin Rowston, who has spent countless hours organising and running the Camden Classic year after year over many years including this year. The gift of the Camden Classic that is given to the community by all members of the Camden Athletics Club and participants, considering the time and the energy given to this community event, is truly appreciated and all involved deserve our wholehearted appreciation. It is a wonderful event. On the Friday prior to the event there was a fundraiser barbecue which I attended, together with Mayor John Trainer and other members of council.

224,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (10:48,"I rise today to acknowledge the special contribution oflevels of volunteerism in Mitchell. We are particularly lucky to have people of the calibre who have received honours in this year's awards. I particularly think about people like Mr Wayne Merton AM, who since moving to the hills 50 years ago has been the state MP for Carlingford and Baulkham Hills and has had a career spanning 27 years. Mr Merton was the Minister for Justice and Emergency Services in the state government, one of the old-school, high-calibre state MPs who delivered so much for their community, and he became an icon in the hills district doing so many things for so many. I think of people like Jane Cooke OAM of Baulkham Hills, who has been awarded the Australia Medal for services to the sport of gymnastics and as an administrator. The Castle Hill RSL Gymnastics School has some extremely high-achieving children going on to be Olympians for Australia. Jane also serves on the Mitchell Sporting Champions Panel, and I am so grateful to her for all of the work that she does on behalf of our community. I think of Mrs Nancy Serg OAM of Baulkham Hills, given her work with the Maltese community. She started her work with this community in Australia in 1965 after she migrated to Australia from Malta at the age of 18. She has been so valuable in hosting community, theatrical and other events integrating Australians of Maltese background into our community so well, doing the work that government could never do. I think of Mrs Carolyn Gould OAM, who has had a great career in the cashmere industry, starting with two goats on her property which later developed into a whole herd of goats. She has been serving the Australian Cashmere Growers Association in so many capacities and in numerous other voluntary positions that I do not have time to recognise today. I think of Mrs Wandacita Day of Northmead for, and this reflects the great diversity of Australia, her work with the labour council and trade union. She fought to modernise the Woolworths workplace to make better work conditions and provide women with equal pay in line with that of male employees, something which is an anachronism today but was so important for people like Mrs Day to achieve at the time. There are so many others in our community who cannot be named today but also deserve recognition. Each year the Hills Shire Council recognises exceptional citizens, including Shirley Purser, the Hills Shire Council's senior citizen of the year, Alexander Roberts, the Hills Shire Council's young citizen of the year, Evelyn Lester, the new citizen of the year, Lionel Smith, awarded the local hero award, and Rick Gatenby, awarded the young hero award. Then, of course, there are the excellent volunteers of the calibre of Warren Bowden, of the Hills District Historical Society-which received the Hills Shire Council's community project of the year awardwith recognition for all the excellent work that he has done with the Castle Hill Heritage Park being one of the very genuine heritage sites that remain in Australia to be protected by government. All of these people deserve congratulations. They are fine contributors to our community and I congratulate all of them. Kings Langley Little Athletics Association Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (10:51): I rise this morning to mention the Kings Langley Little Athletics Association and a very important issue that they have raised with me, something for which I have recently received a response as to certain representations that I have made. I was contacted by Mick Parker, who is one of the officers of the Kings Langley Little Athletics Association, in November last year. He was alerting me to an article in one of the papers about cuts to education funding in New South Wales, $1.7 billion of cuts which I have spoken about in this place, and in particular their impact on sport. This is one issue that I think is incredibly important for our young people, in representing the young community, as I do. It was reported in the Daily Telegraph on 26 November: Representative state sport carnivals-which produced sporting legends like Ian Thorpe, Betty Cuthbert and Jana Pittman-are being threatened by the state government's $1.7 billion cut to the education budget … Kings Langley Little Athletics wrote to me expressing their concern about the impact of these cuts and specifically the impact they will have on young people, the impact on their volunteers and the loss of valuable social skills that are gained though sports participation. Mick Parker, from Kings Langley Little Athletics, wrote to me saying: School sport produces so many benefits for children, including confidence, the will to compete and try, and the making of friends and contacts some lasting many years. He wanted to specifically mention to me the pride that students take in wearing the 'Blue and Yellow State Jacket' if they are lucky enough to make it from the school competition all the way to the state carnivals. Mick and others are very concerned about these cuts with sport participation falling in some areas and the abolition of representative carnivals and all the associated benefits that would be lost. In the words of Mick: I hope you can do something about this … action that will affect so many children. I have received a response from the New South Wales education minister, who had palmed it off earlier. Initially I wrote to the minister responsible for sport and that got passed off to the minister responsible for education and then finally I received a response from the directorgeneral's department. I am concerned on a few fronts as firstly there is a typo, which you expect sometimes-no-one is perfect-but this is an education department. Also there is the fact that there is no attempt in this response to verify that school sport funding will be maintained. It actually says: On Tuesday, 11 September 2012, the Minister announced that the NSW Government had made some tough decisionsabout the education budget. But this is despite the fact that on 31 October last year the Auditor-General revealed that the NSW government had in fact made a $1 billion mistake in its sums, and its budget would actually be in surplus. There was no remedying the situation even after discovering a billion dollars in revenue. The O'Farrell government has refused to put this money back into the education budget that they have recently decimated. That is my fear for sport in New South Wales.

225,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (10:54,"Next Tuesday Territorians will commemorate the 1942constituents, including Mr Tom Lewis and Mr John Moyle, that I would do everything that I could to ensure that there was national recognition of the 1942 bombings of Darwin. After much groundwork and with assistance of the honourable Tony Abbott and the shadow minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, I moved a private members' motion on 20 September 2011 calling for a national recognition of the 1942 bombings of Darwin through a national day of significance. After some negotiations with the Gillard government, I amended my motion to call for a national day of observance for the 1942 Darwin bombings. As I attend this year's commemorations I will stand proud knowing that, despite being in opposition, I delivered on my promise to my community to push for 19 February each year to be recognised nationally. I am grateful for the support from the crossbenchers who understood how important this issue was and provided me with the necessary votes to put pressure on the Gillard Labor government to have this day recognised nationally. It is not surprising that the Gillard government and the former Henderson Northern Territory Labor government played politics with this important issue. We should not have expected anything less. As I have said previously, it was disappointing that Minister Snowdon, who has been in this place since 1987, played politics with this issue. He like his Territory Labor parliamentarians had an ample opportunity to have this day recognised nationally but they did not do that. I was in this place for only 12 months when I moved the motion on 20 September 2011 to get 19 February each year recognised as a national day of significance. At least now it is done. It was not about politics for me, it was about getting things done for my community-19 February recognised nationally as the day of observance for the 1942 Darwin bombings. Radioactive Waste and Minister for Small Business) (10:57): I want to speak behalf of the people of Kemps Creek and Western Sydney more generally about the Liberal Party's plans to dump radioactive waste in Western Sydney from Hunters Hill on Sydney's North Shore. By way of background, in the early part of this century there was an operation at Hunters Hill which meant radioactive waste was left there. This has been a controversial issue for some time. Before the state election, the Liberal Party made a clear and unequivocal commitment not to dump this waste in Western Sydney. Now the New South Wales Liberal government is planning to dump it at two places: Lidcombe and Kemps Creek in Western Sydney. Lidcombe is in the electorate of the honourable member for Reid and Kemps Creek is in my electorate. This is a clear breach of a commitment. The way through this is for Mr O'Farrell to claim that this is not radioactive waste. He said on the weekend that this is just soil. This raises a couple of issues. Firstly, if it is just soil, just leave it there. There is no need to bring it to Western Sydney. Secondly, if it is just soil and they want to move it to Kemps Creek, there should be a dump somewhere closer to where it is being taken from where it could be left, not transported all the way through Western Sydney and dumped at Kemps Creek and also at Lidcombe. If it is just soil, it could be dumped at any one of the number of tips that exist on Sydney's North Shore, but it is not just soil. If it is just soil, why does it need to be monitored at Kemps Creek for 300 years? It is some soil! The Premier is clearly in breach of his election commitment not to dump this waste at Kemps Creek and clearly treating Western Sydney like the North Shore's dumping ground. I",219,Constituency Statements
226,Mr Bowen (Mcmahon,"Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Researchheard the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, say at Lidcombe that Western Sydney was the Liberal's new heartland. Lidcombe, one of the places where they are going to dump radioactive waste, is very close to his electorate. It is not a heartland, it is a dumping ground. There is an opportunity for Mr O'Farrell to front the people of Kemps Creek and explain why he is doing this. We are holding a rally on 18 February at Kemps Creek sports club. Mr O'Farrell has been invited by me, the member for Lindsay, David Bradbury, and the member for Fowler, Chris Hayes, all of whose electorates are affected by this. We have invited him to front the people of Kemps Creek and the people of Western Sydney more broadly and explain his position. Other people who have come are the state Liberal members: the member for Mulgoa, Tanya Davies, who also promised not to do this, and the member for Smithfield, Andy Rohan, both of whom have been struck dumb on this issue. I am sure they did not lodge a submission. Three thousand people lodged a submission. I lodged a submission. Fairfield City Council and Penrith City Council are lodging submissions. But there has not been a word from either of the state Liberal members, who campaigned against this strongly before the electionparticularly Tanya Davies-but have not said one word to stand up for their electorates against their own government, to their shame. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded.

Life was much less frenetic yet in so many ways far tougher, especially in country areas. As much as 42 per cent of the Australian population lived in the regions then, compared with only one-tenth today. Labor's Andrew Fisher was in the second of his three stints as Prime Minister, and James McGowen was serving as the very first Labor Premier of New South Wales. McGowen had a bit of ticker. His government carried out an active policy of subsidising hospitals and dispensaries in order to bring about the realisation of universal health care, and he took it upon himself to settle a gas workers strike by threatening to replace them with non-union labour. His public works minister, Arthur Griffith, conducted the celebrated turning on of the water at the Yanco regulator on 13 July 1912. This was obviously a government with a plan for the future-a far cry from now-because the Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme cost 25,374,000 pounds, which was quite an investment. Mr Griffith and two men who worked on the construction of the irrigation network, one of whom was Christopher Younger, winched open a sluicegate on the regulator to allow water to flow into the channels of the irrigation system for the first time. A contemporary report described the event thus: Mr Griffith said the irrigation land they hoped to open up was the best in the world, and this settlement should be as successful as any in America. It would be also an insurance to the Riverina pastoralists. Then he set to work at the winch and in a few moments, with a noise of cheers, a wave of muddy red water broke out and along the surface of the southern channel. It was a day of great joy for the district. It was the realisation of the vision of the pioneer dubbed 'the Father of the Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme', Samuel McCaughey. He was the first pastoralist to introduce large-scale irrigation to Australia. This Irish-born farmer's son landed in Melbourne in 1856 and headed bush immediately. In 1889 McCaughey purchased Yarrabee Station on Yanco Creek near Narrandera, in conjunction with his brother, John. In 1900 McCaughey bought North Yanco and at considerable cost built about 200 miles of channels and irrigated 40,000 acres. The success of this scheme prompted the New South Wales government to proceed with the dam at Burrinjuck, construction of which began in 1907. North Yanco, including the land on which the town of Leeton now stands, was later sold to the state for close to settlement. Early European visitors had not held out much hope for the district now known as the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. The Surveyor General of New South Wales, John Oxley, looking out from Mount Brogden in 1817 saw what he described as: … a country which, for barrenness and desolation, can I think have no equal. I believe I am the first white man to ever view this desolate landscape and believe I will likely be the last, there is little probability that these desolate plains will ever again be visited by civilised man. Charles Sturt was just as scathing in his 1829 assessment, yet within a century of these explorations life-giving water transformed once arid stretches into a fertile, bountiful region. Sir Samuel McCaughey, who was knighted in 1905, was right when he declared in 1909 that water was more precious than gold It is fitting that a statue of this remarkable man will be unveiled on 6 April in the Yanco park named in his memory.",221,Private Members Business
229,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (11:00,"I would like you to close your eyes and let yourThe centenary of the turning on of the water was celebrated in style with a re-enactment of the historical events. The weather for last year's commemoration was just the same as it was 100 years ago to the day: sunny but cold with a who's who of politics and the local community turning out en masse for the occasion. The band played, speeches were given and the water which gave this once-bleak landscape life to produce food and underpin not just the area's economy but, indeed, Australia's, was let flow. 'This is a ceremony of gratitude,' said Governor of New South Wales and Narrandera girl Marie Bashir in a marvellous and captivating address. Professor Bashir talked about how optimistic, energetic and committed the pioneers were and said that the 2012 event would be something everyone should be sure to tell their children about. She said: It's an emotional homecoming for me because I had the happiest of childhoods in this region. Here we are participating in a ceremony of gratitude for the vision, the sheer hard work and the determination to turn this region into a veritable Garden of Eden. This is a great Australian story – I can remember as a child coming to the farms at Leeton to get the fresh oranges and the wonderful apricots. The need for sensible water policy and to strengthen irrigation was also mentioned often and loudly at last year's memorable ceremony. The motion before the House acknowledges that the MIA was created to control and divert the flow of local river and creek systems for the purpose of food production and is today one of the most diverse and production regions in Australia, contributing more than $5 billion annually to the Australian economy. The Riverina towns of Coleambally, Leeton and Yanco and the city of Griffith, proud communities all, were purpose built and designed as part of the project and are now some of the most thriving and multicultural regional communities in Australia. Leeton takes its name from Charles Lee, who was Secretary for Public Works from 1904 to 1910, presiding over an extensive public works program including the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, Cataract Dam for Sydney's water supply, construction of Burrinjuck Dam and the creation of the purpose built, Walter Burley Griffin designed town named in Lee's honour. Griffith was named after the man who opened the gates on that great day in 1912. The Coleambally Irrigation Area scheme began in the 1950s with potential farmland made available through a ballot system. Those who entered the ballot had to establish that they were financially secure enough to set up a farm as none of the land had fencing or infrastructure. The successful ballot winners were also required to relinquish any other primary interests they had. For these hardy souls it would be all or nothing for Coleambally. In essence, that is the way it has been for this entire region. Riverina irrigators have always given their all, yet in recent years these marvellous family farmers have not been shown the same faith by the federal government. Members of this place should appreciate that irrigation underpins national and international food security. Further, they ought to know that our irrigation industry in Australia fulfils its role as the food bowl of Asia. It is important to build our food processing industry so it can supply Asia's growing consumer markets and develop the research, technologies and logistics which strengthen irrigation, grow high-yield crops and improve safety. Irrigation communities such as those in the Murrumbidgee and Coleambally areas as well as those in the southern Riverina around Deniliquin, of my colleague the member for Farrer, and the Goulburn-Murray of the member for Murray, need the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to be implemented in such a way that it does not destroy hard-won rights fought for and utilised to the betterment of this nation for more than a hundred years. The members for Farrer and Murray and I have argued passionately for a triple bottom line of social, economic and environmental outcomes during this 43rd Parliament as the basin plan neared its legislation. I moved to disallow the Basin Plan and had the motion seconded by the member for Murray. It was debated late afternoon on 29 November 2012, the last sitting day. The motion was lost, but it is better to have tried and failed than failed to have tried. Ten days earlier I had written to the Prime Minister, inviting her to visit the Riverina to address a public meeting to assure the good people there that the hard work they do to help feed our nation and others is valued and that there is a strong future for them after the plan is legislated. I am still waiting to hear back from her office. In her 3 May 2012 speech to the Global Foundation summit in Melbourne the Prime Minister spoke of strengthening irrigation. Her 28 October Asian century white paper acknowledges the huge role Australia has meeting the global food task in the years ahead. Australia is best placed geographically and economically and with our agriculture industry already well established to more than meet the growing demand for food in Asia. Happily, the Leader of the Opposition on 27 November 2012 made his strongest statement to date on water, saying a future coalition government would cap buyback at 1,500 gigalitres, meaning that with water already recovered there would be only 249 gigalitres to purchase basin-wide. Previously, the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries had announced a limit on buybacks of three per cent per valley per decade from 15 January 2013. These assurances were welcomed by Riverina irrigators and certainly every Griffith farmer, whom the Australian Farm Institute says feeds 150 Australians and 450 farmers each and every year. Just last Friday the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, in rejecting a bid by conservationists to lock out mining from Tasmania's Tarkine region, said: From purely environmental terms, it would have been something that would have been a wonderful thing to be able to do but you have to take into account the impact on people and taking that impact into account meant that I simply couldn't go with the Heritage Council's recommendations. As Elizabeth Stott, the wife of a Gogeldrie cotton farmer and a strident campaigner for fair water rights, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I heard those words come out of Minister Burke's mouth.' Unions strongly campaigned to allow mining. Australian Workers Union head, Paul Howes, said that the campaign to put the Tarkine region on the heritage register was run by mainland activists and would have been a disaster for Tasmania. Mr Howes further said: What the Federal Government has done today is a huge win for the people of Tasmania and also for the future of the economic development of north-west Tasmania which sorely needs more jobs … Given Tony Burke's alienation of irrigation communities during the Basin Plan process, an attitude many of my people saw as unfathomable and unconscionable, perhaps what was needed for their cause was to have the support of a trade union! Sadly, that seems to be the only thing which gets those on the other side moving. SoI call on the parliament to support this motion celebrating the centenary of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, I call on members to show their support for the people who put food on their table and I call on the Prime Minister to implement the commitment to strengthen irrigation, as promised nine months ago. the parliament. These are important issues that he raises; we all know the importance that water plays in our wide brown country-the very dry land that we have. The early farmers recognised that to survive in this naturally arid landscape the availability and control of our water systems and resources would be the key to successful food production. However, we live in a continent of extremely high rainfall variability, with long, severe droughts and massive floods, as we saw this year in Queensland. It is not as simple as just controlling and diverting rivers. We have to understand the changes in the water cycles over time and how we can drought-proof regions, and each enterprise within those regions, for those years when drought hits hardest. We have to understand and continually research how we can improve our water usage and storage but, by the same token, we need to ensure that the communities around the rivers survive as they help to keep our waterways healthy and productive. When the Prime Minister was talking at the Global Foundation Summit in Melbourne last year she said, when putting into context what had been quoted in the motion: … it's not just about more exports. It is about developing the systems and services that add extra value to them and participating in the development of a market-based solution to food security across the region. It would involve building our food processing industry so that it can supply Asia's growing consumer markets and developing the research, technologies and logistics that strengthen irrigationmake it better than it has been by using new technologies and being very innovativegrow higher yield crops and improve safety. So, while the Prime Minister is keen to see the research continue to further improve our production and the safety of our food, we cannot just continue to milk the Murray-Darling Basin without having a really good understanding and plan to ensure that we keep the river flowing too. Recently, I received a book from Vicky Cullen, the wife of the eminent scientist Peter Cullen, who passed away a year or so ago, entitled, This Land, Our Water: Water Challenges for the 21st Century. I had had some correspondence with Peter over the years, and I was very pleased to receive the book. It is a collection of papers by Peter Cullen and some associates. I think Peter, more than anyone, knew that the science behind water allocation in the past had often been based on European knowledge and that we should be developing our own knowledge on the basis of what is known about Australia here and now, about our own climatic conditions, our own lands and our own river systems. John Williams of the New South Wales Natural Resources Commission discussed this in his book on page 197: Peter operated within the firm appreciation of our highly variable climate driving droughts and also flooding rains. He knew that we must work hard to go forward with management that can yield river systems resilient to the shocks of drought as well as massive floods which are often amplified by our engineering interventions. He knew that to perform that management with current climate variability would challenge our science and our society. Further he knew that to add to this mix the impact of climate change, our climate variability and changed probabilities distribution of our rainfall would stretch us to our very limits. Of course, we see some of that constantly. He continues: The slow and difficult progress strongly suggests that he was correct.",222,Private Members Business
230,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11:10,"I thank the member for Riverina for bringing this motion toI would support the recognition of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area centenary as a significant milestone in the development of Australian agriculture and food production. That river basin has acted as a food bowl for the whole of Australia for a long time. I believe it has played an important role in underpinning national and international food security, but it is not the only area that needs to be recognised, improved and researched. Our water table, river flows and rainfall on the eastern side of Australia need to be continually monitored and understood. This government has introduced programs that have assisted and will continue to assist this process. In Tasmania, with the help of the state government, we have developed a series of irrigation schemes that will help the drought-prone areas of the Midlands and the east coast to become more self-reliant. Farmers have been persuaded to take part by investing in these schemes for the future on their own properties and many have undertaken to buy water rights. I believe there are still water rights that have not been completely taken up, but as the value of the scheme has become obvious I am sure they will be taken up. People are now starting to see the significance these rights can have for them in their enterprises. This is a recognition that Tasmania has a lot of rain. I think we have 10 per cent of the rainfall of the continent of Australia on 1½ to two per cent of the landmass. It is a natural advantage, although looking at the dryness and the fires we have at the moment you would not think that is the case; but it is the case. So we have a great natural advantage and we now have the opportunity to use this water in our irrigation schemes to help produce food and make sure the economics of food production work very well. Bringing water into areas that have been marginal has made a huge difference to the production of new lines, new crops and new ideas in Tasmania. These things are starting to open up and the water has given us the opportunity to open up bigger areas to produce more on a larger scale. Therefore those economics of size are working to benefit many people. This means a lot of jobs and a lot of opportunities, and a lot of these areas are in the great electorate of Lyons. I was very pleased that Mr Rudd, when Labor came to power, gave me the tick for this policy to come into being. The $140 million has been spent, along with the state contribution, in a very successful way. I am very pleased that farmers have been making their own investment in getting pivots and putting in infrastructure to make this become a reality. For many years the Murray-Darling Basin was treated as though each river system ended at the state boundaries-the state started where the system ended and started again. It is one system, and we need to look at it as a national system, but there are four states involved. I have often said that they should probably give Tasmanians the job-as the honest brokers without any need or self-interest-of sorting this out for everybody. It has been a long time getting to where we are with some of the ways forward. We do need to go forward, but we do need to recognise our history and the significance of this area. I am very pleased that you have brought forward the National Food Plan and the national plan into the future. I think we have great opportunities in Australia. Our food is safe and we have to continue that way. We have to meet the issues thrown up in the Asian century white paper. There are great opportunities for Australia into the future and we need to make sure that we get it right. But we do need to look at things that are contemporary for our own nation, such as what we know and what sciences we have, and utilise them for the future. I thank the member for Riverina for bringing this forward. Ms LEY (Farrer) (11:21): I am pleased to support my colleague the member for Riverina and commend his work in representative politics around water irrigation communities and the people in his electorate that matter so much. I look forward, following the remarks of the member opposite, to the government supporting this motion when we vote on it in the House. The value of agricultural production in my electorate of Farrer, part of the Murray-Darling Basin, is over $3 billion. The value of irrigated agriculture production is $1.8 billion-that is in the Murray and the Lower Darling. Those figures represent an enormous contribution to Australia's bottom line. People quote these figures, and I do too. We should also understand that they can increase, that we can do better and that we can, as farming methods improve, become much more productive. When the national debate turns to water and the politics of water, members who represent irrigated agriculture get very frustrated. I would like to go back to the beginning and quote some lines from Henry Lawson, who in the last years of his life spent some time in the Yanco irrigation area near Leeton, a prohibition zone. In his famous poem, which he revised at that time, called Up The Country, he wrote: I am back from up the country, up the country where I went Seeking for the Southern poets' land whereon to pitch my tent; I have shattered many idols out along the dusty track, Burnt a lot of fancy verses-and I'm glad that I am back. I believe the Southern poets' dream will not be realised Till the plains are irrigated and the land is humanised. The way the early explorers and poets would have seen inland Australia in the part of the southern Murray-Darling Basin that I represent would be nothing like it is today. Sometimes I think that there are people in Australia who do not understand the problem and would take us back to 13-inch rainfalls, scrub country, sheep and, clearly, towns which would be a fraction of their size. The member for Lyons quoted Peter Cullen, whom I have a lot of respect for and have met many times during the debates on water in this place. The irony is that, when we talk about the politics of water, the national plan as put forward by John Howard and supported by me as a member in this place was about taking the politics out of water. Unfortunately, that has not happened. The plan as it stands is very much expressed in terms of flows at the end of the system in the Lower Lakes. While I have no issue with determining relevant levels of water at that point in the system, I do know that it is a political imperative that has been described by the minister instead of a complete, holistic picture of environmental watering. They say, 'We will deliver this much water to the bottom of the system eight or nine years out of 10.' That is a political objective; so the government's plan has been distorted from the very beginning. I commend the motion to the House. I place on record in the strongest possible terms that the food-processing industry is vital to the people I represent; that value adding is something that we can do; and that the closer to the source of the primary product you do the value adding the more jobs and industry you get and the more efficient that activity. The Prime Minister gave a speech in a summit in Melbourne on 3 May 2012 and made a commitment to strengthen irrigation. I have seen no evidence of that. As the government responds to this motion by the member for Riverina, wouldn't it be good if the Prime Minister reconfirmed that commitment and talked about what it really means, in light of a very flawed Murray-Darling Basin Plan, to genuinely support the farmers and the food producers and the communities that represent irrigation in Australia today. As my colleague has said, our irrigation industry fulfils its role as the food bowl of Asia. When you consider what we could produce, how we could export that product and how we could jump up to a completely different level, the figures I quoted at the beginning of this speech could become history and we would have a much higher value of irrigated agricultural production. I support the motion before the House and I look forward to the government's enthusiastic response. Dr STONE (Murray) (11:26): I begin my remarks by commending the member for Riverina for putting forward this most important motion, which commemorates 100 years of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area being established. I think it is a little ironic that Labor have run out of speakers-they have no-one to speak to this motion right now. One of their objections to the motion is that it is to remind the Prime Minister of her commitment-so called-to 'strengthen irrigation'. She stated this on 3 May 2012. We can see their level of commitment by the fact they do not even have any more speakers to this motion in the House. I call on the Prime Minister to get serious about irrigated agriculture, because it is under extreme threat at the moment, compounded by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan but also by the carbon tax, which makes it prohibitive for anyone to use electricity or diesel, as our irrigators do. It puts an additional cost onto anyone trying to produce value for money when it comes to irrigated agriculture. Of course, this government is standing by, watching the dollar at current values make our exports non-competitive. It is standing by as we see labour prices going through the roof. Labour prices are exacerbated by the Labor government's failure to understand how penalty rates can kill off an industry which does not run nine to five, five days a week. Irrigated agriculture covers less than 0.5 per cent of land across Australia, but on that 0.5 per cent of land we produce 28 per cent of the total gross value of all agricultural production. That statistic speaks for itself. If that statistic reflected the comparative value of the automotive industry in Australia, or of some other propped-up industry that the Labor government prefers, then we would all be celebrating-but no. It is 0.5 per cent of land that, with irrigation, is producing nearly one-third of the gross value of agricultural production. I am shocked at what is happening in particular to irrigated agriculture in Victoria. As I celebrate with the member for Riverina the 100 years of the MIA, I point out that irrigation in Victoria began in 1886, some 30 years before it began in New South Wales. The irrigated agricultural area now managed by Goulburn-Murray Water involved a unique engineering feat which made use of gravity to take water from the south to the north, ultimately draining into the Murray River. It set about creating a densely populated great northern plains region in Victoria with irrigated dairy and fruit growing, supporting in turn some 23 food factories. Food manufacturing is, of course, extremely important in multiplying employment prospects in regional Australia. We now have the state-owned irrigation system managed by GoulburnMurray Water trumpeting the fact that we have gone down from the 1,900 gigalitres of water that was available for irrigation before 2007. Now we are down to 1,000 gigalitres. That is a loss of 900 gigalitres and there is an expectation that we will lose even more before the business of shutting down the irrigation system is complete. The object of Goulburn-Murray Water is to reduce the size of the irrigation system by some 50 per cent. They are going to reduce-as they call it-the 'footprint' by approximately 50 per cent, pushing it back to the backbone. That means that the vast majority of landowners who are on the spurs are going to be, against their will in too many cases, converted to stock and domestic water only. That kills productivity. It kills jobs. It kills communities. It kills the very reason that we put all of that effort into fertilising, genetic diversity and development of our livestock, because there would not be any water security to make sure that at the end of the day we can finish the product off and send it to the market. I have to say that this is a sad, sad era for irrigation in Australia. The Commonwealth government with its Murray-Darling Basin Plan has no sense of a triple-bottom-line approach. We could have had a great economic, social and environmental outcome if this government understood what was at stake and what was possible. Instead we see just attack upon attack on irrigated agriculture. Who knows where it will end-tragically in tears. I have no doubt there will be less production to meet that enormous food demand growing in the north of our region and fewer jobs in this country. Debate adjourned. Newstart Allowance Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Bandt: That this House acknowledges that the current level of Newstart is too low. this country who are on Newstart are living in poverty. We have had three reports telling us this. Most recently, there was the Senate inquiry that my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert was successful in establishing, which had the agreement of people including from the government benches telling us in its final report that Newstart is too low. We have got these very important reports telling us that it is too low and demonstrating how it is. But even some simple mental arithmetic done by anyone who is listening could tell you that it is too low at $246 for the single rate. Once you have put a roof over your head it leaves you next to nothing for the week. I tried to do this mental arithmetic myself and live without a few weeks ago. During that week I spoke to someone who had been homeless and had gone to a homeless service that found him a single bedroom in a rooming house in my electorate of Melbourne-for $180 to $220 for that single room alone. I looked around and found that the cheapest place you could find, a one-bedroom apartment in the city of Melbourne, was $240. Once you have taken rent assistance into account, that is $180 out of your $246 gone, just from putting a roof over your head. If you then agree that you are going to feed yourself on the generous sum of $7 or $8 a day, you are down to $4 left for the rest of the week. That is before you have paid any bills for electricity, water or gas. It is before you have paid to have a phone to keep connected to the rest of the world, or your internet to perhaps go and look for a job. It is certainly before you have done anything so luxurious as going to get a haircut or perhaps going to get yourself some clothes for a new job interview. So it is no wonder that it is not just the Greens, but also the welfare sector and the head of the Business Council of",225,Private Members Business
231,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (11:31,"Newstart is too low. The thousands of people aroundAustralia who are saying that it is now so low it is a barrier to people getting back into work, because you spend all your time just trying to survive and have no ability to improve yourself. Most people would expect that Newstart would be a safety net that holds you while you get back onto your own feet, but it is now so low that it is strangling people. Great numbers of people have told me that you either go into debt, or you rely on others, or you just go without basics like food or like new clothes. If we want to be a more caring society, we have to look after those who fall on hard times. Anyone could, through no fault of their own, find themselves out of a job through restructuring, for example, and there are many people in the south-east of Australia in the manufacturing, tourism and education sectors who are finding themselves in that situation in part because the government has failed to act on the pressures of the mining boom. You would hope that that person is then able to look after themselves and survive until they get back into the workforce. But this decision is pushing them further into debt and it is making it harder to get back into the workforce. There is a reason that we are here: Labor is not prepared to stand up to big business and raise the money we need to fund the services and the benefits that Australians expect from a civilised society. Labor in fact pushed single parents onto the dole from 1 January this year. They get an extra $3 a day to look after their kids, which is fantastic and magnanimous. You now have parents saying, 'The cost of sending the kids back to school is so high that I'm going to put my computer, the tool of my trade, into hock or I'm going to go further into debt because it's impossible to make ends meet.' Labor says that it is about getting people back to work. The single parents, who are affected the most, were the ones who were previously working the longest hours because the parenting payment test was more generous than Newstart. They were allowed to work extra hours. Some people are losing up to $140 a week. And when you have a kid to look after that is an enormous slug. In fact, as we found out last week, Labor are now taking more off single parents than they are going to raise from the mining tax. That is not right and those are not the values that people expect from a caring society. We need to acknowledge that Newstart is too low. We need to then say that we are going to have the courage to stand up to Gina Rinehart and make her pay her fair share. Then we will not need to slug single parents, we will not need to keep Newstart below the poverty line and we will not need to raise the taxes that other Australians have to pay. political career, I tend to agree with the member for Melbourne on some points-it will not happen very often. However, I do not agree on most of the solutions. It will not shock you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to learn that. The motion before us reads: That this House acknowledges that the current level of Newstart is too low. It is an interesting debating point. But it has no detail, no costings about exactly where the member for Melbourne thinks it should go or how much it will cost. Maybe that is one of the Treasury costings that they have been asked about, that they are running a protection racket on-and it is being prevented from being released. Mr Bandt interjecting-",229,Private Members Business
232,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (11:36,"In an extraordinarily unusual development in my very shortthem there. We just want to know what is in them. Maybe that is one of them. Mr Bandt interjectingthem out there today and we will know what they are. I thought the member for Melbourne's efforts of showmanship, a couple of weeks ago, claiming that he was living on Newstart reduced this debate-and what should be a serious debate-to a pathetic level. The point on which I agree with him is that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that we get the safety net right. One of the great strengths of our society is that we have a safety net for people. There is a legitimate argument about the level of a safety net and about whether there is an inconsistency in different payments in the system at this point which creates a disadvantage. I think they are reasonable points. But the member for Melbourne displayed a bit of political showmanship, claiming he was living on a certain amount of money when, quite obviously, each week in this position we as members of parliament are entitled to quite a generous taxpayer-funded salary and to benefits, such as membership of the Qantas Chairman's Club, which many people do not. I know the member for Melbourne attends that regularly as well, as he is entitled to. But to claim that you can somehow live on Newstart is, frankly, a joke and reduces what is an important debate that we should be having about the level of Newstart payments, which this motion seeks to raise, to a pathetic level. There is of course a reason that this allowance is called Newstart. It is designed to assist people who have, for whatever reason, fallen out of work and who are seeking to get back into the workforce for a period. We do not want people to be on Newstart for a long period. The member for Melbourne makes a good point that the allowance needs to ensure that people can survive and that they can use that allowance, in addition to other assistance they get such as training, and that people who need this money to help them reskill and get back into the workforce are able to. How that money is allocated, I think, needs to be reconsidered. But it is a two-way street. You cannot just expect that those who create jobs in society will pay more and more tax for those who are unwilling to go to their own extent to get themselves back into the workforce. There are issues in the economy at the moment as we go through a structural change where there are parts of the economy and parts of Australia where there are more jobs than there are in other parts of the economy. That requires, I think, job seekers, particularly younger people, to look at ways that they can better access employment in certain circumstances. So this is a two-way street. That is what we expect people to do, and that is why our plan that we will put to the Australian people before the 14 September election-of creating an economic environment where the private sector can create two million more jobs-will be an important aspect of this debate also, because we need an economic pie that is growing to ensure that people can get access to work and that we assist the economy to adapt to the structural change that is going on within it, which means that people who had presumed work in a certain industry some years ago which is not there now are able to change their skills, update their opportunities, get themselves back into the workforce and not be stuck on Newstart for a long period of time. That is because, no matter how much you increase Newstart-and it is an expensive thing to do as far as the government goes-you will never be able to put it to a level, and you never",230,Private Members Business
233,Mr Briggs,"Well, you released the costings. You go with Treasury-there are eight of",231,Private Members Business
234,Mr Briggs,"No, they are not. There are eight. You are hiding them, Adam. Just putwant it to be at a level, where people are living comfortably, because indeed the whole idea of it is to push people and encourage people back into the workforce. We on the coalition side want people to be in work which satisfies them and means that they are contributing to a strong and prosperous economy for the future. benefits for unemployed people and sick people and other special benefits in 1943, it did so against the backdrop of the Great Depression, where hundreds of thousands of people were thrown out of jobs for many, many months-in some instances years. The poverty and social dislocation and the hardship to families that resulted from that ensured that, when proposals came before the Curtin government in 1943, they received a very favourable reception. Of course, we were not the only country in the world to be introducing such schemes. In the 1920s the United Kingdom had introduced such a scheme, and in the 1930s a scheme had been introduced in the United States as well. What tied them all together was the common view that the No. 1 priority for governments should be to try and provide meaningful work for their citizens and that the benefits should be sufficient to provide a decent standard of dignity while somebody was looking for work and looking after their family in the same instances. That remains our priority today, and in Australia we are fortunate that there are now some 830,000 fewer people who are unemployed today than would have been had we not been elected to government in 2007-that is to say, we have created 830,000 new jobs in the Australian economy over that period. That should be our priority. In this country we have avoided the ravages of unemployment that have beset Europe, the United States and other similar economies around the world, because the government has done the right thing. We have spent where we have needed to spend to stimulate the economy, at the same time as looking after people who are in need. We have not ignored the problems of those people on Newstart, as the member for Melbourne would like to suggest. Indeed, at one point recently a $1 billion income support bonus scheme was introduced, providing $210 extra per year for eligible singles and $350 per year for most couples to assist them to meet increasing costs of living. That said, job creation and job protection will always be our higher priority. For example, on this side of the House we do not think you do anything to aid job security by making it easier to sack someone. We believe the best form of job security is providing decent industrial relations laws and a strong economy to ensure that businesses continue to protect people. Mr Briggs interjectingNewstart has fallen behind the level of other benefit payments. We have recently seen evidence and a report from a Senate committee which has inquired into the adequacy of government benefit payments, pensions, and the comparison rate between pensions and the Newstart allowance. We have had a number of expert witnesses provide evidence to the committee. The Salvation Army, for instance, told the Senate inquiry that the current system does not provide recipients with adequate income. Mission Australia provided similar evidence, pointing out that Newstart is less than half the Australian minimum wage. Anglicare said they believe this has become a barrier to assisting the long-term unemployed in the workforce, a sentiment echoed by organisations as diverse as ACOSS and the Business Council of Australia. What they are saying-and I think this is something that policy setters",231,Private Members Business
235,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (11:41,When the Curtin government introduced,232,Private Members Business
236,Mr Stephen Jones,"Very good, thank you. However, we also know that the level ofneed to be very mindful of-is that it actually costs money to look for work. If you are unable to pay for your basic utilities, a new suit or a new outfit, getting yourself prepared for interviews and travelling to job interviews, then the level of Newstart can be a barrier to those seeking work. That is why I think in the upcoming budget we should have a plan to address some of these issues. As I said, we have not been standing still, but we should have a plan to address these issues. Of course, it has to be funded, and it will not be achieved by cheap stunts like trying to live on a cheese sandwich for a couple of weeks. It will be done because we have got a positive plan to deal with the overall economy. Ms SAFFIN (Page-Government Whip) (11:46): I want to make a contribution on the Newstart discussion, and it is a matter of public record that it is something I have been speaking about for quite some time. My belief is that Newstart needs to be raised, and one of the things that I have to do as a member of a large party and as a member of government is persuade my colleagues to that view. Coming up to the budget this year, as I have said, this is something we should look at. When the single parent changes came in first of all under the Howard government and flowed on under Prime Minister Gillard, I said I did not have a problem with the policy per se. But what I do have a problem with is that Newstart, for anybody going onto it, is too low to live on. I have also said I would like to see Newstart change in other ways, particularly in helping people back into the workforce, and take account of local issues-transport, child care and all the different factors in different areas and regions. AndI have got some particular ones in the seat of Page that I am very mindful of. I have also made statements on Newstart. On 29 August 2012-and this has not really changed-I said that, according to a report published in March 2012 by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social research, the poverty line for a single person, including housing, is $341.80. Newstart falls $136 short of this-that is, for somebody who is on the absolute basic payment and not getting any other benefits. In 1997 Newstart was almost at parity with the age pension. While the age pension has experienced incremental increases and a historic increase under the federal Labor government-and its last increase was $33 per week in the 2012-13 budget-Newstart has fallen to only 65 per cent of the pension in just 15 years, with the gap between the two having widened to $106 per week. The age pension with supplements is at parity level with the poverty line, but Newstart falls well below the standard. Newstart is currently only 18 per cent of the average wage which, according to the OECD, makes it the second lowest unemployment benefit in the developed world. Living on $35 per day or $245 per week, as pointed out by Minister Shorten, is an incredibly difficult ask; that was on Sky News Agenda on 29 July 2012. Yet this is what is expected of Newstart recipients; this amount must stretch to cover all essential items. Those who have advocated reform include but are not limited to ACOSS, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Australia Institute, UnitingCare, the Salvation Army, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Australian Youth Affairs Coalition, COTA, Anglicare Australia and many people in this place, including some of my backbencher colleagues. The Newstart allowance is part of a broader package of support which includes a basic allowance, supplementary payments, Commonwealth rent assistance, concessions employment servicing and access to training, family tax benefits for those with children and assistance with child care. In the 2012-13 budget, the federal government announced additional measures to further help those in receipt of allowances, including investment to improve childcare assistance to help unemployed parents receive training and skills needed to enter the workforce, and a new supplementary allowance to help manage the unexpected costof-living expenses. This provides up to $210 for singles and $175 each for couples, and that is welcome, but we need the Newstart to be more. Other initiatives which supplement the allowance include the tripling of the tax-free threshold, intensive support for mature age job seekers et cetera. In my electorate of Page, I am talking to people who are on Newstart, and some people who are on the parenting pension who have gone onto Newstart, and I am trying to assist them there. I know that an increase in Newstart would go a long way to assisting those people. Debate adjourned. Iran Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Simpkins: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) the Islamic Republic of Iran will conduct Presidential elections on June 14 (Khordad 24 on the Iranian calendar) of 2013; (b) within Iran, political activists, journalist, and political opposition leaders are imprisoned, and often tortured, for attempting to express their freedom of speech, political and media freedom, and for attempting to hold their government accountable for its actions; and (c) Iran continues to refuse international inspectors free and unfettered access to its nuclear program and this raises suspicions that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons; (2) recognises that: (a) the upcoming Iranian elections will see Mahmoud Ahmadinejad replaced as President by another Supreme Leader endorsed candidate; (b) political prisoners being held in violation of human rights must be released as a first step towards holding free and fair elections; (c) Iran's potential acquisition of nuclear weapons poses a serious threat to the Middle Eastern region, and especially to Israel, and could lead to nuclear proliferation; and (d) the Government's decision in sending two senior officials to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Iran in August has potentially undermined efforts to isolate the nation, with Iran's Supreme Leader viewing the participation of nations from around the world at the NAM in Iran as affirmation of sanction failure and as a level of endorsement for Iran; and (3) calls for the: (a) release of political prisoners in Iran in order to take a step towards the nation conducting legitimate elections, and as an attempt to begin to resolve some of Iran's human rights issues; and (b) taking of all possible steps to increase sanctions and isolate the regime and pressure it to allow free and unfettered access to International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. ever, it is relevant to do so again. In 2009, US intelligence determined that, if Iran were in pursuit of nuclear weapons, they would be unlikely to achieve this capability before 2013. It is now 2013. It is a terrifying thought that a country as dangerous as Iran may have nuclear",232,Private Members Business
237,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11:52,"I have spoken on Iran in the past and, now more thancapabilities in just a matter of months. Many throw about the question of if Iran will obtain a nuclear weapon, but to my mind it is more a question of when. Iran's actions have raised undoubted suspicions that it has plans to become armed with nuclear weapons regardless of what authorities have actually stated. It has never been shy in showing off its military capabilities, in a subtle attempt to threaten its opposition. We must remember that Iran already has systems in place which can easily target long-distance enemies. All that is needed is for a nuclear warhead to be attached for it to be truly deadly on a massive scale. Perhaps it will soon be time for the US to pre-empt that threat with a strike against those facilities. In 2012, Iran boasted of a new long-range missile, Meshkat, with a 2,000-kilometre range. It has also announced plans to produce a missile-launching system, the Bavar 373. Even more recently, Iran has claimed that dozens of its drone aircraft have managed to penetrate Israeli airspace without detection, and they plan to produce more. Iran has not allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors full access to its facilities, with only selective access granted to locations usually dealing with energy or raw materials. I note that the agency are refused access to sites such as Parchin, which is a suspected military explosives testing site where weapons relating to research may be found. Due to the secretiveness of Iran's programs, there is a strong possibility that, even if it does not have a ready-to-go nuclear weapon, it would be likely to be in a position where it could assemble one on short notice. If Iran did acquire nuclear weapons, there would be devastating reciprocal effects across the region. Nations who are enemies of Iran, especially those who have been repeatedly threatened, such as Israel or Saudi Arabia, may be targeted, resulting in horrific consequences. Power plays would destabilise the Middle East. Some will form closer alliances with Iran to seek protection, while some may even take action to defend themselves against Iran and attempt to level the playing field by acquiring their own nuclear weapons. This will make pre-existing problems in the region even more difficult to resolve. The contradicting claims by Iranian authorities create uncertainty. Repeatedly, they claim to want to lead the Islamic world and to wipe their enemies-namely, Israel-off the face of the earth. Yet the Supreme Leader of Iran has officially stated that Iran is not seeking to obtain nuclear weapons capabilities, stating that the possession of them is a great sin from an intellectual and religious point of view. I do not believe him, as Shiah Islam has used a form of religious dissembling known as taqiyya throughout history. As Shiah Islam is the minority, they have in the past justified lying in order to protect the Shiah population and ideologies. Regardless of what has been said by authorities, actions speak far louder than words. If there truly is nothing to hide, why don't they just make the nuclear program accessible? This is unlikely. Iran has ignored international demands and sanctions for years. Their lust for power over their own people and their enemies outweighs their desire to comply. Iran has a sense of entitlement as the dominator in the region, which leads to fears that they are willing to go to extreme measures in acquiring this domination. For too long, Iran has positioned itself as the victim and continues to claim ancient conflicts between Shiah and Sunni denominations and even between Persian and Arabic ethnicities as justification for violence and hatred. Shiah belief portrays itself as being the little fish in the Arabic Sunni pond. Iran believes it is its responsibility to return to Persian dominance, as before the Arabisation of the region between the seventh and 14th centuries. So they view it as their right to spread the Shiah theocracy and to suppress the Sunni majority. This desire for control is not just for control over others. Within Iran, people are suppressed and they do not have basic human rights. This is a serious concern, especially as Iran claims to be a free and fair democratic nation. With Iranian elections due to occur in June, many are doubtful about how legitimate these will be. We only have to look back to 2009 to see how little honesty there is within the Iranian government and their elections. Despite there being strong support for the opposition, President Ahmadinejad's shocking win, with a two-thirds majority, points this out. The lack of true democracy in Iran prevents the nation from moving forward. Elections do not achieve real change in Iran, as it is not the President who acts as head of state; it is the Supreme Leader. He is Iran's highest political and religious figure, though he is not elected. He is instead appointed by a closed assembly of experts. While the President is elected in a popular vote, he is only one of a number of selected candidates approved by the guardian council, and that guardian council consists of six clerics appointed by the Supreme Leader, including him. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Supreme Leader holds that sort of control, showing that he holds almost a dictator-like power, and that the President is merely a puppet preapproved by the leader. Currently, 15 potential candidates have already been approved to stand for election. It is expected that the President will be even more compliant with the Supreme Leader's ideologies following the fallout between the leader and Ahmadinejad. This is not how a successful democracy should be run. This is not a democracy. These elections are not fair or legitimate. Opposition leaders are often denied approval to run as candidates and are often imprisoned for attempting to do so. Dozens of political activists and those supporting the opposition have been arrested. They are charged with exaggerated claims of espionage, propaganda or treason, amongst other things. Many are never formally charged and few receive a fair trial. There are even cases of those who are subject to abuse, torture and death at the hands of officials. There have also been human rights violations against those in the media, students, lawyers and civil and human rights activists. As of October 2011, there have been claims of at least 49 journalists and bloggers being held in prisons, for questioning the acts of the government. Attacks have been carried out on those who openly criticise the Iranian government, and authorities prevent people from partaking in peaceful demonstrations. There is no freedom of speech or expression in Iran, two things crucial to the running of a true and successful democracy. Extreme censorship measures are in place, with countless political news, analysis and blogging websites blocked within Iran-not to mention all social media sites, despite the irony of the Supreme Leader having both an Instagram and a Twitter account. Newspapers, blogs and independent journalists have routinely been shut down or been forced to endorse government bias and ideology. Iran goes to incredible lengths to suppress those attempting to hold them accountable. Authorities continue to deny the freedom of assembly and association in Iran. Activists and students are targeted for acting against national security and arrested for propaganda against the state. Students known, or even suspected, to be politically active may be denied access to graduate programs at state universities. There have also been numerous cases in which protesters have been killed, regardless of whether their protests were peaceful or not. Even the UN Secretary-General has called for an end to Iran's human rights violations. He has urged for the release of political prisoners in the lead-up to June in order for a fair and legitimate election. If political freedom is not established there will never be a true democracy. The UN continues to encourage nations to enforce and to strengthen sanctions against Iran, to put an end to the numerous human rights violations and to prevent their acquisition of nuclear weapons. These are steps that Australia needs to take. Yes, we do implement some UN Security Council resolutions which impose sanctions upon Iran and we have established our own autonomous sanctions, yet there is more to be done. In order to strengthen Australia's opposition to Iran and its government, everything needs to be done to show Australia's position. Sending envoys to the Non-Aligned Movement in August 2012 was a step in the wrong direction. The supreme leader claimed the success of the Non-Alignment Movement proves that the forced isolation and sanctions imposed on Iran have been unsuccessful. Simply by attending, Australia, who is not even a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, has reaffirmed those statements. It is my view that maintaining embassies in Australia for Iran and for Australia in Iran shows that Australia is still willing on some levels to communicate and work with Iran. This shows to Iran that Australia is not as serious as some in the isolation of that country. Israel has complete bans on travel and business with Iran, while the US has an almost entire economic ban. The United Kingdom has closed its embassy in Iran, as well as forcing the closure of Iran's embassy in the UK. Even more recently, Canada announced that it had severed all ties-mainly trade, political and economic-with Iran. These are the measures that the government needs to take to ensure Iran complies with sanctions. Putting pressure on Iran will be the only way to end human rights violations, to conduct free and legitimate elections and, most importantly, to prevent Iran from ever acquiring a nuclear weapon. We can only hope that the presidential elections will have more optimistic results than in 2009, but this cannot occur without the commitment by the international community encouraging Iran to do so. There are no easy or immediate solutions, but we cannot allow the attendance at the NAM to occur again. Iran cannot become a legitimate and functioning democracy overnight. It requires a commitment and the dedication of Australia and other nations around the world. (Time expired) grave threat that Iran's nuclear ambitions pose to the peace and security of the Middle East and of the world. In the past eight years under President Ahmadinejad and supreme spiritual guide, Khamenei, Iran has progressed steadily towards building deployable nuclear weapons. Iranian leaders, including the supreme religious leader Khamanei, repeatedly have called for the destruction of a member state of the United Nations: specifically, Israel. According to all of the international experts, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, they are moving towards acquiring nuclear weapons that would give them the capacity to carry out that threat. Of course, the member for Cowan is to be commended on this resolution. He has been speaking about their ballistic missile capacities which, together with the nuclear weapons",234,Private Members Business
238,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12:02,"I welcome this opportunity to speak about theacquisition, make it a truly frightening prospect for all people who are players in that part of the world. No rational statesman would talk about such an atrocity as wiping out a state of the United Nations, but I would suggest that the leader of Iran is not a rational statesman. In fact, he is a religious Shi'ite fanatic, and his rhetoric should be taken seriously. The New York Times on 7 February this year quoted him as saying, 'I am not a diplomat. I am a revolutionary, and speak frankly and directly. If anyone wants a return to the US dominance here'-and he was talking about the prospects of direct negotiations with the United States-'the people'-and he was talking about the Iranian people-'will grab his throat.' These are not the sentiments of a man who seeks to achieve peace for his country through negotiations with the democracy that is still the major superpower in the world, the United States. Both the US and the European Union have warned Iran that they will not allow such a threat to develop, and they have imposed severe economic sanctions on Iran. As chairman of the foreign affairs committee, in every European capital where I have had an opportunity to speak I have commended their foreign ministers, foreign ministries and foreign affairs committees on imposing those sanctions midyear. In fact, that was the key factor in the change in the severity of the economic sanctions in Iran, and the one that is making them pay attention. Iran now lacks even the capacity to refine petrol; the third largest oil producer has lost the technical capabilities and the access to rebuild their refineries. Let us just look at the effect of the sanctions: Iran's exports of oil had declined to about 1.25 million barrels as of December 2012, down from an average of 2.5 million the previous year. Considering that oil exports historically provided about 70 per cent of government revenue, this has had an astonishing effect on the Iranian economy. Iran's oil exports declined to about 940,000 barrels in July 2012, the month the EU's oil embargo came into effect. If you calculate the decline in oil exports at about $85 a barrel, this means a loss of $50 billion in hard currency in one year to the Iranian regime. So sanctions have certainly been very effective. The question is: are they working? As the member for Cowan pointed out, the current Iranian president's second term expires soon, and there will be elections in June. Iran's last elections in 2009 were shamelessly stolen-rigged-by Ahmadinejad and his street thugs in the Basij. It was very ominous for the Iranian people, who have never had this happen before, that suddenly all of the ballot boxes were seized by the interior ministry. Afterwards we saw the bloodbath as the people of Iran realised that the election was stolen from them and this theocratic regime had been kept in office. The prospects do not seem much better for this year's elections. The Economist reported recently that Iran's unelected supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is determined to get a new president who is completely compliant with his will. We do not know who that candidate will be. Ali Larijani, who has been one of the hardline negotiators on the nuclear matter, may be close enough to Khamenei to get his support. Khamenei and Ahmadinejad have fallen out in recent years. Ahmadinejad may run his own candidate against the ayatollah's nominee. There is one ray of hope: a reformist candidate, Mostafa Kavakebian, a professor of political science at Tehran university. He must be a very courageous man. After what happened in 2009 to the opposition forces in Iran, I am not optimistic about his chances. If the people of Iran peacefully brought about regime change, this would be the best way of halting Iran's march towards nuclear weapons and its aggressive policy to countries in the region. There are reports that Khamenei is concerned, however, about the damage the economic sanctions are doing to the Iranian economy, fearing it will weaken the Islamic republic's grip on power. We must approach this peacefully with strong diplomacy and the aggressive sanctions that are taking place. I note that the United States introduced new sanctions which will block countries that have exemptions to receive Iranian oil exports remitting those finances back to Iran. Iran can only buy goods from those countries, such as China. That is a further tightening of the sanctions that has happened only in the last few days. US President Obama has been very clear that the United States will not tolerate a nuclear Iran and he seems to have the full support of Europe on this. Remember, he declared in 2012: Iran's leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. There has been a lot of talk at the same time about the unilateral action by Israel against Iran's nuclear program. Perhaps we will learn more about that after the President of the United States visit to Israel in March, a development I certainly welcome. Israel has a clear right to defend itself against such profound, repeated and verbal as well as existential threats such as Iran's weapons program and ballistic missiles, but I hope it will not come to that. I hope the combination of diplomacy, including the fearless work of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and sanctions will eventually persuade the regime in Iran, whether it is Khamenei or the next president, that developing a nuclear weapon is not worth the risk. Australia understands that Iran's ambitions do not just threaten Israel; they threaten the whole region, particularly the West's allies-Saudi Arabia and Turkey. They are a threat to the Gulf States such as Kuwait and Bahrain, which Iran sees as part of its sphere of influence. In fact, Iran is a threat to the whole Sunni Arab world, where it seeks to establish a regional Shia hegemony, with allies in Syria and Iraq, and through its political robots, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. They are also a threat, obviously, to Europe and Japan and all of our friends in Asia, who rely heavily on Middle East oil. People who claim Realpolitik is a sort of muscular foreign policy ignore the Iranian regime's treatment of the Baha'i in Iran-the terrible persecution of that peaceful religionthe hanging of gay people in public squares, the judicial murder of children under 18, the kidnapping of foreign tourists as well as Iran's own intellectual elite. This all says something about the nature of the regime. Dealing with Iran as Dr Kissinger would have us deal with China, which is simply in terms of Realpolitik and ignoring the nature of the government of the country, is actually an effete foreign policy. It is an effete foreign policy because it does not take into account the intent of the regime, the nature of the regime or why a country like Iran will act in a non-rational way. Do we believe that the Soviet Union under Brezhnev or any of the people in the high communist period would have used nuclear weapons? Most people, even their enemies, regarded the Soviets as rational actors. That is why the Western world was able to deal with them. That is why, in the end, we did not face nuclear conflagration. With these people in Iran, there is a desire for a millenarian period in which Iran will dominate the world. It is important that there be a firm international stand against them; it is important that we all stand together. I hope that economic sanctions and firm diplomacy do work. I know that the President of the United States means what he says, and I hope they get that in Iran. There is one last point I would make to the member for Cowan: Australia does perform a very important role for the Western alliance in Tehran, and you need to consider that when you make comments or judgements about this matter. I am not referring to your understandable references to the NAM conference. Australia's diplomatic representation in Teheran is very important(Time expired) member for Cowan on the situation in Iran and the dire threat that Iran is to the international community. Let it be said that my friend and colleague the member for Cowan was a major in the Australian Army. He knows what the military repercussions are of Iran's threat to international peace and stability. I would also like to thank my colleague the member for Mitchell for speaking on this important motion. On 29 January 2002 GeorgeW Bush, the then President of the United States, said in his State of the Union address that there was an axis of evil. He was referring here to three countries: North Korea, Iraq and Iran. We know what transpired in Iraq, we know the threat that North Korea is to the world with its proliferation of WMD, and today we talk about the clear and present danger that Iran poses to the world. Let us remember: Iran is a terrorist state; it imprisons journalists; it has political prisoners; it supports Hezbollah; it has links to al-Qaeda and Hamas; and it continues to support the despotic regime in Damascus led by Assad, which has led to the deaths of more than 60,000 innocent people. Iran continues with its clandestine nuclear weapons program, and its President calls publicly for the destruction of another UN member state, namely, Israel. It does not matter what happens at these elections on 14 June this year in Iran; Iran will continue to pursue policies which are antithetical to the best interests of the world. We have a responsibility to speak out. We have a responsibility to use our chairmanship of the United Nations sanctions committee to do more to stop Iran-financial sanctions and sanctions about dual-use technology on both individuals and entities are critical. The facts that Iran's economy is in shambles, its rial has fallen to one-fifth of what it was and its oil and exports have been cut by half are good things. On Iran's human rights record, a tribunal at The Hague found that the Ayatollah and his coconspirators in the early eighties were responsible for the death of 20,000 political prisoners. More than 500 people of the Baha'i Faith have been arrested and some have been incarcerated for more than 10,000 days. There is no free speech; there is no free press-in fact, bloggers have been imprisoned. When it comes to terrorism, we have only learnt in recent days from Bulgaria that Hezbollah has been linked to the killing of five Israelis and a Bulgarian bus driver during an attack on Bulgarian soil on 18 July last year. There was an arrest in Cyprus of a Hezbollah operative. There has been a bombing of the Israeli defence envoy's car in India. Attacks have been thwarted in Thailand, Azerbaijan, Georgia and elsewhere, and all have links back to Iran. And, as I said, in Syria more than 60,000 people are dead.",237,Private Members Business
239,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong) (12:12,"I rise to support the motion put forward by theWhat concerns me most is the weapons of mass destruction program that Iran is undertaking. There is its sophisticated ballistic missile program; its serial non-compliance with successive UN resolutions, and its space program, which seems to be moving ahead in leaps and bounds. The danger if Iran gets a nuclear weapon is that it can carry through its threats to destroy another country. What is more, this will led to proliferation in the region, in Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, all of whom will seek to get weapons of mass destructionnot to mention the instability in the Gulf states and the Straits of Hormuz, through which so much of the world's shipping and oil exports go. There is a way forward. The P5 plus 1, which involves Germany, is one method, but know what is said-that a military solution is not off the table. It is time for Iran to come to the negotiation table, come clean with its nuclear weapons program and be a proper citizen of the world. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (12:17): In the late nineties, I worked on the Middle East desk in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. One of the professional highlights of that time was being involved in the normalisation of Australia's relationship with Iran. As a result of the Mykonos affair in the early nineties, our relationship had been relatively cool. We had a mission in Tehran, but the level of significant engagement and dialogue was limited. That all changed with the election of the reformist and liberalising President Khatami in 1997, with 70 per cent of the vote. Despite concern from some of our allies, the then Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer, led the first ministerial delegation to Iran in 1999, and I was part of that delegation. The delegation comprised a cross-section of the business community and we negotiated a number of agreements, including a banking and finance agreement, in which I took part. The Iran under President Khatami is very different from the Iran under President Ahmadinejad. While I am not in any way suggesting that we did not have any concerns with President Khatami's Iran-we did, particularly with regard to human rights-President Khatami's Iran was seeking to engage with the world. President Ahmadinejad's Iran is seeking to antagonise. The Iran of today is hawkish, to say the least, with its nuclear ambitions and human rights abuses, where journalists and political activists are being arbitrarily jailed, including President Ahmadinejad's media adviser recently, and public executions continue. Australia continues to raise concerns with Iran directly on these issues, here in Canberra and in Tehran. I also lament the fate of Iran's people, who are not just repressed by the Iranian political system but disenfranchised from it. These people-many of them bravely demonstrated after the 2009 election-live in fear of speaking out against the regime. Earlier this year, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told a gathering that politicians should not make claims or insinuate that previous Iranian elections were not free or fair. I presume he said this because there is an overwhelming belief that Iran does not hold free and fair elections. The Iranian leadership will not harbour any criticism of its electoral system, even though both the opposition candidates in the 2009 presidential race boldly stood up and said the vote was rigged. And what happened when these opposition candidates questioned the fairness of the elections? They were put under house arrest. Less than a month ago it was reported that Ayatollah Sobhani was calling for the general elections to be scrapped and the next president to be hand-picked. As analysts noted, this is probably a result of the fear within the Iranian leadership that the national protests and uprising that followed the far from free 2009 election will happen again. My heart goes out to the millions of Iranians who want to see fair elections with opposition parties able to robustly and openly campaign without intimidation, arrest or worse. Unfortunately, I cannot support the member's motion, because he has rejected an offer by the government to agree to stronger text condemning the Iranian government and our concerns about its nuclear ambitions and human rights record. This seems to boil down to one reference-the reference in the member's draft to Australia's participation at the NAM summit. Australian officials participate in this summit for good reason: to prosecute a broad range of Australian foreign policy interests with the international community. It is called dialogue. Officials did not participate in the NAM meetings themselves, were not present during any speeches by members of the Iranian government and met only with ministers and officials in the margins of this meeting. Australia's position on Iran has been clear and strong over several years and there is no basis for any claim that our efforts to isolate Iran have been compromised. Our robust sanctions measures, our public commentary and our role in the UN Security Council speak for themselves. We wanted to support this motion and could easily have achieved a bipartisan motion that represented our collective interests and concerns on this important issue. This is simply another example of the opposition compromising a very important foreign policy matter, a matter on which Australia has a strong record, in a vain attempt to score political points. excellent and timely motion and also the member for Kooyong on some fine remarks in relation to this matter. Taking up from the member for Canberra, and a little bit from the member for Melbourne Ports, I would say that there is a point of divergence in relation to this motion. However, it depends on your view of what you believe about the solutions to this terrorist state that is Iran. Do we believe that there will be a diplomatic solution that provides a solution to the Iranian question? Of course, the answer is, in my view, no, there will be no diplomatic solution to the question of this state. I think that is evident from the many, many years in Iran since the fall of the Shah. It is timely that this motion appear today, 11 February, because it is the 34th anniversary of the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We know that in that 34 years we have seen repression and we have seen terror. We have seen external threats to other nations and states and we have seen the treatment of their own people. The 2009 election of Ahmadinejad for the second time is perhaps the best example of this. That defeat of Mir Hossein Mousavi gave rise to the Green Movement, calling for democratic electoral reform. As a younger member here, it was inspiring to see the hundreds of thousands of people jumping onto social media, an invention of the West, in a desperate plea to do something about their own government repressing them. At the height of it, there were 100,000 tweets per hour on June 16, just after the election, climbing to 220,000 per hour, with the hashtag '#iranelection' being the most tweeted of the entire world in 2009. That should say that the Iranian people themselves are crying out for change, and it is the responsibility of the international community and free nations such as Australia to do whatever we can to help with this situation.",240,Private Members Business
240,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (12:22,"I want to commend the member for Cowan for thisOn 20 June we saw the young Iranian woman, identified as Neda Agha-Soltan, shot by the Basij and dying in front of the cameras on Kargar Avenue in Tehran. In today's world that footage alone reached many billions of people and did more for the cause of freedom than we could ever do speaking in this chamber. However, if we are to solve the problem of Iran, we need to be supporting the Iranian people and movements like the Green Movement. We need to be standing up for people like Neda. It is not the case that there will be a diplomatic or UN mandated solution to Iran. When you listen to the words of Ahmadinejad, who travels around the world threatening freedom-threatening Israel and calling for the complete obliteration of Israel; denying the Holocaust; attacking homosexuals; attacking free people all around the world-you can hear from his own mouth the state that Iran is in under Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Khamenei. Iran is perhaps the biggest security question of our age. Its attempt to acquire nuclear weapons and the nuclear proliferation of such a state ought to strike fear into any free nation. Not just the internal repression of regimes that we see around the world but this attempt to acquire nuclear capability for the purposes of executing a philosophy that is spouted by Ahmadinejad should strike fear into every member in this place. It is the coalition's view, of course, that the world community needs to continue to apply significant actual pressure onto states like Iran. That is why on 10 January this year, when Minister Bob Carr announced a new round of Australian autonomous sanctions against Iran, we welcomed them: the financial and travel sanctions on additional individuals and entities active in the oil, gas and financial sectors; anything related to Iran's weapons of mass destruction-things that every member of this place supports. We supported those calls from Senator Carr. We support any call from the Australian government to do those things. It is contrary to these initiatives that we saw in the second half of last year the Gillard government sending our Ambassador to the UN and the Prime Minister's special envoy to Iran to attend a meeting of the Non-aligned Movement. We do have a point of divergence on this. The member of Canberra said we are playing politics with this, but it is not the case. We have a legitimate view that engagement on that level with such a state that is attempting to acquire nuclear weapons for the purposes of executing its evil agenda is not helpful. We do not think it will work. The participation by some countries was used by the supreme leader to claim legitimacy and to affirm the failure of sanctions. That should be a signal to members opposite and everyone here that we ought to be doing everything we can to impose sanctions to support the very people of Iran-the Green Movement and people like Neda who have thrown their lives on the altar of freedom-to help find a free Iran in any way that we can. Non-aligned Movement. We have sent officials to the Non-aligned Movement as guests for some time, so there is nothing new in that. Senior officials have attended the last three Nonaligned Movement ministerial meetings: Special Envoy Joanna Hewitt at the meeting in Egypt in May 2012; the special envoy and the former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer in Indonesia in May 2011 and Belgrade in September 2011; and former foreign minister Stephen Smith at the last Non-aligned Movement summit in Egypt in 2009. The Non-aligned Movement has 120 members and is the largest regular gathering of countries outside the UN General Assembly.

241,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (12:27,"The member for Mitchell was talking about the question of Iran. This is a broad movement, a broad body, and it is important for Australia to attend. It is in our national interest and in the interests of diplomacy. Nobody supports Iran's current nuclear ambitions. Nobody supports its current position on foreign policy-its support of terrorists around the world, particularly in the Middle Eastand nobody supports the reign of terror that the current government of Iran imposes on its own people. We should be cognisant of not just the use of sanctions to prevent Iran's ambition to obtain a nuclear weapon but also the use of sanctions to improve Iran's human rights record. Of course, the two are inextricably linked. I think we will not remove the threat of Iran's nuclear weapon ambitions unless there is significant domestic reform in Iran-in particular, a movement to respect human rights and comply with international obligations, and starting a pathway to democracy. Iran has had a troubled history. It suffered under the Shah of Iran and suffered from foreign intervention during that period, and that led to the Islamic revolution. It is not often you see the people of a country swap one tyranny for another, but it does happen. We would hope that it never happen, but in this case they simply swapped the Shah of Iran and his secret police for a theocracy. Although it allows voting, and votes with some regularity, it is of course only for candidates that the theocracy approves of. There is a secret police and there is a revolutionary guard. People are regularly hauled off to jail, their human rights are violated, their personal freedoms are violated and crimes are committed upon them both by the state and its agents. In my mind, the announcement of Iran's nuclear ambitions are linked completely to its progress on the domestic front, and we should do everything-as the previous speaker saidto encourage the green revolution which began the movement to democracy in the Middle East but which sadly remains unfinished. I think the sooner that process can begin and continue the better. Debate adjourned. School Education Debate resumed on the motion by Ms Rishworth: That this House: (1) acknowledges the important work done by Mr David Gonski AC in conducting the first review into school funding and school education in almost 40 years; (2) recognises the transformative power of education and the importance of ensuring that we have a school system that provides all Australian children with a real chance to reach their full potential; (3) supports the principles emerging from this review which have been incorporated into the Government's National Plan for School Improvement, including the need to deliver; (a) a fairer school funding system based on the needs of every student in every classroom; (b) more support for schools and students who need it most; (c) quality teaching in every classroom; (d) more power in the hands of school principals; and (e) more information about school performance for parents and the community; and (4) recognises that the National Plan for School Improvement will build on the reforms the Government has already delivered to ensure every Australian school is a great school, including: (a) the construction of new and upgraded facilities at around 9,500 schools; (b) delivering record funding to support students with disability; and (c) working with States and Territories to deliver a national curriculum. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (12:32): This very important motion talks about the importance of giving every child everywhere in Australia a very good education. I believe that we do need to be having a very serious debate in this country about how we improve our schooling system. This motion acknowledges the important work done by David Gonski, who conducted the first review into school funding and school education in almost 40 years. It calls on the House to support the principles that have emerged from this. If we are going to move forward, we need to make sure that there is a bipartisan approach to this important issue. We learned from the review conducted by David Gonski that we are falling behind. Indeed, over the past decade, Australian students have fallen from second to seventh in reading and from fifth to 13th overall in maths. Those results are measured by the international PISA exam. We can see we are falling behind and we cannot allow this to happen. We can and we must do a lot better. The Australian government's National Plan for School Improvement sets out the goals for Australian schools to be in the top five in the world in reading, maths and science by 2025. It sets out an ambitious reform agenda to help us reach this target. It is no surprise that a Labor government is taking action to ensure that every Australian child has access to quality education. I am very passionate about this issue and, indeed, this is one of the issues that drove me into politics. I truly believe that if we can give our young people a good education, what it really does is provide them with a passport for the rest of their lives. It gives them a passport that allows them to go into different places, different areas, and different occupations-a whole range of opportunities that would not be open to them if they did not succeed and get a good education. It is very pleasing to me to be part of a government that understands the power of education to transform the lives of individualsand also the importance to our national economy of having a world-class education system. It is important to understand that we need to be competitive around the world. We can no longer just focus on living in Australia and think that we are not competing with the rest of the world. There is a global village out there and our citizens need to be educated and to be able to be the best they can be when they compete not just for jobs here in Australia but, indeed, for jobs right around the world. That is why it is so important that we do address this. It is not like our government has not done anything up to this point when it comes to education. There have been a significant number of reforms that I have been very proud of. I have often been concerned about the opposition and their negativity towards these reforms. Some of the things that we saw in the Building the Education Revolution program not only supported so many jobs in my electorate but have allowed for absolutely world-class facilities at these schools. I have 63 schools in my electorate and I have not been to one school that has said that their Building the Education Revolution building will not transform the way they are able to deliver education-whether it has been for science labs or language labs, or for new classrooms. That has been what many schools in my electorate have used this money for: new classrooms. Many were using demountable classrooms with no air-conditioning and no ability to have innovative space for teaching. The Building the Education Revolution has been an important improvement to our schools. Indeed, a digital education revolution has allowed for curricula to be brought online and be available for teachers-a resource for a whole range of things to enable students to really engage in the digital future. That has been really important. But we cannot stop and we need to continually improve. We want our school system to ensure that all Australian children have a real chance to reach their full potential. The quality of education a child receives throughout their lifetime will determine the opportunities and experiences that will become available to them. The National Plan for School Improvement is based on some core principles emerging from the Gonski review. It entails a set of ambitious reforms which will help to make the government's vision for a high-quality, high-equity education system a reality. Critically, the plan aims to introduce a new school funding system based on the recommendations of the review, including a benchmark amount per student which is based on the cost of schools that have already achieved great results. Extra money, or loadings, will also be made available to support school students who need it the most, including students from low-income families, Indigenous students, students with a disability, rural and remote students, students at small schools and students with limited English. This principle is critically important because we have heard so many times that there are students who fall through the cracks and they are often those with a disability, those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, or those that do not have access to the same resources as schoolchildren in more populous areas. It is so important that we do not say that everyone should just try and get on with what they have got. It is important that we recognise that these factors make a difference, and that extra funding is directed there to ensure that, no matter where you live or what your circumstances, you will be able to get a very good education. This government is very committed to this and I hope that the opposition will be part of this, because not only will it be looking at how we direct funding but it will also be looking at a higher standard for teachers with at least one term of classroom work experience before graduation-looking at the training for teachers going into the profession and an annual performance review for every teacher. What we do know-and this has been said by the Prime Minister many, many times-is that quality teaching is critically important. When I go to my local schools and see passionate teachers really putting in effort I see better results, more engaged students, better welfare for those students and better learning outcomes. I have seen some teachers working in very difficult circumstances without much support, but the quality of their teaching and innovation really help their students achieve. It is really important that we invest in our teachers, and that is why I am pleased that the government wants to deliver training to ensure that teachers get extra help in managing disruptive behaviours and dealing with bullying, so that every child in the classroom gets a chance to learn in a safe environment. Another important point of our reforms is more power for principals, like hiring staff and controlling the budget. There is also better MySchool information to make sure that no school falls behind in providing more information for parents, so they can see how their kids are doing. We have heard a lot of negativity from those opposite about MySchool and I think it is their policy to abolish it, but when I speak to parents in my electorate they tell me they find this an incredibly useful tool for looking at schools in their area. MySchool gives them information about schools and it is an important tool about which to ask the principal questions. In terms of transparency and empowering parents, MySchool is a very important tool and I urge the opposition to keep it going if they win government. It would be a bad policy to scrap this tool. I could keep talking about how important education reform is, but unfortunately my time is limited. This is an important next tranche of reform from this Labor government when it comes to education. It is so important that we pursue this, and I call on the opposition to take a bipartisan approach to education, so that we can ensure that future generations get the best opportunity they can. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (12:42): I can advise the coalition will not be opposing this motion. I agree with most of the context and the sentiments expressed in the motion, as put forward by the member for Kingston, especially sections 1, 2 and 3 which thank Mr Gonski for recognising the power of education over the lives of our children and express support for some of the principles that came out of the Gonski review. At the onset, I express my pride in representing an electorate that contains some of the most distinguished public, independent and Catholic schools in Queensland. The list is far too long to give, but I specifically mention New Farm State School led by principal Carmel McGrath. The school has produced outstanding results in recent years and is the winner of my annual literacy competition in the primary school category this year. Well done to New Farm State School. Out of the four winners and runners-up, two are from All Hallows' Catholic School, my old school, and one each from Oakleigh State School and New Farm State School. Through this competition I have witnessed first-hand the extraordinary writing talent of some of Brisbane's best and brightest young students. I am amazed by the intellectual capacity of these young individuals who represent the future of this great nation of ours. It is interesting we are debating this motion as the Australian Education Bill is commencing its passage through the House of Representatives. The Australian Education Bill contains nine pages and 1,400 words. It sets out aspirational goals and essentially achieves the same thing as this motion. They both express the aspirations and the views of the parliament, but they contain no detail. Because of the issue the government has with Gonski, it has not released any detail, so we do not know where the money is coming from and the government cannot outline how individual schools will be affected. It is all very well introducing bills and motions outlining principles and outlining goals that we are going to strive for, but the reality of the situation is that unless you know exactly, and unless you outline exactly, how the reform is going to be delivered and implemented then the talk will amount to absolutely zilch-nothing. Part3 of the motion states: (3) supports the principles emerging from this review which have been incorporated into the Government's National Plan for School Improvement, including the need to deliver; (a) a fairer school funding system based on the needs of every student in every classroom; (b) more support for schools and students who need it most; (c) quality teaching in every classroom; (d) more power in the hands of school principals; and (e) more information about school performance for parents and the community … I do not think you will find any members of this House who will disagree with those principles. As members of parliament and as leaders in our communities, of course we agree with those sentiments. Who wouldn't? But the devil, as always, is in the detail. How are we going to make sure that those principles equate to action and ground and real change in our schools? The coalition believe that the current quantum of funds for every school and indexation must be the basic starting point arising from any funding model. No school should lose funding as a result of a new funding model. The coalition also have our own set of principles that outline our values for schooling, including that families have the right to choose which school meets their needs, their values and their beliefs; that all children must have access and opportunity to a quality education; that student funding needs to be based on fair, objective and transparent criteria distributed according to socioeconomic need; that students with similar needs must be treated comparably throughout the course of their schooling; that as many decisions as possible should be made locally, right on the ground, by parents, communities, principals, teachers, schools and school systems-school sectors, school systems, must be accountable to their communities, families and students; and every Australian student must be entitled to a basic grant from the Commonwealth government; and that schools and parents must have a high degree of certainty about school funding so they can plan for the future and not be hit with any surprises. Parents who wish to make a private contribution towards the cost of their children's education should not be penalised, and nor should schools in their efforts to fundraise and encourage private investment. Funding arrangements must be simple so that schools are able to direct funding towards education outcomes, minimise administration costs and increase productivity and quality. Let me assure this House that I will fight every day to ensure that not one school in my electorate of Brisbane is worse off as a result of the changes made to education funding. I make this commitment to teachers and to parents of my electorate. Not one school will lose a dollar of funding in real terms under a coalition government-not one school. This is the commitment that I can give to every constituent. I would call on the Labor Party to make that very same commitment. As we know, the review panel chaired by David Gonski handed the final report on schooling to the government in December 2011. The main recommendation was to implement a new funding model, at an additional cost to all government areas of $6.5 billion per year. The panel's original proposal was that the Commonwealth and the states split the cost of introducing the model on a 30 to 70 basis, and that would require each government to lift their existing expenditure in school education by approximately 15 per cent. Dozens of technical issues arose once the panel's model was tested by the government. Both the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Schools Council of Australia reported serious anomalies. Leaked modelling in August 2012 revealed that approximately a third of all schools, both government and non-government, would lose funding. The coalition has consistently maintained that any new funding model introduced by the government should see no school left worse off in real terms. The government has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on consultants to redesign various aspects of the Gonski panel's original proposal for a funding model since the report was handed to the government in 2011. None of that modelling has ever been made public by the Gillard government and no formal response was ever provided by the government to each of the panel's 41 recommendations. We have seen various state education ministers, both Labor and coalition, continue to complain that none of this detail-and it is very important detail: it is a huge reform-has been provided. You would think that you would provide some detail, or that there would be some basis, some costings, or some sort of direction on how you are going to implement this once-in-a-generation reform but again, this is a government which designs policy on the run. None of this detail on how this new funding will operate in practice has been provided by the Gillard government. And the same issues keep coming up time and time again. Various education ministers-of all persuasions, as I have said, not just from the coalition-have all complained. Recently the education minister from my own state in Queensland, John-Paul Langbroek, said: We've had absolutely no detail about numbers. We don't have a model from which we can work. We also don't have any idea about what state contributions are supposed to be let alone whether we can afford them. You would think that some degree of detail would be released out there so that state and territory governments could move forward with the government in advancing the Gonski review and the Gonski recommendations. All sides of this House want our schools to be the best in the world. Who would not want that? We all want the best quality education for our children and for future generations. We want our students-and I see that the member for Moreton is opposite. He was a former schoolteacher, is that correct? Mr Perrett: Yes, for 11 years. Ms GAMBARO: I am sure he would have wanted all of his students to be at the top of the class and we want the same thing-we want all of our students to do well. However, until this government releases details and until it releases modelling, then all of the aspirational talk in the world about being the leaders in school education will come to nothing. We need the detail. We need to know where this government is going and how it will advance these oncein-a-generation reforms. Ms HALL (Shortland) (12:52): I rise to speak on the motion that has been brought to this House by the member for Kingston. In doing so I would like to highlight the fact that the member for Kingston is totally committed to education and to ensuring that every child gets a really good quality education. Education is the nation's future. If we cannot ensure that all our young people get a really quality education that prepares them for life in the 21st century then we are failing them. What we need to do is invest in education for the sake of our economy. If Australia is going to compete in the global market, we need a well-educated workforce-one that is prepared for the future. The government recognises this. We know just how important education is and that is why the Gonski review took place-the first review of the school system in 40 years. The opposition had a chance to instigate a review of the education system when they were in power and they did nothing. Since then, we have undertaken this review and we have made a commitment towards investing in schools. That commitment comes via the National Schools Partnership Program and the National Plan for School Improvement. Those are plans that will put Australia at the forefront of education internationally. They are plans that will ensure that all children have the opportunity to learn. The member for Kingston realises this when she talks about funding a fairer school system, more support for students and for schools, quality teaching in every classroom, more power in the hands of school principals, and more information about school performance for parents and the community. I know that, as a parent, more information is something I always wanted. Then you know how to work with your children to help them improve. Over the past decades, Australian students have fallen behind, and that has led to the government deciding that we were going to act now to significantly improve our performance in key learning areas. The National Plan for School Improvement is a new school-funding program that is based on the recommendations of the Gonski review. It will mean around $6.5 billion a year in today's figures-that is the ballpark figure recommended by Gonski-and now we are negotiating between the Australian government and the states. We have the Australian government investing in schools, whilst in New South Wales we have the O'Farrell government ripping $1.7 billion out of the school system. I think that that is not a very good state of affairs. In Shortland electorate there are around 20,000 students in 49 schools. Nearly $90 million was invested in BER projects. There are libraries, multipurpose halls and science and language centres. There have been 7,589 computers installed under the Digital Education Revolution. Over $15 million has been approved for two trade training centres benefiting 11 schools. There are 11 schools participating in the Smarter Schools National Partnerships program. Eleven schools in the Shortland electorate are eligible to receive funding and are receiving funding under the National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program. In addition to that, the Australian government invested nearly $6 million under the capital works program in Floraville Public School, and that was greatly appreciated by all the teachers, parents and students at that school. That compared to the Howard government investing in a flagpole and insisting that someone from the government come along and officially launch the flagpole. On one hand you have nearly $6 million invested, and on the other hand you have a flagpole. This government is determined to invest in our future by investing in education and making sure that every student gets a quality education. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (12:57): I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this motion about school funding. The Prime Minister, as we have heard so often, has made much of her personal commitment to education, citing it as a 'ruling passion' of her life and stating that the 'education revolution' would be a 'national crusade'. However, as ThomasA Edison so famously said, 'Vision without execution is hallucination.' Given that the Prime Minister is so fond of recounting the facts in question time, let me go through a couple of facts in the short time available. Fact No. 1: in the 14 months since David Gonski delivered his final report to government on school funding, the government has been silent on each of the 41 recommendations. Typically, a report of this size and significance would receive a detailed response from the government. Typically, we would see modelling done of different funding options, and we would see that modelling released, discussed and debated, but so far we have seen nothing at all. The key recommendation in the Gonski report is $6.5 billion of additional funding. That is not over the next 10 years; that is each and every year-$6.5 billion. And yet the government cannot answer very basic questions as to where this funding will come from. What is the split going to be? We heard of a 30-70 split in the Gonski review, yet the government has not said whether this 30-70 split with the states will be the funding model. Moreover, the government has not answered basic questions as to how it will fund the Commonwealth aspects of that funding split, no matter what that figure ends up being. We simply do not know. The government provided around $5 million in the budget towards another review. That $5.8 million in the budget was for further research into school funding changes. So despite the fact that they say this was the most significant review and that it had all the answers, and saying, 'We need to deliver Gonski,' they needed to spend another $5.8 million to conduct yet another review. Time is up-the government need to answer some questions. Fact No. 2: the government has indeed spent quite a significant amount of money-they say-towards education. They have spent more than $16 billion on school halls and yet according to the government's own review, the Orgill review, there has been significant waste and mismanagement of that money-that money has not gone to achieving better educational outcomes for future Australians. In fact, according to many media reports, that money has been wasted. We believe more than half of it has been wasted. Fact No. 3: we know a little about what the government and the Prime Minister in particular think about education and the significance of it because she exposed that in her recent reshuffle. Why is it that the Prime Minister continues to insist on putting failed ministers into education? First we saw it with the member for Kingsford Smith, Peter Garrett, who was the minister responsible for pink batts. Now we have seen it with the member for McMahon, who has been responsible for our border protection failures. These two are now going to be leading lights in education, which the Prime Minister claims to be so critically important to her government. Fact No. 4: this government governs with the support of the Greens. The Greens have a very clear policy when it comes to education funding. They do not want to see one dollar of funding go towards a student who is attending an independent school. They said this very recently in their manifesto, which appeared publicly on their website-although surprisingly in this election year that manifesto has now come down off the website. We need to deliver funding security for students and teachers and our schools so that they can deliver the best educational opportunities for all young Australians. This is what we on this side of the chamber believe. This is certainly what I believe as the member for Higgins with more than 39 schools in my electorate. I know it is critically important that we do not rip away funding from some students in order to redistribute it according to the government's own designated formula of what is 'fair'. We know what this government thinks about 'fairness'. It is about taking money away from some students to waste it in other areas-and the government's record stands very clear on that. school improvements. I have had to endure five minutes from the member for Higgins. I would like her to list, at the first opportunity, the 39 schools in her electorate that wished their school halls would be torn down. I would like her to list the 39 schools in her electorate that do not appreciate the computers that have been given to them or, if she has any National Partnership Schools, to list the schools that have found that scheme to be not worthwhile. I look forward to her informing the House at a later date. I have listened to two speeches here today and the hollow words coming from those opposite about what they believe in on schools. Everyone loves kids. I was a schoolteacher",243,Private Members Business
242,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (13:02,"I rise proudly to speak about the national plan forfor 11 years. I am yet to meet a parent or anyone in the community who says we should not put more money into schools. Those are easy and simple words. I am sure we will hear more from the member for Forde once he gets up. Btu the reality is that it is not what people say they should do for schools; it is what they do for schools. We are in the third iteration of school funding models. For most of my time as a teacher I had the earlier scheme and then the SES scheme under John Howard and now we are moving towards this Gonski model. Let us look at what these do. Everyone knows the SES model was a flawed model right from the very start. That is the reality. The funding maintained a number of schools. I taught at one of those funding-maintained schools. I taught in a Catholic school. I taught for three years in state schools and eight years in the Catholic system, so I understand the compromise that was made. I particularly understand the problems associated with getting the model right in terms of not taking a dollar away from anyone-which is the commitment the Labor government has given, I remind readers and listeners. The reality is, we have to look at what people do. I will stack up our 3,000 libraries against their 3,000 flagpoles any day. When I am sitting back in my rocking chair and saying, 'What did we do as a government, especially when the financial crisis hit?' I will know that we poured money into education facilities. I see, time after time, these people who are lions in parliament and mice in their electorates standing in their school halls and saying, 'This is a fantastic educational institution.' These things contribute to the curriculum; that is the reality. Interactive whiteboards, the NBN and all of these things will give high schools a path for the future. That is what Labor has invested in. It is not just simply saying, 'We love kids.' We all love kids; everybody does. That is what society is geared to do-invest in the future-but it is how you do it. With the National Partnership scheme we are making sure that those who need the most support get it. That is the trial that has worked so well. Then there are those other difficult things. I saw the Leader of the Opposition today talking about the fact that 50 per cent of the Labor caucus come from union backgrounds. I am one of those people. For five years I worked in the Independent Education Union. I am one of those union thugs, I guess. I see the great work that goes on in our schools, not just private schools like The Murri School in my electorate, which is run by the Indigenous community. My electorate has well-to-do schools, Catholic schools-poor Catholic schools and Catholic schools that are doing a little better-and everything in between. I know what wages are like in these areas. I know how difficult it can be for parents to make sure that their schools are well resourced. Do not judge the Labor Party by what it says or the Liberal and National parties on what they say. Judge them on what they do. I can proudly say that, since we were elected in 2007, the education budget has doubled. We have invested money, at every possible opportunity, to improve the lot of schoolchildren. That is what the Gonski report is all about: working with states. They keep saying, 'Where is the money?' The reality is, we are a federation. We have this thing called the Constitution. It means we must talk to state education ministers. We do not run many schools-it is a bit hard to change the Constitution. We need to work in collaboration with the state governments. It is hard to believe, but they are not necessarily willing and able to be led. They tend to be their own people. as usual. It is always a pleasure to follow this member, my esteemed colleague on the football field on a Thursday morning. I too rise to speak on the member for Kingston's motion on the National Plan for School Improvement, and I do thank her for bringing this motion to the House. We all, on both sides of politics, readily agree that education is an enormously important part of people's lives. Nelson Mandela once said that education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world. As we have heard from the contributions today, I think everybody would agree with that sentiment. Everyone should have the opportunity to secure a quality education. Education is liberating. It gives us the knowledge and tools needed to live a prosperous life. As Benjamin Franklin once said, 'Investment in knowledge pays the best interest.' The disappointing thing about this debate today is that it is focused on money. In the discussion and focus on money it has overlooked some key aspects of what we are really seeking to achieve with education-that is, an improvement in the outcomes of our students. We seek to improve their knowledge and skills as they enter the workforce after leaving school, to allow them to compete in a new global economy. In this regard, education is an essential foundation and a building block for our society to thrive and prosper in that global economy. It is interesting to note that it was over 60 years ago that education was declared a basic human right for every person and preserved in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Yet today there are millions of children around the world missing out on education. More than 72 million children of primary age are not in school, and some 759 million adults are illiterate and do not have the awareness necessary to improve both their living conditions and those of their children. While these are global numbers, it is sad to say that there are people in this country who fit into those categories. If students cannot read, then they cannot learn. The ability to read is in itself fundamental to the development of any young mind-and the ability to acquire knowledge, develop their imagination and learn to dream. It is through the ability to exercise that imagination and see genuine hope for the future that they have the motivation to go to school every day and continue to learn, grow and develop. Thankfully, while we have pointed out various flaws and concerns in this debate over this past half hour, we do, for all intents and purposes, have a decent education system. But it has not been the thriving revolution that was promised by the Prime Minister and this government. The plans to improve basic literacy and numeracy have failed despite some $540 million being spent in this area over the past five years. The independent performance audit concluded that the literacy and numeracy program has yet to make a statistically significant improvement to literacy and numeracy in any state. Recently, we conducted a survey in our electorate. We surveyed over 1,000 people, and 930 of those responses were that the basic skills of reading, writing and arithmetic were important. Yet we seem to have ventured off course somewhere because, instead of returning to these basic, fundamental building blocks of education, this basic structure that will improve education outcomes for young people, we have focused on new buildings or a competition and discussion, as we have heard today, about the difference between flagpoles and new",251,Private Members Business

Yet nowhere in this debate have we touched on these fundamental building blocks for the future of the students in our system. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 13:13 to 16:00 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. contribution to this important bill which, as I said last week, is only an interim step towards recognition of Australia's Indigenous peoples in the Constitution. Before debate was interrupted, I was indicating to the chamber that, while ultimately it will be the voice of Australian people who give constitutional recognition to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, this bill will help raise awareness more broadly in the community of the issue and will also commence a conversation among us all. It remains the resolve of the government to pursue meaningful change to the Constitution that echoes the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The bill provides a mechanism for all Australians to become familiar with the possible wording for a constitutional statement that could be included in a future referendum. I have seen countless times in our area the positive effect that recognition has on people through, for instance, the many award presentations held in the electorate each year, simply acknowledging the good deeds and efforts of individuals and groups. It provides an enormous sense of satisfaction and empowers them to continue to do their work. Imagine how empowering it would be were we to take this to a higher level, the most paramount level, and that is to have existence recognised within the heart of Australia's constitution. This is the sort of effect that the High Court's Mabo decision had on Indigenous people across the country when the court overturned a long-held legal view that this land had not been inhabited prior to European settlement. Overturning the principle of terra nullius acknowledged for the first time in law, for the first time since Captain Cook landed on these shores, that there were people here long before Europeans. It also validated their sense of being, their sense of belonging to the land, their sacred places and stories, and the struggles of all those who came before them. The Mabo decision itself opened the door for everything that has occurred since regarding Indigenous recognition. It is absolutely important and appropriate to recognise the landmark speech made by former Prime Minister Paul Keating at Redfern Park in December 1992. There he publicly acknowledged to Indigenous Australians that European settlers were responsible for the enormous difficulties that Aboriginal communities continued to face. I quote Mr Keating directly: We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practiced discrimination and exclusion.",253,Private Members Business
244,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (16:01): I am delighted to continue myIt was our ignorance and our prejudice … These were important words and should not be viewed simply in the sense of blame but, rather, recognition of past ills and to enable a situation where we can repair our relations and move the country forward. In a similar way, who can forget the tears of joy and relief displayed when former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd gave the formal apology on behalf the parliament and previous governments for the wrongs that had been inflicted on Indigenous Australians under the previous policy of removing children from their families. This week marks the fifth anniversary of this significant act of reconciliation, for which Indigenous people in the Chifley electorate continue to be enormously thankful. I hasten to add that the Chifley electorate has one of the largest urban Aboriginal populations in the country, and that many Aboriginal people in our electorate are either members of the stolen generation or their direct descendants. Five years after the apology to the stolen generations, people will again gather in Mount Druitt this week to commemorate this significant national event. Long before 'reconciliation' was a commonplace term in our day-to-day vernacular, members of the community, whom I am proud to represent, started gathering each year in Mount Druitt to celebrate Aboriginal culture and to march together as one for reconciliation. Fifteen years later, the Mount Druitt reconciliation march continues to be an important event in the social justice calendar in the Chifley electorate. This event continues to be well attended and is also recognised as part of the ongoing festivities within the Blacktown City Council area. At this point, I want to note that these types of events do not occur on their own and that within the context of the discussion that we are having in this place it is important to recognise the central figures who drive the work of the Mount Druitt and Districts Reconciliation Group-in particular, Marguerite Tobin, President; Pat Smith, Secretary; Maureen Berger, Vice President; and Debra Robertson, Treasurer. Their work has helped provide a platform to bring people together across our area, and they should be deeply thanked for this. I also want to make reference at this point to something else which I was enormously proud to be associated with and which I also think has great relevance to this discussion. Last year, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I was involved in the inquiry into Indigenous languages in Australia. I was very enthusiastically supportive of the establishment of the inquiry for a number of reasons, which I will touch upon shortly. I note that in its report titled Our land our languages, the committee recommended that the government support constitutional changes to include the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages. The two issues of recognition are inextricably linked. The recommendation of constitutional recognition of Indigenous languages is an acknowledgment of the fact that, post Mabo, Australia should no longer be considered a monolingual nation. The committee found that at the time of colonisation there were an estimated 250 Australian Indigenous languages being used and that today we report with great regret that only 18 languages are spoken by significant numbers of people across all age groups. The committee's report found that Indigenous language is inseparable from culture and a person's capacity to learn, making it a significant barrier to closing the gap on educational performance. As someone who grew up in a household where we learned English as a second language, I can testify to the powerful impact that language has on a sense of identity and a sense of being-and this is particularly so with Indigenous language and the role that it plays in day-to-day existence. I know how important having access to language is. It is a bridge between generations and in forming an important bond with culture. It should not be underestimated. I cannot stress enough the effort that has been undertaken in the preparation of this report and then to bring those recommendations to life. I can testify with my own eyes and earshearing and seeing-what is being done in our area. It is great to see the amount of work that is being undertaken to keep Indigenous languages alive and to teach these languages to young people from within cultures. In particular I note Hebersham Public School and the work that it is doing with its Koori Play and Chat program. This program is designed to teach younger Indigenous Australians the importance of their own language and it does so within the educational context. In the future, how exciting it will be when students from all cultures are able to study and master one or more of our own Indigenous languages. What greater recognition of Indigenous culture could there be? The simple answer to that is that there is no greater recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people than the single most important document to our nation-the Australian Constitution. As I indicated earlier, the Constitution sets out rules for the conduct of the Commonwealth of Australia. But, importantly, as a document it helps define who we are and what we value. Also within this document, the truest recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders must and should occur. supports the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 and warmly supports the long overdue move to provide for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution. Indeed, the second of the two referendum proposals which were defeated in 1999 was a personal project of the Prime Minister of the time, John Howard-a new preamble to the Constitution. It was designed, in large measure, to achieve this very objective-to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That preamble proposal was, regrettably, defeated in the referendum, as indeed was the change for which I was leading the campaign-to make Australia a republic and ensure that our head of state was no longer the King or Queen of the United Kingdom but rather an Australian citizen chosen by Australians. It is worth noting that the preamble-and this is a cautionary observation-had absolutely unanimous political support. I am not aware of any member of the House of Representatives, the Senate or any political party who opposed the preamble. Notwithstanding that, the preamble achieved fewer votes than the republic proposal. This is a very important point about the practicality of this change to which I will return. Our Constitution was not a document establishing an independent country. Australia was not an independent country in 1901. It was constituted as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire but subordinate to the imperial government. The Governor General was not an Australian head of state. The Governor General was not chosen by Australians or appointed on the recommendation of the Australian government. The Governor General was an imperial viceroy and indeed was the effective representative of the imperial government in",254,Bills
245,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth) (16:09,"As honourable members are aware, the oppositionAustralia right up until the 1930s-1933, I believe-when there was, for the first time, a British high commissioner appointed to Australia. So it is important, when you read the Australian Constitution and see references to the Queen-which are defined in the Constitution Act as being references to 'Her Majesty Queen Victoria and her heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom'-that does not, in 1901 terms, mean the Queen as she is today, acting on the advice of the state government; it means the Queen acting on the advice of her imperial ministers and the imperial government. The Constitution is filled with provisions which speak to this subordination of Australia. A very good example-this is one of a number, but I will just recite one-is section 59, which states that the Queen may annul any Australian law within one year of it being enacted. Indeed, under other provisions, the Queen has the ability to withhold consent to any law which had been reserved for her consent by the Governor General. So there was a whole scheme. If the Governor General, the representative of the imperial government, felt there were an Australian law that was out of place, he could refer it back to Whitehall where the Queen or King, acting on the advice of the imperial government, could then knock it back. If, by some mischance, the Governor General approved a bill and it became law-became an act-the Queen nonetheless could annul it. That of course raises the interesting constitutional question of what would happen if an incoming government in the 21st century were to advise Her Majesty the Queen that she should annul certain laws passed by the previous government within the previous 12 months. It is an interesting question as to whether that dead letter could rise, vampire-like, from the grave and bedevil all the constitutional lawyers and politicians. But my point is the Constitution was a document written in and of its own times. It has evolved mightily. It has evolved not very much by the method that the founders imagined, by formal amendment, because it has been so difficult to amend the Constitution. Indeed, of 44 proposals to amend the Constitution, only eight have been successful. The last one which was even remotely controversial that was successful was in 1946. The Aboriginal rights referendum in the 1960s, an initiative of the Holt government, was unanimously supported. And the other referendum changes, at least in my lifetime, that have been successful have been essentially technical ones. How the Constitution has evolved has been largely through Constitutional or political evolution. There were the Statute of Westminster and the Australia acts, which had the result that without changing a line in the Constitution references to the Queen, meaning the Queen acting on the advice of the imperial government, came to mean the Queen acting on the advice of the Australian government. And then you have all of the changes effected by the justices of the High Court as they interpreted the Constitution. But we have in many respects, as George Winterton once said, in Constitutional terms a frozen continent. We have been unable to change our Constitution in any controversial way. Many people have said that you need bipartisan support to change the Constitution. It is certainly very hard to change it without it, but it is absolutely not enough. The preamble is a very good example of that, a very good demonstration of the force of what I am saying. In order to successfully change the Constitution you need to have overwhelming public support, a real sense of momentum, the strongest possible support, and very little opposition-somewhere between very little and no opposition. The reason for that, in my judgement-and I acknowledge that it was the Chief Justice Murray Gleeson who drew this to my attention many years ago-is that we have compulsory voting in Australia. So people who are not interested in the issue, not because they are foolish or irresponsible but simply because they are not interested in the issue-people who have chosen not to pay attention to it, who have not read all the literature and have not watched the debates, and are then, as we are in Australia, dragged along by force of law to the polling booth and presented with a proposition-are invariably much more likely to vote no than yes. If you don't know, you are likely to vote no. Indeed, at every referendum which has been contentious the forces against change have said quite openly, 'If you don't know, vote no.' Obviously the less you know about it the more likely you are to be open to scare campaigns and the like. They are not unknown in political circles, so honourable members. I think will acknowledge. So the big challenge we face with this project is not that everyone in this building is not united in their support for having a Constitution that more properly speaks to the Australia of today: the Australia that does not treat Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders as it did in 1901, as not simply second-class citizens but effectively non-persons, noncitizens, not even to be counted, not to vote, as though they had just been airbrushed out of history. That was pretty much where it was in 1901, to our great shame. But all of that has changed. How do we make this document speak to the civilised, just, fair Australia of 2013? How do we get it passed? Some people would say, 'Oh well, just give it a go. Work up a referendum proposal and see how you go.' The consequences, to my mind, of a referendum proposal on this topic being defeated would be very serious. It would be seen as a national rejection of reconciliation. It would do extraordinary damage to Australia in terms of our own perception of ourselves and indeed to the world's perception of us. So to have a referendum on this topic is a momentous roll of the dice. I think Australia would have been better advised, obviously, to have approved the republic proposal in 1999. I imagine there are many people in the world who still imagine that Australia is in some respects not fully independent because the Queen of the United Kingdom is our head of state, notwithstanding that we are of course as thoroughly an independent country-in fact in some respects more independent-as the United Kingdom. So perceptions matter. But with this question, because it touches on such a sensitive issue of race, the stakes are much higher. SoI am very pleased to see that the bill provides that the minister shall within 12 months of this bill being enacted take soundings, and report on the feasibility of a change being achieved. It is something that is going to have to be undertaken with great care and with great responsibility. There is a tendency in some sections of the media and in some sections of the community to run very hysterical scare campaigns on a range of issues. We are all familiar with those. This is a proposal that is very potentially vulnerable to that. You can well imagine people saying, 'Oh, if we were to make these changes, Aboriginals will be able to claim our backyard, claim our house.' You can imagine all the scare campaigns that could be run. They will have to be resisted with great force, and care. This is going to be a test of our maturity as a nation. Are we able to tell the truth about ourselves? We no longer regard Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as second-class citizens or noncitizens. There may be some people who do, but there is no serious constituency. There is no accounting for a handful of people. But overwhelmingly the vast majority-that is 99.999 per cent-of Australians share the same aspirations as are in this bill. But it is so easy to run a scare campaign. Of course, you have to remember that in any referendum you have to have a specific proposal. You cannot just have a vote on recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, just like you cannot have a vote on whether Australia should be a republic. You have to have some specific words. It is always possible for people to say, 'Oh well, we agree with the general objective but we object to these words.' They try to clothe their opposition in a technical objection. This bill, which some people have said is pretty innocuous, is much more potent than most of its readers imagine. It is in many respects a challenge to all of us, to all Australians: are we mature enough, are we grown up enough, are we confident enough to say we are not going to play petty politics, scare campaign politics, frightening people politics? Are we going to face up to the facts and maturely and soberly find a set of words that achieve the recognition that we should all support, but does so in a way that it can be carried? This is a great project that we are looking at today and we should all strive very hard to ensure that it is completed successfully. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (16:24): I too rise with some hope and sense of anxiety, I expect. That was very well articulated by the member for Wentworth, because this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 is indeed adult reading for an adult nation, and we need to take the necessary precautions to ensure that all Australians come with us on the journey as we move towards this appropriate recognition of the reality of our country and history. I am proud to be a member of the party that removed the final vestiges of the White Australia policy. I am proud to be a member of the party that handed the first tracts of land back to traditional owners and I am proud to be a member of the party that apologised to the stolen generations. I am proud to stand here in this place as part of a Labor government that continues to make important strides forward in the official recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution. While we should be proud of these strides we made as a government and nation it is also important to recognise that there have been times we should be ashamed of: times that we have gone against our great professed Australian belief in egalitarianism, times in our national history that reveal us as a people failing to meet that sense of our best selves, times in our history where we have had a sense of what we should strive for to ensure we all move forward together and times when, through lack of generosity or fear, the historical record reveals us as far less than the best Australians we could be. So let this time, our time, not be one of those shameful times. In order to advance Australia toward fairness we, the Gillard government, are introducing this very important bill to the House. On our journey toward community understanding of the substance of a referendum and a confidence that such a referendum will successfully achieve a positive outcome for the entire population-the first Australians and those of us who arrived a bit later on boats and planes-this bill is both an instrument that enables that conversation to occur and a record of our journey toward that day of constitutional recognition. We find ourselves here, in this House of Representatives, with this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill before us. It is a bill that will establish an act of recognition acknowledging the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their descendants as the first people of our nation. It will serve as a stepping stone to holding a successful referendum that will change the Australian Constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This should be a bipartisan goal, and I am very heartened by the comments of my fellow parliamentarians in this debate. This should be a goal that brings all Australians together, not one that divides us. This should be a goal that we can be proud of, not one tarnished by political gains. As part of our commitment to recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian constitution, this government established an expert panel to lead a discussion with the communities to move this issue forward and to bring it to public consciousness. The expert panel consulted widely, and we in this place should be very proud of the high level of community engagement that was achieved during this process. When the report was handed to parliament in January last year we had a comprehensive set of proposals that would guide our government and future governments toward the effort of recognition. We have already invested $10 million to help build public awareness and community support for change. In my role as the member for Robertson on the very beautiful Central Coast-Darkinjung and Guringai country-I meet wonderful, active citizens who deeply understand what we are seeking to achieve here. I commend a particular group from my electorate known as Friends of Mingaletta, formerly called Central Coast Citizens for Constitutional Change, and I acknowledge and put on the record today my regard for their work and advocacy in bringing more attention to this issue in the seat of Robertson. The Friends of Mingaletta have already held a number of community meetings, and they have brought together community leaders to enlist their support in promoting and publicising the need for constitutional change and engaging the wider community in that debate. It is a task that has presented quite a challenge and they have certainly risen to that challenge. They know that for this historic and necessary change to come about we have to pull together-we have to come together as a country. And, as the member for Wentworth indicated, there are those whose interest, perhaps, in making money above making a country might interrupt this journey in some way. We need to be very careful to engage our media in enabling an historic, forward-looking campaign to achieve the outcomes that this legislation sets in train. We have to talk about this issue with colleagues; we have to talk about this issue in schools; we have to talk about this issue through social media and, importantly, we have speak about it in the parliament. Indeed, as parliamentarians we are called to lead discussions in our own communities in very positive ways about the issues that are at hand and being considered through this bill. We have to drive the conversation. We have to ensure that as every week and month passes more non-Indigenous Australians hear about this propositionthat more non-Indigenous Australians say 'yes' to recognition; that more non-Indigenous Australians say yes to closing the gap. Passing this act will continue that momentum for change. Again, referring to the region in which I live-the seat of Robertson-I am privileged to have a very active and growing local Aboriginal community, ably represented by Sean Gordon, CEO of the local Darkinjung Aboriginal Land Council. I asked him to bring together some of his own thoughts on what this legislation will mean for the local Aboriginal population that he leads at this moment, along with other great leaders in our local Aboriginal community, and I would very much like to read those comments into the record now: Darkinjung local Aboriginal council is located on the Central Coast of New South Wales representing 9,000 Aboriginal people on the Central Coast and is the fastest-growing Aboriginal community in Australia based on the 2011 census data. Our experience is similar to that of our remote communities although not to the same severity. What is clear is that Aboriginal people living within urban settings are more likely to be disconnected from country, language and identity due to colonisation and European settlement. The Act of Recognition bill is an important critical step towards Constitutional recognition. This bill provides an opportunity to introduce as an interim measure the concept of recognising Aboriginal people as the first people of this country. The bill is a step in the right direction as it establishes foundation to build the necessary support structures to gain bipartisan agreement within parliament; however, more importantly, the bill allows the Australian community, both black and white, to better understand the importance of recognising aboriginal people in the Constitution. The immediate impact of the Act of Recognition Bill, if recognised, supported and passed by parliament demonstrates that there is a genuine commitment to create a real and lasting change between black and white Australia and demonstrates a sign of good faith that governments care and acknowledge our history. The Act of Recognition bill should not be seen as the solution to address the existing problems between black and white Australians nor should it be seen as the solution to fixing communities. The bill should first and foremost be seen as the first step in a true recognition and a genuine reconciliation. This bill, if passed, will provide our future generations-our next generation of leaders-the opportunity to be proud of our history and proud of who we are as Australians. The bill will hopefully generate and sustain a new generation of leadership amongst Aboriginal people and communities and allow future leaders to concentrate on remedies and solutions to our communities without the burden of recognition or the lack thereof. Finally, if the Act of Recognition bill is passed, it will lay the foundation that is necessary to achieve constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians and demonstrate what we all know and love: that Australia truly is a great country. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I want to thank Sean Gordon for those words and all the representatives on the land council for their contribution to our life-our cultural life and our physical life on the Central Coast. I have been taught to look with new eyes many times by my Aboriginal brothers and sisters, and I am sure that you have had similar experiences, as we are gifted with opportunities to travel around this great wide brown land. This legislation makes the clear statement of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first inhabitants of Australia. It acknowledges the unique history, culture and connection to traditional lands and waters. It also commits to closing the gap in life outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians and acknowledges that constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is an important part of that process. This bill should not be a substitute for full recognition but, rather, it should encourage all Australians to become familiar with the need for and the importance of a constitutional change. Sunset provisions in the act will mean that a future parliament will reassess how to move forward with the change and will not allow this legislative instrument to become entrenched at the expense of a referendum. The apology did not bring a full and equal opportunity for Indigenous Australians and, sadly, nor will this referendum, even if it proceeds to a successful conclusion from the perspective we have been discussing here today. Nonetheless both are very important steps in bringing closer that goal and bringing it to reality. As the Prime Minister's words echoed just the other day, there is much more to do to close the gap, and this bill is, in essence, part of the journey towards closing that gap. I do recall, as a student, accessing a book in the library one Friday afternoon. It was one of those Friday afternoons when perhaps I was avoiding a more onerous task, but I was browsing the shelves and pulled off a book and opened it up. Sometimes in our lives the pages that appear before us are very powerful. The story that was recounted on those pages was of a different interaction that might have occurred when the British arrived here in this country. I read several pages of an interaction in which the white arrivals spoke to the Aboriginal people and marvelled at the richness of their understanding of country, marvelled at the uniqueness of their language, marvelled at the sustainability of the way in which they lived and marvelled at the complex multikinship structures, and I often wonder what a different country we might be if that fantasy had been a reality. The moment for proper engagement and acknowledgement of the richness of Aboriginal culture passed at that time. It is important that at this time, while it is our duty and we are on watch, we make every endeavour possible to ensure that we reach out across the nation, that we engage in sound enabling education that draws us together with an acknowledgement of our common humanity and draws us to a much better and long overdue recognition of the place of the first peoples of this nation. I commend the bill to the House. Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 allows this nation more time to debate the issue of constitutional recognition, to build consensus and to work on increased awareness right across this great country. The debate, I think, has had two important contributions made by the previous speakers. On our side, from the member for Wentworth, there was a very, very clear elucidation of just how complex a referendum change can be, and the previous speaker referred to 'an adult conversation for an adult nation'. It is a theme that I would like to pick up, because the one component of that discussion that has not yet been added to this debate in this parliament is the conversation within Aboriginal Australia about their role in succeeding in this very, very important course of events. I would like to focus a lot of my speech on a 2009 quarterly essay by Noel Pearson, not because I do not believe that it is, for the very simple and self-evident case, a very important piece of work that will be remembered as really expanding on the role of Indigenous Australia in its own journey towards constitutional recognition but because large elements of this quarterly essay have yet to find their way into Hansard. I believe that important parts of this debate on this day will be looked back on, and we will see the important role that this piece has played in this journey. Of course Pearson, like many people, is inspired by the readings of others. In this quarterly essay, he focuses on Jonathan Lear's Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation, a work in 2006, where Lear asks the important question: what would it be for such radical hope to be justified for Aboriginal Australia? Those who hold, harbour and project such hope must be serious in order to succeed. Pearson makes the very important point that determination alone is not enough, that it is necessary but not sufficient, that we will need more than that. When you are struggling against all odds, determination is no guarantee of success. He makes the very important observation that discipline is just as important. The 'great vulnerability' that he observes in Aboriginal people has been that the institutions of their culture mandated a seriousness that, met long ago, fell apart and has really struggled to restitute itself. It has been inadequately replaced or inadequately rejuvenated. In the midst of the ruins of the old world and facing the mutations of the new, Aboriginal Australia is seeking",256,Bills
246,Mr Laming (Bowman) (16:39,"Indeed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanderan accommodation of those things that make Aboriginal culture something of a serious people. Pearson postulates that all pre-modern peoples face this very challenge, that they carry within their culture 'some institutional essence of what made and maintained them as peoples', but at the same time they are facing modern people-to use that vernacular-who are secular and unanchored. Modern people come to feel a double-edged sword, because modern people in many ways are free of that traditional orthodoxy. That includes the ability that we have to lose our own identity as modern people and to also succumb to and assimilate easily into a dominant culture, which is not the characteristic of pre-modern people. That is a fascinating observation by Pearson. Those who resist assimilation really have no protection against its inexorable advance, so Pearson asks this very question: what will it take to seriously engage that challenge ahead? Obviously, he makes his case that education is something that can, in a parallel world, be pursued with other elements like constitutional recognition. IfI am reading his quarterly essay correctly, he says, 'Never make constitutional recognition something upon which we become utterly reliant but let it be something that we engage in, in parallel.' Pearson makes two observations about what it takes to be a very, very serious people. The first of those is to live in hard places-the very self-evident observation that, the harder the place, the more serious must be the people. Human societies occupy some of the hardest and most inhospitable and economically irrational corners of the world. They are places on Earth that require serious people to sustain them as homes, and strong rationales are needed to maintain that hearth in hard places. The second element is when people are striving to maintain and transmit to future generations their pre-modern culture in a language of a modern and global world. The more esoteric and the less economically rational that these cultures may be deemed and that languages are to the imperatives of the modern global world, the more serious a challenge these people will face and the more serious they will have to be in order to retain their culture and language. I think he very, very simply elucidates that the challenge facing elements of traditional and often remote Aboriginal Australia is even more than we can understand as modern people, to use his expression. His notion of seriousness is about orthodoxy-a 'serious person' in the sense that we are concerned with an orthodox person. Pearson makes the interesting observation that one of the great challenges to the traditional life has been alcohol. He notes that in a range of orthodox cultures around the world alcohol is anathema but that that is not the case in traditional Aboriginal Australia where they have faced a range of European vices that are unprecedented and where, he notes, 'Aboriginal Law did not evolve to proscribe these vices according to comparable principles of precedent'-principles that you might find in other cultures. The whole point that he makes about orthodoxy is that in many of the cultures-but not in Aboriginal Australia-elements like alcohol, gambling and illicit drugs have become anathema but that that has not yet occurred in many elements of traditional Australia which have survived to the present but remain 'fatally compromised by the assumption that the Law which underpins this High Culture does not have anything to say about the European vices'. This is an observation that I was privileged enough to be part of in 1994, when petrol sniffing first arrived at the Central Desert community of Lajamanu in the mid-nineties. These were the first images that senior Aboriginal people on the traditional council had of their grandchildren: with half-cans of Coke tied around their noses and filled with petrol. They called a community meeting in Lajamanu in the first few weeks that I was there. I had no language to understand the discussion, but in their Warlpiri-their emotional, heartfelt Warlpiri-they had no words to describe these very vices, so they simply borrowed from the English. The only parts that I could understand of the entire communication at this community meeting were the English words for the vices for which they had no traditional response. And so what really started these contradictions that we see between a traditional strong culture based on kinship and the almost impotent powerlessness of dealing with external threats is something that Pearson challenges his own people with. He challenges them to have that conversation and to walk in both worlds, where there is both a traditional and a mainstream response to those challenges. This brings me to the fifth Closing the gap report, where, in a presentation from the Prime Minister that was just touching on some levels of early data about which we can all be optimistic, she then switched back to very much a focus on the banned drinkers registers, on Alice Springs and on disputes between jurisdictions-something which I think belittled that report. I think we were really there for a distillation of the evidence, to be hopeful for where there is promise and to be rightfully concerned where there is not progress. But, in the end, quoted in that very important-and landmark-fifth anniversary speech was data provided by the then Labor minister from the Northern Territory and released prior to the Northern Territory election which compared the impact of the Banned Drinkers Register to its impact the previous year. What was not known to anyone-not to those listening to that speech nor even to the Prime Minister who read it out-was that the data attributed to the use of the 'Enough is Enough' Banned Drinkers Register in Alice Springs had actually had lifted out of it all of the alcoholrelated antisocial behaviour reports attributed to domestic violence. These reports were not included after the Banned Drinkers Register came into effect, but they of course had all been included prior to the Banned Drinkers Register. This is a comparison of apples and oranges, and a false attribution of the impact of the Banned Drinkers Register when, on any fair and balanced assessment of the data in the Northern Territory, the Banned Drinkers Register had very little impact at all on dysfunctional behaviour or antisocial behaviour in Alice Springs. But that is not what has been carved into stone in the fifth Closing the gap report. That is genuinely unfortunate. To emerge from these challenges that are fundamentally destructive of any culture, be it traditional or otherwise, the challenge for Aboriginal Australia will be to incorporate into their own belief systems having one foot in mainstream legal systems, and of course to continue also the culture of their people that have for millennia dealt with an enormous number of challenges but are yet to deal with some of the Western vices that I have outlined. The late Maria Lane, a South Australian Indigenous academic who was mentioned in that quarterly essay, also made an important, though unpublished, contribution which Pearson picks up in his essay. In that paper, Lane observes that, effectively, we have seen a divisionwhich Marcia Langton in her Boyer Lectures this year picked up on again through a slightly different prism. Lane refers to: 'A Welfare-Embedded'-Aboriginal-'Population which is riskand work-averse, and benefits-, wealthand security-oriented', and to the other leaf of the dichotomy, 'An Open-Society Population which is opportunity-, effortand outcomeoriented'. She described this division very early, long before the Boyer Lectures of this year where Marcia Langton referred to a north and a south: a north economically engaging in the mining opportunities of remote Australia, and then very much a more eastern seaboard, urban Aboriginal debate that is predominantly focused on the rights-based debate. She makes the obvious point: 'Why can't we have both?' or 'Should we even be learning from the activities of the north and making sure that we don't become preoccupied with the former?' Interestingly though, it was Lane who first described this. She talks about the origins of the open society population being found in the forties and the fifties when Indigenous people first started leaving the settlements to move to urban areas and often picked up very menial and basic work. Their children grew up within that ethos. Secondly, she talks about a number of the settlements where people either chose not to, or were unable to, move from remote Australia, predominantly because the welfare system trapped them there on a pedestal-to move from those communities was, effectively, to walk away from a lot of the welfare supports that one relies on in a community. It is interesting that this has been picked up a long time ago and is still informing debate today. I think the most important thing that Lane talked about was that this open society population has developed almost independently of many of our Indigenous-specific educational interventions. It occurred simply by movement to opportunity, and that is why it is very important to make sure that we never prohibit, or never make it difficult through government policy, for Aboriginal Australians to move to where opportunities are. We should never say to them, 'Well, you'll lose your publicly funded housing'. We should never say to them, 'If you move to take a job, there go your entitlements'. We have to find a way to transition into grasping opportunities, because through capability of course comes opportunity. Lane scathingly characterised a lot of the programs as being preoccupied with questions of relevance, cultural sensitivity, language and racist theories such as learning styles, theoryappropriate curriculum, role of elders, parents or community, self-esteem, cooperativeness, need for outdoor activity, focus on sport, love of art and all those Aboriginal exceptionalism arguments, which failed to identify that, at the heart of it, all Australians are just wanting the same thing for their children. As a result of the irrelevance of many of these specific policies, Pearson argues that there will be a predicted shift away from this exceptionalism, and back towards a focus that every opportunity that Australia offers should be available to all Australians. In that ideal, we are now seeing break-outs right across the country, not just in Cape York. Great work is being done in the Kimberley and great work is being done in parts of outer metropolitan urban Indigenous programming as well-not to mention in Queensland the great work being done by QAIHC and the establishment of a range of Aboriginal-controlled medical centres that are working in this area to run on a mainstream model but deliver Indigenous-tailored and Indigenous-centred and controlled care. In Cape York there is of course the focus on education. They are initiating this debate that says, 'We can walk in both worlds and enjoy the best of both, and that we can realise that by starting with the children.' Chris Sarra, Noel Pearson and a range of others around the country are working on that. I have explicitly focused on this, because I think the most important thing of all is not to have a mostly non-Indigenous discussion about our Constitution. We also need to have a discussion with Indigenous Australia about the shape of the next Indigenous studying, training and working population. At the moment we have a great dissonance. We have a falling out of educational opportunities for a whole host of reasons, and an expungement of Indigenous language out of a range of state educational curricula. We have children falling out of the system the minute they drop out of school, and we have no community-wide system to ensure that working-age cohorts all get an opportunity. And ultimately, we have not yet developed a mature welfare system that is prepared to support not just an Aboriginal Australian but any Australian who is willing to move further than the 90-minute Centrelink rule to take up an opportunity. Only when our welfare system can mature to that point can we absolutely grasp the opportunity that every Australian family wants, be they Indigenous or otherwise. Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. This legislation follows the report titled Recognising. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution, which was presented about a year ago. I note that the member for Page, who was a member of the expert panel that put together that report, is in the chamber. I say to her on behalf of all of her colleagues that it is, indeed, an excellent report. I have read through it and I believe it sums up the situation of Indigenous people of this country very well. When I think about Australia's identity and what distinguishes Australia from other nations, the first thing that comes to my mind is the Australian Indigenous people-the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country: people whose attachment to this land dates back tens of thousands of years; people with a fascinating and, indeed, unique culture. Since 1788, the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Australian story has been controversial and at times divisive. Since colonisation, Australia does not have a proud history in its treatment of the Indigenous people. It is a history littered with government policy and decisions based on prejudice and ignorance. One only has to look at the speeches of Prime Ministers Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin to understand the racist thinking of the time. Nor was the racism directly and solely meant for the Indigenous people of this land. In fact, I suspect that most of it was intended towards other people. Policies which in hindsight have been discriminative, racist and heartless arose as a result of thoughts in that era. In recent decades, however, there has been considerable effort to recognise the rights and equality of Indigenous people in Australia. The 1967 referendum, land rights, Mabo and Indigenous political representation have all been commendable examples of changing attitudes throughout this country, yet many other efforts have had only limited success when assessed against the often substantial resources committed. The issue of Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution is a prime example of that. Few people expressly opposed the proposition, yet following through with constitutional recognition has proved incredibly difficult. I heard the speech by the member for Wentworth and he made that very point. He quite rightly also made the point that not only has it proven to be very difficult in the past but also it is likely to be very difficult in the future. That may be partly explained by the broader issue about the difficulty of amending the Australian Constitution. Only eight propositions out of 44 put to the Australian people have been successful. I suspect, however,",262,Bills
247,Mr Zappia (Makin) (16:54,"I too take this opportunity to speak to the Aboriginal and that it has more been about a lack of commitment by politicians at all levels across Australia. The rhetoric and the platitudes have not always been matched by the necessary commitment and effort required, in a similar way to the lack of commitment that we are seeing on the question of local government recognition. Indigenous Australians are understandably cautious about the latest proposal. Recognition of Australia's Indigenous people in Australia's Constitution will be more than just a symbolic or patronising gesture. The Australian Constitution sits as the foundation document of Australia's legal framework. It provides a framework for Australian laws and the responsibilities of federal and state governments. It is the founding document of our nation. The absence of any recognition of Indigenous people in the Australian Constitution is a denial of the truth about the origins and history of Australia and perpetuates an injustice that may have been accepted in 1901 but it has no place in Australia today. Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution will recognise the rightful place of Indigenous people in the Australian story, but it will do much more than that. Constitutional recognition, reconciliation and Closing the Gap all intersect. Reconciliation will never be complete without truthful recognition of Indigenous people in Australia's history and its future. Importantly, every act of reconciliation will break down barriers to Closing the Gap strategies. Acknowledging injustice and grievances can be a powerful step in the reconciliation process. That is why former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's national apology was so important in unifying Australia. The Prime Minister's Closing the Gap statement on Wednesday, 6 February, only last week, highlighted progress made in overcoming Indigenous disadvantage and hardship. The statement also reaffirms the considerable disadvantage that continues to exist throughout Indigenous communities-the kind of disadvantage that led to the Northern Territory intervention policy. I believe that the Northern Territory intervention policy is well intentioned, but it will be some time before a proper evaluation of it can be made. My expectation is that there will be some initial benefits, and those who support the policy will point to those benefits as evidence that the policy is working. There are concerns, however, that over time there will be ways found to circumvent the policy, and just as prohibition did not stop the consumption of liquor in the US, the intervention may result in corruption and illegal activity in order to get around it. I am also told that intervention is causing considerable resentment amongst many of the Indigenous people. Addressing core problems through education, awareness and inclusion would very likely have much better long-term benefits than protectionist laws which attempt to control behaviour. Whilst disadvantage continues, many of Australia's Indigenous people will continue to feel resentment, continue to feel discriminated against and continue to focus on past injustices. So Closing the Gap will heal wounds and enable reconciliation, and conversely reconciliation will help close the gap. Both will be enhanced by constitutional recognition of Australia's Indigenous people. This legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, is an important step in that process. It follows the work of the expert panel that I referred to in my opening remarks. Cognisant of the track record of constitutional change, the government wants to ensure that any proposal for Indigenous recognition has the best chance of success. With that in mind, this bill establishes a process for consulting with the Australian people, getting the wording of the proposed constitutional change right and overcoming procedural concerns as obstacle to a successful referendum. Last year I was asked to address a forum organised by the City of Salisbury on the question of Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution. The Hon. Robyn Layton AO, QC, former Supreme Court justice, currently co-chair of Reconciliation South Australia and, in fact, South Australian of the year, Professor Peter Buckskin, Dean of Indigenous Scholarship, Engagement and Research at the University of South Australia, and Khatija Thomas, Commissioner for Aboriginal Engagement, also spoke at the forum and shared their expert perspectives on the constitutional change and the process required. It was an interesting discussion. I came away from the forum with two clear observations. Firstly, whilst the City of Salisbury team had gone to considerable efforts to organise the event, the numbers participating, although as well as expected, reflected the general lack of interest in the matter. The attendance at the forum was consistent with many other forums that I have attended with respect to Indigenous issues. The point I make is that regardless of how much we try it is quite often very difficult to engage the broader Australian community in questions and issues relating to the Indigenous people of this land. That is certainly one of the observations that I came away with. Secondly, there was, from memory, unanimous agreement from those present that whilst Indigenous constitutional recognition should occur, there was still considerable work to be done to ensure that a referendum on the question would be successful. The concerns expressed on the night were consistent with the concerns that have been expressed in this place and previously in other places and at other times. It is extremely difficult to change our Constitution. It is even more difficult to change our Constitution when we are dealing with a matter relating to the Indigenous people of this land. WhilstI note that the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have all acknowledged Australia's Indigenous people in their state constitutions, I am also conscious of the difficulty that we face in changing the Australian Constitution. In fact I understand that attempts in 1944, 1974, 1988 and 1999 to change the Constitution with respect to Australia's Indigenous people all failed. The only successful attempt was in 1967 and I understand that it was overwhelmingly successful, in fact the most successful change to any Constitutional matter in the history of the nation. I suspect there was also a very good reason for that, and the changes made at a time, I think, were quite logical and understood by the Australian people as being changes that should be made without there being any disagreement from any quarters. Whilst the Mabo High Court decision of 1992 led to the Native Title Act and the establishment of an Indigenous Land Fund and the delivery of a social justice package, I believe that it also raised profound questions about the Australian Constitution and in particular the moral and legal requirements for Indigenous recognition. For example, if Indigenous ownership pre-dates British occupation, are those lands exempt from colonial law, and what other rights therefore pre-date the Australian Constitution? Such questions will continue to remain unresolved and these are questions about the sovereignty of this nation. I note that the expert panel made some comments about that in the report-very good comments, I might add-but questions remain unresolved and in fact they are questions that now arise, in my view, as a result of the Mabo decision. Furthermore, the Australian Constitution cannot continue to remain silent on a matter which the High Court has now ruled on and which contradicts a critical presumption on which, I understand, the Australian Constitution was framed. I conclude with a couple of other observations. I note that in many of the recommendations, including some of the propositions put forward by the expert panel, words like 'recognise', 'acknowledge' and 'respect' feature in any proposed wording that may be put to the Australian people as the words that we ought to adopt with our Constitution. I note that the word 'rights' is never mentioned. I do not know how others in the future will interpret words like 'recognise', 'acknowledge' and 'respect' unless you attach specifics to those words. If you do not, then, quite frankly, it will also leave a degree of ambiguity about what the Constitution says about our Indigenous people. It seems to me that if the word 'rights' is not mentioned, and is never going to be mentioned, then the Indigenous people of this land, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, will continue to feel aggrieved. Perhaps, as other nations have done, it is time for this nation to also strike a treaty with the Indigenous people of this land. At least that will then enable Indigenous people and the non-Indigenous people to move forward with a degree of certainty about the rights of each party. With those comments I commend the bill to the House and once again extend my thanks to the expert panel for the work that they have put into presenting their report to the House. Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 into the House. This is an important step forward in the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our nation's Constitution, something I support. It is important that we maintain a bipartisan approach to their constitutional recognition and I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's proposal that both leaders make statements to the House of Representatives affirming support for constitutional recognition. I also commend the government on the establishment of a parliamentary joint select committee following the recommendation of the coalition. In December 2010 the government announced the formation of an expert panel on constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to consult throughout 2011. I join with my coalition colleagues in thanking Professor Patrick Dodson and Mr Mark Leibler AC for their work in consulting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to deliver a report on possible options for a constitutional change. It is essential that we work together with this expert panel to achieve this necessary change to the Constitution and to take the important step forward in recognising our first Australians. Achieving meaningful change to the Constitution has long been a commitment in this place of the Liberals and Nationals. It was a coalition government which was responsible for the historic 1967 referendum which removed racially discriminatory provisions from the Constitution. That referendum passed with the overwhelming support of the Australian people-more than 90 per cent of all votes cast and all states carrying it. In 1998 Prime Minister John Howard spoke in favour of a constitutional amendment that recognised the prior occupation of Australia by Indigenous peoples and their place in the Australian community as well as their right to preserve their distinctive identity. At the 2007 election the Liberals and Nationals made a commitment to hold a referendum on this matter, which took the Labor Party 2½ years to match. It is the coalition that has maintained its position on constitutional recognition and our commitment to seeing it pass. But we cannot do this alone.",266,Bills
248,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (17:09,"I welcome the introduction of the Aboriginal andWagga Wagga based Wiradjuri elder Aunty Isabel Reid said it is time for the parliament to put politics aside and work together to achieve meaningful reform in this area, so I welcome the government's bipartisan, in-principle support of the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I am pleased that this is now a bipartisan endeavour but there is still much work to be done. Given the fact that we are only months away from the federal election, little progress has been made to ensure there is necessary community consensus for this change at a referendum of the people. We just heard the member for Makin say that there have been only eight of 44 referenda passed. Thankfully, the fifth of those, on 27 May 1967, gave the Commonwealth power to make laws for Aboriginal people resident in the states and to include all Aboriginal people in the national census. But generally referenda fail, so it is absolutely crucial that when this referendum is put to the people it passes, as well as recognition in the Constitution for local government. We must make sure that when we do put it as a referendum it absolutely passes with the majority of the people. Because of this, it is appropriate that we delay a referendum bill on this important issue until a time when there is wide, long-lasting and bipartisan support for constitutional recognition. The coalition has consistently reassured the government and the community of our strong support for the recognition of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Islander peoples in the Constitution and we want to ensure that this happens in the right way, at a time when it has the most chance of succeeding at a referendum. Ms SAFFIN (Page-Government Whip) (17:13): I rise to speak in strong support of this bill and it pleases me that it has come before the parliament. Having served on the expert panel, and now being a member of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Islander Peoples, I have been deeply involved in this issue for quite some time. The contribution I make tonight is a rather small one because of the continuing work that I will be involved in to advance constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This bill is a landmark piece of legislation. It may be that it is only for two years, and some people have asked me about that. They have said, 'Why couldn't it last permanently?' I have said that the bill is put here. It is an act of faith. It is an act of faith by this parliament to say that we will work together in a spirit of cooperation with the communities, and have full consultation across the community of Australia with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, to advance the question of constitutional recognition. It is an act of faith, but it is a landmark in what it does for recognition. It is one of our shorter bills. There are not too many short bills that get put through this place. They are usually longer and far more complex. But it is one of the shorter bills. It is one of our most easily read. It is also one that is easily understood, and it gives expression to that recognition. One of the other issues that I wanted to talk about was everybody involved with the expert panel, my parliamentary colleagues the honourable member for Hasluck, the honourable member for Lyne and the honourable Senator Rachel Siewert from Western Australia. The four of us worked together in a very cooperative way to ensure that we were able to have input into the expert panel with all of the other members and say, 'We're putting forward the views of representatives of the parliament and also of the major parties, minor parties and Independents.' We were able to do that. The work that came out of the expert panel is a fine piece of work, and it gave the parliament, the government and the opposition something to work with. And it also, for the first time, presented and gave us a way forward with mechanisms for that recognition in the Constitution. It fleshed out all of the legal issues and other issues around it. In working on the joint select committee on constitutional recognition, chaired by Senator Crossin, we approached our task, our work, in exactly that same way; in the spirit of cooperation and the spirit of working together to advance constitutional recognition. We have had a hearing, we have prepared a report and we have had our meetings and that spirit has prevailed, and that is the spirit that prevailed with the expert panel. The way forward relies on us working to come up with something that is absolutely satisfactory to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is essential. That is fundamental. That is a first and something that the Australian people can vote yes for. We, the expert panel, had a methodology. The methodology that we used had four planks to it. It was to contribute to a more unified and reconciled nation, to be of benefit to and to accord with the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, to be capable of being supported by an overwhelming majority of Australians from across the political and social spectrums, and to be technically and legally sound. The work the panel was able to do was across those four planks, including being technically and legally sound. We had the time to do that. I know that that sort of methodology, that approach, will be required to continue to make sure that we get to where we want to be, where I want to be and where I know a lot of people want to be at the end of this process. As tempted as I am to crow about who did what first and who was better at it, I do not want to impart that into this debate. I do not think that is helpful. I just think that we need to put our heads down and get on with the task we have been set. It is one of the most significant tasks that members of parliament and this parliament have been set in terms of an advancement in the relationship among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all Australians. With those words, I commend this bill to the House. and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (17:19): I firstly thank all of those who have also spoken on this important piece of legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People Recognition Bill 2012, which, if passed, will commit the parliament to placing before the Australian people at a referendum a proposal for constitutional change of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The principal purpose of this bill is to articulate the parliament's recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the original inhabitants of Australia and also their ongoing connection with their traditional lands and waters, cultures, languages and heritage. WhatI would like to do is contextualise this discussion. As you know, I am here as the member for Lingiari. I was first elected in 1987. Prior to my election to the seat of LingiariI worked as a policy adviser to the Central Land Council in Alice Springs. Prior to that I was a school teacher and prior that I was a researcher at the Australian National University on government programs and their impact on Aboriginal communities. In one way or another,",269,Bills
249,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Scienceeither directly or indirectly, I have been working with or for Aboriginal people for at least 35 years. Over that period many things have changed. I can recall in the eighties the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, which had as its spearheads Dr Nugget Coombs and Judith Wright. I remember the advancing discussion around the issue of a treaty and recognition in those days and the public discussion that took place around it. I recall well the period after 1976 and the introduction of the Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory. I also recall the struggle that took place in this parliament in the mid-eighties around the issue of national land rights. I recall the divisive nature of the debate. I recall the resistance from the mining sector principally; from conservative governments, including Brian Burke and the Labor government in Western Australia; and from other conservative elements within the community. I remember well the division. I remember well the demonstrations and rallies, of which I was a part, on the front steps of Old Parliament House, regaling the then Hawke Labor government about the importance of looking at a land rights model which did not jeopardise the principles of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act, which was seen as a precedent in principle for all land rights across this country recognising the inalienable right of Aboriginal people over their lands. That was not to be the prospect of the national land rights bill. Had the national land rights legislation been passed, we would have seen the erosion of rights previously given by this parliament in the Northern Territory, and that was not seen as acceptable. Ultimately, as we know, the national land rights bill never went anywhere. Subsequently I remember the discussions that took place around the formation of ATSIC. I remember the public rally and the discussion which took place around the 1988 Barunga Statement, which hangs so proudly in this parliament. The principles of that statement could well fit this bill. It talks about recognition. It talks about justice. It talks about understanding the imperatives of Aboriginal people, in this case from the Northern Territory. We can go back even further to the sixties and the bark petitions. This year is a significant anniversary of the bark petitions, which of course were a precursor to the discussion around land rights in this place, as well as the issues that arose at around a similar time-the treatment of Aboriginal people in the pastoral industry and the people who walked off Wave Hill et cetera. There is a whole combination of elements which go together to hear the voice of Aboriginal people screaming out for the recognition of rights and the recognition of justice over many years. I was either a very close observer or a participant in some of these things. The key element for me, though, was the way in which Aboriginal people so proudly and so justly argued their own case, and they did it with such great dignity, until finally this parliament was forced as a result of an action by a Torres Strait Islander in the High Court to once and for all get rid of the concept of terra nullius in the early 90s. We then had native title being recognised. Again, I remember the divisive nature of the debates here in this parliament, of which I was part. I remember vividly the entrenched opposition from vested interests outside this place who claimed the world was going to end. I remember the disgusting maps used by conservatives to advertise what the impact would be of native title if native title legislation was ever passed. Thank God it is now history. I remember well the eloquence of Paul Keating in his Redfern speech in 1992, and I will come to that a little later. For me, this is a really important piece of legislation for the people I represent. Over 40 per cent of my constituents are Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory-by far the largest proportion in any seat in this parliament. I am proud to represent them in this place and-let there be no doubt-I am here because of them in so many different ways. I have seen old men and old women who argued, for nearly four decades now, the justice of what we are now accepting as a principle in this parliament. Many of those old advocates, those people of great wisdom, have sadly passed and are no longer with us. But if they were here they would applaud the way in which this parliament has now come together around these issues. They would say, I am certain: 'This is the place we need to be to have our rights properly recognised, to see that we are getting recognition at last for who we are and for how important we are as a people, as part of the national community, as part of the national conversation and as part of our national narrative.' That, to me, is ultimately what this is about: to say to these old men and women, 'The sacrifices you have made in the past and the sacrifices which are being made now have been to some avail.' We now have in front of us this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill. I could not have imagined this a decade ago; in fact, quite possibly not even five or six years ago. But here we are in this place, people of goodwill, coming together to support this legislation. I thought I should refer more directly to that wonderful speech by Paul Keating. WhilstI will not read it all I do want to refer to a couple of elements of it. This is surely one of the great speeches made by any great leader in this country since federation, and certainly in terms of the cause of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their rights this is first among them. He said: And, as I say, the starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us non-Aboriginal Australians. It begins, I think, with the act of recognition. How right he was and how right he remains in the context of this piece of legislation. He referred to the Mabo judgement: By doing away with the bizarre conceit that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans, Mabo establishes a fundamental truth and lays the basis for justice. I agree and I think we now all agree. There is little division over this issue anymore. He described Mabo as 'an historic decision'. Then he said: The message should be that there is nothing to fear or to lose in the recognition of historical truth, or the extension of social justice, or the deepening of Australian social democracy to include indigenous Australians. There is everything to gain. How we know that now. Ultimately, later in this parliament we joined together in the Apology, which was so finely given by the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. The Apology again addressed this issue of our history and justice, the understanding of the sacrifice and the hurt of the stolen generations. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating in his speech: Where Aboriginal Australians have been included in the life of Australia they have made remarkable contributions. He also said in this speech: Ever so gradually we are learning how to see Australia through Aboriginal eyes, beginning to recognise the wisdom contained in their epic story. This is now a fundamental truth-something which is now beyond debate in this country. I want to conclude my contribution by reading the last 30 or 40 words from Paul Keating's speech: I said we non-indigenous Australians should try to imagine the Aboriginal view. It can't be too hard. Someone imagined this event today, and it is now a marvellous reality and a great reason for hope. There is one thing today we cannot imagine. We cannot imagine that the descendants of people whose genius and resilience maintained a culture here through fifty thousand years or more, through cataclysmic changes to the climate and environment, and who then survived two centuries of dispossession and abuse, will be denied their place in the modern Australian nation. We cannot imagine that. We cannot imagine that we will fail. And with the spirit that is here today I am confident that we won't. I am confident that we will succeed in this decade. We did not succeed in that decade but we will succeed in this decade. I think it is a tribute to this parliament that we have come across the aisle to support this very important piece of legislation that will, I hope, lead us to a referendum which will finally and once and for all give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the recognition, which is their just deserts. Debate adjourned. Courts and Tribunals Legislation Amendment (Administration) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. (Administration) Bill 2012 will change the administrative structures of the National Native Title Tribunal, the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The specific structural changes proposed by the bill are the transfer of the National Native Title Tribunal's appropriation, staff and some of its administrative functions to the Federal Court; amendment to the Native Title Act 1993 to reflect the fact that the National Native Title Tribunal is no longer a statutory agency for the purposes of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997-it being subsumed into the Federal Court-and the formalisation of the merger of the administrative functions of the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The bill implements recommendations of the Strategic Review of Small and Medium Agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio, known as the Skehill review, which was publicly released in June 2012. The changes which affect the National Native Title Tribunal are probably inevitable as a result of the passage of the Native Title Amendment Bill 2009, which noted the primary adjudicative role of the Federal Court and sought to integrate the",271,Bills
250,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (17:34,"The Courts and Tribunals Legislation Amendmenttribunal's alternative dispute resolution code with the court process. That bill had the coalition's support. As to the amendments affecting the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court, which has been changed to the Federal Circuit Court, the administrative merger occurred de facto in 2008 and 2009 in preparation for the government's planned abolition of the Federal Magistrates Court, which has now been abandoned. The purpose to merge the administration of the Federal Magistrates Court with that of the Family Court had its genesis back in the days of the Rudd government, which sought to abolish the Federal Magistrates Court altogether and merge it into the Family Court. As we know, the initiative failed and the coalition policy was ultimately adopted by the immediate past Attorney-General, Ms Roxon. As the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Brandis announced during the 2010 election campaign: One of the issues that has dogged this portfolio over the life of the Rudd-Gillard government is the fate of the Federal Magistrates Court. The Federal Magistrates Court was truly one of the success stories of the Howard government. It was established 1999 as a measure to enhance access to justice in the federal jurisdiction. Although it has jurisdiction over most matters arising under federal law, most of its work is in the family jurisdiction. The Labor government made a grave error of judgment when it sought to dismantle the Federal Magistrates Court. To deal with smaller cases quickly it is vital that there be a lower tier Commonwealth trial court. The coalition government will restore a second tier Commonwealth trial court to deal with smaller family, trade practices, industrial bankruptcy, tax and administrative law matters. It will be called the Federal Circuit Court. We expect it to become the principal trial court within the federal jurisdiction. Federal magistrates will be offered positions as judges of the Federal Circuit Court. The Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court will deal with the most complex trials. That is a direct quote from the coalition policy. The Federal Magistrates Court was established by the Howard government in 1999 in order to provide for timely, efficient and less formal adjudication of disputes in the federal jurisdiction. Since its establishment it has been very successful. In 2011-12 it finalised over 92,000 matters, which included family law, industrial, migration, admiralty, bankruptcy, administrative law and consumer protection. The court now deals with 85 per cent of all family law matters, up from 60 per cent in 2004. Eighty-three per cent of all applications filed are completed within six months, and 95 per cent within 12 months. It is a testament to the court's efficiency. Despite this, the Rudd and Gillard governments have sought since 2008 to abolish the court. One of the first acts of the Rudd-Gillard government in the Attorney-General's portfolio was to commission the Semple review of the federal courts, which recommended that the Federal Magistrates Court be abolished and reconstituted as a separate lower division of the Family Court and the Federal Court. This plan, disclosure of which the government resisted throughout 2008, and most colourfully justified by reference to a dispute over biscuits in a tea room shared with the Family Court, was finally released in December of that year. The government accepted its recommendations in February 2009. However, these proposals received almost no support from any arm of the federal judiciary and none at all from federal magistrates, who themselves rightly feared that the culture of innovation and efficiency that it had built up to the benefit of all its stakeholders since its establishment would be lost in the more procedurally focused Family Court. The alternative proposal, the one represented by this bill, which the coalition announced in 2010, was widely reported to have the endorsement of the federal judiciary. Last year the then Attorney-General conceded defeat and instead proposed that the court be maintained under a new name to reflect its expanded workload and jurisdiction. In doing so she has accepted the policy announced by the coalition in the 2010 election, including the very nomenclature the shadow Attorney-General proposed. The change of name which the coalition proposed and which the government has adopted is appropriate for two reasons. First, the Federal Magistrates Court is already a circuit court in the true sense of the word. It has 13 principal locations and 35 circuit locations throughout Australia. Circuit settings are regularly conducted in such locations as Broken Hill, Dubbo, Coffs Harbour, Alice Springs, Bundaberg, Ipswich, Maroochydore, Mount Gambier, Burnie, Ballarat, Mildura and Shepparton. In 2011-12 the court allocated approximately 145 weeks to its circuit program. This is an extremely valuable service allowing parties to have their matters heard and determined without the need to travel to major centres. Second, having regard to the breadth and complexity and monetary limit of its jurisdiction, it now seems misleading to describe this body as a Magistrates Court. At its establishment it seemed an appropriate descriptor, inviting comparison with the quick and less formal state and territory magistrates. However the success of the model and the consequent expansion of its jurisdiction required a proper recognition of the work of its 61 judicial officers. However-and this has always been the way for this government-there is a gap between rhetoric and reality. For 2011-12 the court reported an operating deficit of more than $3½ million. The court has reported ongoing pressure on its operational budget despite what it describes as 'significant initiatives' to reduce costs and generate efficiencies. It has been unable to manage its work on the funds that the government has provided to it without spasmodic emergency injections. On 14 December last year the Australian newspaper quoted the court's CEO, Mr Foster, as saying: Over the past several years, the courts have been operating at a loss ... Despite implementing many cost-cutting initiatives, the point had been reached where in order to balance the budget in 2012-13, it would no longer be possible to continue the provision of many existing services, such as maintenance of regional registries, circuits and the use of family reports in parenting cases. Replacement of judicial officers could not be afforded without further impinging on other services. In other words, what the government now recognises as the reason for the court's existence, its circuit program, was at risk as a result of the attrition of four years of a government seemingly hostile to its very existence. Thankfully, the emergency funding has now been allocated, but this is no way to fund the judicial arm of government. The courts cannot be treated as a mere program to be funded or defunded depending on the way the political and budgetary whims are blowing. Senator Brandis wrote about this back in June 2012 when he said: … all the federal courts have been running at a deficit and are projected to do so for the next four years. The chief executives of the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court disclosed to the Senate Legal Affairs Estimates Committee last week that, in order to comply with Department of Finance stipulations that the courts bring their budgets back into balance, the already stressed services the courts provide will be cut back even further. And in a move that will only make a bad situation worse, the budget announced increases in court filing fees-the very threshold of access to justice-by a total of $76.9 million over four years. Incidentally, the description in the budget papers of this measure was penned in language of which Sir Humphrey would have been proud: 'The government will reform court fees to better reflect the capacity of different types of litigants to pay. The reforms will send more appropriate price signals to court users.' AndI believe that my distinguished colleague, the former Attorney-General, will be saying something more broadly about the use of the word 'reform' for such measures as these, and I would agree with him that that is a much overused word when you are talking about something that is just blatantly a price increase. When you are increasing the price of the access to justice, then clearly that is not about enhancing that access to justice. To do this is really to proclaim to the world the Gillard government's deep indifference to freedom of information. Government senators used every procedural trick in the book to suppress production of the Skehill report, written by a former secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, which reads like a vivisector's guide to the future of the federal judiciary. The Gillard government's attitude to accessible justice is to charge more and provide less. Not only does this make a mockery of the government's self-serving rhetoric; it reflects a more disturbing approach and a fundamental disrespect to the separation of powers. The courts are not an agency of the executive government and they should not be treated as such. They are a separate institution of government and they must be sufficiently resourced to perform their constitutional functions and preserve their constitutional integrity. The coalition is deeply supportive of the work of the federal courts and their place within the Constitution of Australia. The work of the federal magistrates-or, as they shall soon be known, the judges of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia-has shown the value of the Howard government's vision of a court to provide the greatest possible access to justice in the federal jurisdiction. As I have previously said, the CEO of the Family Court has also been the acting CEO of the Federal Magistrates Court since November 2008. Mr Foster has been examined in Senate estimates about the potential for conflict in the concurrent performance of these two roles, and he maintains that it has been working satisfactorily. However, both courts are operating in deficit and have been the recipients of urgent supplementary funding this year so that essential operations such as the circuit sittings that I mentioned previously can continue. In any environment where Mr Foster must consider when to rob Peter to pay Paul, a Senate committee inquiry will take the opportunity for more detailed consideration of the effectiveness of the joint administration and whether there is a sustainable funding model for these courts. That committee reports later on this month, and at that time the coalition will consider whether amendments are necessary. In the meantime, the coalition does not oppose the bill that we are discussing here today. This bill has been referred, as I said, to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. When that committee reports on 23 February, the coalition reserves the right to move amendments in the Senate based on what the committee findings might be. But, in the absence of that committee reporting at this stage, the opposition does support the passage of this bill through this chamber. Legislation Amendment (Administration) Bill 2012. The genesis of this bill lies in the folly of the Howard coalition government and their difficulties in terms of their challenges and travails with the then Chief Justice of the Family Court, Alastair Nicholson, in response to efforts made by the Family Court in relation to making procedures simpler in terms of rules and regulations, the establishment of judicial registrars and a greater emphasis on mediation, conciliation conferences and the like. From an ideological point of view, the coalition government established a Federal Magistrates Court which involved duplication of many services and a duplication of jurisdiction. I remember sitting down at a family law conference over in New Zealand, explaining to some family lawyers in Christchurch over a cup of coffee the idiocies of our jurisdiction with respect to the Family Court. They were just bewildered about it. So let's not get this idea that somehow we had a sort of legal nirvana under the Howard coalition government. They established a real problem in the overlapping jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court and the Family Court. Anyone that practised in that jurisdiction and any litigant that went in there knew that you got moved from pillar to post. There was a duplication of administration, there was a different culture and there were different rules, and that was a real problem. So we said we would look at a review of it. So the then Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, announced that there would be a review into this. That review came back. It was done by the Attorney-General's Department in conjunction with Mr Des Semple, and they said that the current situation was financially unsustainable. That was announced back in 2009, not long after we got in. There were inefficiencies in administration. There were problems that were found in the delivery of family law services to Australians. There were challenges in terms of culture. There were a whole host of problems that were created by the Howard coalition government in terms of what they did with the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Court. So there were further reviews in relation to this. There were some other challenges that we faced in terms of knowing where to go on this. So the Skehill report was established and undertaken to look at a strategic view overall about what should happen in terms of the performance of government programs against policy and examination of the federal court system in this country-the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. It was found by Skehill that in fact there were predicted deficits in relation to these courts. The report was projecting a deficit of about $19.5 million, or around eight per cent of the combined forward estimates appropriations to 2014-15. What was the response? The response was that we decided to go down a different path. The previous speaker talked about a circuit court-to rename the Federal Magistrates Court to reflect what is reality and to recognise that federal magistrates are in fact judges. There were other challenges in this jurisdiction, but we know that if you were a litigant and you went to, say, the Commonwealth Law Courts Building in Brisbane, at North Quay, in order to lodge your application and you were not sure what to do-you had different forms for different courts and different registries-there were real problems. Fortunately, to a certain extent this was overcome by practical application. My experience was that there were real problems of imperialism in administration: one administration taking others. There were problems in terms of which part of the building they were in: who had jurisdiction? I saw",274,Bills
251,Mr Neumann (Blair) (17:46,"I speak in support of the Courts and Tribunalsjudges referring matters to federal magistrates who said that they were the fount of all wisdom. There was real hostility in this area. So we had to have a change of culture. I think the practical merging of administration solved that problem to a large extent. What we have seen with respect to this legislation is a change in the shared administration from a legal point of view. They have had a single chief executive officer since 2009, which I think has gone some way. Lawyers who practise in this jurisdiction tell me that there have been improvements in relation to this, but I am telling you that there were real problems before that. Let's not get into the idea that somehow there was a new Jerusalem when the Federal Magistrates Court was established by the Howard coalition government, because that is not the experience for litigants and the lawyers who practise in the jurisdiction. This particular piece of legislation was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. The report was tabled by the member for Moreton today as chair of the committee. It recommended that this particular piece of legislation be passed by the House and that the Attorney-General, in accordance with native title legislation and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission, include a yearly report on the operation of the Native Title Act 1993, particularly concerning the functioning of the Native Title Tribunal, in relation to adequacy, expertise and, certainly, human rights. I want to make this point: last Friday, at the National Centre of Indigenous Excellence in Redfern, we had a roundtable with the National Farmers Federation; the Native Title Tribunal; Fortescue Metals; BHP Billiton; the Attorney-General's Department; FaHCSIA; the Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda; lawyers who practise in this jurisdiction; people from the left, the right and the centre; and Callithumpians-we had the whole lot. We had so many people at the roundtable. The member for Moreton was also there. The general consensus was that there was need for reform with respect to native title in this country-that since the Mabo native title legislation has been in operation, there has been a need for comprehensive review of the legislation. It has been in operation for about 20 years. That was the consensus. It did not matter whether you were a representative from a mining company or an Indigenous person, that was the case. The recommendation of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, of which the member for Moreton and I happen to be members-he is chair of that one and I am chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs-was that we do a comprehensive review of native title. That is what the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs recommended when examining the legislation before the chamber today. As a member of that committee, I strongly recommend that the government look at the native title legislation. We have had looked at bits and pieces. At the moment, the ATSIA standing committee are looking at the good-faith provision, the reversal of the onus of proof, the resurrection of extinguishment of native title and also Indigenous land use agreements. So we are looking at bits and pieces, but we are not looking at it in a comprehensive way. The Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs recommended that the government take an opportunity. I use the opportunity in making this speech on this legislation to recommend to the government that we do so. There are changes made by this bill facilitating the transfer of the National Native Title Tribunal's appropriation, staff and some administrative functions to the Federal Court of Australia, reflecting that the NNTT is no longer a statutory agency for the purposes of the Financial Management and Accountability Act. Skehill recommended some ways to improve the value for money for the government in terms of the discharge of functions. I think this is a sensible measure in that regard. You are never going to get a perfect legal system. You are never going to get a system which solves every inefficiency. You can do what you can do to improve access to justice. I think the proposed amendments do that in this regard. I think they put in place, from a legal point of view, that which was so clear such a long time ago. On the National Native Title Tribunal, there were submissions made to the social policy and legal affairs committee by the registrar and CEO of the Federal Court of Australia and a number of other entities to address concerns particularly in terms of the amendments and the difficulties in terms of native title processing in this country. We have a situation where it takes an inordinate amount of time for native title claims to be dealt with. We have improved that by transferring some of the mediation processes to the Federal Court and improving the streamlining of that, and the former Attorney-General mentioned that. The issue of processing this in a more expeditious way was raised in detail last Friday in Redfern. It is something the government really needs to have a look at. There have been concerns in the past in terms of the cultures of the NNTC, the Federal Magistrates Court and the Family Court. I think we have addressed that through the merging of certain entities but also in terms of making sure that those entities are staffed with appropriate people. Not every appointment is as good as we would like, but certainly there are appointments in the last couple of years which have been better appointments. It has now been over 20 years since Mabo. We heard in our legal and constitutional affairs advisory report inquiry that there were 211 native title claims on the Native Title Register and about 166 determinations that native title exists, but it would take decades, we found, for all of these claims to be dealt with. We have to look at how we do this better in this country. We cannot have people who feel they have a native title claim being held up for that time. We have got to make improvements. According to what we have seen, I think there will be some savings. We had some evidence from the Chief Executive Officer of the Family Court, who is also the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Magistrates Court, that about $7.8 million has been saved by removing the duplication of structures and making changes. They are worthy improvements. But, as said before, there were initial cultural differences and obviously there was some inevitability in those challenges. But they will have improved, I am told. That is certainly the evidence we got from those people who made submissions to the inquiry and it is the evidence that I have received anecdotally from friends and acquaintances who practise in this jurisdiction and continue to do so. I support the legislation. I think it is worthy of support and will make an improvement. There are things we can do in the future that will benefit both native title and family law, and we should always be vigilant about improving access to justice because that is what we should do in our role as parliamentarians. intend to make some observations about the proposals before us. I note that the member who is on our side, the shadow minister who spoke before me, prefaced my concern about the use of the word 'reform' for what are often changes. I note that the word 'reform' is very loosely",278,Bills
252,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (17:59,"I do not speak often in relation to these bills but I doused. When I looked at some of the statements as to what was being intended in this legislation, that was brought home to me. I saw some observations before the Senate committee summarising what is being done on this occasion. Schedule1 of the bill formalises the implementation of native title institutional reforms-I would say 'changes'-which commenced with amendments to the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 1997 from July last year. It folds the tribunal into the Federal Court as a statutory agency and makes consequential amendments to the government's financial and annual reporting frameworks. The amendments remove the legal risk and provide clarity for agencies and stakeholders. The amendments not only generate savings but result in a better alignment and allocation of functions and a clearer focus of increasing the rate of claims resolution. These legitimate legislative amendments are supported by administrative arrangements such as a memorandum of understanding between the agencies to enable the tribunal to continue performance functions in a way that is consistent with its status in the independent statutory authority. I make mention of that because I do have enormous respect for Graham Neate, who was the President of the Native Title Tribunal. I saw the role that the body carried out over a long period as being positive. I saw it as being the specialised body. I must say I was troubled, when I was attorney, at the way in which in the Federal Court there was often a desire by judges who bring themselves to these matters-sometimes frequently but sometimes not so often-to want to appoint people that they thought might mediate, and they would not always go to the Native Title Tribunal, the specialist body. I do not know why that was always sought in that way. I tried to have an inquiry into the better way forward, and the advice that was given to me at that time, which I acted upon, was to require the courts to use the Native Title Tribunal. Graham Neate is reported as saying that the tribunal had several Indigenous staff members and had built up extensive experience in resolving native title claims and that he hoped that this knowledge would not be lost. I thought they were very appropriate observations and comments. I suspect there is a degree of trying to reinvent the wheel under the guise of reform, which can, I think, jeopardise the ability to get the full value that you can out of a body with that experience. I noted what my colleague the member for Blair had to say about the difficulties in getting resolution of native title claims. My experience was with people who were involved in this area. The present High Court Chief Justice was involved with me, when he was a Federal Court judge, in looking at ways and means in which we could expedite consideration of these matters. One of the major problems with the large number of claims that had to be dealt with was the inadequate number of people with anthropological experience able to give advice to the states and to give advice to the applicants to enable matters to be progressed quickly. I do not know whether that has changed. I understand there were very few universities that were actually training anthropologists and producing that expertise. I know the desire to get these matters resolved and resolved quickly, but I do not think it is always the institutional arrangements which we are fiddling with. Often it is matters that we do not even give attention to. The need for anthropological expertise is something that I attach a great deal of importance to. I note that the departmental officials commenting on these matters spoke of schedule 2 as amending the Family Law Act and the Magistrates Act: … to ensure that these acts are compatible with the courts operating under shared administration with a single chief executive officer. The Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court have been operating under shared administration, including a single chief executive officer, since 2009. The move to a shared administration was a joint decision taken by the two courts. Mr Skehill found that the shared administration arrangements have been a genuine success. As a result, he recommended that the previously proposed restructure of the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court should not proceed but that the shared administration arrangements be formalised. That is what we are dealing with in relation to this legislation. The legislation, as the shadow minister said, is not opposed at this stage but there are Senate committee deliberations; there may be amendments that suggest themselves out of that which we are not foreclosing at this time. I turn to the comments of the member for Blair because he is an experienced family law practitioner but he seemed to have a fond view of the Family Court under former Chief Justice Nicholson. He said that as a practitioner, but there are mixed views about the performance of the court involving practitioners. I think it has a lot to do with the way in which the court was first established. I am going to tell you a little story about a former judge from Sydney, Ray Watson. My father taught him at Penrith High School. He was an adviser to Murphy as the Attorney General in relation to the Family Court Act, and Ray Watson, I think, saw himself as the real architect. He has been unwell in recent times and is very fragile in a nursing home in my electorate. I fondly remember him giving some advice when I chaired a select committee reviewing the Family Law Act. He said I should go and see what happened in Alberta, Canada. There, I would find a Family Court that had court counsellors, and I would understand the model he had developed for our Family Court with court counsellors. He argued very strongly the case for the Family Court to be managing the process of trying to get independent advice on family circumstances through the court counselling model. There was a magistrate in Sydney called Reg Bartley who ran the Children's Court, often dealing with family issues before they would become real issues before the Family Court. He would say to me: 'I can never get a counsellor from the Family Court because they hang onto them; they are their own. They have all the time to be able to use them and they'll use them fully, and we can't get access.' I went to Canada and met Judge Marjorie Bowker of the Family Court of Alberta, and I discovered something: the Family Court of Alberta was the equivalent of our Children's Court of New South Wales. Divorce was not dealt with before the Family Court of Alberta: it was dealt with in the Court of Queen's Bench. I was surprised Ray Watson did not know all of this. When I came back it struck me: here is the most junior court, the Magistrates Court, dealing at a grassroots level with these issues that needed the help, and the Family Court was building up a bureaucracy of its own. As a practitioner I was never one who would want to argue a case if it were possible to settle it. I regret that not all practitioners see it the same way. Some see these issues as matters that you should pursue until you have spent the last dollar that your client has. I do not think it does the profession much for its reputation. For me, I wanted to see more practitioners who were trying to find alternative dispute mechanisms. I very strongly supported the setting up of the separate bodies to advise people on family issues and requiring people to get counselling before they even got into the court. In my view, if you were going to try and resolve an issue you needed to do it before people became entrenched. I think we do have some cultural problems in our family law system and I am not sure that the Family Court of Australia, which deals with a very small proportion of the case loads now, fully understands that. I think the complexity that has developed, the legalism that has been brought into family law disputes, is very troubling. I very much disagree with the member for Blair in relation to the observations he made about the way in which the Magistrates Court has worked. I think it has been extraordinarily successful. You only need to look at the numbers of cases that are resolved before the Magistrates Court to understand that it has played a very significant role. It may well be that the Family Court has been so structured that it is only receiving the most complex of all the issues that the courts might have to deal with; it may be that those are the only ones that are getting before it. But, actually, when you look at the workloads you would be surprised: if you go into Sydney most of the matters are dealt with before the Family Court; if you get out into the suburbs they are being dealt with by the magistrates. I think we have been greatly served and I think the magistrates do feel a little aggrieved that this tremendous load that they have assumed, which they have dealt with very successfully, has not been fully recognised. I think the renaming of the court as the Federal Circuit Court will help in maintaining that degree of commitment that the magistrates have brought to the process of dealing with family law issues. I hope, in the way in which these issues are being dealt with, we are not seeing our institutions attacked for the purposes of delivering administrative savings because the government's priorities for expenditure are elsewhere. I saw some news reports today suggesting, for instance, that there has been a very significant reduction in numbers of Federal Court judges. It seems to me that the reduction in Federal Court judges is occurring in order to produce savings. It was interesting to me that the Chief Judge of the Federal Court-about to retire and be appointed as a member of the High Court of Australia-was simply drawing attention to the potential, if it continues, for the court and its standards to be diminished. I think that would be very unfortunate. There have been some issues of conflict between the magistracy and the Family Court. I would like to commend all of our courts because I think the separation of powers and the quality of our justice are particularly outstanding. But I do not think the way in which the government is pursuing reforms simply for the sake of change, if it impacts adversely on these institutions, is in our national interest. I do not speak often in these matters, but I have enormous respect for the people that I dealt with when I was Attorney and I am troubled about some of the pressures that they have been placed under as the government is seeking to get reductions of expenditure through some of the mechanisms that we have seen, even introduced in this legislation, which we are not opposing. member for Moreton.

I am less inclined to thank the member for Stirling for his contribution-certainly not when he started moving on to what the opposition spokesperson Senator Brandis had to contribute on this piece of legislation. For me, Senator Brandis is to appropriate commentary on sub judice matters what Mal Meninga was to celebrity political careers: he did not have a lot to contribute-although as a member from New South Wales, Mr Deputy Speaker Windsor, you would appreciate that Mal Meninga, having given up his political career, then moved to Queensland and coached us to seven State of Origin wins in a row. I am sure you would appreciate that he did have something to contribute. Politics' loss was Queensland's gain. But I wonder about the role of the opposition spokesperson Senator Brandis. It is a bit of a scary proposition, the idea of him being the nation's first law officer-big shoes to fill for those opposite. I am not sure that he would be able to. At least he would not have to give advice to himself; he would have a department to give him advice, rather than that Brandis on Brandis stuff which he is often keen to quote. The bill before the chamber proposes reforms to the administrative structures and processes of the National Native Title Tribunal, the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia. These reforms have been presented as a means to improve the operations of the affected bodies and achieve savings. Both the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee that I chair have supported-unanimously, I understand-the legislation's intent. The bill implements recommendations of the Skehill review of small and medium agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio. The bill will make significant improvements to the administrative structures and processes of the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the National Native Title Tribunal and will allow these agencies to realise significant savings through reduced duplication and more efficient administration. In particular, the bill makes legislative amendments to facilitate the merger of the administrative functions of the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court of Australiawhich I understand is already happening-including by recognising a single chief executive officer position for the two courts. It will facilitate the transfer of the National Native Title Tribunal's administrative functions, appropriations and staff to the Federal Court of Australia and reflect that the National Native Title Tribunal is no longer a proscribed agency for the purposes of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. This transfer is widely supported by stakeholders, as I saw both in my capacity as chair of the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee and its engagement and in other research. It is widely supported as a means to speed up native title consent orders and determinations, which would be a good thing for this nation. It has also been the subject of extensive transition planning to ensure no current matters are delayed. The Skehill review commented that the continuing existence of the NNTT could be seen by stakeholders as being very important, and abolishing it without being able to demonstrate a better substantive outcome could jeopardise the functioning of the native title system as a whole; therefore, the report recommended that the NNTT remain as a separate entity although its mediation function resources should be transferred to the Federal Court. This bill is predominantly finalised in providing the legislative authority for a number of arrangements already in place or well advanced. As I said, the courts, the tribunal and the Attorney-General's Department have been working together over some time to implement the reforms. I would particularly like to commend them on their consultation with their employees. It was a very well-managed change process. I know it can be quite stressful when the cultures of different organisations come together but it appears to have been managed very well with a lot of consultation with employees-although I am also hopeful of a later external review to be undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office at an appropriate point in time. This would provide reassurance that the anticipated benefits in terms of efficiency and effectiveness of the affected courts and tribunals have been achieved, something touched on by the Father of the House in his speech as well. Obviously, this is in addition to the annual reports and Senate estimates. My committee also asked the Attorney-General to direct the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda, and his team to report on the adequacy of the services being provided by the National Native Title Tribunal. I could talk about this in a lot more detail, but I see the member for Braddon and the parliamentary secretary in his capacity of representing the Attorney-General is here-the man more suited than anyone else in this parliament to speak like Rumpole of the Bailey. I look forward to hearing from him and I commend the legislation to the chamber. Forestry) (18:20): I speak on behalf of the new Attorney-General, the Hon. Mark Dreyfus, whom I would like to congratulate. I thank the four honourable members for their contribution to this debate. While changes to the administrative structures of the federal judicial and tribunal may not capture the imagination in the way some other bills do, it is nevertheless an important piece of legislation-as other speakers have already outlined-to ensure our courts and tribunals function as efficiently as possible. The Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court-soon to be called the Federal Circuit Court-the Federal Court and the National Native Title Tribunal all play a vital role in Australia's decision-making system. These amendments streamline their administrative processes while ensuring they retain their distinctive identities, and these reforms implement recommendations made by Mr Stephen Skehill in his recent review of all the Attorney-General portfolio's small and medium agencies. By facilitating the transfer of the Native Title Tribunal's appropriations, staff and some of its administrative functions to the Federal Court and by formalising the merger of the administrations of the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court, the government's aim is to ensure the focus of these organisations is on court and tribunal users. In combination with the additional funding of $38 million going to our courts-which the former Attorney General announced in September-these changes will put our federal courts on a much sounder fiscal footing. Our courts and tribunals will be able to focus much more closely on maintaining and improving services-whether that be regional circuit work, native title mediations, claims determinations and future act activities, finalisation times and registry services. On behalf of the Attorney-General, I thank the Chief Justices of the Federal and Family Courts, the Chief Federal Magistrate and the President of the NNTT for their assistance and cooperation throughout this process. The Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court",283,Bills
255,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon,"Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries andhave worked cooperatively since 2009 to combine their administrations, an initiative recognised and supported by Mr Skehill in his report. As the courts' initiative has been successful, the bill's purpose is to clarify and formalise this arrangement, rather than to fundamentally change the way the courts operate. The bill will allow the courts to make significant improvements to their administrative arrangements, while ensuring that courts retain their separate and distinct identities. During the consultation for this particular bill, the Family Court Chief Justice and the Chief Federal Magistrate raised some further potential improvements to the structure and processes of their courts. The government is maintaining an open dialogue with the courts about possible future reforms. It is clear that such reform is an iterative process, and we need to ensure that courts keep pace with the community they serve. But the government's immediate priority is on reforms that directly benefit court users through efficient, swift and responsive courts. The NNTT changes, which this legislation supports, are more recent but have been conducted in a similarly positive and expeditious manner. Amendments to the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 1997 that commenced on 1 July 2012 consolidated the NNTT with the Federal Court as a single prescribed agency. At the same time the NNTT's budget appropriation and its corporate services staff were also transferred to the Federal Court. This bill will finalise this implementation process. These changes are expected to generate $19 million in savings over the next four years by reducing unnecessary duplication across the courts and the NNTT. In the case of the NNTT, the changes enable it to work more closely with the Federal Court, with respect to priorities, reporting and the performance of the complementary and independent functions, ultimately achieving better native title outcomes for all native title stakeholders. The amendments also complement the government's 2009 reforms to the Native Title Act, which gave the Federal Court a central role in managing native title claims. Since those reforms the rate of consent determinations has increased almost fourfold. In discussions on the bill, the heads of jurisdiction and the president of the NNTT recognise the need to progress structural change quickly. This is an important reform, but they understand that it is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The government's and the courts' joint focus is on how to improve functionality and users' experiences when they interact with the courts and the tribunal. This bill represents an important part of the government's court reform package which includes, amongst other things: implementing the name change from the Federal Magistrates Court to the Federal Circuit Court and retitling magistrates as judges to better reflect the court's role in the federal judicial system; bedding down the judicial complaints framework which was recently passed by parliament to provide a more transparent and understandable way to raise complaints about judicial officers; ensuring the additional $38 million in court funding goes directly to maintaining and improving court services; implementing new court fee levels to better reflect capacity of different litigants to pay, such as higher fees for large corporations and government departments, balanced by the reintroduction of fee waivers and exemptions for disadvantaged litigants; and, to complete, passing legislation to establish the new Military Court of Australia to deal with serious service charges against ADF personnel. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Yousafzai, Miss Malala Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Tony Smith: That this House: (1) condemns the contemptible act of attempted murder committed on 9 October 2012 by Taliban terrorists who boarded a school bus in the Pakistani town of Mingora, sought out 14 year old schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai by name and shot her point blank in the head and neck; (2) applauds Ms Yousafzai's advocacy on behalf of gender equality in Pakistan; (3) expresses particular admiration for Ms Yousafzai's public speaking debut in September 2008 when, at the tender age of 11 years, she declared in a speech to the media in Peshawar, Pakistan: 'How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?'; (4) notes media reports that the Taliban have openly claimed responsibility for this despicable attack on Ms Yousafzai and have threatened to try again to assassinate her at the first available opportunity; and (5) wishes Ms Yousafzai a speedy and complete recovery from her injuries. subdivided into two general categories known by Latin terms: malum prohibitum and malum in se. The Oxford English Dictionary defines 'malum prohibitum' as: Something which is not intrinsically wicked but which is regarded as wrong because it contravenes a law or regulation. Tossing an orange peel out of your car window, for example, is littering and illegal, but we all agree it is not an act so vile as to incite a rebellion of our moral sensibilities. By contrast, 'malum in se' translates into English as 'evil in and of itself', an action so inherently depraved that no law is required to deem it or tell us it is an abomination. This motion calls upon the House to condemn the mother of all mala in se. It calls upon this House to denounce the attack on Malala Yousafzai as a crime so incontestably heinous, so irreducibly vicious, that its perpetrators are consigned to the dark netherworld of barbarism. As we grapple with our detestation of this atrocity, we might wonder how anyone might become so warped as to commit it. We might ponder what foul fires of fanaticism could so incinerate the human soul as to mark a helpless teenage girl out for death. The answer to that question is found within a tragic truth of our time. It is found within the medieval doctrines of Talibanism that seek to bludgeon the world into the heart of a gothic darkness. Central to this totalitarian mindset is the belief that women must be kept subservient, subordinate and illiterate. But it was an outright refusal to accept the subjugation of her gender that caused Malala to fall afoul of the Taliban. She has been a wonderful advocate for female equality, growing up in the Swat Valley, ground zero of Pakistan's jihadi insurgency. She saw first hand the violent campaign to terrorise girls schools into closure. But Malala refused to submit to Taliban thuggery. In a televised address before the Peshawar Press Club, she issued a defiant challenge to the barbarians who sought to rob her of the future simply because of who she was. She said:",285,Bills
256,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (18:27,"Wrongful acts in English Common Law can beHow dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education? Her audience of hard-bitten journalists was awed by the appearance of a young girl, at that point not even in her teens, who combined courage and eloquence in equal measure. The BBC was impressed enough to offer her a column on the network's Urdu website. In January 2009, Malala penned her first piece, describing her intention to defy a Taliban edict that forbade girls from attending school. Relating how her principal advised students to refrain from coming to school in uniform or colourful clothes, she wrote: I decided to wear my favourite pink dress. Through that small act of rebellion, Malala placed another stone in that palisade of ideas that defends liberty from the encroachments of tyranny. Needless to say, the Taliban took extreme exception to this adolescent advocate for female freedom. These jihadi barbarians responded through the only language they understand: they placed Malala in the crosshairs of their hit list. In October last year, Taliban assassins finally caught up with Malala as she was doing what she does best-furthering her education. They waylaid her school bus as she was coming home from class and forced their way aboard at gunpoint. Malala was armed with schoolbooks and they, of course, were armed with guns. After identifying her by name, they shot her without mercy, leaving her for dead. But die she did not. It was touch and go for a while and Malala was flown to the UK for surgery. Happily, as we all know in this place, she is well on the road to recovery. In fact, just last week Malala gave her first televised interview since being attacked last October. She described the myriad notes of benediction received from people across the world, saying: Because of these prayers, God has given me this new life and this is a second life. I want to serve the people and I want every girl, every child, to be educated … A fortnight ago, Malala was nominated for the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize by three members of the Norwegian parliament. I cannot think of a more worthy recipient. I applaud this initiative by our Scandinavian colleagues, and I believe the House does well tonight by expressing its words of admiration for Malala Yousafzai. Malala's father, Zia Yousafzai, himself a school principal and advocate for female education, is also worthy of our greatest respect. We should all be humbled by the example of this young hero's bravery and integrity. I know I am, and I know that those speaking on this motion are as well. Ms SAFFIN (Page-Government Whip) (18:35): I would like to thank the honourable member for Casey for bringing this motion before the parliament so that all members, representing everyone, can speak in this House in a way that gives support to Malala Yousufzai, to this one girl, but also supports the rights of girls and women to education and to equality across the world. The honourable member for Casey just thanked the Norwegian parliamentarians for nominating Malala for the Nobel Peace Prize, and we can also do that as well as members of parliament, so that might be something that we can have a conversation about later. She would be a most worthy recipient. It was on 9 October that Malala was shot by the Pakistani Taliban, or the Tehrik-iTaliban-the TTP, as they are called-while climbing onto a school bus. Can you imagine sending your daughter or your child off to school on a school bus and they are shot by some very, very extreme people? Pakistani media reported that two of Malala's classmates were also injured in the shooting, and I am not sure what happened to them but it would be good to find out. Malala grew to prominence by writing an online diary on BBC Urdu about her time in the Swat Valley during Taliban rule in the area, which was late 2007 to mid-2009. I note that her father had also been involved in education activism as well, so obviously education was something that her family was committed to. Following the Taliban's displacement from the area, Malala continued to be an activist for education and youth rights in the Swat Valley and in Pakistan. As a result of her efforts, she was one of five nominees for the International Children's Peace Prize in 2011 and she also won the inaugural Pakistan National Peace Award in December 2011. After she was shot, she was medically evacuated to the United Kingdom for specialist treatment in Birmingham and her prognosis looked very grave indeed. I think that everybody has been heartened by and is so pleased to see her remarkable recovery. On2 February this year Malala successfully underwent major surgery, including a cranial reconstruction aimed at mending parts of her skull with a titanium plate as well as the placement of a cochlear implant designed to restore hearing on her left side. Her injuries were horrific. She will continue her rehabilitation at the family's new temporary home in Birmingham. I understand that her father is now working there and working in their consulate, and they have relocated there. He is education attache at the Pakistan consulate in Birmingham for a period of three years. That means that all of the family are together and they are able to look after each other. The Pakistan Taliban, or the TTP, have claimed responsibility for the attack, with the spokesperson, Ehsanullah Ehsan, saying that Malala was pro-West, she was speaking against the Taliban and she was calling President Obama her idol. She was young, but she was promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas. Ehsan went on to say that the attack served as a warning to all youngsters involved in similar activities, and noted that Malala would be targeted again if she survived. The Pakistan Taliban have vowed to target her again. I did notice, in reading some of the commentary on the internet, that it seemed as though they had started to change what they were saying, but the fact is that they took responsibility-they did it. It is just unbelievable. In a speech to mark the inaugural International Day of the Girl Child on Wednesday, 10 October last year, Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her shock at the attack and her admiration for Malala's activism and commitment to girls' rights in education. As I have said, we all expressed our shock. I have never seen anything draw such widespread condemnation so quickly and right across the globe. President Zardari has been reported in Pakistan media as saying that such attacks would not shape the resolve of Pakistan and that the nation would continue to fight against the militants, and that was welcome too. Also, the Interior Minister, Rehman Malik, has vowed to bring to justice the Taliban attackers behind Malala's shooting, saying, 'No matter where the terrorists may escape, we will bring them to justice.' But, despite reports of several arrests being made in connection with the attack, there is no evidence yet of those who actually committed the attack being brought to justice, and I know that is something that people will be watching quite closely. Among the comments that were made worldwide was a statement by the White House on behalf of the President. There were also comments by the EU and the UK-already quoted here. The UN Secretary-General's United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, called for a global day of action on 10 November 2012 to support the goal of education for all children, and that became known as Malala Day. That was commemorated in over 100 countries. That was a way that all of us in the international community could join hands and give an expression of support for her and support for the right of girls, particularly, to have access to education freely and in a framework of not being seen as somehow deviant. For God's sake, it is unbelievable to think that someone would get shot for it in this day and age. Malala has been the recipient of several international awards and accolades since the attack, including the Simone de Beauvoir Prize for Women's Freedom and the Rome Prize for Peace and Humanitarian Action. Malala's plight is now regularly evoked in major international meetings, such as the recent World Economic Forum in Davos and meetings of the United Nations and specialised agencies. Indeed, at the moment we are talking in this place about Malala and what happened to her. I will speak a little on how our government responded at the time. They obviously responded strongly and were appalled at what I call an attempted assassination of child activist Malala in western Pakistan. The government said at the time that they commended the Pakistan government for the financial support and assistance that they provided. I am sure that when she was taken to the UK they would have done everything they possibly could to provide care-and I am sure that they are doing that-and it was good to see that that happened immediately. The right to an education is something that we take for granted here, so it is something on which we can all join together and say, 'That has to be the right worldwide.' Indeed, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines the right to education. We have to make sure that we can support that, as we do here, everywhere else. I conclude by saying that Australia has long supported these rights and has provided education assistance for female students in some of Pakistan's most remote and marginalised communities. One of the important things that we can do with our ODA is to make sure that we spend it in a way that is going to provide those girls who are students with educational support. I would just like to say to Malala: good on her for what she has done for girls and for education. We wish her a speedy and wonderful recovery. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (18:45): I rise today to speak in support of this excellent motion proposed by my good friend and colleague the member for Casey. I join with my colleagues opposite in universal acclamation for the commitment that we are expressing in this House today to girls' education and the tribute to Malala Yousafzai. On9 October 2012, in the Swat Valley in Pakistan, three cowardly Taliban terrorists boarded Malala's school bus, sought her out by name and deliberately shot her point blank in the head and in the neck in an attempt to kill her and silence her forever. Happily for the world, they were not successful. Their violent act of misogyny left Malala in a critical condition, unresponsive for three days as doctors fought to save her life. In less than five weeks, Malala went from an intensive care unit in Pakistan, showing no signs of consciousness, to walking, writing and reading again in a hospital in Birmingham, Britain. Only in the last weeks has she been discharged from hospital. As an advocate for girls' education in her native Swat Valley, Malala's life had been at risk from the Taliban for a number of years for simply wanting to have an education like her brothers. Her father said of her that she: … got influenced by what was going on and gradually she joined me in our struggle against extremism. She was then 11 years of age. The Taliban has had a long history of trying to prevent girls from attending schools through violence, even going to the extent of physically destroying schools, with some estimating that the Taliban destroyed over 150 schools in Pakistan in 2008 alone. As they sought to impose their austere interpretation of sharia law, the Pakistani Taliban threatened girls, their families and their teachers, despite the fact that at the time there was a pledge by the Pakistani government to safeguard girls' education and their schools from such extremists. The Taliban's efforts to disrupt and prevent girls' education continue to this day. Amazingly, given the violent threats they have been faced with, there are brave girls throughout Pakistan willing to risk their welfare so that they can attend school and improve their chances in life for themselves and for their families. In 2009, Malala began blogging for the BBC's online Urdu news service under a pseudonym, describing the Taliban's repression of girls' education. Malala wrote, 'I was afraid going to school because the Taliban had issued an edict banning all girls from attending schools,' before describing how a number of her friends had moved out of the Swat Valley to Peshawar, Lahore and Rawalpindi to be able to continue their education in a safer environment. For those that stayed, the very real and present Taliban threats of reprisals on families meant that many did not send their daughters to school. In late 2009, Malala took up a position as chair of the District Child Assembly of Swat, leading discussions between young people as to what they wanted their future in the Swat Valley to look like. Over the next few years, Malala continued to agitate for girls' education in her blogs, on television and radio and in social media. When in October 2011 she was nominated by Desmond Tutu for the International Children's Peace Prize, and in December of 2011 she received Pakistan's National Youth Peace Prize, the risk to Malala and her family was brought into the open, with death threats published in newspapers and slipped under the family's door. Yet, despite this, Malala continued to campaign for girls' education, describing it as 'our basic right'. I commend those in Pakistan and throughout the world who have joined with her. The newly formed Malala Fund will help girls just like Malala. One of the instigators of this fund, Alyse Nelson, said: We stand with Malala and girls around the globe who are boldly speaking out as advocates for education and equality. When girls move forward, they take their communities forward too. This is so true. Malala has said when speaking of her recovery: … because of these prayers God has given me this new life … and this is a second life. AndI want to serve. I want to serve the people. I want every girl, every child, to be educated. Malala Yousafzai is a brave young woman, a true feminist, a warrior against the evils of real misogyny. She is an inspiration to me and an example to us all. On8 March, which is International Women's Day, we must focus on the issues facing women right around the world. This is one of the critical issues facing our sisters throughout the world: to have an education, to have a right to education and to have that education in a safe environment. Malala, you are a true inspiration. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (18:50): It is a great pleasure and honour to speak on this motion tonight and I commend and congratulate the member for Casey for bringing it forward. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl the Taliban tried to assassinate, is thankfully recovering albeit slowly and is in relatively good health. On9 October 2012 when this young activist living in the Swat district of Pakistan was attacked by the Pakistani Taliban on her way to school, Malala grabbed worldwide attention when she began to tell her story online, a story of the Taliban's repressive regime. In the period following the dislodgement of the Taliban, Malala persisted in informing the world about the situation and in particular the difficulties confronting young girls striving for an education. Malala was one of five nominees for the International Children's Peace Prize in 2011 and she was awarded the inaugural Pakistan National Peace Award in December 2011. After the attack on her bus, Malala was evacuated to Birmingham where she underwent major surgery. After being discharged, Malala is reported as saying that she will be an advocate for the right for 'every girl, every child, to be educated'. Malala is an inspiration to us all because she has taken a very brave and public stance against repression by the Taliban of women and the rights of women to be educated. When the mujahideen and later the Taliban took control of regions of Afghanistan in the 1980s and early 1990s, they set about burning thousands of schools. The Taliban and their allies murdered thousands of teachers. They destroyed the education system and created a fear of learning in the areas they controlled. From the mid-1990s the Taliban began a campaign of violent repression aimed at preventing school-age girls and boys from obtaining an education. In some quarters it is fashionable to oppose the work that we are doing in Afghanistan. Yet over the past decade there has been a recognised increase in children attending schools and getting a much-valued education. There are media reports highlighting how parents in Afghanistan and Pakistan are desperately trying to get their children into education. Parents in these countries quite understandably want their children to be taught to read and write and learn science and maths so that they can get good jobs and support their families. I read one account from an Afghani woman who said of the Taliban: We supported them for 10 years … And what have we got in return? They're not letting us send our children to school or to the provincial hospital. I guess their next idea will be to bury our daughters alive to make sure they never go to school, work in an office, or walk around without a veil. It is not just Afghanistan where the Taliban's repression is suppressing young people seeking an education. According to data from UNICEF, only about one-third Pakistani children aged between five and nine are enrolled in primary education and UNICEF reports that two-thirds of girls and almost half of the boys in Pakistan do not complete primary school. In Pakistan there exists a thriving market for private education because there are parts of that country where it is almost impossible for young girls and boys to attend school. Both the Pakistani government and opposition leaders widely condemn the attack on Malala and they have vowed to continue to fight against extremism. Yet it has taken the bravery of Malala to bring to the fore the situation that exists in her country and also in Afghanistan. The Taliban's education policy is pretty straightforward: they oppose reading, they oppose books, they oppose kites, they oppose public education and, most of all, they oppose girls being educated. The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan is improving-and I saw it first hand on my visit to Afghanistan two years ago-but it is only happening in certain areas. The Australian government has provided education assistance for female students in some of Pakistan's most remote and marginalised communities. In Afghanistan, I understand that a million girls are now going to school, which is an extraordinary and dramatic achievement in such a short period of time. When I was there I enjoyed seeing these girls skipping along in their uniforms with their little friends, heading off to school or coming home from school at the end of the day, having had a wonderful experience of learning and being educated and working to build their nation. Prime Minister Gillard has stated on the record our resolve to continue supporting Malala's work and to pursue measures so that young girls like Malala can be free to go to school to learn and to have the opportunity to be educated in a safe environment. I wish Malala a full and speedy recovery and I wish her and her family a safe, happy and educated life. colleague the member for Casey and I congratulate him for putting forward such an important motion on such a powerful issue. The story of Malala Yousafzai is an inspiring one. It is the story of a young woman wise beyond her years and possessing a grasp of the way things in her homeland should be, not just how they are. It is the story of a young woman's steady determination to stand up and make a difference, to stand up for what is right and to stare down evil. At just 11 years of age, Malala was reported to have said in a speech to local journalists: 'How dare the Taliban take away my right to basic education?' This was after a Taliban edict banning education for girls as they sought to impose their austere interpretation of sharia law and as they went about destroying over 150 schools in the region. Malala caught the Taliban's attention in 2009 when she began writing a blog for the BBC about her life growing up in Pakistan's Swat Valley. That led the New York Times to release a documentary about Malala and she became a sought-after international spokesperson for her struggles against the Taliban's sadistic mediaeval rule. Despite threats from the Taliban, Malala rarely showed fear and she did not hide her face. She said in an interview in 2011: 'I have the right to an education, I have the right to play, I have the right to sing, I have the right to talk, I have the right to go to a market and I have the right to speak up.' A reporter then asked her, 'Why do you risk your life to raise your voice?' And she answered: 'I shall raise my voice. IfI didn't do it, who would?' The Taliban reacted in the way they often do when faced with the forces of freedom of speech. They sent their assassins to murder the 15-year-old girl. On9 October last year two Taliban gunmen walked onto her school bus, asked for her by name and, from point-blank range, fired two bullets into her head and neck. But they were not able to kill her. And, as often happens with acts of evil, it had the exact opposite effect: they turned her into an even bigger international heroine. They created worldwide publicity for her cause and they captured global attention for the struggle for women's rights in Pakistan. In their failure they sent a timely reminder to the world of the sick and perverted thinking and barbaric evil ways of Taliban extremists. They are little more than cowardly savages. Several weeks after Malala was struck in the head and neck by the bullets she was airlifted to the UK where, after months of surgery, just a few days ago the 15-year-old walked down the hall of the British hospital under her own power and gave a videotaped interview. Despite",287,Private Members Business
257,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (18:55,"I rise to support the motion moved by mybeing the victim of such a horrific attack, this passionate young woman has not altered her views. She said after recovering, 'I want every girl, every child, to be educated,' in direct defiance of the criminals that have vowed to kill her. Young Malala's story is remarkable in so many ways. She has rallied the world in a fight to educate young girls, but her greatest gift has been to demonstrate to the world, including the Pakistani people, that it is possible to stand up to the Taliban. Her courage is infectious. But perhaps her greatest gift is to remind the world that our freedoms must be fought for and protected and that we should not cower in the darkness when faced with evil. She reminds us, as that old quotation goes, that all that is necessary for evil to flourish is for good men to do nothing. And, as her case shows, those 'good men' even include 15-year-old schoolgirls. She is a hero in every sense of the word. There could not be a more worthy nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (19:00): Last October, a 15-year-old schoolgirl in Pakistan, Malala Yousafzai, was singled out and shot in the head on board a school bus by a member of the Taliban. She miraculously survived after life-saving surgery and was recently discharged from a UK hospital. I want to wish Malala well, as I am sure all colleagues in this chamber do. The Taliban stated that they shot Malala, who is a campaigner for girls' education, for promoting secularism. These hardliners consider the education of females to be an abomination rather than a human right, and not surprisingly this shooting sparked domestic and international outrage. On1 February Malala gave her first public interview since her recovery. In a courageous display of vision this teenage girl made a vow to continue to serve her people and fight for the right of every girl and child in her home region of the Swat Valley to be educated. Malala has come to represent one of the many females who are the contemporary face of activism in the Muslim world. They speak up for justice where girls and women face a continuing tirade of misogyny embedded in the cultural mores of their communities One of these women is Miss Tasneem Chopra, Chairperson of the Australian Muslim Women's Centre for Human Rights. I would like to quote Tasneem: It is no coincidence that Malala was targeted in this attack. Evidence shows that Muslim women and girls who stand at the front line of activism frequently find themselves at the front line of attacks, often facing dire circumstances. Radicals do not target women activists by accident. This is a deliberate strategy to undermine their pathways to sovereignty through education and equality. Miss Chopra explained that the Taliban in their extraordinary feudal interpretation of Islam enact brutal acts of misogyny. The attempted murder of Malala is by no means an isolated event. Young girls wanting to go to school in areas like Pakistan's Swat valley and neighbouring Afghanistan have come to typify a growing resistance against the Taliban, which seeks to subjugate them completely. In recent years in Afghanistan, they have carried out multiple atrocities aimed at schoolgirls, some of which include the November 2008 attack on 16 schoolgirls with acid while they were walking to school, a poisonous gas attack on a girls school in May 2009, and in August 2010 seven Kabul schoolgirls were hospitalised after another poisonous gas attack on their classroom. In April 2012, 150 Afghan school girls were hospitalised after drinking poisoned water in their school. These are despicable acts of evil. But, unfortunately, they are done often in the name of Islam, so it is crucial to highlight that the Islamic faith strongly encourages the education of Muslim males and females. In fact, countries such as Indonesia and Egypt, for example, boast amongst the highest rates of Muslim female literacy and tertiary qualifications in the world. It is the Taliban's selective view of Islam that favours a patriarchal interpretation. Theirs is premised on a belief that in order to control society they must control their women. Because of these tactics, the Taliban ensure that, if you are a female, Afghanistan is recognised as one of the most dangerous countries on earth. In our quest to right these wrongs that are committed against women and children in the region, we must be very mindful and note that as long as men continue to define what makes a women's role in society acceptable the parameters of her life chances will never be her choice. That is why strides must be made for women's sovereignty both at home and abroad, and they must continue to be a matter of global significance. From the rights of the girl child to eliminating violence against women, we all have a stake in the protection of females in order that we progress into healthier societies. It will always be women who remain best placed to articulate their lives, their lived realities, to speak of their disadvantage, their burden, their glass ceiling and how these injuries must end. SoI want to join with all my colleagues and recognise that this Thursday, 14 February, marks the celebration of a global movement known as One Billion Rising, an international movement where for one day women, men and children stand together in solidarity to end abuse against women. This is an event that was put together by One Billion Rising founder Eve Ensler, who has said that the reality is that one in three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in her lifetime, and that is one billion violated, and that is an atrocity. Debate adjourned. National Disability Insurance Scheme Debate resumed on the motion by Ms O'Neill: That this House: (1) acknowledges the inequity that exists within our communities in the provision of services to people with disability; (2) notes the high level of community engagement with the Every Australian Counts campaign for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and the DisabiliTEA events held around the nation; (3) supports the Government's focus on improving the standard of living for people with disability and their families through the introduction of a NDIS; (4) commends the Government for introducing the draft legislation that sets out a framework for the NDIS; and (5) notes that the first stage rollout will benefit more than 20,000 people with disability, their families and carers in the Hunter in NSW, the Barwon area of Victoria, and South Australia, Tasmania, and the ACT. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (19:05): The motion really is related to a debate that has been extended in the House throughout this day. When I put up this notice of motion I was unaware that there would be such a symmetry. I moved: That this House: (1) acknowledges the inequity that exists within our communities in the provision of services to people with disability; It is an inequity that has existed for far, far too long. What we have happening in this parliament at this time is a very graphic exposure on a number of pieces of legislation right across the field, from superannuation through to disability, about what this Labor government believe in and what we are committed to doing. It is very important that for all of the talk that has been going on for many, many years, for the whole of the 12 years of a Liberal-National party government, there was nothing as visionary, as enabling, as engaging to the community as what is being proposed in this term of this Gillard Labor government. I want to note in my speech this afternoon the high level of community engagement with the Every Australian Counts campaign for the NDIS. Particularly, I would like to mention two disabiliTEAs which were held in my electorate. The first one I attended was at Kariong. It was organised by a wonderful woman by the name of Jean Lawrie. She dipped into our community. It did not take her very long to find a very passionate advocate for fairnesswhich is what we really stand for in this party of mine, the Labor Party-for her son, who was disabled. Dorothea Marler gave a wonderful speech and read a poem that she wrote six years ago about the challenge and the joy of having a profoundly disabled son. Our recently elected mayor at the time, Lawrie McKinna, spoke in response to that. We cannot but have our hearts touched by this issue. What we have to measure our politicians by is whether, when their heart is touched, they are willing to actually do the work and provide the funding to enable an appropriate response. Many platitudes can be spoken, but you have got to actually make decisions about what sort of party you are by what you actually do. This is why I am very pleased to have this motion put before the parliament this afternoon, because we absolutely on this side of the House support the notion that fairness for people who have a disability and support for families and communities caring for people with disability are things that are very much worthy of our attention and worthy of the investment of money, time and energy to bring about better outcomes. At Kariong there were about 50 people in attendance-families, carers, disability enterprises. I want to acknowledge the great work in the community done by Derek Crawford, who emceed the event that day and is a member of our local Masonic Lodge, which gives out hundreds of thousands of dollars in our community every year. Also, of course, I acknowledge the CWA. Those great ladies were there, and they provided an outstanding morning tea. I followed that with a visit out to Pearl Beach, a great little community with the most wonderful arboretum. Opera in the Arboretum is a great community event that happens out there. On this occasion it was to the home of Karen and Bruce Donaldson, who had 40 people in attendance to raise the issues around the National Disability Insurance Scheme and to show that community, and to show me as the federal representative, that it is time for something real and practical to happen in this space. There has been enough time for talking. It is time now for action. The government supports the focus to improve the standard of living for people with disability in their families through the introduction of this National Disability Insurance Scheme. My community visit to a wonderful young man by the name of Samson, who lives in Narara, revealed to me just how much care there is and how much need there is for a response. Samson's father is quite a gifted man with technology and was able to create a computer program that allows his son to communicate. There were no commercial programs available that enabled him to do that. That flexibility to be able to invest in the things that are going to improve people's lives and the unique responses that are required to liberate people's ability and to diminish the disability in their ability and give them the opportunity to participate fully, are, critically, at the heart of the motion I have put through. I commend the government for introducing this legislation and I commend them for committing to 20,000 people from 1 July and enabling this visionary project to come to life. It is the end of talking and the beginning of action under a Labor government. Thank you. forward this motion about the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I agree with her that it is enabling legislation. It will provide great opportunities for those families with somebody who has a disability. I do not like the tone arising out of the fact that the government is trying to politicise the National Disability Insurance Scheme by always making out as if the coalition does not care and does not support this particular piece of legislation. We do not like, on this side of the House, this particular piece of legislation being politicised. It is something which has bipartisan support. The time for a National Disability Insurance Scheme has well and truly arrived, as the member for Robertson quite correctly pointed out. People living with a disability, their families and carers have struggled to receive the support services they desperately require. An NDIS will give them the fair, efficient and equitable system they deserve. I was the first federal parliamentarian to sign up to the Every Australian Counts campaign in New South Wales, a campaign which highlights the need for an NDIS, something of which I needed no convincing. If ever something required bipartisan support, this is it. The coalition believes that full implementation of the NDIS will be nothing short of a new deal for people with disabilities and for their carers-those absolutely selfless, important people who do so much to improve the lives and well-being of close family members with a disability. The coalition is committed to working with the government and has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee, to be chaired by both sides of politics, to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS-a call reiterated by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech to the National Press Club on 31 January 2013. The number of people with a disability will increase significantly over the next 20 years. As this number rises, the number of people willing and able to care for these disabled people will, sadly, decline. The NDIS will help to ensure that there will be support for those who desperately require it, even if they do not have family to assist them. It is important that the NDIS focuses on early intervention and identifying support services which are most effective and efficient and will maximise the potential in those with a disability and help to facilitate their independence. Providing disabled people with what they need, when they need it, will help to reduce pressure on families and allow easier participation for the disabled in work, life, and the community. It will offer their families much needed respite. The NDIS will also provide for a person no matter how their disability was acquired and it will ensure assistance for those who may require it in the future, as well as those who already do. The creation of the NDIS is a complete reform of current disability provisions. It will ensure the new system is fairer than what is currently in place. Principal beneficiaries will be those whose disability has an impact on their daily life. This is our opportunity to get things",293,Private Members Business
258,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (19:10,"I commend the member for Robertson for puttingright and bring in a safety net for those with a disability in the same way Medicare and compulsory superannuation have reformed society in the past and are now something we all take for granted. The NDIS is an investment in Australia's future and, particularly for those whose lives will depend on the scheme, it is important that a long-term funding commitment is made to the scheme to ensure it is established properly and can go the distance. If funded correctly and adequately, the NDIS will ensure that Australia can meet the current and future needs of those with disability, no matter what the current economic climate may be. I know the importance of an NDIS to so many people throughout Australia, but especially the people in the Riverina who have come to me to outline their situation, such as Carol and Chris Harmer of Wagga Wagga, who know all too well the need for an NDIS. Two of their three children, Emily who is 20 and Tom who is 16, have Phelan McDermid syndrome, a rare condition with approximately only 600 people affected worldwide. The Harmers have high hopes for the support and services the NDIS would offer them and their children, as well as others in similar circumstances. Mrs Pat Thomas of Temora cares for her son Richard who has a disability. She established the Special Persons and Carers Group of Temora to provide support for those with a disability and their carers. To see her lifelong work supported by an initiative such as the NDIS means so much to her, knowing there will be the necessary support for those with disabilities once their elderly parents can no longer look after them. Every Australian has the right to know there will be support for them or their loved ones if a disability is acquired. We have the opportunity to work together as the parliament to get this system right for those who have waited so patiently for it. We owe it to them to give them a system which is fair, equitable and efficient. I commend the bill. member for Robertson who put forward this motion. I have spent the last two years actively campaigning to raise awareness for the NDIS, which is essentially a once-in-a-lifetime reform. I understand why a national disability insurance scheme is so important, because I have taken a lot of time to listen to local members of my community. I have worked closely with James O'Brien, who is a tireless advocate for people with disabilities. I have been listening to families right across the electorate and have hosted many discussions and morning and afternoon teas in my electorate, in places like Gisborne, Doreen, Sunbury and Seymour. I have attended DisabiliTEAs and met with countless individuals, families and local organisations and I know how anxious they are to see a scheme implemented. To me, an NDIS means dignity, freedom and choice for people and their families-not just for those in my electorate but Australia-wide. Having a family member who has disabilities, I know just how hard it can be from day to day, whether it is arranging carers, getting access to respite or just wanting to give your child every opportunity to lead a fulfilling life. Can you imagine what it is like to sit around the family table and have to grapple with the daily decision about what help you can afford to provide for your child and having to repeatedly dip into your mortgage or savings to help provide basic care? Can you imagine having to travel weekly for many hours each way just to access speech therapy and physiotherapy? Catherine has to do this with her gorgeous six-year-old daughter, Kristen. Catherine had this to say: For our family, NDIS will mean that Kristen can be supported to actively participate in as many spheres of community life as she chooses. I want my daughter to be able to be supported in the choices that she",297,Private Members Business
259,Mr Mitchell (Mcewen) (19:15,"I rise to speak wholeheartedly in support of thewants to make; whether it be living independently when she's an adult or having the ability to continue her education and have a career to make a contribution to society. NDIS can work both ways because it means people can be part of the economy if the right investment is made to support them at crucial stages of their lives. Those are very powerful words indeed. Can you imagine hoping to outlive your child because you do not know what help there will be for them once you are gone? As Janice told me regarding her 21-year-old son Jake: Your involvement has been very welcomed and I can't thankyou … enough for taking seriously how important … funding will be for Jake. It will allow us to build a good life for him, full of opportunity, life experiences, and independent living skills and help him live a full and meaningful life. This will all take time, but I feel confident with the right supports in place he will grow and mature. Those are the day-to-day struggles that families face trying to do what any parent would do: give their child every opportunity that they can. I am extremely proud to be part of a government that gets what an NDIS means. With its needs based approach, it changes the concept from a charity approach to one centred on the individual, allowing people to choose the services that they need and want. You would hope that the NDIS would receive bipartisan support, but it comes with mixed messages from the coalition. The opposition leader, Tony Abbott, when he attended an NDIS rally in Perth, said: When it comes to the NDIS, I am Dr Yes. And, no, he did not actually write that down! We then had the shadow Treasurer telling the National Press Club that, while he supports an NDIS in principle, he will not promise to fund it. So those opposite are happy to pose for photos, they are happy to tell people what they want to hear, but they always add the traditional LNP out clause. It is also time the Victorian Premier got off his hands and signed up to this. From leading the states in disability services, in only two years Victoria has gone to having a waiting list of 3,600 people seeking urgent support. It is not good enough. A lot of the work that went into building support for people with disabilities has now gone, and it is not fair for those who live with disability every day of their life. This situation, as with that of Catherine, who has to travel from one side of the city to the other to get access to speech therapy, is not fair. It is not right that she has to do this in her day-to-day life. Without true bipartisan support from all levels of government, this once-in-a-lifetime reform will not get the support it deserves, which is to have all of us working together for the best outcomes for people with disabilities. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (19:21): I rise tonight to contribute to this private member's motion on the NDIS. I support the motion. As I discussed last week when I spoke in the House on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012, the NDIS is not a partisan political issue. Both sides of this chamber have committed to the implementation of the NDIS. No matter who wins the election later on this year, an NDIS will be implemented. Unfortunately, I think the Labor Party desperately want to turn this issue into a political football, and we have seen the games being played with coalition state governments in recent times. However, their politicking will not work, because the coalition is absolutely committed to an NDIS. I passionately believe in a National Disability Insurance Scheme because as a LiberalI really believe that the core of government is to help those who cannot help themselves. I think both sides of this house would agree that there are people with a disability and parents and carers of people with a disability who do not have the same opportunities and freedoms that many others enjoy. This motion acknowledges that inequality that exists within our communities in the provision of services to people with a disability, and that is a very important point. On 30 January, I and the shadow minister for seniors, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, hosted a seniors forum. One of the attendees told a very heartfelt story of being the carer for her elderly and disabled mother. She said that as a full-time carer she does not get a holiday, she does not get a break-all she gets is a carers pension. On the very rare occasion when she can get away, she has to put her mother in respite care. She said that because she has been out of the workforce for so long looking after her mother she will have trouble finding a job back in the private sector. She said that, not because she is not capable but because she has not worked for a while, employers will be reluctant to hire her. So this motion is absolutely correct when it recognises the inequality that exists in the provision of disability services. I am also very glad that this motion notes the Every Australian Counts campaign. I want to acknowledge the fantastic work that is being done in Queensland by Fiona Anderson. They run an absolutely superb public advocacy campaign for NDIS. They have done it in a non-partisan, genuine way, and I congratulate them for that. As I mentioned in the House last week, I had the privilege of addressing the Every Australian Counts rally in King George Square in the Brisbane CBD on 30 April. I addressed the rally, along with Senator Jan McLucas and Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale, and reaffirmed the coalition's commitment to an NDIS. I was privileged to meet some remarkable individuals there. I want to acknowledge the advocacy of Fiona Anderson, who has worked day and night to raise awareness in the community of the need for an NDIS and lobbied politicians of all persuasions to support it. I also want to acknowledge the Every Australian Counts campaign's Queensland NDIS Steering Group, which consists of people like David Barbagallo, Debra Cottrell, Angela Tillmanns, Francis Vicary, Bruce Milligan, Len Airey, Jane Geltch, Judy Dickson,Valmae Rose, Frank Martin, Anna Cox, Evan Munroe and, of course, the most energetic leader of them all, Fiona Anderson. I want to thank them for their service and dedication. I also want to thank Every Australian Counts for organising all of the DisabiliTEA events in Brisbane that I was fortunate enough to attend, particularly the group who met at New Farm. I got to hear first hand many heart breaking stories about how difficult it is to access the myriad services available and how hard parents have to fight to get services at all. In conclusion, I want to thank the Queensland government for their commitment to increase disability funding to help fund an NDIS. The Labor government should stop trying to politicise the NDIS. It is an initiative that the coalition supports. The NDIS is something I passionately believe in. I will fight for my constituents in Brisbane and I will make sure that it is a reality. I thank the chamber. member for Robertson on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. BeforeI do so I would like to return to some of the comments made by the member for Brisbane because she sits in this chamber as a member from Queensland. I am here with the member for Blair, who is also a member from Queensland. We heard that speech. It was a classic example of the political football that is being played here, but it was more of an effort by a magician. The reality is",298,Private Members Business
260,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (19:26,"I too rise to speak on the motion moved by thethat people with disabilities in Queensland get $7 spent on them. Compare that to those in Victoria who get $10 spent on them. We are starting behind the eight ball already before the NDIS kicks off. We have seen hard-hearted Premier Campbell Newman commit not one dollar. When we had a chance to have a trial scheme in Queensland, which would not have cost anything-certainly, significantly less than the cost of the new racetrack at the Gold Coast. Mr Neumann: Five million dollars. middle of Brisbane-we all know that the state politicians are in dire circumstances-but there is not enough for a trial scheme. I am sick and tired of hearing those opposite say that we are trying to make political capital out of the NDIS when the reality is that we in the Labor Party are committed to putting dollars forward, not just supporting it in principle. It is like their comments on education. The reality is we need to do a lot more. I am glad the member for Blair is here because he sat alongside me as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when we did the Access all areas report. That made the scales fall from my eyes about some of the challengesMr Neumann interjectingthe day-to-day horrors and about how something as simple as accessing buildings can interfere with your life, I had not fully understood some of the challenges that people with disabilities have. It is easy to say you support the NDIS and be photographed with Everybody Counts et cetera, but the reality is it is what you do. We have seen the Premier and the Liberal-National Party in Queensland do absolutely nothing. To be lectured by the member for Brisbane and told that it is all one happy family and this is bipartisan is ridiculous and totally misleading. I mentioned the Access all areas report because that was when I first had a lot to do with Minister Shorten, who was Parliamentary Secretary Shorten at the time. He is to be commended for having so much to do with making the NDIS a national program and a national goal. He has done so much to raise awareness. It could be said that, when he received that portfolio, he was also not fully aware of the challenges that people with disabilities have but, once he was aware, he became incredibly passionate about it. Then we move forward to when the Productivity Commission reported and showed the areas of unmet need for families and carers. We hear stories in our electorate offices all the time. Obviously, the way to respond is by working with the state governments. That is the reality: we have a federation and we must work with state governments when it comes to implementing these improvements to people's lives. Whilst state governments do not actually provide a significant number of services, it is the NGOs that roll out most of the programs with federal money. That is the reality. It is going to be a process where we work with the NGOs to make sure that we can improve people's lives. I have already seen it, and I am proud to be able to say that one of my organisationsMulticap at Eight Mile Plains-has already stepped up, whilst the state government has not stepped up, in terms of the NDIS trial sites. I am glad to say that some NGOs in Queensland have seen the opportunities that are there and have stepped up to make sure that they can",300,Private Members Business

262,Mr Perrett,"Yes. I thought I was reasonably sympathetic but, until I actually heardparticipate. I have had meetings with so many of my peak disability bodies or those who interact with people with disabilities, such as Westside Community Services at Kyabra, MontroseAccess, Contact Incorporated, the Spinal Injuries Association-there are so many of them-and they are looking forward to the changes that will take place in the months and weeks ahead as real money goes into this scheme. Labor policy and Labor will get it done. On 26 OctoberI was proud to hold a DisabiliTEA event in the Ipswich community at the Brassall Shopping Centre to make sure that we raised awareness amongst the Ipswich and West Moreton region about the need for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I spoke on 10 October 2012 at the Care Aware fair, run by Carers Queensland as part of their 2012 Carers Week to recognise the 4,300 carers in the Ipswich and Somerset region of Blair. We know that one in eight Australians provide care to family members and friends who have a disability-a mental or terminal illness or a chronic condition-or who are simply frail. By mid-2013 we will see more than 20,000 Australians with a disability and their carers and family friends really benefitting from the first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Every year I hold a Blair Disability Links expo in the Brassall Shopping Centre in Ipswich. This year we had 30 storeholders and at least 500 visitors. I thank the many people who supported that event. Every year I relaunch the Blair Disability Links information kit, which gets bigger every year, with local organisations such as CATS, Focal Extended, ALARA and others. Contributors to that vied for local people to get access to help, information, guidance and funding. There are a couple of people who were present, particularly, at the Blair Disability Links event that we had in December. Apart from Peter and Linda Tully, whom I have talked about before, and Debbie Chilton, there was a fellow by the name of Neil Moorhead. Mr Moorhead had given up full-time work after being diagnosed with a kidney disorder and found it difficult to adjust to his changed lifestyle. He spoke at that event passionately and movingly about how he managed to handle his disability and study full time. He had spoken to Centrelink and was surprised by the number of support options and services available. He spoke in support of a national disability insurance scheme, as did other people who were there. It was a great day and there was great enthusiasm for this scheme. The tragedy and the shame of all of this is that how we spend our money at a state and federal level shows our values, our ethics and our priorities. During the nearly 12 years of the Howard coalition government, despite the words of those opposite, there was inaction. The support for disability services during the time of the Howard coalition government grew by less than the rate of inflation-1.8 per cent. In reality, we could have a National Disability Insurance Scheme launch site in Queensland but for the wrong choices, wrong values and wrong priorities of Campbell Newman and the LNP state government. They did not even have the grace and humility to come with a proper proposal to the Council of Australian Governments when even the Liberal governments of New South Wales and Victoria came with detailed proposals for a launch site. A 1½ page scribbled note about Gympie being a possibility for a launch site is not a genuine proposal. The reality is that for Queenslanders it would mean simply $62.50 for every person with a disability in Queensland if Campbell Newman and LNP government contributed to a launch",301,Private Members Business
263,Mr Neumann (Blair) (19:31,"The NDIS is a Labor initiative. It is a Labor program, asite. Eighty thousand Queenslanders are missing out, and, sadly, the current rate of funding per capita in Queensland is much lower than every other state, particularly Victoria. In Queensland the current rate is $5,830 per capita compared to Victoria's $8,378 per capita. This is not just a matter of social justice; it is also a matter of economic responsibility. It is just simply important that we support a National Disability Insurance Scheme. The truth is that those opposite mouth words but have not put up one dollar towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme, and even now cannot say how they would fund it. The thing is that those opposite can talk the talk but have never walked the walk. I believe that when it comes to a National Disability Insurance Scheme, the Liberals, who have had different views on this, no matter which particular spokesman, are disingenuous, deceptive and disheartening to those who are really facing the challenges of disability. The truth is those opposite oppose the National Disability Insurance Scheme, despite the words they offer. Debate adjourned. Primary Language Disorder Debate resumed on the motion by Mrs Prentice: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Primary Language Disorder (PLD) is a lifelong disability which affects many children in Australia; (b) families of children with PLD face great uncertainties and vagaries due to the obscure nature of PLD and therefore the difficulty of reaching a diagnosis of their child's disability; (c) children with PLD have the best chance in life if they receive treatment for their condition as early as possible; (d) without intervention, there are profound long term implications for affected individuals in terms of gaining an education and employment, leaving them feeling isolated and despondent and at a high risk of developing depressive and anxiety disorders; and (e) an April 2012 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology highlights the high incidence (50 per cent) of oral language dysfunction in youth offenders; (2) recognises that: (a) the CHI.L.D. Association's Glenleighden School is the only school in the southern hemisphere which caters specifically to the needs of children with PLD and other language disorders; (b) for over 30 years, this school has achieved significant results for thousands of children; (c) the CHI.L.D. Association: (i) through both its outreach program and direct clinical services, provides support for children with PLD and their families and schools across Queensland; and (ii) provides quality specialised early intervention services through its clinic, but is limited to those families who can pay for services as PLD does not fulfil the criteria for funding under the Better Start for Children with Disability Initiative; and (d) there are currently no consistent eligibility criteria across Australian States and Territories for children with PLD to access specialised educational resources; and (3) calls on the Government to consider PLD as part of a review of the Better Start for Children with Disability Program. this motion. I have moved this motion because this is such an important issue for the parents and children of Ryan, and across the country. As we see a concerted push to secure support for the most vulnerable in our community with the National Disability Insurance Scheme, I want to ensure that the children with communication difficulties, and particularly primary language disorder, are not ignored. Primary language disorder is a lifelong disability which affects children of all races and backgrounds across the country. Some studies indicate that communication disorders can affect up to one in 14 children. In Sydney, McLeod and McKinnon conducted a study of 14½ thousand primary and secondary school students and found that the incidence of communication disorders was in the order of 12 to 13 per cent. To explain this speech and language impairment, primary language disorder is primary in the sense of being the most significant impairment contributing to activity limitations and participation restrictions on the individual's current well-being, as defined in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Because there has been a lack of clear evidence of specific neurological structural or functional differences to define the disorder, the medical and allied health community have had much difficulty agreeing on a consistent classification and definition of primary language disorder, let alone achieving full recognition in the community of its debilitating effects. What we do know is that children with PLD will have difficulty understanding what others are saying and in using words to respond. Such a child may not respond to their name and may be reluctant to take part in conversation. They may struggle with reading because of difficulties sounding out words and understanding what is being read. They may struggle with writing when forming letters, words and sentences. And they may struggle with numeracy arising from the inability to appreciate sequences as well as abstract concepts. Children can also be easily distracted, readily given to frustration and therefore reluctant to learn new skills. These realities mean a child with PLD may not be able to communicate their wants and needs to parents and siblings and others, and may not be able to handle simple classroom tasks or respond adequately to instructions. In turn, these issues may lead to serious frustration and outbursts of temper and tantrums, which usually means normal schooling for such a child is quite problematic and social acceptance more broadly is particularly limited. It is important to note that these children are not necessarily intellectually impaired. Their hearing and vision are usually excellent, they may have the same physical potential of others of their age and their appearance almost always provides no clue. Therefore, families and children face great uncertainties and vagaries due to the obscure nature of PLD, and that can cause great difficulty in reaching a diagnosis of the child's disability. Without intervention there can be profound long-term problems for students to gain a full education and employment. Sufferers can feel isolated, despondent and anti-social, leaving them at high risk of developing depressive and anxiety disorders. This can lead them down the slippery slope of serious antisocial behaviour and brushes with the law. They then become part of the offender cycle, where the frustration of suffering and isolation from untreated speech and language impairments can lead to multiple incarcerations. Worst of all, because of their condition, sufferers have enormous difficulty explaining or even defending themselves against accusations of illegality.",302,Private Members Business
264,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (19:36,"I thank my colleagues who are speaking in support ofHowever, there is some hope for these children and their families-hope that this spiral can be broken. Since 1976, the CHI.L.D. Association has catered for children and adolescents with severe speech and language impairments through both the Glenleighden School and its Let's Talk Development Hub. The team at CHI.L.D. Association has been successful in treating thousands of children who have the most severe forms of primary language disorder. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the countless numbers of volunteers and staff who have been involved with CHI.L.D since its founding, including-but not limited to their current executive principal, Ms Vikki Rose Graydon, who has been with the association for 20 years. I would also like to thank head of school Cae Ashton, tireless fundraisers such as Bruce Grundy and of course the staff and allied health staff, including teachers, physiotherapists, speech pathologists, psychologists and others involved in all the projects. Children who attend the Glenleighden School enter with between zero and two per cent of the speech language capacity of their peers. Clearly, we are talking about the most severe cases of PLD, but at the Glenleighden School they have developed an approach that successfully helps these children achieve their educational and personal potential-so successful that a child may only need to attend the school for one year or a couple of years before they can enter the mainstream schooling program. Some students attend the school through to senior school, continuing to work on their disorder. Unfortunately, the Glenleighden School is the only one of its type in the southern hemisphere which caters specifically for children with PLD. Parents come from all over the country to bring their child to Queensland at a huge financial cost to their family, uprooting themselves for a better life for their child. Similarly, the association's Let's Talk program provides outreach services for more than 300 children a year, not just in Brisbane but at schools across Queensland. They help children with PLD and also intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, dyspraxia and other conditions. The important work that these people do for what are some of the most vulnerable children in our community cannot be underestimated. I mentioned in my maiden speech that some issues are simply too important to resort to partisan attacks. We must all support the CHI.L.D. Association's work in a bipartisan manner. I would like to thank my Queensland colleague Senator Claire Moore for the support she has given, as well as the shadow minister for disabilities, Senator Mitch Fifield, who has visited the school with me. There are two main issues which Australian governments must address. Operational definitions of disability are inconsistent across states. In Queensland PLD is listed under a category of speech language impairment and funding is allocated on that basis. In some states direct funding for teaching children with PLD does not occur. In the final report of the Gonski review, no recommendations were made for disability loading on the basis that the panel perceived 'significant obstacles' preventing them from doing this. Therefore, there remain significant concerns in the community about whether implementation of the Gonski review will address concerns about disability loading. Australians still do not know what support will be provided to all Australian students, including those with a disability, despite the government having received the Gonski review in 2011. The issue of inconsistent recognition across the states affects the ability to treat children equitably. At present, although research is clear about the incidence and impact of PLD on children, there is no direct early intervention for children affected by PLD because it is not recognised as a condition with respect to the Better Start initiative. As a result children will often be diagnosed and treated as having PDDNOS-pervasive development disorder not otherwise specified, which falls under the umbrella term of the autism spectrum disorder. This can be a huge problem because often treatment will then be focused on the social and emotional problems of a child rather than on the linguistic problems, which secondarily cause social and emotional problems. In 2010 the Australian government announced new funding to improve access to early intervention services for eligible children of up to $12,000 with a maximum of $6,000 per financial year. Funding is available for cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome and some vision or hearing impairments. The list of currently eligible conditions means that some disabilities make the grade while other families with children whose needs are just as great miss out on assistance. I have written on numerous occasions, as has the organisation, to members of the government, who have assured me and CHI.L.D. that work is underway for a more consistent definition of disabilities at the national level. So it is incredibly disappointing that progress has been very limited to date and the government has indicated that they will not assist children with PLD. Furthermore, because there is no consistent definition, the school must classify their students as having either a physical disability or an intellectual disability in order to gain access to federal funding. The school therefore believes it is an important ethical issue because, as previously mentioned, a child who suffers from PLD does not necessarily have a diagnosable physical or intellectual disability. As I have said, it is imperative for the prognosis of children affected by PLD that they receive intervention as early as possible prior to entering the education system. Therefore, there is the potential to benefit these children by including the most severe forms of PLD as a treatable condition in Better Start for Children with Disability. Including primary language disorder on the list of eligible conditions will provide certainty and assurance to parents across Australia that their child will have access to early intervention treatment directly related to their speech-language impairment. I commend the motion to the House. motion to the House and want to add my support for people who have primary language disorder and their families. I recently met with a constituent of mine, Deborah Heller, a mother whose son lives with primary language disorder. I would like to publicly commend Deborah and her husband, Justin, for bringing their story to my attention and for their persistence and strength. They are truly remarkable parents. I would like to begin by telling you a little bit about their story. Deborah and Justin's son Cooper was born in 2007 and they realised early on in Cooper's life that something was not quite right. He could not speak at all and was becoming isolated from family and other children. Cooper became anxious and frustrated and was completely incapable of communicating the simplest of messages. The family also faced prejudice in the community, as you can probably imagine. Deborah said to me, 'Please take a moment to really think about how you would feel if other people watching your child grunting, squealing or being generally inappropriate for their age said to you, ""If he was mine I'd kill myself.""' Deborah and Justin faced an uphill battle in getting help for Cooper as waiting lists for speech therapy were extensive in both the private and public sectors. They happened to live in Townsville at the time. After travelling from Townsville to Brisbane to see a neurologist,",304,Private Members Business
265,Mr Ripoll (Oxley,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (19:46): I commend thisCooper was diagnosed with severe speech-language disorder. Language disorders and impairments are very much a hidden disability in the community. Few people understand the disorder and we rarely speak about it. I would, therefore, like to bring this important issue to the attention of the House. Children like Cooper are often misdiagnosed, sometimes with autism or intellectual impairment. Primary language disorder children can have autistic traits, sensory issues, major behavioural challenges, delays in developmental domains and problems with gross and fine motor skills. These traits often combine to pose severe barriers to their ability to learn. After approaching numerous schools in Townsville and finding none that could help, the family decided to move to Brisbane and attend the Glenleighden School in Figtree Pocket. This is a world-leading school, particularly in this field, and provides world-class PLD education through a combination of methods. Deborah told me that Cooper is very happy at the school and is getting a great education-although the family have had to make some financial sacrifices, as you can imagine, in uprooting their family from Townsville to Brisbane and taking care of all the special needs that their son Cooper has. Deborah wants her sons to have the same opportunities as the rest of us want for our children. Deborah and Justin tell me that people with PLD are more likely to enter the justice system, are at risk of long term unemployment, have a higher incidence of mental health issues and are at risk of poverty and homelessness. There is a lot more that we could do, and I think there are many things that we are actually doing now. Because this is a complex issue and not well understood in the community, there are often myths about what is happening. Unfortunately, it does come down to levels of funding and who provides what, where and how. This government has a number of programs. One in particular is the More Support for Students with a Disability funding program, which provides $200 million in additional government funding to government and independent schools over last year and this year. As part of this funding $2.7 million was provided to the Queensland Association of Independent Schools and the Queensland Association of Independent Schools provided part of these funds to Glenleighden School specifically for this type of special benefit and training. The federal government also provides recurrent funding to Glenleighden School. In 2010 that funding totalled $853,000, or a bit over $12,000 per student. This has increased since then. There is more good news. The Gonski review provided some very specific measures. Other people have spoken about this in different areas. Gonski identified that there was no consistent approach, there was a real mismatch between what happens at different levels. There is a better way and Gonski provides that mechanism. There is also limited and inconsistent data on the number and location of students with disabilities. It is important that we actually know this so that we can fund it properly. On7 December last year all school education ministers gave provisional endorsement to a model for a nationally consistent collection of data on school students with a disability. This model moves away from an approach based on identification and support of students according to particular types of disabilities, and instead the model encompasses all disabilities and is focused on the level of adjustment provided for a student to access and participate in schooling on the same basis as those without a disability. It takes away that problem of whether one particular condition is in or out as part of this debate. Students will be included in the data if they have a condition, including a language disorder, which results in the person having a learning difficulty. This is an important part of the change that this government is bringing forward. Unfortunately school funding from the state has been cut to this school. I know that has been acknowledged from the other side. I do not want to make a political issue of it but just state the fact that it has been cut. There was a promise from the previous government to increase funding from 22 to 40 per cent. It reached 29 per cent but that has now been a cut. I do not accept that school funding should be cut, but if there is one area where it definitely should not it is particularly in the provision of education for students with disabilities. There are questions about what we are doing about this and I think they are fair questions. But there are answers. It is not as if this government is sitting on its hands on this very important issue. This government is committed to improving the lives of Australians with disabilities and under Australia's fragmented disability services system, which is highly complex, many people cannot get the sort of support that they need. This should not continue and we want to change it. In recognition of this the Gillard government have already significantly expanded the support services we provide for children with a disability. In 2008 we assisted more than 25,000 children with a disability to access early intervention services throughout our Better Start for Children with Disability and Helping Children with Autism programs specifically. This debate tonight gives me the opportunity to provide a little more information about this particular program and how it relates to primary language disorder. It is claimed that perhaps the government made an administrative change in regard to PLD in terms of access to Better Start and that this was somehow removed. The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, which administers the Better Start program, has confirmed to me that PLD was never included as an eligible condition under Better Start. We cannot have changed because it was never in. Individual children with multiple diagnoses including PLD may have been included under Better Start but not on the basis of having PLD alone. It is important to get these things clear because that has an impact in terms of where funding is understood to have come from. It is also claimed that the government classified a condition known as pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified as an autism spectrum condition. This is not correct. The department has confirmed that the government do not set the definition the definition of autism in Australia; in fact, we use a diagnostic tool developed in the United States. We know that despite progress we have had through these programs like Better Start there are still gaps and still inconsistencies. We need to continue to bridge those gaps and to rectify those inconsistencies because it is the right thing to do regardless of funding levels and models and whatever else may be out there. These gaps and inconsistencies do affect people with primary language disorder. We know there is a better way to identify them-which is what we did, beginning last year-and to meet the needs of children and other people with significant disabilities. That is why we are leading the way to reform Australia's disability system through the National Disability Insurance Scheme, widely known as the NDIS-a massive undertaking by Australia, by this government, for a fair, constructive and progressive way forward to deal with the issues and take a more holistic approach. A person's eligibility for the NDIS is not based solely on a diagnosis of their disability, because we recognise that that does not meet everyone's needs-just as, when it comes to issues such as autism, primary language disorder or other things, it is not the government that sets what is in or out; we work to frameworks and models, and that is obviously done at other levels by experts. The government's role is to make sure that people are not disadvantaged by the system-that the system actually helps, aids and supports them and provides the funding to the right people. I believe support should go to young people, particularly those with primary language disorder. It should help those parents who are doing everything they can in their struggle to make sure that their children have the same opportunities that everyone else's children have. That is why I am very much in support of the motion put forward by the member for Ryan, because I think she raises a really good issue, and I know she is very genuine about bringing this forward. It is a school in her electorate, but I am very supportive and I think she will find that she has lots of support on the government's side and that, if we work together on this, and try to find where the problems sit, we can find solutions. SoI am very supportive of the motion-that is why I wanted to speak on it-and also very encouraging of the parents who work so hard to make sure that their children get a fair go. forward by the member for Ryan which highlights the issue of primary language disorder and, most importantly, calls for a review of the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative to potentially include primary language disorder in the list of categories which that initiative funds. I also commend the member for Oxley on his fine words just before me in providing very strong support for this motion. Primary language disorder is in many ways a hidden condition that can have a significant impact on a child's ability to learn and engage. It is not easy to detect and therefore can sometimes go unnoticed. However, it is widespread and is said to affect a very high proportion of Australian school children. Some studies have suggested that as many as one in 14 Australian school children are affected by primary language disorder in some capacity. Clearly, there is a spectrum-from those who have very severe primary language disorder and struggle to communicate at all to those who just have difficulties communicating but can still, nevertheless, communicate some language to others. So the proportion of people who are potentially suffering obviously means that this disorder is having a significant impact on a large part of Australian society. The disorder itself causes speech and language skills to be impaired. Therefore, children with this condition have trouble expressing themselves-what they are thinking and how they are feeling. They also have difficulty in understanding when others are communicating with them. While this can seem fairly innocuous, it can actually have a severe impact on a child's growth and development, both academically and socially. What assistance is there to support these children who suffer from this disorder? Sadly, there is no consistent assistance which applies across Australia to help such children but, as the member for Ryan highlighted, there is at least one school in Australia, the Glenleighden School, which does amazing work in this area. It caters for people who have severe primary language disorder. It does, as the member for Ryan pointed out, amazing things and ensures that those kids, after a couple of years, can move into a mainstream school and adequately",306,Private Members Business
266,Mr Tudge (Aston) (19:57,"It is with great pleasure that I second the motion putcope there, socialise and develop fully just as any other kid can do. I commend the school on their fine work and on their commitment to raising awareness of this disorder around the nation. However, I also believe that we must look at other ways of providing support to parents and schools catering for students who suffer from this condition. I strongly believe that the government must, where it can, provide assistance to those suffering generally from a disability including from the disability at question here. I understand there are so many needs which compete for funding. I generally think we need to provide more money overall for kids who have learning difficulties or disabilities generally. I think that funding needs to not only go to kids at government schools but equally go to kids at Catholic and independent schools; it should not matter which school you attend. The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative is a good program which does provide funding for kids who do have disabilities. However, there is only a short list of disabilities which make the grade for this program such as Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy, and hearing and vision impairment. I by no means would like to see the funding for those disabilities reduced but I would like to see a review of this program with a view to expanding it and potentially incorporating primary language disorder in the list which it may be able to fund in the future. That is in essence the nature of the motion in front of us. The motion calls for a review to take a proper look at this particular initiative, assesses its adequacy and also determine whether or not primary language disorder should be incorporated in the list of disabilities which should be funded under that program. I congratulate the member for Ryan for moving this motion this evening. Again, I congratulate the member for Oxley, the speakers on the other side of the chamber and also those who have brought this issue to our attention. (Time expired) Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (20:02): Like my fellow speakers in this debate, I am very pleased to be speaking to this motion tonight. I join with them in thanking the member for Ryan for bringing this motion before the House and for giving members the opportunity to learn more about primary language disorder. It gives us a chance to develop a better understanding of how children and adults with this disorder-and it is a lifelong disorderand the people who love and care for them can be helped and supported. It is not unusual for private members' motions in the House to discuss various diseases and disorders that our constituents are struggling with and to call attention to their plight and the need for more research or more funding to save or improve lives. The subject of tonight's debate, primary language disorder, is particularly deserving of our attention because it is otherwise so hidden from mainstream view, adding to the hardship of families who are trying to make sense of it and do the best for their child. The Sunday Mail in Queensland published an excellent article on primary language disorder a couple of years ago. It described primary language disorder as being insidious. It is hidden because primary language disorder children look no different to any other child. It is not well understood and is often difficult to diagnose or is misdiagnosed altogether, adding to the frustration and heartache of parents who are dealing with children with this disorder. It is also one of those things that can take a long time for parents to pick up on themselves and to start that journey of trying to find a diagnosis. So it can be some time before children receive any kind of treatment or intervention for PLD. It is often mistaken for developmental delay, autism or some form of intellectual or physical disability. In fact it is none of those things; it is a language disorder pure and simple. People with primary language disorder have a serious disability with speech and language but this is not accompanied by other sensory disorders like deafness. As was explained by the parent of a child with primary language disorder in the feature article in Queensland's Sunday Mail, it is like the person with PLD is in a foreign country where they cannot understand what is being said and do not have the ability to speak or communicate in a way that can be understood by others. To add to the puzzle facing sufferers and their parents and carers, the disorder manifests itself in a wide range of different ways, leading to the difficulty of pinpointing the diagnosis. It affects talking and comprehension, and how people make sense of the words that they hear. It affects concentration, writing, even balance and coordination, motor skills, problem solving, and, in some cases, people's senses are heightened. Whatever form it takes, it is very easy for us to comprehend how profound the consequences are for a child's social and educational development, behaviour, happiness and the ability to function at school or in society. What parents are looking for first, is an answer-a correct diagnosis, so that they can understand what their child is going through. Then, they can work towards finding the treatment and intervention that will make a difference. I am pleased to say-and it is actually highlighted in the member for Ryan's motion-that many parents in Queensland have been able to find an answer and do have their children on the right path to engagement, to learning and to finding a way to make sense of the world even while they are suffering from primary language disorder. That is because those children are enrolled at the Glenleighden School, in the western suburbs of Brisbane. It has a unique and, in fact, world recognised methodology of looking at students in a very holistic way. It has different experts, including experts in physiotherapy, psychology, occupational therapy, speech pathology et cetera. They are looking at how to unlock the key to language and comprehension for these students. Parents at the school have described the miracles being performed for their children. I want to quickly pick up on the point that the member for Ryan makes in her motion, and that other speakers have talked to, about how to get more help for sufferers of primary language disorder. I would like to point out that two of the initiatives that we are debating in the House this week-the Gonski reforms of education funding, and also the NDIS-really do look at new ways of dealing with these things. They are not looking at the definition of a disability, but, in fact, what treatment or what support is required to overcome the disability. (Time expired) Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (20:07): I am very pleased to stand in support of this motion put forward by my good friend and colleague the member for Ryan and seconded by my other good friend and colleague the member for Aston, and I join with those across the chamber here tonight to commend the member for Ryan for bringing forward this motion to the House. Primary language disorder is a developmental disorder that affects many children across Australia. Children with PLD, as it is known, do not develop the ability to use or understand spoken or written language at the same rate as their peers. By 12 months of age, a child without PLD would be saying their first words such as 'mama' and 'dada'. However, sufferers of PLD may not be able to say their first words until they are three years of age. This has several negative implications on the child's development, and children with PLD often experience learning difficulties, social isolation, and behavioural problems. In some cases, PLD can affect the child's coordination and fine motor movements. While there is no cure for PLD, it has been shown that early intervention greatly improves the child's ability to communicate and interact with others. If sufferers of PLD do not receive the early attention they require, their speech or language disability impairment may become more profound and have a serious impact on their ability to learn and interact with others in the years to come. This often makes mainstream schooling difficult, and very frustrating not only for the child but also for their family, as adequate assistance is not always available. Despite the impact that PLD has on a child's ability to learn and interact with others, sufferers are not eligible for additional funding under the government's Better Start for Children with a Disability program. The Better Start initiative provides funding to children who have been diagnosed with one of 13 specific disability types prior to their sixth birthday, and this is not one of them. As the member for Ryan has pointed out, in her electorate there is some hope for parents who have children suffering with PLD: the Glenleighden School in Brisbane, which has been teaching children with PLD for the past 30 years. In my own electorate of Higgins, for more than 39 years the Currajong School has offered specialist support for students with spectrum disorder associated with social and behavioural problems. Currajong has a specialist support staff that includes a psychologist, a speech pathologist and an occupational therapist, all of whom work closely with teaching staff to ensure the best outcomes for each student. Every student has learning or behavioural goals that the staff and family work toward achieving. I have visited the school and seen the very dramatic impact that a specialist learning environment can have on children with behavioural and social issues and with such learning difficulties as PLD. I have sat with parents who have told me how these schools have helped their children to achieve their educational and personal potential. There are significant problems, as we all know, with disability funding. We know that disability funding is different in each and every state. The hope that somehow disability funding will be solved by the Gonski recommendations is just that-a hope. We have no detail currently as to how it might apply. The coalition's policy at the last election was to have an education card that would not discriminate between children who went to a government school and those who went to an independent school. The funding would follow the student so that parents could have choice as to where they sent their child to school to ensure that it was the best possible environment for them. We on this side want a learning environment where it is possible for children with PLD and other issues to receive targeted assistance for their conditions not only at school but in the years beyond that and for parents to receive the right and appropriate support. I commend the motion that the member for Ryan has brought before this House. It is a critically important issue. motion proposed by the member for Ryan on primary language disorder. This is an important issue, and I wish to share with the House some recent findings. Tasmanian researcher Belinda Jessup of the Tasmanian Department of Education last year completed her PhD on primary language disorder. She found that 41.2 per cent of Bass prep pupils have some form of the disorder; that 18.2 per cent of the general school population in Bass have this disorder; that primary language disorder has no obvious genetic cause, nor is it socioeconomic; and that it is",309,Private Members Business
267,Mr Lyons (Bass) (20:12,"I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak on thedemonstrated in kinder and prep as children not having comprehension and language skills. Belinda also found that primary language disorder leads to low self-confidence, low selfesteem, bad behaviour issues, antisocial issues and trouble with the law. It is more frequent in boys. It is clear that this is a problem, and I commend Belinda for her efforts and interest in this important area. Other research shows that early intervention through speech pathology is critical. The St Giles society is Tasmania's largest provider of public speech pathology and it is a fantastic organisation. St Giles was founded in 1937 as a response to the polio epidemic. The organisation has since truly flourished through two polio outbreaks and the deinstitutionalisation of children's disability services, and it is evolving to meet the current disability reforms towards the provision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. St Giles, just on Friday night, celebrated 75 years of service to the Tasmanian community. I thank each and every one of its staff and volunteers for the great work they do. St Giles was founded by the community for the community and this underpins everything it does. This government is committed to improving the lives of Australians with disability, and this is demonstrated by our actions since 2007. St Giles, in Launceston, has certainly been the beneficiary of this commitment, with the federal government providing it with $6.8 million in the 2012-13 budget for paediatric services in Tasmania. Under Australia's fragmented disability service systems many people cannot get the support that their families need. The people missing out include children with disability, many of whom can benefit greatly when they get early help in their lives. Supporting kids with disability through early intervention can make a huge difference to their development and gives them the best chance to make the most of their lives. This is particularly the case for children with primary language disorder. My wife's nephew, in fact, had early intervention and now he is a carpenter working in business and making his way in life. Since 2008 we have assisted more than 25,000 children with a disability to access early intervention services through the Better Start for Children with Disability program and the Helping Children with Autism Program. So our extra support for children with disability is already making a difference and I am very pleased about that. But we know there are still gaps and there are still inconsistencies. I know this from my time as the business manager at Launceston General Hospital and before that as the manager of Beaconsfield Hospital. We are leading the way to reform Australia's disability system through the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a true Labor reform in the tradition of Medicare. The coalition had 12 years to act on services for people with a disability and they sat on their hands. They stood by while demand grew for disability services, and disability pensioners struggled with the cost of living. They failed to invest in disability services and they failed to support students with disability. The NDIS is a fundamental change to how we will deliver disability care and support. Late in November last year I received an email from the mother of girl in my electorate, Mrs Ruth Symons. Ruth's daughter Katherine has a disability and she shared with me her struggles. Ruth wants the very best for her daughter. She said: The chance to have consistency of care for Katherine. To be able to take some control of the care that she receives and the care she will need. To not feel threatened by agencies or Service providers for questioning their services or their lack of outcomes. To have a choice and a voice! BUT above all the chance for her to reach her full potential. Our $1 billion investment in launch sites shows how serious we are about the NDIS. How people acquire their disability should not determine their support. I support this motion. Debate adjourned. Reform Agenda for Older Australians Debate resumed on the motion by Ms Hall: That this House: (1) acknowledges that the Government has a positive reform agenda for older Australians and is delivering enormous commitment and investment in aged care and promoting positive aged care issues by: (a) increasing the aged pension; (b) reforming the aged care system; and (c) helping older Australians stay at work longer; and (2) calls on all Members to support the reforms and guarantee support for older Australians. Ms HALL (Shortland) (20:17): I moved this motion that stands in my name on the Notice Paper. Australia has an ageing population; therefore, as a nation it is imperative that we have a positive approach to ageing, one which respects older people, provides them with opportunity and financial security plus a strong aged-care framework to provide care and support to frail aged Australians-people that look to government to make sure that they are taken care of when they are in need. This is a wide-ranging motion. It covers the age pension, the age-care system and helping older people stay in work longer. This government has a very proud record when it comes to financial support for older Australians. We have delivered the most significant reforms to the pension system in its 100-year history. Since 2009 Labor reforms have delivered increases to the maximum pension of $172 a fortnight for a single and $182 a fortnight for a couple. The single rate pensioner now is $4,300 better off a year. The maximum rate pensioner couple will now be $4,500 a year better off. Key aged-care reforms have taken place. The government has invested $59.5 billion in aged care over the next four years. That is our commitment: $40 billion funding for residential care over the next four years from 2012-13, and more than $13.4 billion estimated revenue for the residential care industry this year. Believe me, the industry is very pleased with being able to expect this additional funding, because they have struggled in the past. That will be $78,500 estimated average total revenue per resident, and $53,200 estimated average funding per resident from the Australian government this year. That is a big increase. There is a 26.7 per cent increase in income per resident. There is an 8.2 per cent annual increase in funding per resident and an 8.5 per cent increase in funding per resident. That is looking at a CPI increase of 2.7 per cent over three years. So they are big increases in funding. That will make a real difference to the lives of older people. It will provide additional support and care to help them remain in their home longer; provide additional help for carers to access respite and other support; deliver better residential care; strengthen the aged-care workforce; support consumers and research; make better health connections; tackle the nation's dementia epidemic; support older Australians from diverse backgrounds; and build a system for the future. The government has made a big commitment to dementia. It recognises the importance of having a healthcare system that responds to the challenges. It is estimated that almost a million people will have some form of dementia by 2050. The Standing Committee on Health and Ageing is currently undertaking an inquiry into early diagnosis and early intervention. I believe-and I know that all members on this side of the parliament believe-that is absolutely imperative. The funding of $123 million is now available for people with dementia for home care packages. The other aspect of this legislation refers to mature age workers. There are 3.8 million mature age workers in Australia, and many want to work. Actually, my husband is well over the retirement age, and he is still at work. Last year over-55s were around 16 per cent of the labour force, and that is compared to 10 per cent in 1980. There have been numerous government incentives to encourage workers to stay in the workforce. The appointment of Australia's first Age Discrimination Commissioner is also a commitment to older Australians. This government recognises that older people can make enormous contributions to our society both in the workforce and in the community generally. And as such we are committed to the future for older people. (Time expired) her motion. It gives me the opportunity to reflect on what wonderful contributions our older or senior Australians have made to our community over the years. I note that the member makes reference in her motion to the positive reform agenda for older Australians and claims to have delivered enormous commitments and investment to aged care by increasing the age pension, reforming the aged-care system and helping older Australians work longer. There are a few little bits and pieces there. We have had the change in superannuation so that people still working can get super between 70 and 74, and I think that is a positive move. Certainly in my previous life in the financial services sector that was a frustration for a lot of my clients that were still working in that age bracket. This is a sector that is absolutely buried underneath layers of regulation and red tape and is possibly one of the most regulated sectors in our country. I think it is instructive to note that since 2007 there have been more than 20 reviews and inquiries relating to ageing and agedcare issues, including three by the Productivity Commission. It took over 250 days for this government to respond to just one of these reports, the 2011 landmark Productivity Commission report. Of all of these reports, only a few recommendations have been picked out by this government. They have increased the age pension and they support older Australians staying in the workforce longer, which, as I have said, we on our side have supported. But at the end of the day a total of $1.6 billion has been cut out of the aged-care sector, resulting in local aged-care providers finding it really difficult to cope. Aged-care nurses are spending a third of their shifts doing paperwork to keep up with the excessive regulations placed on this sector. By all means this is a sector that needs regulation, but not in this current form. Imagine your elderly parent or grandparent missing out on essential care because a nurse is too busy working on paperwork to attend to their needs. Our older Australians deserve better. They have contributed so much to our country and have made it the great place that it is for us to enjoy today, and we need to ensure that they get the care they deserve.",312,Private Members Business
268,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (20:23,"I would like to thank the member for Shortland forIt is interesting looking at this motion and I think it is worthwhile separating out the issues, because quality aged care is a separate issue to pension increases and having older Australians in the workforce. If we are talking about a positive reform agenda for aged care, then we are not quite there under the current government. Since the last federal election, the coalition has continued to listen to the aged-care sector. We confirm that we are committed to supporting older Australians with better and more sustainable aged-care services. Our agreement will deliver better and more affordable aged care by reducing red tape and enabling nurses to get back to nursing and taking care of residents; by providing certainty for aged care for older Australians, underpinned by a high-quality framework; by delivering value for money through revised subsidy arrangements; by ensuring certainty for the aged-care workforce, by establishing a more flexible and viable aged-care provider network to meet the care needs now and into the future; and by ensuring that the comfort and safety of older Australians is maximised. The coalition wants reform in partnership with the aged-care sector; it does not believe that fundamental reforms should be imposed from above. If successful at the next federal election, we will immediately commence consultation with stakeholders in the ageing and aged-care sector on the framework of the aged-care provider agreement, including consideration of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. We in the coalition will always support measures to assist the senior members of our community. (Time expired) Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (20:28): On Saturday, 1 December it was my great pleasure to attend the Belconnen Senior Citizens Club's 30th anniversary party. I went along with my two older boys-my five-year-old Sebastian and my three-year-old Theodore-who I must say were wonderfully feted by the members of the Belconnen Senior Citizens Club. This is a club which is focused on sports and recreation. There are older Australians in the Belconnen area who are engaged in dancing clubs, walking clubs and sports of all kinds. Mal, Noelene and Marj were particularly generous in looking after Sebastian and Theodore, and I also enjoyed seeing new ACT MLA Yvette Berry and her father, Wayne, at the event. It was a great reminder, if one were needed, of the vigour and energy of older Australians in my electorate of Fraser. Over the last 40 years, life expectancy in Australia has increased by around a decade. One of the great thought experiments is: which would you prefer-an extra decade of life or the economic growth that has come over that period, with approximately a doubling in real per capita incomes? I have barely met a person who says that, if they had to choose between the two, they would take the money over the years. Most of us value that extra decade of life far more than even a doubling in income. It is a reminder of the great advantages of Australia and of the health and lifestyle reforms that have increased longevity. When I hear commentators talk about the 'problem' of ageing, I am tempted to reply-as Minister Shorten sometimes does-'It beats the alternative.' Certainly there are challenges that Australia faces in an ageing population but they are great challenges to have. On 19 November last year Minister Butler came to my electorate and held with me an aged care forum to speak with Canberrans about the aged care changes that the government is putting through in its Living Longer Living Better aged care package. The package is improving the wages in the aged care sector and making sure that people have greater access to choice and information. Older Australians and their loved ones often have to make quick decisions and it is important that people have access to all of the information in front of them. It is important that people looking at retirement home options realise that they do not just have to pay bonds but that they can pay daily payments. It is important that people have support if they want to stay in their own homes, as so many do. The forum was the most popular event I have run in my electorate. I held another on 7 December, which again packed out the room in the Griffin Centre. It was a real reminder of the interest that Canberrans have in understanding the government's aged care reforms. This is a government that is committed to improving dignity in retirement. When we increased the single age pension for someone on the full rate by $1,600 a year, it decreased the poverty rate. The University of New South Wales's Peter Whiteford estimated that it reduced by about a fifth the number of people living in poverty in Australia, a massive reduction. Now the government's increase in universal superannuation from nine to 12 per cent is again going to see more Australians enjoying dignity in retirement. By bringing down the tax rate on superannuation contributions of lower-income Australians to zero, we are encouraging low-income Australians to save for their retirement. Recognising that low-income earners are disproportionately women, who have lower superannuation balances, this is a measure that particularly advantages women, which is why taking it away would so disadvantage lowincome Australians and women. This government is proud of its reforms, of its assistance to people in the aged care sector and of increased longevity in Australia. that we should never complain about being old. Certainly, Nationals New South Wales Senator John Williams said to me only recently that none of us should complain about getting old because some Australians, indeed many people in the world, do not get that choice and unfortunately die far too young. This motion is about aged care and Australia's ageing population. For many, it is Australia's most challenging social issue. Present projections have it that over-85-year-olds, who currently make up 1.7 per cent of the population, will represent 5.7 per cent of the population in Australian by the year 2047. How we deal with this as a nation and how we meet the growing costs of aged care will be critical for future Commonwealth governments. While Labor's living better package claims to, as the motion states, deliver enormous commitment and investment in aged care, there are significant gaps. This is probably because the government brought the announcement of this package forward a few weeks and the same old Labor spin doctors were at it again, unfortunately. The government claimed this was part of its positive aged care plan, which this motion seeks to acknowledge, but it was, I believe, just an idle attempt by Labor to give the impression it was doing something in aged care when it was really years away. Sure, a headline figure of an additional $3.7 billion over five years sounds impressive but, like most of Labor's ideas and promises, the devil is indeed in the detail. This so-called new spending initiative is a combination of the government's means testing as well as the reallocation of funding from other existing projects. The actual amount of new money being spent on aged care is only $577 million, a far cry from the $3.7 billion headline. The coalition's response to this plan was cautious. We wanted to wait and see what the actual detail of this plan was. It is fortunate that we did, because there are some significant oversights. In Labor's usual style, it has missed an opportunity to reduce red tape. The aged-",315,Private Members Business
269,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (20:33,"I agree with the member for Fraser when he sayscare sector has been crying out for somebody who can go in and fully cost a plan which will be positive for them. This was evident when the shadow minister for aged care, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, and I toured aged-care centres in Griffith, in my electorate, last November. Labor could have made the system much better. But it did not. So many people in my electorate are complaining about this very fact. Labor had the opportunity to increase productivity in this crucial system, but it chose not to. In an industry where aged-care centres are wallowing in red tape, the government's Living Longer Living Better package will, unfortunately, place additional demands on an already crowded system. In fact, the coalition has been advised that at present some aged-care nurses can spend up to one-third of their time on bureaucratic paperwork. There were reviews and consultations, as there always are with this government, but the government has ignored this advice and cherry-picked from the Productivity Commission's report, taking only a few of its recommendations. The sector has some significant concerns about Labor's new plan, which this motion fails to acknowledge. Chief among these is the government's decision to rip $1.6 billion out of the aged-care funding instrument over the next four years. These cuts, according to the government, have been made because of assertions of rorting within the sector and for which there has been no substantive evidence produced to date. These are not cuts in places where they are needed, such as unnecessary bureaucracy. These cuts are coming out of funding for essential services such as reclassified patients who are high care to medium care. This will lead to staff cuts in aged-care homes and place an even greater demand on an already ailing system. It is no wonder we saw headlines in the Sydney Morning Herald 'Minister defends cash cut for aged' and in the Australian Financial Review 'Nursing homes face subsidy growth limit', because this government and the minister have a problem of their own making. According to many, aged care is the single most challenging social issue that governments will face in the future. The coalition has a plan to restore investment in the industry so that it can cope with increasing demands into the future. The coalition has spent a lot of time talking, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells and I did in Griffith in November, with the grassroots sectors of the aged-care industry to ensure that we get the plan right. At the last federal election the coalition set out its commitment to the delivery of a highquality, affordable and accessible aged-care scheme which meets the needs and preferences of older Australians. For the next election we the coalition are committed to reducing the inhibiting red tape this government has placed on the industry and restoring a real and sustainable plan which meets the needs of an ageing population. We will negotiate an agedcare provider agreement with the aged-care sector. The first ever aged-care provider agreement will set the framework for aged care and ageing in Australia over the next four years. We will bolster Medicare by reinstating the private health insurance rebate as soon as we responsibly can. So while this motion seeks to acknowledge the government's positive plan, we must remember that, as with all of Labor's promises, this is more smoke and mirrors. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (20:38): I rise to support the private member's motion on the reform agenda for older Australians, moved by the member for Shortland. The member for Shortland is a strong advocate of all aged-care issues, so it is a great pleasure to be speaking on her motion this evening. The quality of life for elderly Australians is particularly important and it is more so in my electorate, which is one of the most multicultural and diverse electorates in Australia and has indeed one of the largest ageing communities. Ageing is an integral part of the life cycle where nothing is quite as complicated because of cultural and linguistic sensitivities as caring for elderly people and their very complex needs. Increasing the age pension, reforming the aged-care system and helping older Australians stay at work longer are all part and parcel of addressing those needs and they are being implemented by the Gillard Labor government. Caring for the aged is an issue that affects all communities and all sectors. I find this is continuously reiterated to me through my personal work with my constituents and also in my dealings with community groups, both in my electorate and elsewhere, particularly given the ageing of Australia's post-Second World War migration, otherwise known as the ageing of Arthur Calwell's new Australians. Of the ageing new Australians-they once were new Australians-the Greek and Italian communities have the largest number of ageing people, and they are followed by the Chinese, Indians, Turks and many others who came to Australia during that period. I have spoken many times to those communities and almost all of them advocate-and these are alarm bells that we need to heed-that what is now paramount is the proper care of the elderly and in particular the care of the elderly from migrant communities, because the quality of that care is a hallmark of any civilised society. The ageing of migrant communities brings special challenges that we are all very familiar with. Just as newly arrived migrants need special services to assist their settlement into this country in the first five years of their arrival, so too, at the other end of the spectrum, elderly migrants require culturally and linguistically sensitive services to cater for their needs as they age. This is the case no matter how long they have lived here. Many of them have been here for many decades. The date 29 August marks 50 years since my father and his young family, including me, first disembarked at Station Pier at Port Melbourne. It is for those reasons that I am very pleased to say that the government has made important headway on reforming the aged-care system when it comes to caring for our ageing people and in particular our ageing migrant population. In December last year I welcomed the release of the National Ageing and Aged Care Strategy for People from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Backgrounds. The strategy will help inform the delivery of Living Longer Living Better, which is part of the government's $3.7 billion aged-care reform package. As we all know, ageing brings with it a returning emphasis and reliance on the mother tongue. Older people, no matter how fluently they have acquired a second language-in this case, English-or subsequent language during their lifetime, tend to feel most comfortable in their original language as they grow older. Taking into account that about 20 per cent of people aged 65 years and over were born outside Australia and by 2021 that number will rise to 30 per cent, it is vital that we are sensitive to this fact when planning and providing services to older Australians of nonEnglish-speaking background. The migrant elderly-many of them in my electorate-often have very different cultural, linguistic and spiritual needs, and that can affect the type of care and services they require and are provided for. I congratulate the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, because he has recognised that this community sector has very important needs and unique challenges that are faced by the elderly, their families and their aged-care providers. He has responded to those needs through the National Ageing and Aged Care Strategy for People from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Backgrounds. That is the basis upon which the government will assist in helping this sector develop highly specialised needs. (Time expired) Shortland, as the ageing population is a major issue for this and future governments. I agree that we must guarantee support for older Australians and, in particular, that reform of the aged-care sector is particularly important for our ageing population. The motion does not admit that this government was forced to increase the age pension as a result of its own economic incompetence and its failure to rein in the real cost-of-living pressures that affect older Australians. Governments do not support older Australians by implementing the world's biggest carbon tax economy-wide without giving one cent to almost 300,000 self-funded retirees. Governments do not support older Australians by increasing the cost of private health insurance and governments do not support older Australians by increasing taxes on superannuation and reducing the amount that Australians can contribute to their own superannuation. We cannot support our senior Australians if we fail to implement real reform for the agedcare system, particularly at a time when Australians are expecting more and more from aged care. Yet this is exactly what the Labor government has been doing since it took office in 2007. I continue to meet with many aged-care providers in my electorate who are disappointed with the government's response to the Productivity Commission's Caring for older Australians report of 2011. The government missed the opportunity at that time to implement real supply-side reform in what many see as a wasteful, unfair and inefficient Aged-Care Approvals Round process, where providers applied for packages from the government. It has been conveyed to me by people who operate in the aged-care sector that resources are continuing to be wasted and taxpayer funds are not being efficiently allocated because clients have no, or very limited, input into choosing a provider. They are also rightly concerned about the government cutting $1.6 billion from the Aged Care Funding Instrument. Cutting $1.6 billion is not a sign of a government acting in the long-term interests of the industry. As we move from the baby boomer generation to the next, users of aged-care services will no longer meekly accept what they are given, as many Australians had to do during tough economic times earlier last century. It is therefore integral to the future care of older Australians that we implement policies that give clients and their families the ability to choose their own provider to deliver government funded services which they have been assessed as needing. Secondly, the Labor government is making it more difficult for older Australians to support themselves by increasing taxes on superannuation. The Treasurer has run out of taxpayers' money and is now resorting to attacking the hard-earned money and savings in Australian superannuation funds. It is likely that the quality of life and living conditions for older Australians will worsen in the future because we have a government which is ripping the heart out of the superannuation system. Despite having already increased taxes on super by $8 billion, the government has not ruled out further attacks on super. This has created enormous uncertainty for retirees and those approaching retirement. The government promised in 2007 that they would not change super taxes, but that is exactly what they have been doing ever since. By their actions, they will continue to increase taxes on super in the future. They have",317,Private Members Business
270,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (20:43,"I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member forcut the government's co-contribution scheme-aimed directly at assisting the lowest paid in this country-by $1,000, a cut worth $3.2 billion to their bottom line. Lastly, the motion claims that the government is helping older Australians stay at work longer. They have recently announced that they are going to legislate flexibility. You do not help older Australians stay at work longer by simply legislating that someone has the right to a part-time job, as if that right somehow compels a local small business owner to employ someone that they cannot afford. At the end of the day, governments do not create jobs; businesses do. With jobs, governments can go two ways. They can stifle business, overregulating them and controlling them with so many regulations that the likelihood that businesses will employ any Australians, particularly older Australians, is reduced. Alternatively, governments can get out of the way and ease conditions and regulations on small business so that businesses can grow and there may actually be jobs for older Australians to be employed in in the future. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Val French and the work she does with the Older People Speak Out, OPSO, organisation. They are great advocates for the aged in our community, not only for having older people working but also for their rights going forward. Debate adjourned. Cyclone Oswald Insurance Industry to speak in the grievance debate. There are two matters I wish to grieve about. My electorate of Hinkler and, to a lesser extent, the seats of Flynn, Wide Bay and Capricornia were the focus of the Australia Day tornadoes, followed by the floods that ensued as Cyclone Oswald turned into a rain depression. That rain depression was quite hard to predict. It moved inland into the headwaters of many of many of our rivers and caused a flood circumstance of a magnitude we have not seen before. Just to give the Federation Chamber some scale, in 1890 we had 9.05 metres, in 1942 we had 8.5 and in 2011 we had 7.9. But this time we went up to 5.4 metres-in other words, 1.6 metres over the last flood circumstance and half a metre from the all-time high. It was uncharted territory. WhatI want to grieve about is this: we saw in the last floods in 2011, especially at Grantham, the first murmurings of 'We have to do something different.' We do this in parts of Australia endlessly over and over again. We race to the aid of our fellow Australians, as well we should. We go through the torture of evacuating people, of cleaning out houses, of mourning the dead and of rebuilding, but we do not do a heck of a lot about reconstruction and relocation. We should. You really have to ask yourself when you go back over nearly 100 years of well-documented floods, what are we really doing to stop this happening? There are always plenty of us around, including our ministers and shadow ministers, and again it is appropriate that they should be there and they should support people. We certainly go through the traumas of the flood, the evacuation centres, the people who work endless hours in emergency services, the people who shift rubbish, the mud armies-all this kind of thing. They are all appropriate and I am not in any way detracting from them one iota. But you",320,Private Members Business
271,Mr Neville (Hinkler,"The Nationals Deputy Whip) (20:48): It gives me great pleasurereally have to ask yourself, after every one of these floods what is the way up between what we spent and what we achieved the next time? I think we should have a commission of inquiry into that and that we should have some sort of restoration commission and that both sides of politics perhaps should come together and have a bipartisan horizon of 10 years in which we take a totally new look at this thing. I do not know what the right figure is and that is what the commission could find out, but it could be perhaps $200 million a year for 10 years, $2 billion over 10 years, to start a whole series of things. One is to put certain houses on high stumps, the old Queenslander, quite common in Queensland and northern New South Wales. Providing the house is sound and aesthetically pleasing, why wouldn't you? If you do get a flood and it washes through the bottom, it is not the end of the world. Another is that all councils have land banks of one sort or another. Why not develop some of those, create a new suburb and start moving houses. Again, the house has got to have aesthetic and construction integrity. We are not suggesting that you put all the run-down houses in all the run-down suburbs that get wet and put them all into one estate to create some sort of slum. I am not suggesting that for a minute. But where they are aesthetically pleasing and can be restored you put them there. You would have an incentive program for people to move to those places. Finally, with the ones that are just not worth moving but need to be knocked down, you have some program with a public housing component to it where a person could get a nice three-bedroom cottage on condition they moved to this new site. If we did this over a 10-year period, we would not solve all of them and some people would be slow to move and there would be lots of problems, but we will not solve it by standing back and pretending it is not happening. It is happening and if we are moving into a period of more extreme weather conditions-I am not going into the pros and cons of climate change, I am talking broadly-we are going into a period of more violent weather conditions then perhaps we should be looking at it fairly soon. The other thing I want to grieve about is insurance. I am just not convinced that we are getting a good deal from our insurance companies. I am going to be radical tonight-it is not like me, a member of the coalition and a member of the National Party, to say this-because I think we have come to a point where we should reconsider the State Government Insurance Offices. You might say 'shock, horror, it has all got to be done by free enterprise'. Well, yes and no. With communications, if we cannot get telecommunications providers to go to a certain area, the provider of last resort is Telstra. We accept that; all Australians accept that. I think that if we had an SGIO in each state that took responsibility for a certain area of insurance-and we have very good SGIOs in Queensland and New South Wales, and I am sure in other states, and I am told the SGIO in the Northern Territory which is still in practice is effective-that would provide us with an insurer of last resort. I am not suggesting for a minute that this insurer would take unreasonable risks. Equally, we would not have situations like the case of one of our members here in this parliament-who shall remain nameless but is from a western Queensland town-whose insurance was $1,500 a year and after the recent floods it was put up to $10,000 a year. He objected to that and had it changed but the point was that he lived at one end of the street which was up high and the flood area was down low, yet the insurance company just said that he was in such-and-such a street and would have to pay the higher premium. It did not accord with what the real flood risk was. As if that is not bad enough, there are people in high-rises that are paying incredible figures now. People who are buying units for their retirement just cannot afford to live in them. Something is radically wrong. At other times, insurance companies work on the basis of postcodes-postcodes! For God's sake, in any town there are hills, there are valleys and there are low-lying areas, and there are some places that have not experienced a flood since Australia was settled. And, yet, that postcode cops this insurance rates premium. This has happened to me personally. I am nowhere near a flood area in Bundaberg, and yet my premium was-until I objected very strongly-to go up radically. I think we have got to get to a new point. All councils today have contour lines on the maps. In fact, most councils now can deliver that information for every house in a town or suburb. It is not beyond the capacity of insurance companies to come to terms with that, and to set their premiums on what the basis of insurance used to becontrolling risk. It is a matter of assessing risk, looking over a broad horizon of so many years, looking at what it might cost in a bad eventuality and taking into account other things, and then setting the premium. We have to get back to that. (Time expired) Iraqi Refugees Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (20:59): My grievance this evening is about the underutilisation of skilled and highly qualified Australians who have come here to live in this country under the refugee and humanitarian program, and, in some cases, also those peopleespecially partners of principal applicants-who have come to Australia under other categories. My grievance is about the difficult process of degree and qualifications recognition, as well is the lack of recognition of prior work experience by local Australian employers as told to me by many of my constituents. My seat of Calwell probably has the largest constituency of Iraqi refugees in the country, and they are predominantly Christians of Chaldean extraction, and also of Assyrian and Syriac extraction, who have been settling in the northern suburbs of Melbourne: Campbellfield, Broadmeadows, Roxburgh Park and Craigieburn-all, of course, significant established growth suburbs in my electorate of Calwell. Such is the growth in the settlement of Iraqi Christians in Calwell that each month at our local citizenship ceremonies this emerging largely refugee community is very heavily represented in taking up Australian citizenship. They are characterised by many things, but one in particular is their devotion to their Christian faith. They are indeed devoted parishioners, and as a result the federal seat of Calwell is home to the Chaldean cathedral of Our Lady Guardian of Plants in Campbellfield, the Ancient Church of the East St Mary's in Coolaroo, the Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East in Coolaroo and the Holy Spirit Syriac Catholic Church in Dallas-where I had the honour of attending the weekly Sunday mass service last night, which on this occasion involved the ordination of five deacons by the pope of the Syriac Catholic Church, Pope Joseph, who was visiting Melbourne from Lebanon for the occasion. These emerging communities-the Chaldeans, Assyrians and Syriacs from Iraq-have many needs as they work their way through the settlement process. Paramount, of course, is establishing a home, and more important to them than anything is the education of their children. But, of course, very important to them is the gaining of employment, and this is essential to their ability to achieve the establishment of a home and the education of their children. Employment, however, often means trying to find similar or comparable work to what they were doing when they were in Iraq, and the problem for a large number is that they cannot. This is a major source of their frustration and angst as they work their way through the settlement process here in Australia. The Iraqi community can be best described as a relatively highly educated community with skills and qualifications across a range of academic professions, particularly, I have found, in the fields of maths and sciences. They are, in addition to that, linguistically competent, and many are able to speak, in addition to their native language or dialect-which is based on ancient Aramaic-Arabic and English. Many of them are very proficient in English. They are people who come here as refugees, as I have noted, having left successful careers and lives behind in Iraq. By virtue of their age when they come here, they have built expertise and experience in the professions that they have worked in. To illustrate this, I can say that I recently met a constituent from Iraq in my electorate who was the first female graduate as a dentist in Iraq. She had a successful practice there until she was forced to flee during the first Iraq war. She was the first female dentist in Iraq, and she is living in Broadmeadows in my electorate-incredible. She is one of the many Iraqis who have much to offer the Australian community, and I can tell you that they are very keen to make a contribution to this new homeland. I fear and they fear that they are being underutilised and undervalued for a number of reasons, one of which, of course, is the complexities of the qualification recognition regime in this country. I would like to share with the chamber a couple more local stories, because I think it is very important that we tell these stories so that maybe we can begin to focus on this issue as a parliament so that we can understand it and address it if possible. I believe that we have much to gain from facilitating the employment of people such as my constituents in this country. One of my other constituents who came to see me sometime last year was an academic while living in Iraq, and his expertise was in agriculture. He had written many books, and in fact he had even advised the Iraqi government. His greatest frustration was that he could not get a job in academia here in Australia. In fact, he said to me that he felt deeply hurt at what he felt was a refusal to acknowledge the value of his academic achievements. He basically just could not understand why he could not get a job given the standard of his expertise. There is another constituent who I have become very fond of and very close to, Mr Louis Joseph. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in science, majoring in chemistry, from Iraq in 1990. Following the Gulf War, Louis had to migrate to Turkey and applied to come to Australia under the Humanitarian Program. Upon arriving, Louis was informed that his qualification was not fully recognised as a degree, but rather a diploma. His experience in Iraq as a scientist in the field of chemistry was similarly not recognised, and he was told to restudy his degree in Australia. Louis did complete a bachelor degree in science and chemistry here in Australia. He found that he had completed in his own course in Iraq far more advanced subjects and that here in Australia he was merely repeating subjects he had already completed in Iraq. Furthermore, his Australian degree cost him $10,000 and, in his words: Even if your degree gets recognised, prospective employers see an overseas graduate. There is a question mark over you. As I said, I have come to know him personally. He is making an impossible contribution to the local community. I think that he, along with many of my other constituents, has a very significant contribution to make to this country. We owe it to ourselves and we owe it to the people who are being brought here under the refugee Humanitarian Program to do the best we can to take advantage of the skills and the expertise that they bring with them. Many of them, in order to make ends meet, have to do menial jobs because they have to work-jobs that are far removed from the areas in which they have been trained and they have studied in. Colloquially, this is called the 'overqualified taxidriver syndrome'. I think it is a syndrome that many of my colleagues in this place would be familiar with, especially those who have constituencies similar to mine. The extent of the overqualified taxidriver syndrome is not known, nor its existence conclusively proven. It remains largely anecdotal, but it persists enough through anecdotes and through direct storytelling and contact with members of the community to suggest that there is an issue that we need to examine and research more thoroughly in order to avail ourselves of a much needed understanding of this. Because whether the community is of Iraqi or African or European background, the narrative about, in this instance, recognising overseas qualifications and acceptance or value of overseas work experience for people who come to Australia under the refugee Humanitarian Program is largely the same wherever you go and whoever you talk to in this country. I am pleased to say that there has been some response, or an attempt to respond, to this from the government. We have already taken steps to try to address some of these issues. I want to commend the recently funded Melbourne Employment Forum as $20,000 has been allocated to work with migrant communities on some important job initiatives, including bringing together existing expertise to establish an independent network of migrant communities and using the forum as a hub for research and strengthening of employment opportunities. This is a beginning; by all means it is not the perfect solution, but it is a beginning. I look forward to this work continuing for the benefit of my constituents and everyone else in this country. Africa: Aircraft Accident debate this evening on behalf of one of my constituents. It has been almost 8½ years since South African registered plane ZS-KOX crashed while returning from a flight to Victoria Falls in Zambia. On board were Justine Watters, her husband, Matt Watters, Matt's mother, Shirley Watters, and their friends from United Kingdom, Justin and Rebecca Ward. All, including the Canadian pilot, Mike Channer, perished. The Watters family were constituents in my seat of Pearce, as is Justine Watters' father, Mr Sam Morton, who I understand is in the parliament this evening. Mr Morton is an extraordinary person who, in the midst of his own considerable grief, was one of the first people to get to the crash site, where he began the gruelling process of recovering the bodies of his much loved family, their friends and indeed the pilot. Sam Morton has been a constant source of comfort to the other families affected by this disaster and has pressed tirelessly for action from the South African government, both to have the matter properly investigated and to ensure that such an event could not happen again. Shortly after the return flight began, the propeller of ZS KOX fell off at 8,000 feet and six minutes later the plane crashed. Mr Morton has been very grateful for the cooperation and assistance of Mr Joseph Kabotolo, Mr Chitalu Kabalika-then the director of the Zambian Department of Civil Aviation-and Ms Karen Van Boxtel, stationed with the British FCO in Lusaka, for the kindness and help they rendered the bereaved families following the tragedy.",321,Grievance Debate
272,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (21:09,"I appreciate the opportunity to raise a grievance in thisThe Zambian Department of Civil Aviation, along with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and its American counterpart, conducted an investigation into the reasons for the crash. The findings were disturbing as the causes were found to be: …in-flight detachment of the propeller assembly attachment studs, improper torque of the propeller studs (failure to lock the studs allowed the studs to back out of the propeller hub assembly in the separation of the propeller from the aircraft), failure to follow correct propeller installation procedure; and failure to use identifiable manufacturers' approved parts. There were suitable landing sites available to the pilot but he had no power source and visibility was extremely reduced due to engine oil covering the cockpit windows. As the plane was registered in South Africa the maintenance had to be carried out by a South African registered maintenance company approved by the South African Civil Aviation Authority, or SACAA. Following the accident, Mr Pine Pienaar, then chief executive officer of Nelair Engineering, confirmed in writing that the propeller of ZS KOX was removed by Nelair 130 operating hours before the crash and inspected 30 operating hours before the crash. Nelair carried out the last three mandatory periodic inspections, which included removal and refitting of the propeller, in January 2004. The final mandatory periodic inspection and other maintenance was carried out by Nelair only 19 days before the crash. In 2006, the late Dr Ian Phillips of the South African Department of Transport assisted SACAA in examining the details of the crash. Dr Phillips informed the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that SACAA had audited Nelair and as a result revoked their aircraft maintenance organisation licence, called an AMO. Dr Phillips stated that the cancellation was permanent and that the Department of Transport would vigorously resist any effort by Nelair to obtain their AMO licence again. Since the crash of ZS KOX, Nelair has been involved in two additional incidents involving poor maintenance, of which one was a propeller separation. If you do a Google search you will find Nelair still advertising as one of the largest privately owned companies in South Africa concentrating on aircraft maintenance and servicing. Since 2006 the matter has been vigorously pursued by Sam Morton-through three prime ministers in Australia, four successive Australian foreign ministers including Alexander Downer, the member for Griffith, the member for Perth, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, and the British and Canadian governments who have been actively engaged, and all have been extremely helpful. In 2006 I was in South Africa with the assistance of the then Australian High Commissioner Philip Green, who made an extraordinary effort to assist. We tried to set up a meeting with the director-general of the Department of Transport, Ms Mpumi Mpofu. Ms Mpofu was not available for a meeting. A phone hook-up was arranged with her and she subsequently undertook to inform the minister of these events. I also addressed the relevant South African Senate committee, whose members expressed much sympathy and distress over the terrible loss of life. Mr Levers Mapaso from the South African Department of Transport referred the matter to the National Prosecution Authority for review and it has been with that authority since April 2009. The parts sent to America by the Zambian Department of Civil Aviation for investigation have gone missing. The South African CAA claimed key files were lost, and a board of inquiry was cancelled at the last minute without any clear reasons being given. Time delays and the failure of the relevant South African authorities to notify the South African Police Service within a reasonable period of time that a criminal investigation is called for has resulted in crucial evidence being lost and or unaccounted for. Mr Morton has not given up and continues to press for a just outcome. He has the support of many in this place, including my colleague the member for Brand, who has been very helpful in bringing the matter to the attention of the current government. Mr Morton and the other families are entitled to answers to so many unanswered questions. TonightI would again respectfully ask the South African authorities to take all necessary action to properly investigate this matter. I wish also to record my appreciation, as I said, for the member for Brand, who has provided assistance in continuing to pursue this matter in recent years. I extend again my sincere sympathy to Mr Morton and his family and to families of the other people who lost their lives in what should have been an avoidable disaster. Most importantly, the member for Brand and I had hoped that the South African High Commissioner would be here this evening. Perhaps the high commissioner is somewhere in the parliamentary building. There are questions that need to be answered and issues that need to be investigated. Why wasn't this matter referred by the relevant South African authorities to the South African Police Service in a timely manner? Why was the board of inquiry cancelled without any reasonable explanation? What has happened to the failed parts of ZS-KOX which were examined by investigators and have now gone missing? Finally, what has happened to the key files that are also, we have been told, now missing or unaccounted for? Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you and to others in this parliament: these are very serious matters. They must be investigated and the questions must be answered. Once again, I would like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and all those who have assisted us over the years to try to get this matter properly investigated and to make sure that this kind of event does not cause such grief to other families as it has caused to the Morton and Watters families and the other families from the UK and Canada. Werriwa Electorate: Coal Seam Gas residents in the Werriwa electorate in relation to the proposal for coal seam gas exploration and fracking in my electorate. Werriwa is on the urban fringe of Sydney. It has some rural aspects. Last week AGL suspended an application for exploration in that area. At first residents greeted this with great joy, thinking that it was a victory for residents. However, one must be cynical that perhaps there are other reasons for this withdrawal. It has been claimed that the initial application was really lacking in substance-there was the company's attempt to justify it on economic and employment grounds. Another possibility is that they wish to see this go off the agenda for some time and a downturn in activity by the community and then perhaps relaunch it when it gets a bit quieter. Thirdly, of course, there could be the fact of the federal election. Last week Minister Burke made the following comments: NowI have very deep concerns. He is talking about this particular industry: One, about that principal itself but secondly, I've got concerns about what does that say about the New South Wales Government's attitude to this issue? We are not only talking about the sort of land that, for example, with the Darling Downs in Queensland with all the controversy that that involved, we're not just talking about land like that.",325,Grievance Debate
273,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa) (21:18,"This evening I want to join with localWe have acreage that goes right into residential areas and I know the attention has been on the New England area but this goes all the way up the north coast of New South Wales, this goes to the Hunter and this goes in Western Sydney and I am deeply concerned … As I say, that could be one of the reasons for the suspension of the application. I have to say I have grave concerns. A few local Liberal MPs are saying they are against this proposal. They have joined with Campbelltown and Liverpool councils. However, the state minister seems to be a major booster for the industry. Perhaps this is where he is going to parachute to after his political career. Because in response to one of his Liberal colleagues some months ago-and that colleague was writing on behalf of Campbelltown councilMinister Hartcher said: Council's proposal for provision to be made to 'appeal determinations made for all coal seam gas extraction activity proposals' is a matter that would be best put to the Minister for Planning ... I do not support such a position in relation to exploration as I believe it would add an unnecessary burden on industry and prevent exploration. In the aftermath of the withdrawal of the application last week he was again up in the media circle with further comments on this issue. This is a man that is part of the state government, supposed be giving some rights to residents with regard to these developments. He said: (Coal seam gas) is no good to us still in the ground … You have to take it where it is, you can't say you don't want to develop it here. So Minister Hartcher is certainly making his views clear from a government position, which might be in contrast to a few state MPs running around the place seemingly against it. We have a situation, as I said, in New South Wales where there must be grave concerns about the government's attitudes. I notice the daughter of the former minister for immigration, Phillip Ruddock, has certainly been very active around this issue. What was interesting was the state government's decision to de-fund the organisation which she heads, the Environmental Defender's Office. People in that state might be aware that this withdrawal of funding to the organisation came after complaints from the coal industry to the Premier that they were causing too much trouble for the industry, that they were actually representing residents, giving them information, providing expertise et cetera. So what we have seen in New South Wales is the closure of that organisation. I have a quote here from the Sydney Morning Herald: The mining industry urged the Premier, Barry O'Farrell, to scrap funding to the Environmental Defenders Office-and months later the state government did just that. I have to say that this organisation is valuable. It has produced booklets that have certainly been circulated widely in the state. I have urged the federal minister-I am not putting too many dollars on this at the TAB-to try and give some funding to make sure this organisation does continue to do its work. This industry, of course, is widely discredited. A year ago they tried to allege in the public domain that the CSIRO had endorsed their analysis of the industry and its problems. In contrast, the CSIRO, in the Sydney Morning Herald of 11 January this year, was forced to actually go on the public record. A reputable, respected government organisation had to actually repudiate the industry in public because of misleading claims. This article in the Herald states the CSIRO rejects claims made by APPEA regarding groundwater and coal seam gas. The CSIRO rejects the claim made in a television commercial aired on 2 September that: CSIRO [and government studies] have shown that groundwater is safe with coal seam gas. Those are the kinds of lengths to which this industry will go. I referred earlier to local opposition. I put out 22,000 cards in my electorate in the last two to three weeks, and I am pleased to say that in excess of 800 of them have been returned to the office, which is indicative of a very strong groundswell of opposition to this proposal. This proposal is in a pristine, long-treasured area called the Scenic Hills. It is in close proximity to residential areas. There is grave concern about property values in the area and of course about issues such as groundwater and seismic movements. We know that in the United Kingdom internal documents from one of the companies indicated their own concerns about their responsibility for possible seismic movements. It is interesting to note that there has been firm opposition by the industry to regulation and controls. The Chief Operating Officer of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, Rick Wilkinson, said the industry in New South Wales and Queensland 'is arguably the most heavily regulated in Australia and any proposal from Canberra to duplicate strict state-based regulation is wasteful and inefficient'. So there you go, the industry is very concerned with the federal government's attempts to give the community some rights to join with local councils-Liberal and independent controlled-in opposing these measures. There are grave concerns about this internationally. Bill McKibben's article in the New York Review of Books on 8 March 2012 was the first article that alerted me to developments in the United States, particularly in the state of Pennsylvania. He said: December, then, was a tough month for the fracking industry, and it ended on a particularly low noteon New Year's Eve a magnitude 4.0 earthquake in Youngstown, Ohio, was blamed on the injection of high-pressure fracking water along a seismic fault, a phenomenon also documented in Arkansas and Oklahoma. A second concern has to do with the damage being done to rivers and streams-and the water supply for homes and industries-by the briny soup that pours out of the fracking wells in large volume. Most of the chemical-laced slick water injected down the well will stay belowground, but for every million gallons, 200,000 to 400,000 gallons will be regurgitated back to the surface, bringing with it, McGraw writes, not only the chemicals it included in the first place, but traces of the oil-laced drilling mud, and all the other noxious stuff that was already trapped down there in the rock: iron and chromium, radium and salt-lots of salt. In September 2009, however, pretty much everything died in the course of a few days-everything except an invasive microscopic algae that normally lives in estuaries along the Texas coast. This bloom of “golden algae” that killed everything else was a mystery-how could a species that usually lives in brackish water on the ocean's edge have survived in a freshwater Appalachian creek? The answer emerged swiftly: drilling companies had been illegally dumping wastewater in the region, turning it into brine. This is a matter of concern not only in my urban electorate but throughout the state. There have been 1,000 submissions to the state inquiry. The local Liberal MPs in my region are going through the motions. We are talking about four people in the state government-that is enough people to cause an impact on government policy. Yet for every effort they make to supposedly oppose these kinds of measures, we see Minister Hartcher essentially saying that we've got to promote this industry and make sure it gets up and operates. He is saying that the dollar counts more. Internationally there is a big trend towards this because of concern about the mounting question of energy sources. This is supposedly a cleaner version than coal. But there is evidence around the world that, when all the additions and subtractions are done, the change on the climate front is marginal. I commend residents for firmly opposing this measure. We must be vigilant that AGL will possibly launch another case and we have to be very forthright and strong with the state government in opposing these measures. Australian Politics Robert Menzies, launched the first campaign for the modern Liberal Party he said, 'We need to return to politics as a clash of principle and get away from the notion that it is only a clash of warring personalities.' This idea would resonate just as strongly with the Australian public today. Modern policy makers need to break free from a political discourse defined by an evershortening media cycle punctuated by tweets and blogs and the cult of personality. Above all, these political games have obscured the serious challenges Australia is facing. People want the masquerade to end. They want the real challenges identified so solutions in the form of genuine policy can take shape. Australian society is traditionally a society that encourages its citizens to expand their horizons and to dream big. It is a society that instils in its citizens the ethos that with hard work your goals, your ambitions and your aspirations are always attainable. So embedded are these aspirational values in our culture that a generation of Australians have grown up understanding that home ownership is a reality and employment in their dream job is a probability. Generations of Australians have grown up believing that all of our aspirations are possible. At its best, Australia is a nation full of hope for every young person that they may be rewarded for their efforts, paving the way for a future of endless opportunities. Yes, Australia is a nation that allows any young person with the desire to achieve and the hard work to go with it the opportunity to enjoy a comfortable life. At least that is the narrative that we believe in, that we hold dear and that history reflects. But today's dark art of political spin doctoringthe pursuit of a cheap headline or a sound bite-has not just been an effort to paper over the cracks in Australia's once bountiful economy; it has also fostered the growth of ill-conceived policy on the run. Australia has witnessed a significant increase in spending across welfare entitlements as a percentage of gross domestic product. This has been driven by handouts focused on shortterm election cycles and political parties trying to outbid one another. Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey once described it as the battle between the fiscal reality of paying for what you spend set against the expectation of the majority of public opinion that each generation will receive the same support from the state as their forebears or increased support. In essence, it is a culture of entitlement and it needs to end. While the next generation of Australians will arguably continue to see our nation as a lucky country, we are now a land uniquely placed in the heart of a globalised world between the dominant West and a rising Asia. While this changed landscape will bring its own influences to bear, the next generation will face additional changes such as an ageing population. There will be a greater burden on government drawing from a smaller revenue base. This inevitable demographic dilemma may well coincide with the waning of the mining boom and, as demographer Bernard Salt pointed out, our society and businesses are in a great state of flux. When the baby boomer generation leaves the workforce, they will take with them not only their skills but their taxpaying capacity. While the preceding generation of 2½ million Australians enter retirement, we now see four million Australians on the edge of retirement about to draw on age pensions, pharmaceutical benefits and other assistance from government. While the 1990s experienced a net overseas migration rate of approximately 100,000 per year, today it is 170,000 or 180,000, providing only an extra 80,000 working Australians, not nearly enough to plug the gap rendered by our shifting demographics. Generation Y faces an inescapable burden-that is, paying for a much higher demand on government. Sure, generation Y, described by Bernard Salt as the most educated and globally minded generation, may have several inherent advantages it still has to be able to mobilise if it is to secure its own financial future and participate in a high-wage and highly productive economy. While the previous generation saw a massive increase in productivity as women entered the workforce, gen Y and future generations are facing a world with no guarantees. To achieve similar productivity gains they will need to capitalise on new technology and persistently expand into new markets. They will require constant upskilling and further training and they will need to be a more creative workforce. So an indisputable demographic challenge faces the next generation of Australians. There will be a greater onus on them than on the previous generation to secure their own financial future. As a nation, we must meet this challenge from a position of strength. We must take advantage of the opportunities we have now. This, as I began, is what will ultimately require a mind shift in many policy areas, a moving away from the immediate here and now-the day-to-day politicking-towards a long-term focused direction, one that is capable of meeting the test of enormous structural change to our economy and to our society. Here is the rub: as I previously said in this place, the aspirations and goals of so many Australians are under threat due to this government's self-serving character. This government has chosen to pursue its own agenda and to turn inward and concentrate on its own political survival ahead of listening to Australians-real Australians, those hard working Australians simply trying to make their way. On the brink of a period of decisive intergenerational challenge, this government chooses to listen to and hold its closest reserve for pollsters and spin doctors. Since it assumed power in 2007, home affordability and real household wealth have declined. The average monthly repayments on new home loans have skyrocketed from $1,194 in the John Howard years to $2,074 today. The average proportion of family income devoted to new home loan repayments has leapt from 27.8 per cent under the previous coalition government to 34.4 per cent with Labor. As we approach the combined headwinds of an ageing population, climate change and a post-mining-boom economy, this government's hands are nowhere near the wheel. Debt is wallowing at more than $200 billion. The interest repayments alone are $7 billion a year-that is the interest before the principal. The locals in my community expectsurely not unreasonably-that their government should take pressure off family budgets, that their government will fuel the economy and grow job opportunities and that their government will value their money and live within its means, all the while prioritising the delivery of better services and better infrastructure. But instead Labor still believes that it can both tax and subsidise a nation into prosperity-so obviously a flawed formula lacking the element of incentive in each instance. As I related in my maiden speech in this place, it is the Liberal side of politics that is the side of opportunity. We are the party based on encouragement rather than subsidy and a handup instead of a handout. These philosophical beliefs are at the core of why we will always fight for lower taxes, smaller and more efficient government and the individual's right to choose. A new coalition government will pay down Labor's debt, restore fiscal discipline and return the budget to a sustainable surplus. The coalition will put an end to wasteful spending programs and will cut the cost of red tape for business by $1 billion every year. The carbon tax will be abolished, and a coalition government will rebuild a powerhouse economy through lower taxes, more efficient government and productive business. It will create one million jobs within five years and two million jobs across the next decade. At a watershed time-a time of significant geopolitical and demographic change-it will end the spin and restore hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians. Climate Change indeed, the future of Mother Earth. With each new report of extreme weather events-be it intense heat and bushfires or disastrous floods in Australia, record-breaking storms in the Middle East never previously experienced, elevated temperatures in Russia or exceptionally frigid conditions in Europe-the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition, who notoriously claimed that climate change is 'crap', is further eroded. Of course, not every weather-driven disaster can be directly linked to the effects of global warming, but what is clear and should be understood by someone like the Leader of the Opposition, who has a degree in economics that would have included a study of statistics, is that the likelihood of a connection between the increasing severity of weather extremes and global warming is ever strengthened. I have previously discussed the use of statistics to understand how it is possible to predict the chance of, for instance, a particular volume of rainfall or the maximum temperature in a place for which there are reasonable records. WhatI said was that the occurrence of random events such as rainfall or maximum temperatures is what statisticians describe as normally distributed and, when plotted on a graph, these measurements produce a bell-shaped curve. Perhaps such things would be easier to understand with the help of a blackboard, but what it means in practice is that the most common values fall under the centre of the curve while the least common values, either smaller or larger, fall under the edges. The width of the bell curve is determined by the spread in the measurements. In general, so long as there are at least a few years of data, the chance of a particular weather event can be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy and the possibility of extremes can also be quantified. Despite the relentless campaign of disinformation and denial by the opposition, the evidence for global climate change is now irrefutable, with measurements from around the world showing that extreme weather events that were previously unlikely are becoming more frequent as the bell curve flattens and the extremities start to become the norm. In Australia, as we know, recent temperatures have exceeded all previous records. Whilst the deniers continue to claim that these and other events have no significance, a survey conducted in mid-",327,Grievance Debate
274,Mr Murphy (Reid) (21:37,"TonightI grieve for the future of the environment and,2011 by Griffith University shows that just 4.2 per cent of the 4,347 respondents selected the option 'There is no such thing as climate change' and just 8.5 per cent could be considered strong climate change sceptics. Even then it was obvious that few people believed the claims of the Leader of the Opposition and his fellow deniers, and that was well before the most recent extremes of temperatures. The vested interests in the mining industry and the media that support the opposition's relentless negativity should realise that they are on the losing side in this debate and are living under the delusion that the market for fossil fuels will continue to expand even as many countries, Australia included, introduce measures to introduce reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Of course there are those like Mr Clive Palmer who insist that Australian coal is needed to fuel power stations in countries like India and China, where the growth in demand for electricity is relentless and new thermal power stations are springing up like proverbial mushrooms. Fortunately for the planet, if not for the coalminers and gas producers, technology developed in our country using concentrated solar energy to provide heat to existing power stations makes it possible to replace most, if not all, of the coal and gas burnt in these power stations. Between 2003 and 2006 scientists from the University of Sydney developed a prototype high temperature solar collector at Liddell Power Station in the Hunter Valley to replace some of the coal burned in the boilers. I was privileged to see this development for myself before the developers, discouraged by the Howard government, took their technology to the United States, from where it is now being sold back to Australia in the form of a collector that provides emissions-free heat to the Kogan Creek coal fired power station in Queensland. It is clear that proven solar thermal collectors rather than untested carbon capture and storage equipment can and very likely will be used in countries like India and China as well as Australia to reduce coal and gas consumption and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions from existing and soon to be built thermal power stations. After all, the sun's heat costs nothing and produces no emissions. To those like the opposition and their supporters who say that these changes will never happen and that Australia can simply ride to riches in a mining shuttle, I say that the development of solar technology shows that a brighter future lies in the hands of our scientists and engineers and that we need to recognise that the age of fossil fuels is rapidly drawing to a close as the world takes serious steps to reduce emissions. I wish to make some remarks about the exploitation of public ignorance by political opportunists on matters of policy that have a significant component of scientific understanding. This issue has an unfortunate history and the current campaign being conducted by the Leader of the Opposition has strong similarities to the situation that developed in the former Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time the charlatan TrofimD Lysenko, strongly supported by Joseph Stalin, exercised centralised political control over genetics and agriculture and promoted unfounded theories and practices that led to the death by starvation of millions of people. Although he was a scientific fraud, Lysenko as a politician was no fool. He exploited public ignorance of genetics as he compared his opponents in biology with the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government's collectivisation strategy, saying that by opposing his theories the traditional geneticists were setting themselves against Marxism. In a similar manner, the Leader of the Opposition appeals to individuals who are unwilling to accept the evidence of experts, and condemns his critics as economic saboteurs as he supports the statements of discredited individuals such as IPA adviser Bob Carter and the mining industry's Ian Plimer, who promote claims with no factual basis and deny the link between carbon dioxide emissions and global warming. To quote Wikipedia: Lysenkoism is used metaphorically to describe the manipulation or distortion of the scientific process as a way to reach a predetermined conclusion as dictated by an ideological bias, often related to social or political objectives. In concluding, there could be no better description of the climate change statements of the Leader of the Opposition and, as we know, the opposition continues to deny the reality of climate change as it promotes direct action, a policy that has been widely condemned as unscientific, un workable and a ridiculous waste of taxpayers' money. I am sure that the people of Australia, when they cast their vote on 14 September this year, will vote for the future of our environment, indeed the future of Mother Earth. is interrupted in accordance with standing order 192B.
