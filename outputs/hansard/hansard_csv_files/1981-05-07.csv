Clearly 1976 strongly opposed the introduction of these it is an absolute abrogation of that undertaking fees. It has on this occasion also indicated that it is which was given by the Minister for Education a great mistake on the part of the Government to last year. I want the House and everybody in Ausimpose them. There are already indications that tralia to note what the Minister has done and to take that on board because, when presenting the able to afford fees unless they are amongst the report of the Lynch committee, the Prime Minismost able students who are lucky enough to be in ter ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) solemnly declared that receipt of post-graduate awards of one kind or it was not the Government's intention to reinanother.

It is just as worthless as the one that measure. But inquiries and calculations that I the Minister gave in October last year. What we have made show the Government is likely to reare seeing now is the thin end of the wedge in receive not more than one per cent of the total gard to the wholesale reintroduction of fees at all amount which the Commonwealth spends on terlevels in tertiary education.

Not all post-graduate students will pay, clearly said: that the matter of fees was something but in addition many of those students who will be which had to be taken into account in the annual forced to pay will be discouraged from enrolling budgetary considerations. So it is quite clear that and, therefore, the Government will not receive this is the decision for this year. The decision is not fees from them. So, in return for imposing a to reimpose fees at the undergraduate level next measure damaging to Australia's research effort, year, but it is no guarantee that they will not be highly disruptive to university education as a introduced at some stage in the very near future. whole and highly disruptive to the administration Therefore I think we have to continue to emphaof universities-these fees cannot be collected for sise the damage that the reintroduction of fees nothing, as all that will be raised in the form of could make and would make if we had a reinrevenue is about one per cent of the amount that troduction at the undergraduate level. it currently spends on tertiary education.
