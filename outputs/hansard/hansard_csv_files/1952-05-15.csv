On a numfere in the business relations and private affairs of anybody. If the honourable gentleman will place the question on the notice-paper, the part that can be considered will receive consideration. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform the House whether the responsibility for the retention of price and marketing controls on hides and tallow rests with the Commonwealth or the State governments? As there is now only a relatively small margin between the Australian fixed prices of these commodities and export values, I suggest to the Minister that it would appear that these controls may no longer be required, and I ask him to take or initiate any action that is necessary to terminate them in the interests of maximum primary production. Commonwealth association with these and New Guinea? controls arises from the fact that the States have fixed home-consumption prices which are below export values. If of the Territory of Papua and New the Commonwealth did not co-operate Guinea holds office during the pleasure with the States by regulating exports, of the Governor General. The occupant little if any tallow or hides would remain of that office is not appointed for a in Australia to meet our own needs. term that concludes at a particular date. They would obviously all be exported.

State legislation. The central marketing authority, which is the Australian Hide and Leather Industry Board, was appointed under the Commonwealth act by arrangements with the States. The tallow control is a voluntary arrangement carried out by a tallow pool committee representing various sections of the tallow trade. I am aware that there is not now a great disparity between the domestic and export prices, and in the interests of increased primary production I shall endeavour to arrange a discussion of the matter with the State authoriber of occasions I have made representations to the State Ministers in control of prices to' increase the price of hides. At their meeting last week the State prices authorities increased the price by 50 per cent. That is the first price increase that has been authorized since 1939. for Territories advise the House of the circumstances of the retirement of the Administrator of Papua and New Guinea, Colonel Murray? Was the retirement due to the expiration of a stated term of office, age limit or ill health, or was it due to his disagreement with the policy of the Government?

28,Mr Hasluck,"The AdministratorImmigration whether it is a fact that many hundreds of Australians, most of them ex-servicemen, who visited the United Kingdom shortly after the last war, are now stranded there hecause they have not sufficient money to pay for their passage home. As they are the best immigrants we can obtain,, will the Minister consider the formulation of a scheme under which they can be repatriated to Australia ? to my notice any cases of the kind to which the honorahle member has refered. It is possible that they do exist but I question whether the number is aa great as the honourable member has suggested because I am not aware of any applications for assistance having reached my office. The House will know that under the scheme for the repatriation of distressed Australians abroad Australians who are stranded overseas without funds may apply for assistance from the Commonwealth. If a member of the family of the person concerned who is resident in Australia is prepared to give a suitable guarantee of repayment of any moneys so advanced-w e do not insist on difficult terms for repaymenta sum sufficient to enable the stranded Australian to return is advanced by the Government in genuine cases. The suggestion that Australians who have been overseas for several years should be returned to this country, virtually as immigrant settlers, raises a question of policy which would have to be examined. I shall look into it . for Supply inform the House whether the Government, by signing an agreement with the joint American atomic energy committee for the export of uranium ore to that country, has placed Great Britain at any disadvantage? Was the British Government asked whether it required this ore? Was any attempt made to ascertain whether a refining plant could be established in Australia? if' Was the very best price procured for this ore? Has the Minister seen A"" report to the effect that ProfessorMyers able member is introducing the name of a person outside the House. He must not do so when asking a question without notice. This practice is becoming altogether too silly. I have ruled against it time after time. my question there. ber should place such a question on the notice-paper. wish to reply to the part of the question that is in order? able publicity has been given to the matter that the honourable member has raised. No disadvantage at all was suffered hy Great Britain under the agreement mentioned for the simple reason that the negotiations were conducted by a joint organization. The three gentlemen who came to Australia represented not only the American Government but also the British Government, and consequently what was done was done jointly by the representatives of those governments and of the Australian Government. The honourable member can be firmly assured that a good price was obtained under the agreement and that Australia's interests as well as those of our allies were completely safeguarded. Health seen a recent statement that was attributed to the Queensland Minister for Health in which the latter referred to the new Commonwealth scheme for additional aid to hospitals?

54,Mr Speaker,"The proper prounderstanding that has arisen over the provision of money through the State governments for local government works such as road construction and maintenance aud water supply, will the Acting Prime Minister take steps to establish direct contact between the Commonwealth and local governing authorities so that funds may be made available dii'ectly to thern ? prised that such a question should emanate from the honourable member for Darling whose colleagues of the Opposition only last night made strenuous efforts to uphold the sovereign rights of the States. The Commonwealth has no intention to interfere with the States. that the State Electricity Commission of Victoria is endeavouring to raise a loan of several million pounds at an interest rate of 4& per cent, in order to finance a continuance of its activities and that, during the currency of a similar loan campaign by the commission last year, the Australian Government announced its decision to fix a higher interest rate than was then in force for a forthcoming Commonwealth loan, which sabotaged the State instrumentality's loan, will the Treasurer give an assurance that the Government will not again announce a higher interest rate for the next Commonwealth loan with similar disastrous results? man's question is based on wrong premises, and it appears that the time has come for me to state the facts again. The fixation of interest rates and conditions attaching to loans is a matter, not for the Australian Government, but for the Loan Council at which the States have a preponderance of voting strength. ter for Defence Production explain why Mr Speaker, hear the Australian Broadthe Government small arms factory at casting Commission broadcast, originated Lithgow is manufacturing castings of by the British Broadcasting Corporation, electrolytic zinc and/or its alloys for purof the splendid address given by that poses other than defence, and this is comother great Speaker, the Speaker of the peting with private manufacturers? I remind the Minister that electrolytic zinc and zinc-based alloys are rigidly controlled, and that supplies are reserved for defence purposes and defence contracts. Private manufacturers in Australia are una-ble to obtain sufficient supplies to keep their plant in production. If this allegation is correct, and I understand that it is, will the Minister have the practice stopped? viously I cannot be aware of every activity of the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. The factory is a Government establishment which exists primarily for the specfic purposes of manufacturing small arms. However, as honourable members are aware, the reserve of small arms is quite sufficient. Therefore, to keep the Lithgow plant moving, we must turn to other forms of production. We hope ultimately to get orders from overseas so that the factory may continue the work for which it was designed. In that event, all work associated with private enterprise will terminate. However, I give the honorahle <»entleman an undertaking that I shall have the matter investigated. for the Army indicate whether it is the Government's intention to establish a rehabilitation training scheme for former members of the Korean and Malayan forces similar to, and oroviding the same benefits as, that operating for ex-servicemen of World War II ? that arrangements for such a scheme are already in train. The Minister for Repatriation, whom I represent in this House, has indicated to me that the organization is very nearly complete, and that within a week or ten days he hones to be able to implement the Government's policy in this connection.

63,Mr Allan Fraser,"Did you,House of Commons, in commemoration of tbe 25th anniversary of the opening of the Australian Parliament at Canberra? His words were of a very gracious and generous nature towards this country, but my chief purpose in asking this question is to inquire whether you noted well the paternal kindliness of his tones and the gentle sweetness of his manner, which were such, I think, as would make it a real pleasure to obey his rulings out of sheer affection. Will you try to be a little more like him, sir? cast to which the honourable member has referred and I have sent an acknowledgement to the Speaker of the House of Commons in my own handwriting. I noticed that the honourable gentleman referred to "" that other great Speaker "". That calls to my mind the fact that his reference this morning was in striking contrast with other references that he made to me and my administration not long ago, which made me think that, if the Speaker of the House of Commons were an eagle, I must be a vulture. I simply say .that, from my personal knowledge of the conduct of the House of Commons, the differences between that institution and the House of Representatives at Canberra are very great indeed. The remedy lies, not with the occupant of the chair, but in the conduct of those over whom he presides. MEAT. Commerce and Agriculture state when the negotiations for the agreement that provides for the sale of Australian meat to the United Kingdom at a low price were commenced ? When does the honourable gentleman expect that all details of the agreement will be finalized so that Australian producers and the public may be informed of the terms of the new contract, and what is the reason for the delay? for the sale of meat to the United Kingdom at what the honourable member has described as a low price were commenced on the initiative of the late Mr Chifley as Prime Minister in, I think, August, 1949. Mr PO.LI.AKD -The price was not discussed then. price was discussed in subsequent negotiations before the advent to office of the present Government. That is on record. However that basis was not retained. The long term contract has not been tabled for reasons that I explained to the House last week. I expect that it will be laid on the table next week. Commerce and Agriculture say whether, despite what the Australian Wheat Board has done recently, the Government will continue to pay freight charges upon wheat sent to Tasmania? that the position in respect of the domestic sale of wheat has been made rather chaotic as a result of a decision made by the Australian Wheat Board. The board was legally entitled to make that decision, but I have suggested that it should meet at an early date to consider the position that has developed. I hope that the meeting will be held next week. The Government will consider the position in the light of whatever decision the board makes about the property of which it is a trustee. directed to the Postmaster-General. Isi ' a fact that, during the Empire Day broadcast on the 24th May, the national song of Australia, Advance Australia Fair, will be replaced by another song written by an employee of the Australian Broadcasting Commission? If so, has the Minister consented to this arrangement by the very superior persons who control the Australian Broadcasting Commission ? similar to one asked by the honourable gentleman some months ago, in the course of which he alleged that members of the staff of the Australian Broadcasting Commission were receiving benefits from broadcasts of the new fanfare prior to news broadcasts.

The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) was, as usual, ineffective. His speech may be dismissed with little comment, but it was worth noting that by inflection of his voice, and by halfrending an article from a publication culled Muster, he sought to discredit the summing-up of Mr Justice Sugerman in the Pye Brothers case, in connection with the Ghoolendaadi Estate. Opposition members interjecting, able member for Mitchell will resume his seat, I am becoming rather tired of the difficulty thnt I experience in maintaining order during debate and also durinsr questirne time. The Standing Orders lay down clearly that honourable members shall not converse in this chamber. They are here to listen to and participate in debates. If they wish to converse among themselves they should abide by the Standing Orders and leave the chamber to have their conversations outside. to say that with intent, or perhaps without intent, the honourable member for Lalor endeavoured to discredit the summing-up of Mr Justice Sugerman in the Pye Brothers case, which concerned the resumption by the New South Wales Government of certain property, and that by half-reading an article that appeared in the publication Muster, he had sought to convey that Mr Justice Sngerman's summing up was not a critical one, whereas, in fact, the article in Jlfuster condemns socialism in no uncertain terms and also condemns the high-handed policy of the New South Wales Government in connection with land resumptions. As a matter of fact, the whole article expresses complete condemnation of socialism and its principles. I have only to re-read the extract that was read by the honourable member for Lalor last night to prove that statement. It saidTlie court found in favour of the Government, but in announcing his decision Mr Justice Sugerman made, it would appear from ment, a significant distinction between the administer it, and justice. That is the issue that arises out of this article. Surely words could not be plainer than those that appear in that article. I followed the comments of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) closely. As usual, he shook his head, he feigned indignation, he raised his voice and, obviously his blood pressure, but he failed to raise an argument. In fact, I thought that during the whole of his discourse he was reaching for .air.

I wish that the honourable member had spoken earlier in the day, because he left me overnight with a feeling of tlie utmost depression. Obviously the depressing dogma, of socialism has entered into the honourable member's soul, because lie predicted disaster, without a glimmer of hope, for himself, the Government, the country and ex-servicemen settlers generally. were listening to the debate they would not have had the heart to continue in their industry after having heard the honourable member. Instead of placing their applications in the ballot box they would have rushed off to the nearest undertaker to be measured for a shroud. But is the picture as gloomy as it has been painted by the honourable member? The honourable member for Lawson( Mr Eailes) in a well-reasoned address stated that the Commonwealth was prepared to assist in soldier settlement. It is prepared to give that assistance in four ways. First, it is prepared to write off 50 per cent, of the cost of developing and acquiring a property. Second, it is prepared to pay the settler a living allowance for a period of twelve months. Third, it is prepared to remit half the rent and interest payable on the property during the first twelve months of occupation. Fourth, it is prepared to meet half of any losses that may be involved in advances for the purchase of plant, stock, improvements and working expenses. The conditions of advances under those terms will be fair and reasonable, and hold out some hope to the soldier settler. Due to the lack of argument by Opposition members, I can only assume by listening to their interjections, that they are endeavouring to defend ex-servicemen. It is remarkable how quickly honourable members opposite form new friendships. Only recently they were loud in their criticism of the Government concerning what they claimed to be an injustice, suffered by wool-growers, whom they had formerly condemned as members of the squattocracy. Now, like soldiers marching on to war, Opposition members have grabbed the banner of the ex-servicemen. They have found a new love for the soldier settler, and are prepared to espouse his cause. Not long ago, one Opposition member, who is loud in his interjections, indicated that it was not the ex-serviceman who won the war, but the members of the Boiler-maker's Union. It is difficult to find logic in the statements of honourable members opposite. This bill has given the Opposition an opportunity to practise the true concept of socialism. It has enabled them to advocate giving something If any soldier settlers away which does not belong to them, while exhorting others to make a sacrifice. It would appear that this debate has resolved itself into a discussion of the "" stand and deliver "" tactics of the Government of New South Wales. The subject of soldier settlement should be raised above the level of party politics. Honourable members on both sides of the House should have a natural desire to enable as many ex-servicemen as possible to settle on the land. Yet, there should be an element of justice in the manner in which properties are acquired for that purpose. No man should be required to surrender his land without just compensation. Ex-servicemen do not want property which has been taken by force. It was the very exhibition of force which made them ex-servicemen, and which moved them in World WarI . to resist the force of the Kaiser and in World War II . to resist the force of Hitler. It is not their desire to see land taken from anybody except on just terms. Soldier settlement can be a tremendous advantage to the nation. It is right and just that the States and the Commonwealth should assume the responsibility of placing these men on the land. That responsibility should not be borne alone by those who own property. I cannot understand why Opposition members will not accept that view. Much has been said about the method of State resumption of land. In order to determine the justice of a principle of this kind, we have only to apply it to ourselves. If honourable members owned property, would they be prepared to surrender it for any purpose without adequate compensation? If an honourable member opposite had property",17,Second Reading

Would the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) who is a better farmer than he is a politician, be disposed to say to the Commonwealth, if it wanted to take over his farm for an experimental station in the interests of ex-servicemen, "" Yes, take it at its 1942 value plus 15 per cent."". acquired for war service land settlement was I suggest that the test of assuming himself to be in the place of the dispossessed owner is the only test that every honourable member should apply in this matter. In the minds of free men there is a belief that the owner of land is entitled to retain possession of his property and develop it to the best of his ability accordresumed by agreement with the owner . . . ing to the laws of the country. But I am sorry to say that such a state of affairs does not exist in New South Wales. There was a time in the history of Australia when a Torrens title meant something. The Torrens title gave the holder just and adequate rights to his own land. It entitled him to use the land as he wished. However, the principle that "" an Englishman's home is his castle"", now exists in New South Wales only as a fairy tale. In that State a Torrens title is only a title to be determined at will by the State Government. South Wales there are many officials in various government departments who seem to work on the basis-"" its a fine day to-day, let us go out and resume somebody's property"". to be, that wherever there is a piece of land subject to certain restrictions. He was that the owner has made highly productive, it should be taken from him. If ever there was violent greed displayed in stark reality it is shown in the desire of the land grabbers to acquire more and more land while paying no regard to its eventual use. Unlike the provisions contained in this measure which indicate that land shall be resumed only on just terms, a State government can resume land on any terms that it wishes to apply; or on no terms at all. In New South Wales there Mr Wheeler. is no obligation on the State Government to pay compensation if it should acquire land. If the Government's will is thwarted it can act very ruthlessly. To illustrate my point I shall quote from the official records of the New South Wales Parliament. I hope that this extract will not be challenged, as extracts read by other Government supporters have been challenged by honourable members opposite. I quote from New South Wales Hansard of the 21st November, 1951, in which it is recorded that the Minister for Lands in New South Wales, Mr Renshaw, saidThe compensation or price payable for land originally limited by the Commonwealth State War Service Land Settlement Agreement to au amount not exceeding the value of the land as at 10th February, 1942. The agreenient was declared invalid by the High Court in December, 1940, but prior to that date thia Statu had already amended the law to allow the 1942 basis of compensation or purchase money to be exceeded by up to 15 per centum, if the land is acquired by purchase or Fur some considerable time owners who have been prepared to make land available for war service land settlement have, with the authority of Cabinet, been paid prices considerably over the statutory limit. . . . There are, however, still one or two properties to be acquired where the owners, over a number of years, have delayed this action by various means. I do not consider that they should be allowed to gain any advantage in the matter of price over owners who willingly co-operated in making their hind available fur ex-servicemen.

I am merely saying that the methods of the New South ""Wales Government are very similar to those that were' practised by Shylock many years a g°[Quorum formed.] It is remarkable that when the honourable member for Hindmarsh hears something with which he cannot agree he invariably tries to take some kind of a "" walk-out powder "". We are accustomed to such a reaction from him. I had been making a comparison between the methods of Shylock and those of the New South Wales Government in connection with land resumptions. In effect, that Government says to landowners, "" You will deliver your land. If you object you will be paid 1942 values, but if you go quietly we will give yoii 1942 values plus 15 per cent."" I submit that settlement on the basis of 1942 values is wrong in principle. It is also wrong when it is considered that just compensation should he given to land-owners. It is reasonable that new settlers should be given suitable land, and it is only fair that such land should not be acquired or resumed at inflated values. However, to adopt 1942 values is to use standards which pertained during a year which was probably one of the blackest in the history of real estate in New South Wales. The country was then at war and threatened by a Japanese invasion. If that year is to be adopted as the yardstick, no just reason exists why 1942 levels should not also be used as the basis for the assessment of wages, hours of working, living costs and charges generally. I do not share the concern of honourable members opposite because of the introduction of this bill. I am pleased that eriihodied in it is the condition that sums to be paid for properties acquired shall be subject to the consent of the Minister for the Interior which, in fact, means the consent of this Parliament. I believe that that provision will ensure justice for the owners of the properties to be resumed and also for soldier settlers. Despite the denials of honourable gentlemen opposite, innumerable instances could be given of land which has been resinned by State authorities in circumstances which amount to confiscation. The honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn), in a very forthright speech last evening, gave examples which cannot be challenged. I do not propose to cite further examples, but I draw attention to the fact that a different approach to land acquisition from the methods employed by tbe New South Wales Government is envisaged in this bill. This measure indicates that the Commonwealth is prepared to settle such transactions on just terms, whereas the New South Wales Government is prepared to settle only on its own terms. The danger of the latter course is that, with a radical, socialist government, little distinction exists between such terms and confiscation. Large land-owners are not the only persons to fear that process. It may even affect the holder of a farm of 10 acres. That method of land seizure is being utilized in my own division, in the town of St. Mary's. The town planners, drunk from an orgy of resumption, have begun to resume land which is used for primary production and to make it available for the purpose of setting up some kind of housing scheme. Their action means that farm land is being resumed for a purpose which cannot be fulfilled for several years. In the meantime, primary production in those areas must cease and local government authorities must whistle for their rates. The honourable member has now gone far beyond passing references and is dealing with a. subject which is completely outside the scope of this bill, namely, the operations of the New South Wales Housing Commission. that perhaps the honorahle member should endeavour to keep closer to the bill. rural matters. Perhaps because the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) represents a rural constituency, he is unable to appreciate that fact.

I repeat that small farmers cannot disregard the threat to their properties which has been made by the government of New South Wales. For confirmation of that statement it is only necessary to read the utterances of a former premier of that State, Mr that power. They are finding great, McGirr, who with true Gilbertian touch, polished up the knocker on the front door and betook himself to the calmer waters of the Maritime Services Board. When Premier of New South Wales, he threatened small farmers that if they did not use their properties in a manner approved by the State they would have to choose between State direction and resumption of their land. In accordance with the socialist concept of resumption, confiscation of properties would then be practised in its entirety. I believe that this bill removes that land.

The bill has merit, lieves may be purchased at suitable prices. and I support it. This short bill has a little to commend it and honourable members on this side of the House could have supported it insofar as it places in the hands of the Minister name any such service land settlement more expeditiously and to settle soldiers on the land more quickly. But it is quite obvious from the remarks of honourable members on the Government side that the bill is intended to go beyond that point. Apparently the idea underlying the bill is to enable the Minister to exercise discriminatory power against certain State governments and particularly the Government of New South Wales. Therefore. I support the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) in his contention that this would lead to an abuse of Commonwealth power. The settlement of soldiers on the land is a sovereign right of the States and they are endeavouring to exercise difficulty in exercising some sovereign rights and many States would liko to hand some of those powers back to the Australian Government, but this bill refers to a power which the States would prefer to hold. They want to make a success of war service land settlement and the Australian Government should not interfere in such a way that it will make their difficulties greater and prevent soldiers from being settled on the land quickly.

The Minister for Lands is then quick to seize the opportunity and appropriate the land at that price for soldier settlement. Immediately I am besieged by numerous applicants. Veiy few of those applicants can get a hearing from the authorities as such purchases are few .and far between. The terms for soldier settlement are generous and attractive. No fault can be found with them but sufficient properties are not being made available. The culprits are those who hold large areas of land because they are hungry for profits. They are not prepared to sell unless ""they can get an exorbitant price.. A farm in my electorate that will carry 35 cows costs £8,000 to £9,000. Those prices are being asked in the Ballarat area. Soldiers cannot get land when such prices are asked. The value of the land is inflated. This Government which set out to beat inflation should not be a party to such high prices. I invite honourable members to examine rhe background of some of those who offer land, and to examine also rhe information that is being advanced by honourable members opposite in relation to them. The Postmaster General( Mr Anthony) cited the case of a man who was administering a property for his sister-in-law who was a soldier's widow. The case sounded like a good one which should be treated with sympathy. But later, lionorable members were informed that the property was a large one and the man who was administering the estate was acting, not only for his sister-in-law, hut also for himself. Land-holders Avho hold large tracts of land and ask big prices for it exhibit selfishness. The honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) produced a sworn statement about a man who purchased land for £19 an acre which was eventually acquired by the New South Wales Government for £23 an acre. There was no loss to the land-owners although the honourable member for Farrer went to great pains in his attempt to .prove that great losses were being suffered by the poor landholders. They are all weathy men and they are exhibiting a selfish spirit. I commend any government which sets out to overcome that selfishness and seeks to settle soldiers on the land. I attended a meeting of returned soldiers recently. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr McDonald) was present. The soldiers were very dissatisfied with the deal that they were getting. They were not being settled on the land. Many of those who attended the meeting were applicants for blocks. I told them that as far as I could see unless there was a change of heart on the part of people who own large blocks of land we would get nowhere. in the western district of Victoria which was not settled has been taken over by soldier settlers? More than 2,000,000 acres are available there. long to put men on that land. My opinion is shared by the State President of the Beturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in Victoria, Mr Norman Wilson, who said last Saturday that unless land-holders were prepared to release their land for soldier settlement the Government would have no alternative but to acquire it. Decisive and immediate action must be taken. Government supporters appear to forget that ex-servicemen have earned the right to be settled on the land. Honourable members who served in the forces must have often wondered while they were away from this country whether the men who stayed at home were not making their soft jobs even more attractive while others were fighting for' the preservation of democracy. The Government has a duty to protect the interests and rights of ex-servicemen. The State governments have given a great deal of sound thought to this matter. The New South Wales Government rightly decided that, as the men in the fighting forces were not able to make a move to purchase land for themselves it should reserve suitable areas on which to settle them after their return to Australia. Now, however, honourable members opposite object to these arrangements being carried out. If the arrangements of that kind were right at the time they were made, they are just as right to-day.

We owe our prosperity solely to our ex-servicemen without whose sacrifices this country would be in alien hands. The action of the New South Wales Government in reserving land for war service land settlement purposes has my whole-hearted approval. This Government, which claims to be an anti-inflation government, is taking action which will worsen inflation. If land acquired for war service land settlement purposes is sold at unduly high prices the proceeds of such sales will be put into circulation and thus inflation will be accentuated. What is the way out of this lamentable situation in which hundreds of ex-servicemen are clamouring for land, primary production is declining and the shortage of essentia] commodities is apparent on every hand? Obviously the only way out is to take quick and decisive action to settle as many ex-servicemen on the land as is possible. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to haggle about this matter. Tho Government must not be permitted to use the provisions of this bill to coerce the sovereign States to take action which will result in the slowing down of the war service land settlement scheme. Because this bill will give to the Minister more power to discriminate against the States to the detriment of the scheme, I oppose it. -From the arguments that have been advanced by honourable members of the Opposition it is abundantly clear that their opposition to this bill arises from the fact that they believe that it will alter torate thousands of acres not suitable for the practice that has existed in the past under which land-holders whose properties are acquired for war service land settlement purposes have been paid on the basis of 1942 values, thus making them bear part of the cost of the scheme. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr the best beef cattle in Queensland. .Toshua) asked why land-holders should not contribute at least something to the scheme. If land-holders should be compelled to accept 194'2 values I place the cap back on hishead by asking him how he would feel if, in 1949, before he came here, the bank in which he held a high position had said to him, "" We propose to distribute between those of your clerks who served in the armed ""forces during the war the difference between your present salary and the salary which you earned in 1942''. I am sure that he would not agree with such a proposal, yet he con. tends that a somewhat similar action should be taken in respect of land values. We have heard a good deal about land acquisitions by the New South Wales Government in connection with this scheme. Similar practices have heen adopted by the Queensland Government. Under the provisions of this legislation the Queensland Government has frozen large properties and done everything possible to give effect to its policy of rnining primary production. When this bill has become law the Minister will have discriminatory power to curb its socialistic tendencies. I propose to cite some examples of what has happened in Queensland in connection with this scheme. Although the tot.nl area approved for war service land settlement purposes was only 395,500 acres, the Queensland Government has already allotted 422 blocks covering approximately 715,500 acres. The total area approved for settlement was estimated to provide 570 blocks. Since 1946, notwithstanding the fact that the total allocation for the State was only 395,500 acres in the Wandoon area alone, the Queensland Government has frozen 600,000 acres, thus crippling primary production in that district. Why should it tie. up such vast areas of land? Yet this is only one of several areas that has been tied up in that way. Throughout my eleccloser settlement have been tied up in that way. The land is not suitable for working on a mixed farm basis. The State Government has frozen a large grazing property in the Calliope district, outside Gladstone. It produces some of Apparently, that Government's approach to properties which it decides to acquire is, ""How can we ruin production here?"" It has frozen this property since 1947 on the ground that it will acquire it for soldier land settlement. Any one with any",22,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War
95,Mr Pearce (Capricornia) [11.51].,"knowledge of primary production realizes that it would be absurd to settle soldierfc on blocks of tbe size into which it is proposed to sub-divide this property. The blocks will be so small that no settler will be able to earn a decent living on them. New settlers will have to provide homes, whilst water will not be available on many of the blocks. Consequently, ex-servicemen and their wives to whom the blocks will be allotted will simply have to work themselves to death. One or two droughts will break their hearts and eventually will force them to abandon the holdings which will then become unproductive. This is an instance of the stupidity of the State Government in taking over grazing land for the purpose of soldier settlement. It is clear that on blocks of the size that are to be provided settlers ultimately will he broken in spirit and ruined financially. Such a policy in itself would be bad enough, but the most wicked feature of the Queensland. Government's action is that it has frozen for acquisition the cream of the property as a whole. The present owner of the station will be allowed to retain only the most inferior part of it .which does not include good flats or fattening areas. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) should know from, his experience as a bank manager that grazing cannot be carried on successfully in an area all of which is poor land; at least a portion of it must be good. The Queensland Government, under the power that is vested in it under the War Service Land Settlement Agreements Act, if it is permitted by the Commonwealth to go ahead with this scheme, will ruin this large area which, as I have already said, previously produced thousands of head of prime beef cattle. That Government has frozen large, areas in other parts of the State with the intention of acquiring them for soldier settlement. The present occupants of tlie properties, while awaiting actual acquisition, are not utilizing them to capacity. This policy is typical of the Queensland Government which has shown that it believes that all land should be owned by the State, and so it will not encourage people to acquire properties. It does not wish to see existing properties being worked by private enterprise. Over 80 per cent, of the agricultural land in Queensland is owned by the State. Apparently, it is not much concerned to ensure that settlers under the war service land settlement scheme are allotted holdings which they can work profitably and thus develop assets for themselves and for the community as a whole. I turn now to the prices that are being paid for properties that are being acquired. Surely the honourable member for Ballarat would not expect land-holders to offer their properties on the basis of 1942 values. All of us know that the man on the land was in an extremely precarious position for many years prior to that year because he was not receiving a just price for his products. Having regard to the increase of our population during recent years we must increase the production of foodstuffs. The value of foodstuffs has risen, and land values have risen correspondingly. That is a good thing because such conditions tend to stabilize primary production and enable producers to count upon earning a fair income. However, tlie Opposition agrees with the Ned Kelly tactics of the Queensland and New South Wales governments, which, regardless of present values, are acquiring holdings at 1942 values. No honourable member opposite has answered the challenge of the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) to justify the present system under which landholders are obliged to forfeit the difference between 1942 values and present day values. Surely the additional cost that would be involved if properties that are required for soldier settlement were purchased at present values should properly be borne, through taxation, by the community as a whole. But the policy of the Queensland Government in this respect is morally untenable. Let us look at this problem squarely and face up to our responsibilities in respect of it. Land-holders whose properties have been, or will be, acquired at 1942 values have, since that year, produced food stuffs in the interests of the community. If they had failed to do so, we should not be here to-day. The man on the land is the backbone of the country. Members of the Opposition should realize that although they do not get votes from primary producers they get their food from them. The sooner the Labour party shows some sympathy for the man on the land, the better it will be for Australia. be able to make a reasonable living from Many land-holders, for various reasons, are prepared to make their properties available for soldier settlement provided that they will be paid reasonable prices in relation to present market values. Would it not be better for the Queensland and New South Wales governments to acquire such properties which are fully equipped and have a proved productive capacity and on which ex-servicemen could make a decent living from tbe start? In this respect, I refer to a property that is situated two miles from Rockharnpton. Iiecently, the Australian Government purchased for £50,000, on behalf of the Australian Meat Board for use in its experiments relating to the establishment of zebu cattle, a property of 6,948 acres whicb is situated in the Belmont area fifteen miles from Rockharnpton. The holding to which I am referring is only two miles from that city and, inclusive of improvements which consist of a very fine residence and out-buildings, including dairy, stables, and feed room, it is being offered on the market to-day for £10,000. The property has a splendid supply of water and every acre of it is available for use. It has been in production for 50 years and during the next 50 years, because of its fertility and proximity to Rockharnpton, its value will, undoubtedly double. What is wrong with purchasing such a property under the War Service Land Settlement Act, and permitting ex-servicemen to settle on it? Tbere are dozens of such properties in Central Queensland which may be purchased at reasonable prices. But the Government of that State, in its vindictive desire to hurl every possible obstacle in the way of primary producers, says, in effect, "" We are not interested in equitable prices or even the quality of the land on which ex-servicemen are to be settled. We shall examine the areas with a view to seeing whom we can smash"". think that such a statement is unfair, but the results in Queensland bear out the truth of it. The State Government has resumed the pick of the areas within Mr Pearce. large stations, and, by so doing, has ruined those stations. The choice areas have been sub-divided into such small allotments that ex-servicemen will never them. The only reason that I can give for such a policy is that the Queensland Government is anti-primary producer, and believes in a policy of "" produce and deliver at the pistol point"". It is determined to use every means in its power to thwart the man on the land and, in order to do so, has used the instrument of acquisition in the way that I have described. I hope that this bill will mean an end to that policy. Do Opposition members want ex-servicemen to settle on land that will break their hearts and ruin them financially? Under the war service land settlement scheme as it operates in Queensland at the present time, ex-servicemen are suffering bitter disappointment and are incurring financial losses. I hope that the effect of this bill will be to terminate that unsatisfactory condition of affairs. Holdings of good land, which have produced excellent beef cattle, are being ruined by the vindictiveness of the Queensland Government. I am whole-heartedly in favour of the bill; my only regret is that it was not introduced earlier so that some of the mistakes which have been made could have been corrected, and the vindictiveness of the Queensland Government avoided. Under wise guidance we may be able to thwart the policy of certain Stategovernments which are determined to use every means in their power to socialize Australia, nationalize the land and produce a condition of society in which a few persons will be commissars and the great majority will be serfs. must have been heavy flood waters in the Eitzroy River, if the muddy thinking of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) is any indication.

Their stories do not bear investigation. I believe that their complaints have been made for the purpose of political propaganda and have no relation to the subject-matter of the bill. On the lst November, 1951, ' I made a comment about the price of land. directed attention to the fact that anomalies would arise, and stated that the prices paid for land should be higher. I repeat that statement now, because I understand that the Postmaster-General, in his summation of his case, tried in a skilful way to indicate that I approved of extravagant prices for land. I desire to correct that impression, because I emphatically do not approve of extravagant prices for land. ""WhatI said a few months ago was that the basis of the 1942 values seemed a little low in 1951. Since then, a general practice has been followed of increasing the 1942 values by 15 per cent. The honourable member for Lalor, who has had experience of these matters, and the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes), knows that in many instances the 1942 values are not inflexible. The parties, in negotiating for the sale of land, deal on the basis of a f a i r price. It is to the eternal credit of all State Governments, regardless of the political parties in office, that they are determined that inflated prices will not be imposed on the whole community. prices are not necessary; someone simply wants a rake-off. the land-holder who has to give up his property, when gangways on to the transports Mr Haylen. the last war, we said that nothing would be too good for them on their return to civil life. Perhaps the grazier made a reservation at that time, and said "" nothing is too good for the ex-servicemen but my land"". The Labour party resists that attitude. The basis of the land settlement scheme has been carefully considered. An y one who has knowledge of events after World WarI . will recall the f r i g h t f u l suffering of exThat argument is completely servicemen under the soldier settlement Yet Government supporters scheme. Hundreds of them walked off extravagant their properties. Occasionally a hero such as the honourable member for through. Onlyi n comparatively recent years has the honourable member been able to get his head above water. Many of hia colleagues were completely ruined by the hardships that they endured in their efforts to make a 'living out of properties that had been sold to them at I grossly inflated prices. Around Sydney, the scandal of this land jobbery was so great that the nationalist government then in power in New South Wales was rejected by the electors. Attempts to settle ex-servicemen on the land after World War II . have been guided by common-sense considerations. There has been no nonsensical talk about the vast fertile hinterland, a land of possibilities which soldier settlers of World WarI . found to their cost to be a desert of glorious sunsets but few primary products. Unfortunately good agricultural and pastoral land is limited,, and that was the beginning of the irritations that have been evident in the war service land settlement scheme. I believe that the Government of New South Wales has made an honest attempt to settle ex-servicemen on economic holdings of productive land, but the work is necessarily slow, and that slowness is another source of irritation to prospective settlers. Apparently honourable members opposite would have been quite satisfied had ex-servicemen again been pushed out to the Extravagant western districts of New South Wales, where, after World WarI . , herds I have sympathy for perished and crops failed and soldier settlers were forced to rejoin the crowded but let us not forget that millions in the cities. Between Sydney ex-servicemen walked up the and Penrith, land which could he during described only as monkey country was",26,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War
101,Wannon ( Mr Mcleod) Fought His Way,"cut up into orchards. Poultry farms were established on gravel pits where the flocks died because of the lack of green pickings. Those schemes were amongst the worse pieces of land jobbery that have ever been perpetrated in this country. Our war service land settlement scheme to-day is good, but it is necessarily slow and that is not altogether a disadvantage. By proceeding cautiously, we can give ex-servicemen a chance to become good rural producers. They are being given land on fair terms and, as the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has said, payments are so balanced that they can enjoy good living standards. It is a matter of "" slow and steady wins the race"". A slow hut sure scheme is preferable to the spectacular and colourful tipping of ex-servicemen from the suburbs of Sydney on to worthless land. However, from, the fact that land selected for the settlement of ex-servicemen is the pick of our agricultural and pastoral land, another frustration has arisen. Many property-owners are unwilling to relinquish any portion of their holdings. There may be economic justice in the resumption for soldier settlement of the properties of land-takers long since gone, but some proposed resumptions have been strongly contested. No blame for delay in land resumption and settlement can be placed upon the governments concerned. Most delays have been due to litigation over resumption resulting from the reluctance of property-owners to part with good land, even to ex-servicemen. The third irritation or frustration has arisen from the dispute between the States and the Commonwealth. The belief that the rights of the squatter are paramount to the needs of the settler has been canvassed far too freely. I remind the House that we are concerned not only with the need for closer settlement, but with the fulfilment of our obligations to our fighting men whom we have sworn to reward. Many of them must be disgusted with the Commonwealth's attitude in this matter. The Opposition supports the bill because it represents the greatest good for the greatest number, and perhaps we would not even have protested against it had not certain statements by the two Ministers who have spoken in this debate put into our minds, and particularly in the mind of the honourable member for Lalor, who was a Minister in the Chifley Government, the idea that in this loosely worded, sketchily outlined, and badly drafted bill there is more than meets the eye. It is the duty of the Opposition to expose the real intention of the measure, not only in the interests of good legislation, but also in the interest, of ex-servicemen. Law authorities. thing in that. Even Homer occasionally nodded ;but my general statement stands. Hidden in this measure may be an attempt by the Commonwealth to interfere with State administration. Th«i States have made an honest attempt to exercise fairly their powers of resumption since the constitutional limits of the Commonwealth have become apparent, but the propaganda of the Minister for the Interior and the Postmaster-Genera, has caused alarm in the minds of th« Opposition. Interference in the settlement scheme could take two forms. The Minister for the Interior himself could delay proceedings; or property owners could impede resumptions by wrangling over terms. Those are the things that the Opposition wants to stop. The Minister for the Interior has said that them are thousands of acres of land awaiting settlement in the western districts of Victoria. quite well that such land cannot be mads ready for soldier settlement as quickly as can lands now in production. The development of unoccupied areas is a long-range plan. We are concerned with the shortrange plan of settling ex-servicemen on fertile areas that have already been developed. I have no doubt that honourable members opposite appreciate the need to press on with the war service land settlement scheme, but unfortunately the Postmaster-General assumed the role of propagandist for the landholder who already has had a fair crack of the whip and will in any event get a fair price for his property.

105,Mr Haylen,"The Minister knows,valuations plus 15 per cent, and any other concessions that are going is not a good price to-day, it will be very good ten years from now. How is it possible to establish a true value when some lands were resumed before the extraordinary land boom that accompanied high wool prices, some were resumed during the boom, and others are being resumed during the present period of falling prices? The Postmaster-General has argued that present-day values should rule, but in these days of severe credit restrictions how many people can find enough money to buy huge properties ? Very few people indeed are so fortunate. The true price of a property, a3 the auctioneer calls it, is the real price that some one is willing to pay for it. It is fantastic to argue that extraordinarily inflated prices should of Country party propaganda. Members apply when. considerably lower prices would prevail if the normal law of supply and demand were allowed to take effect. When a land-holder offers a property of 30,000 acres for sale at a price £10,000 above the value determined hy the State authorities, the correct price The Labour party subdivided its majority should be ascertained by calling for offers neatly and efficiently on just terms. The from potential buyers. This Government has imposed rigid clamps upon inflation, but it is allowing land prices to career away out of control. Its views on fair valuations for the resumption of properties are based upon ;i figment of its imagination. They are rhe natural product of a history of conservatism. Any man who has owned a fertile property that has provided good returns for, say, 50 years, has been well treated by the land and by Australia. ff.e should be in a sound financial position and it should not be much of a sacrifice for him to sell his property at its 1942 valuation plus 15 per cent. The Postmaster-General gave the impression that he was completely rabid on this issue. His arguments were illogical, and many of the alleged faots that he submitted were only half truths and assumptions. He declared that many property-owners were afraid of being done down. That is not true. Many sensible, patriotic primary producers have taken a broad view of the situation and have decided that the terms laid down for the acquisition of land are not unreasonable. The Postmaster General conveniently ignored the obvious Mr IJ aylen. answer to his arguments until he was reminded of it by the honourable member for Lalor. If Ministers and their supporters sincerely want to establish fair values for land, they have only to honour the promises that they made in order to gain the support of the electors. If they restored value to the £1, pounds would become scarcer and land would become cheaper. The problem would then vanish and the Government would no longer be obliged, for political purposes, to attribute the difficulties that we have been discussing to the so-called socialistic activities of the Government of New South Wales. The Postmaster-General merely shed crocodile tears on the thirsty pastures of the Country party often boast that the Labour party lacks support in rural districts. But what happened in the electorate of Lyne? The Country party entered the recent by-election campaign there like a lion but it left like a Iamb. Labour party has a rural policy and it tries to infuse the elements of decency into that policy. It offers the primary producer a fair deal within the limits of the Constitution. The Minister for the Interior, a dynamic and attractive speaker, tried to confuse the issue when he declared that the sole purpose of the bill was to ensure an expeditious and satisfactory settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. But that tale will not hold water. Five thousand ex-service applicants have already been processed and are ready to take up blocks. Behind them are 5,000 more ex-servicemen who want to settle on the land. The Australian Country party divides the nation into two parts, one consisting of those who live on the land, and the other consisting of those who dwell in the cities and use the products of the land. It scorns the city residents, although they provide the best market for primary products that the farmer can hope to find. Honorahle members on the Government side of the House should visit my electorate and discuss the subject of land settlement with ex-servicemen and others who live there. Many of those men are descendants of dispossessed farmers who were forced off their properties by droughts and other misfortunes. They are eager to establish themselves on the land and I am sure that they would persuade Government supporters to change many of their opinions. The State governments are not robber barons. They are doing their best in a statesmanlike way to remove the obstacles that are obstructing the war service land sei tlement scheme. The honourable member for Capricornia i, Mr Pearce) made a deplorable speech, iu which he said that the State governments were on the prowl, seeking to destroy every large estate and put the land to wrong use. He confused the issue by suggesting that the big estates should remain untouched. If lhat policy were put into effect, we should have to forget all about our immigration programme. The term "" closer settlement"" should not be treated merely as an ikon on the wall. It stands for a definite policy of good preliminary planning, careful that must be implemented in the interests of Australia. ""We must promote closer settlement if we are to carry on with our immigration plans and develop the nation. Employment in our cities is rapidly approaching saturation point and we must establish more, and more immigrants in rural areas. Many small farmers must be in need of temporary labour, but the absorption capacity of our rural industries is usually over-stated. Statistics prove that the ability of those industries to absorb labour is not great. The honourable member for Capricornia even accused the former Labour Government of having placed ex-servicemen upon arid land that they will never be able to farm successfully. The truth is that the land settlement scheme was carefully drafted so as to avoid such a tragedy. The argument that has boiled up during this debate has arisen solely from the proposal to' acquire the best land for the settlement of ex-servicemen. Had the scheme provided for the acquisition of useless country, there would have been nothing but peace during the discussion. The whole issue resolves itself into a struggle between the "" haves"" and the ""have nots"". The Postmaster-General misrepresented Members of the Opposition have tried to me when he referred to a statement that distract attention from the main issue. I had made in a previous speech to the The honourable member for Wannon( Mr effect that the prices determined by State governments for rural properties were low in relation to current values. I wish to correct any false impression that may have arisen by emphasizing my opinion that the addition of 15 per cent, to 1942 values, subject to the exercise of good judgment and common sense by the official negotiators, establishes fair prices. The case made out by the Postmaster-General was entirely invalid. He appeared to forget that he had a duty to defend the interests of ex-servicemen, and he spoke as though the State governments, and the Government of New South ""Wales in particular, were tyrannical land-grabbers when, in fact, nothing could have been further from the truth. If the honourable gentleman would take the trouble to travel around his own electorate he would learn that the. war service land settlement scheme has been outstandingly successful up to date. Its success has been the result administration and a succession of propitious seasons. The only serious problem that hampers the development of the scheme is that of establishing a fair system of land acquisition. The Labour party firmly holds the view that, if the Government inflates prices, it will defeat the object of the plan by destroying its economic basis. The Government's propaganda on behalf of landlordism to the neglect of ex-servicemen, to whom it made so many glowing promises, is as contemptible as it is ridiculous. The bill is a brief measure which deals with the conditions under which money appropriated for the purposes of the war service land settlement scheme shall be payable to the States. It provides that payments shall be made in such amounts and subject to such conditions as the Minister shall determine. The Opposition apparently fears that the Minister will exercise the proposed power in order to ensure that land shall be acquired on just terms. The Government and its supporters strongly contend that vendors should receive prices based upon the true value of their land at the time of acquisition. I heartily support that contention.",28,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War
106,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) [12.32],"McLeod) said. that the Government was concerned more with the land-holder than with the ex-serviceman. The fact is that the Government in interested in both the land-holder and the ex-serviceman. Its object is to ensure fair play. It is interested in securing that a government shall pay a fair price for any property that it acquires. That form of fair play is the very basis of British justice, which fix the price paid by settlers on the basis our servicemen fought to preserve. They fought to keep Australia free from domination by nations which, in their own territories and in territories that they have overrun, act in a manner similar to that in which the Opposition suggests the Commonwealth and the States should act. The governments of those nations acquire land, but they do not pay compensation to the owners of the land. The Opposition does not suggest that we should go as far as that, but it does suggest it is fair and reasonable that, in 1952, a State government that acquires land for the purpose of war service land settlement should pay to the owners of that land a price based upon land values that prevailed in 1942. The administration of the war service land settlement scheme has given rise to many anomalies. A property could be acquired by . a state government, which paid to the owner a price based upon the .1942 value of £8 an acre. An adjoining property of similar quality not required for war service land settlement, could be sold at the same time for £22 an acre. that. I am concerned, not with inflation in this case, but with justice. The property that was not acquired by the State is as good as the property that was acquired, but, although the owner waa paid only £8 an acre for the property taken from him, the remainder would have brought at least £22 an acre nt auction. Does the Opposition consider that that man was treated fairly? I do not see how such a method of acquiring land could be upheld by any true Australian. This Government proposes that a just price shall be paid for activities of the market riggers. any land acquired for the purpose of war service land settlement. If land is acquired at a price that is considered to be uneconomical from the point of view of the settler, that figure can be written down. It may be that land values will fall. Therefore, the Victorian Government is not doing any writing down at the present time. It requires a longer period in which to survey the position. It does not want to of the present value of the commodities that they produce on their properties, because it may be that, as a result of a decrease of the prices of primary products, in some years' time the value of the properties, calculated on that basis, will have decreased. In ten years, the land values that prevailed in 1942 may prevail again. Land values may fall. But who can say now whether they will fall and, if so, to what degree? Are we to accept the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua), or any honourable member on either side of the House who have expressed their opinion in this regard, as an authority upon what the value of land will be in ten years' time? Land values rise and fall,, but it seems that nobody can foretell what they will be at any given time. In 1946 or 1947, the honourable member for Wannon ber for Lalor( Mr Pollard) said repeatedly that the price of wheat, which was then about 6s. a bushel, would fall during the next year or the year after. The Chifley Government, acting on that assumption, negotiated the New Zealand wheat agreement, under which wheat was sold to New Zealand at a low figure. The members of the Labour party, probably quite honestly, took the view nt that time that the price of wheat would fall. Now they believe that land values will fall. They may be right. Under certain circumstances, they could have been right in 1946 or 1947, but they were wrong and the price of wheat rose, and continued to rise until it is now over £1 a bushel on the world market, did not take into consideration the fact",30,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War

It is quite wrong to assume that the land value that prevailed in 1942 will prevail again ten years from now. If a government acquires land, it should pay what the land is worth at tbe time of the acquisition. All kinds of people may be interested in the sale, including widows or orphans. I know of a large property that was sold for £135,000, but there were so many beneficiaries that each of them received only £3,000. Surely the Opposition does not believe that, when a large property is sold for, say, £100,000, all the proceeds of the sale go necessarily to one man. Furthermore, many large properties are the subject of mortgages, which must be discharged from the proceeds of the sale. The Opposition, which views these matters from the socialist viewpoint, regards every land-holder as a bloated capitalist, but the reverse is often the case. come to accept that honourable gentleman It has been said that the man on the land, irrespective of what he is producing, is receiving too much for his products. In many instances, he is receiving only his costs of production. The members of the Labour party should be the last to criticize the prices that are paid to primary producers, who supply food to the metropolitan ai""eas, many of which are represented by Labour members, at prices lower than they would receive if they sold their products overseas. I do not believe that an ex-serviceman settler, unless his political views were similar to those held by the Opposition, would agree to land being acquired at 1942 values. I think that he would regard that as unjust. The provision for writing down will ensure that no settler will be required to pay an uneconomical price for a property. As I have.said, the Victorian Government is postponing for as long as possible the fixation of the prices that shall be charged to settlers, because it is afraid that a figure fixed upon the basis of the present prices of primary products would, in a few years time, be too high. The basic principle upon which government should act is that a man who sells a property should receive for it a sum based upon the land values that prevail at the time of the sale, and that the price charged to the settler should be such as will enable him to make a profit from his land and live well over a period of years. Any finance required should come from all the people. I support the bill, which is designed to uphold a principle for which we have fought. Sitting suspended from 12.U& to 2.15 p.m. This bill provides for the continued implementation of the scheme, which was introduced during a Labour government's term of office, under which the Commonwealth agreed to provide certain moneys to the States. The Opposition, of course, supports the proposition that the Commonwealth should raise money and advance it to the States for the purposes of war service land settlement. I listened to-day to the usual flow of talk and generalities from the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull). I have now with a great deal of tolerance unmixed with concern. The honourable gentleman naturally peddles the same stories that we heard from honourable members opposite for so long, and the same bogies that have been dissipated by the Government's actions. Not only does the Opposition uo longer regard his shaky criticisms seriously, but it considers that they now fall in vain on the ears of the public, because he has uttered them time after time during his long period as a member of the Parliament. PTe has said over and over again the same things about socialist objectives and the desire of socialists to take land from the people. I presume that when he is in appropriate company, he accuses socialists of dragging babies out of the cradle and all the rest of those fearsome tales that have fallen from the lips of tories through the ages. The fact is, of course, that the record of Labour administration in this country renders futile the generalities and inanities of honourable gentlemen like the honourable member for Mallee. As I have said, it was a Labour government that introduced the scheme for war service land settlement. Tbat scheme is a vast improvement on the scheme that was in operation after World WarI .

112,Mr Tom Burke (Perth) [2.15],"a condemnation of governments, parliaments^ administrators and the people generally if we had not learned a great deal from the failure of the war service land settlement policy after World War. I . History shows that those problems have always arisen in post-war periods. As far back as we can find recorded history of war, soldiers who have returned from battle have wanted to be settled on land that they could farm profitably for themselves and for the benefit of the community. The same position obtained after the end of World War II . , and the scheme that was introduced by a Labour government offered every opportunity to men who returned from war service to satisfy their ambitions to become farmers. This bill became necessary because some major features of the war service land settlement scheme were found, on legal challenge, to be. invalid. The Opposition sanctions, a continuance of its own scheme, but it views with some apprehension the remarks that the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) made in support of the bill. I am confident (hat, had the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes), who is in charge of the bill, been allowed to pilot it through the House in the way he set out to do, the bill would long since have received the general approbation of all honourable members. General, endeavouring, it seemed, to vent spleen on his political opponents in New South Wales, embarked on a tirade against the New South Wales Government. He made it plain that he considered that this Government's power should be used to coerce the governments of fhe sovereign States. That would be not only a grave departure from the policy formerly Government, but also, in the present situation, would be a policy fraught with grave dangers. ment's supporters have claimed for many years that they believed in having a federal system of government in operation in Australia and would seek to make that system, as it was conceived and born at the beginning of the century, fully General's approach to this bill, however, indicates that if he has his way in shapJfr. Tom Burke. ing the Government's policy the federal system in Australia will receive a deathblow. The uniform taxation system has given great power to the Commonwealth Parliament, but if the Government takes the coercive action that the Postmaster General seems to wish it to take, it will deal a far greater blow to the State, governments than did the uniform taxation scheme. At present the Government hands out money to the States for all sorts of purposes. It makes those moneys available subject to certain conditions that it imposes. According, to the Postmaster-General, whose statements have not been refuted by any succeeding speaker on the Government side-in fact they have been confirmed by some succeeding speakers'-the Government can, and must, tell the State governments that those of them, which bend to the federal desire will receive all the financial assistance they require, and those that will not yield to dictation by the federal Minister-no t necessarily by the Eederal Government or this Parliament-wil l receive 310 financial assistance. State governments, are sovereign in their respective spheres, one of which is war service land settlement. Within the framework of the relatively loose, existing agreement the States have the right to impose such conditions as they please, and must accept full But the Postmasterresponsibility for their actions. They are not responsible to this Parliament for those actions, but ave responsible, on appeal, to the electors of New South Wales who are adult men and women entitled to exercise their democratic right to vote for the political candidates of their choice. But. unless the Minister for the Interior advocated by the disavows the TOWS expressed by his colleague, the Postmaster-General, it seems that die Government intends to say to The Governthe States, "" You are responsible, not to us as a Government, but to a federal Mmister "". Of course, if such a condition can he imposed in relation to war service land settlement, it is only the beginning of the exercise of such federal power in the appropriation of money for the States. operative. The PostmasterI n Western Australia at the moment we have a situation that has arisen in connection with the immigration scheme. The Liberal Government of Western Australia imported prefabricated bouses from Austria, and brought out Austrian building workers under contract to erect the houses. When the workers arrived, bowever, their contracts were abrogated for a niuiiber of reasons. When the case came to trial the plea was changed, and the Western Australian Government stated that the abrogation was not because of inefficiency of the workers, or failure by them to meet the terms of the contract, but because, as Austrians, the workers were enemy aliens. Has this Government said"" to the Liberal Government of Western Australia, "" Unless you deal fairly with men with whom you have made a contract, you will receive no more . moneys for immigration purposes "" ? If the Government followed the pattern of the policy that the Postmaster-General appears to espouse, it might well do that. That kind of thing could be carried through the whole range of State government activities and be used on almost every issue that arises. The Federal Government could say to the States, "" Y o u must accept the conditions that we impose, and carry out, in every detail, the instructions that we give in connection with every grant, or you will receive no moneys "". I suppose one of the issues which could most easily defeat a government in New South Wales, which is a great industrial and agricultural State, would be a failure to carry out to the fullest possible degree a war service occupation which is not their first choice land settlement programme. A Labour government could be so defeated in New South Wales because of a refusal of funds hy the federal authorities. So also, X. remind the Postmaster-General and the Government, could a non-Labour State government be defeated. The Government of Western Australia, for instance, could be refused funds for land settlement at the will of this Government, because the Minister involved decided that theconditions that the State imposed in relation to war service land settlement did not suit him. That would make interference with the State programmes possible. It would make defeat at election time possible and it would make possible collusion between a Liberal Government in Canberra and a Liberal Opposition in New fl3] South Wales. In short the Government's proposals would make possible a greater blow at the sovereignty of State governments than any that has been delivered in the history of federation. The land settlement scheme was well conceived, planned and begun by a Labour government. It has been administered reasonably well since that time but in some respects it has been lagging and might well be. improved. Throughout Australia, and in Western Australia in particular, large areas of land could be settled under a land settlement scheme. Much of the unalienated land has a small carrying capacity. Settlement of this land would require some investigation and caution but there is a vast area throughout Australia on which people could be settled as they wish to settle under the generous conditions of the war service land settlement .scheme. A shortage of supplies such as heavy capital equipment and wire and a shortage of man-power are hampering the full operation of tbe scheme in Western Australia and, I presume, in other States. The Commonwealth and the States, in consultation, have endeavoured to overcome these shortages but should make greater efforts to settle ex-servicemen on the land as early as possible. Men who desire to have farms do not want to wait for them for years. If that becomes the situation they will lose interest and heart until finally they take up some other and they will probably continue in that occupation for the remainder of their lives. Primary industry is enjoying a period of unparalleled prosperity even though the peak of prices has been passed. It is possible that prices will eventually fall much lower. Consequently it behoves the Australian and State governments to strain themselves to their utmost to place these men on the land in order that they may enjoy at least some period of high prices and so build up reserves for the bad times that almost inevitably will come. The existing legislation limits the period of time during which ex-servicemen may lodge applications for land. That limit was imposed when the act was first introduced by a Labour government because tbe governments whicb administered the scheme had to know with reasonable certainty the number of men who would make applications under it. That limit might well be removed. Not only ex-servicemen but also other members of the community should be encouraged to settle on the land under this or a similar scheme. That being so there is no reason for the maintenance of a time limit. I know of two men who were unable to apply for farms before the time limit had expired because ill health had prevented their operating a farm with a reasonable certainty of success. By the time their health had improved sufficiently the deadline had been passed. After serving their country and, in one case, after recovering from a long and serious illness, they found themselves debarred from participating in this scheme. The Government, in concert with the State governments, immediately remove this time limit. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the Government would be very unwise to adopt the attitude to the State governments that has been advocated by the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony). The Government might well submit its arguments concerning just terms of acquisition to the State governments. I do not think that the Australian Government is competent to say exactly what is a fair value. Values vary from year to year with changes in the prices of primary products. The Government is not in a position to define the conditions of acquisition for the New South Wales Government. New South Wales and the governments of other States, not the Australian Government, that must finally accept the responsibility for the acquisition of land for soldier settlement. A by-election was held in the electorate of Lyne a short time ago. It is apparent from the remarks of the Postmaster-General ,and other honourable members opposite that this subject was widely and, I presume, angrily canvassed during that by-election. If that was so the electors of Lyne do not seem to have been deeply moved by the Government's arguments. New South Wales Government has acted within its rights, whether its actions have Mr Tom Burke. been just or unjust, and the Australian Government is not in a position, morally or politically, to impose its will on the Government of New South Wales. This scheme, which was introduced by a Labour government, has done a great deal of good. It has heen administered intelligently and if proceeded with energetically it will do much more good for ex-servicemen and also for agricultural production. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) has to a large extent reiterated the remarks of the honorahle member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). These honourable gentlemen have stated that the Australian Government is attempting to exercise a dictatorship over the States. They have said that the States have sovereign governments and that the Australian Government has no right to attempt to dictate to them. The Commonif necessary, should wealth is also a sovereign body and is bound to act within its powers under the Constitution which confers upon it the power to acquire property only on just terms. The States, unfortunately for their citizens, are not bound to acquire property on just terms. The States may acquire property on the most unjust terms and, what is more, they have been doing so. Many honourable members will use their own epithets in respect to that practice. Indeed, such epithets have already been used in the course of this debate. It is a practice which cannot be too strongly condemned. The Commonwealth is bound to acquire property on just terms and is prepared to deal with It is the Government of the States on that basis. Who, then, is the dictator? Isi t the Australian Government which is seeking to deal with the States within the limits of its powers or is it the States which say, "" We shall deal with you only on unjust terms""? All the Opposition's talk of the breaking down of the federal system is sheer poppycock. The Australian Government has been providing the States with money for which they had no legal right to ask. This ball will provide that more money shall be paid to the States, which the States have no The legal right to require from the Government, but which the Government is prepared to grant to them on just terms.",32,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War
113,Mr Joske (Balaclava) [2.33],"I shall now deal with a phrase that was used to-day by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua). He mentioned a "" selfish spirit"", and apparently he associates persons who happen to own land with this selfish spirit. He should remember that land-owners are seeking only a reasonable market price for their land. They ask for nothing more and nothing less. In the words of the Australian Constitution they ask that their land should be acquired by the State governments "" on just terms "". Let us examine this charge of selfishness. Suppose the honourable member for Ballarat had had his pocket picked, and, using his well-known sprinting ability he had chased and caught the pickpocket. Suppose the pickpocket had said to him, "" ""What is your trouble, you have a very selfish spirit. Why should I not have your money."" The honourable member for Ballarat would not regard the transaction in that light at all. He would hail the thief before a magistrate. In court the advocate for the pickpocket would, perhaps, put forward the argument that the prosecutor had a very selfish spirit, and ask that the case be dismissed. The honourable member for Ballarat would be astounded if the magistrate accepted that argument and dismissed the case. What would the honourable member think of a country that tried to maintain its civilization under the principle of ownership illustrated by that case? The argument of honourable members opposite, if translated to practice, would lead to anarchy. Any government that accepted the principles of socialism would plunge the country into anarchy because no citizen would know his position from day to day. He would not know whether, with the connivance of the government, his pocket would be picked or his land taken from bim. I suggest that the words in our Constitution, "" on just terms"", are golden words. They refer to the fundamental principles of justice. Justice is the birth right of every English-speaking person. Emblazoned across the pages of English history is the fundamental principle that justice shall be denied to no man. Yet the whole argument that we have been faced with in the course of this debate is that unjust terms for the acquisition of property are necessary, and that the Commonwealth must take part in a scheme with the States to do injustice to the owners of property. During the course of this debate it has been emphasized and re-emphasized by honourable members on this side of the House that this Government intends to preserve justice in our community and at the same time to give full justice to ex-servicemen. In that regard I refer to the speeches of the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) and the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn), both of whom have pointed out that this Government is anxious to do, and most certainly will do, the right thing for ex-servicemen. What is more, the record of the Government shows that it has always had the interests of ex-servicemen in the forefront of its deliberations. The Opposition argues that land should be resumed at an unjust price so that ex-servicemen can get it on terms which they can observe. The Postmaster-General pointed out that the terms of the agreement gave the State governments the power to write down the .values of those properties so that ex-servicemen could get them at prices they could afford to pay. This bill indicates that the terms of the financial assistance to the States for tbe land settlement of ex-servicemen are that the money shall be "" payable to the States in such amounts and subject to such conditions as the Minister determines "". The measure gives the Minister ample power to ensure that the ex-serviceman is properly protected and that he will get land on reasonable terms. Nothing could be more just than that. There is no question of injustice to ex-servicemen. The injustice is to the landholder. Grave injustice had been done to the unfortunate people who have been asked to hand over their land upon terms which amount to having their pockets picked. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) said that the current agreement had been satisfactory and, in effect, his remarks were echoed by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke). The Leader of the Opposition said that the agreement had been invalidated on a technical point. Let us examine what the Opposition understands by a satisfactory agreement, and what the Leader of the Opposition, who at times has regarded himself as an apostle of justice, regards as a technicality. The important point in the Magennis case was that the agreement entered into by the Commonwealth and States provided that the price to be paid for land was not its value at the tune of acquisition, but its value in 1942. The High Court held that the payment of the 1942 value, which was very much lower than the present value, could not be regarded as payment on ""just terms"". In fact, counsel for the Commonwealth did not attempt to argue that it was payment on just terms, and therefore the Commonwealth had no case at all to put before the court on that moral issue. That is the sort of agreement that lionorable members opposite regard as satisfactory, and on that very case they stand condemned. Reference has been made to a recent judgment given by Mr people. This bill is against the spirit Justice Sugerman. That gentleman is a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and holding that high position, he does not speak lightly. He speaks deliberately, and he certainly does not attack a government unless he has very grave cause for so doing. The Labour party in this House is in exactly the same position as the Government of New South Wales because when it held office it entered into the 1945 agreement under which it was prepared to acquire property on unjust terms. Therefore, every word that Mr Justice Sugerman spoke applies, not only to the Government of New South Wales, but also to the Labour party in this House. His Honour said that while he was bound to apply the law, he was most certainly not dispensing justice. Thnt was the language of castigation; it was the language of scorn; and it heaped obloquy on the Labour party. the debate on this bill honourable members constitutional history. of the Government parties have consistently failed to face up to the real issue insr the. honourable member for Balaclava before the House, which is not whether ( Mr Joske), have objected to the manner the New South Wales Government is in which the New South Wales Governacquiring land on unjust terms or otherment performs its functions. According wise. The real issue concerns the constito them, power should be exercised over tutional monstrosity in the bill which that Government in connection witli its will enable the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) to determine at will, the terms and conditions on which Commonwealth moneys for expenditure on war service land, settlement will be granted to the States. On all previous occasions in our constitutional history that matter has been the subject of legislation or of agreement subsequently confirmed by legislation. This provision is unique. 1 have been waiting with a great deal of interest to hear the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) speak on the bill. I hope that he will give to the House the benefit of his wide knowledge of constitutional matters. I remember only too well a few months ago, hearing the honorahle gentleman say that he came into this House not so much as a Liberal or a party man but as a Parliament man, and that he considers that his role in this Parliament is to protect the parliamentary institutions, the Constitution, and the rights of the and the letter of everything for which the honourable member professes to stand. Where joint undertakings between the Commonwealth and the States are involved, is the Commonwealth to take upon itself the responsibility of dictating to the States the terms and conditions under which they must perform their part of certain functions? Apparently this Government considers that in connection with any State activity which may impinge upon. Commonwealth functions, and for which the Commonwealth is asked to contribute funds, a Commonwealth Minister should have power, completely unfettered by Cabinet or the Parliament, to say to the State concerned, "" Unless you carry out this function in the way that I think it should he carried out the necessary money will not be forthcoming from the Commonwealth "". Thai position is absurd. As I have already said, it is completely unprecedented in our Honourable members opposite, includ-",35,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War

If the Government of New South Wales were performing a function which had been delegated to it by the Australian Government or it were acting on behalf of the Australian Government, such a course might be justified.

125,Mr Keon,"Almost every Highfor wide diversity of opinion. I wish to protest vigorously against this legislation ""squatter"" means that they who which vests in a Minister, no matter how estimable, calm, judicial and completely free of prejudice he may be, such wide power. Obviously such power will be used to blackmail the New South ""Wales Government and to force it to give effect to a policy which the Liberal party considers should be put into operation. That function should be left to Mr Treatt and the members of the Liberal Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament. Apparently the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) and other members of this Government have so little confidence in their colleagues in the State sphere that they are obliged to give to the Minister for the Interior certain power in order that he may force the New South Wales Government to correct an alleged injustice. I suggest that if the people of New South Wales seriously disagreed with the actions of the Government of that State, obviously it would not be in office to-day. by prices control and has to sell In due course they will have the opportunity to decide whether or not that Government should be permitted to remain in office. Whilst it is true that this legislation deals only with the discretion that is to be vested in the Minister for the Interior, and that the actions of the New South Wales Government are not properly under scrutiny, I think that, in view of what has been said, some remarks should be made by me in relation to that matter. I find it somewhat ironic to hear the squatters and their representatives talking about theft, robbery, confiscation and land grabbing because if ever there was a class in the history of Australia which established itself by theft, robbery, land confiscation, defiance of the law and every possible means of robbery and pillage of the public purse, it was the squatting class. I do not know how many of the estates involved in these protests have been held in the same families since the early days of Australia. then the people concerned at present should be the last to talk about moral rights, land confiscation and land grabbing. Anybody who has the slightest knowledge of land utilization in Mr Keon. Australia knows that the very word were originally so named squatted on the land and defied the law, the government of the day and everybody else so that they might hold that land. They held it in spite of the law. Eveni f some honourable members talk about theft and robbery, the representatives of the squatting interests, should be the last to enter the controversy. Reference has been made to 1942 values and to the suggestion that because some particular form of control of land prices has been exercised in New South Wales, there is something wrong with it. What do honourable members think of price control which compels a publican to sell for 2s. a bottle of beer for which he can get 5s. on the open market? Has he not as much right to complain as a landowner who is compelled to sell his property at a price that is far below its market value? Anybody who is affected his goods at a lower price than he could obtain without control is in thf same position. The only difference is that in one case land is being sold and in the other case a different type of property is involved. Honourable members interjecting, able member for Yarra( Mr Keon), has the floor and nobody else. ment control has stopped people from selling their property at a price higher than they could get if there were no controls. I cannot understand why members of the Australian Country party do not talk about theft and robbery in relation to the long-term contracts that are applied to primary products. When the Government acquires primary products and puts on them prices lower than those which are offering on the open market, is not that in the same class as the acquisition of land by the New South Wales If they have been so held Government at a fair and just figure? I have noticed that in speaking of the values of land and in quoting cases in which, according to honourable members on the Government side, thousands of pounds were lost by individual graziers,",38,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War
126,"Mr Speaker,",Order! The honor,39,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War
127,Mr Keon,"B y legislation, governalmost all of the properties concerned were wool properties. some people feel that they should spare a few tears for an unfortunate wool grower who, according to honourable members on the Government side, is losing £60,000 on the sale of a property of 20,000 acres. But when one considers the astronomical increase in the income of the graziers that has resulted from the high price of wool and the consequent total dislocation of the ordinary system of values for grazing lands, the problem of trying to reach a just price for those properties is difficult. I recall, however, that much of the increase in the value of those properties took place as a result of competition for wool between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. anxious to help soldior settlers now, and who talk about justice, freedom, and rectitude, had no objection whatever to selling their wool to the Soviet Union, and some of the increased prices of their land about which they are screaming came as a result of the complete lack of patriotism in the disposal of their product. Any government is more than entitled to say that it will examine that position before it will pay an artificial value for land which resulted from those increased wool prices. If the land owners are being deprived of the artificial values which their properties acquired because of the willingness of growers to sell their wool to anybody provided they could get a high price, the Government of New South Wales is more than entitled to examine that extra rakeoff and tell the people that they are not entitled to it. I have no particular sympathy for them. In one case that was mentioned by an honourable member, it became quite obvious that the gentleman concerned had been offered the 1942 value many years before^ 1950. He had delayed the acquisition of the property year after year and now he was insisting on the 1950 value for it . In cases of that nature, the vendor is not entitled to receive the extra money. This hysterical charge about theft and robbery that has allegedly been perpetrated by the New South Wales Government quite obviously falls to the ground on examinaI suppose tion, even if honourable members are prepared to accept the unsubstantiated figures that have been quoted by honourable members on the Government side without authority. I , for one am not prepared to accept them. Honourable members have been told that certain land was worth £60 to £70 per acre on present values. For all I know, this is merely a wild guess that has been made by the owner of the property, for no evidence to the contrary was produced during the course of the debate. The persons concerned are in no different position from other people who, because of prices control, cannot sell their property at high prices and claim that they are suffering as a result. The graziers who seem so sell or hold their goods as they wish. holding food? Obviously some goods must be sold. I refer honourable members again to the homely example of the bottle of beer. How long can one hold a bottle of beer to wait for a higher price? Such goods cannot be held.' The only difference is that in one case the property is fixed. The New South Wales Government, having in mind the details of each case, has decided to go ahead with its plans. I do not intend to query them. That is its function. The hysteria of honourable mem-bers on the Government side simply echoes the screams of those gentlemen who, in many cases, are being made to disgorge the ill-gotten gains which were derived from selling their wool on the open market, and I have no sympathy with them. The real point at issue in this legislation is whether this Parliament should vest in a Minister of the Commonwealth the power, to blackmail the States into following a policy which he may decide to be right, even if the people in the State concerned have indicated at an election or in other ways that the policy was wrong in their opinion. Such legislation cannot he defended. I am astonished at the attitude of honourable members on the Government side.

I hope that it will not be accepted. If honourable members dismiss the classconscious bitterness, rancour and heat that pervaded the speech of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) and his pre-occupation with a bottle of beer, they will reach the conclusion that he has no knowledge of the purpose of the bill that is before the House, or of the history of the events that have led to its introduction at this critical time. Jed by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). that the honourable member for Yarra has been misled, not only by the honourable member for Lalor but also by other class-conscious and prejudiced gentlemen. If it. were possible for him to look at this matter in a dispassionate way, he would support the bill and divorce himself from the bitter opposition of honorahle members on the opposite side of the House. This measure is entitledA bill for an act relating to grants to tlie Parliament that honourable members do States in connection with war service land settlement. There is, however, a great deal more in it than that. It is of the greatest importance not only to ex-servicemen, thousands of whom are waiting for land, but also to hundreds, if not thousands, of people who stand possessed of land that is likely to be acquired by the principal States for war service land settlement purposes. This bill is related to a great many other things. It is related to the criminal practice of the States which exercise their sovereign powers to acquire land under the ""War Service Land Settlement Agreements Act at values which rob the owners of their equity in their own land regardless of their circumstances. The bill is also related to the invalidity of the War Service Land Settlement Agreements Act insofar as the Commonwealth is concerned, and to the very important fact that the Commonwealth is bound by section 51 (xxxi.) of the Constitution, which provides power to acquire, but also imposes a condition that the Commonwealth must make its acquisition "" on just terms"". Similarly, this bill is related to the intention of the Government to use the provisions of section 96 of the Constitution, not for the purpose of circumventing section 51 (xxxi.), but for the purpose of making sums of money available to the States for war service land settlement in the hope that those funds will be used to expedite acquisition "" on just terms"". Lastly, the bill is related to the urgent need for an amendment of the New South Wales Constitution Act 1902 to give to the people of that State the same rights as they enjoy under the Commonwealth Constitution. I propose now to return to ray statement that the bill is related to the criminal practice of the States iu exercising their sovereign powers in order, Mr Speaker, in referring to the practices of the States as criminal practices ? nal "" is completely out of order. Certain other objectionable words were used by honourable members last night to describe persons outside this Parliament who have no protection.

I was referring, not to Her Majesty's governments, but to practices followed by them. If the Chair takes exception to the term "" criminal""I may be pardoned for thinking that it is justifiedI withdraw the word and say that the States, in exercising their sovereign powers in the way I have mentioned, have been guilty of unpardonable practices. Honourable members on this side of the House who have addressed themselves to this bill have cited case after case to demonstrate that injustices and indignities have been inflicted upon the people because the States have exercised their sovereign rights in a way that has completely ignored all the responsibilities that are incidental to democracy, wherever it is found.

If I may be permitted to do so, I , too, shall refer to that case as a prelude to my recital of a happening in this House only the day before yesterday. It is the shocking case of the one-armed farmer, Mr Rivers Johnson, of Tocumwal, in my electorate, who committed the grievous sin of having bought, ever so many years ago, with his hard-earned savings and all the credit facilities that he could command, an area of land. After many years of struggle be brought his property to the pitch of production when it was considered suitable for the settlement of ex-servicemen. Thte New South Wales Government offered him 1942 value, plus 15 per cent., for his land, but immediately thereafter threatened him with compulsory acquisition at the bare 1942 value if he rejected the offer. He was a lone individual faced witli the bitter opposition of his own State Government. In the end, he was driven off his property by force and, in this age and generation, compensated with £8 an acre for land that was valued at £20 an acre, when adjoining land was selling, and is indeed still selling, at £30 an acre. all, the Minister would exercise his right His story is typical of hundreds of others in New South Wales. Only the day before yesterday I introduced to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) a deputation representative of people who are terrified of the application of the sovereign powers of the New South Wales Government in the acquisition of land. Even, in this HouseI dare not mention the names of the members of the deputation, because I know that if I do so, although this is supposed to be a free and democratic country, they will be deprived of theii* land to-morrow by the New South Wales Government. The deputation was led by two men who, after years of labour, each possessed areas of land which is being farmed by two sharefarmers. Each of the share-farmers is mid ex-serviceman who holds a qualifying certificate under the War Service Land Settlement Act and is qualified to apply for a farm. Both of them have entered every ballot available to them since their return from the war. The two landowners are eager and willing to assist the share-farmers, who with their families have been with them for more than two years, to purchase the properties on a ju3t basis. They entered into a contract of sale which provided for a purchase price that was entirely acceptable to the share-farmers and was regarded by the owners as being generous. The owners intended to assist them in every possible way, but as soon as the parties sought the approval of the Minister for Lands in New South Wales to the contract, he sent a representative of the closer settlement panel to interview these people and forbid them to sell the land to any one at. any price, or upon any terms, as the State government (proposed to acquire it on the basis of 1942 values plus 15 per cent. The parties pointed out to that official the injustice that they would suffer as they had been in occupation of the property for some years and were still in occupation of it, and having regard to this injustice, they asked to be given the opportunity to put their case to the State Minister, The official replied that he was empowered to tell them that if they resisted in any way at to acquire both of the properties in their entirety and thus leave the owners without any land at all. When the facts of the case were placed before the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes), who is in charge of this bill, he had no alternative but to tell the people concerned that the Commonwealth could not do anything to protect them. The State Government could exercise in an unscrupulous way its power to acquire land at any value regardless of any injustice that might thereby be done. Yet, when supporters of the Government endeavour to protect land-holders from dangers of that kind, which, at the moment, threaten them, but may threaten any person in the community, they are confronted with bitter hostility on the part of members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Yarra drew an analogy between an area of land and a bottle of beer. I shall draw a much more apposite analogy. If it is competent for the New South Wales Government to acquire an area of land at any price, or on any terms, that it determines, as it has been doing in respect of land required for soldier settlement, it is equally competent for it to acquire the home of the honourable member for Lalor, or that of any other honorahle member, under the same conditions; and members, of the Opposition, if they were consistent, would say that that government would be perfectly justified in doing so. Is it any wonder that in these circumstances thousands of land-holders and other property-owners are terrified that the Damoclean sword that the State Government suspends over their heads may descend upon them at any moment? This measure also relates to the unconstitutionality Land Settlement Agreements Act insofar as the Commonwealth is concerned. The Commonwealth is bound by placitum (xxxi.) of section 51 of the Constitution. It is a good thing that the Constitution confers upon the Commonwealth power to acquire at any time property of any kind in the public interest; but the Constitution also imposes the sacred condition that the Commonwealth must without exception make such acquisitions upon just terms. instances, terms of acquisition might be in dispute, no one can fail to realize the value of the protection that that provision of the Constitution guarantees to the community as a whole. The High Court has interpreted "" just terms"" as used in the Constitution to mean the value of that which is acquired at the date that it is acquired. Because the Commonwealth is bound by that section of the Constitution, if for no other reason, all that has been done, so far as it is concerned, under the War Service Land Settlement Agreements Act has been invalid. This hill is designed to rectify that position. I must confess to a sense of shame that, having regard to the merits of this measure, the Labour party should oppose its passage. The bill also relates to the intention of the Commonwealth to utilize section 96 of the Constitution for the purpose not of circumventing placitum (xxxi.) of section 51 of the Constitution hut of making funds available to the States in order to give to thousands of ex-serviceilr. Roberton. men, and ex-servicewomen too, opportunities to settle on the land, not in the hereafter, but here and now. That is what, the bill does. If the present situation were allowed to remain, apart from the doubts to which it has given rise from a legal and constitutional viewpoint, the whole process of soldier land settlement would be slowed up to a serious degree to the detriment of those persons. The hill also relates ta the urgent need for an amendment of the New South Wales Constitution Act 1902. In reply to the honourable member for Yarra, I say that if the New South Wales Government had any sense of democratic responsibility it would cease its unof the War Service pardonable practice of robbing landholders of their land or of depriving them of their equity in properties which they have acquired by their own labours over many years. The honourable member's reference to squattocracy was both ill timed and ungracious. When the history of soldier land settlement in Australia is written, it will contain no chapter more disgraceful than that in relation to the present policy of the Government of New South Wales, which must excite Whilst, in many shame among decent people. If the House wishes to correct the present position, as I have no doubt the majority of honourable members do, it will pass this bill. Let us away with the attitude of members of the Opposition who have been sent here to oppose all legislation that is introduced by the Government regardless of its merits. There are several other phases of this problem. From my own experience, I know that it is a delusion to assess the value of properties solely on the basis of area. The question of area does not arise in this case, and, indeed, it cannot arise in any case. It all depends on the kind of land, and the circumstances. It could happen that the owner of a few hundred acres could be described as a large land-holder, and that the owner of thousands of acres could be described as a small land-holder. It depends entirely on the land itself. This business of acquisition in New South Wales is not a threat to the large land-owner any more than it is a threat to the small land-owner. In my district there are people who possess areas of less than 500 acres, but they are threatened with the same dire consequences as have been visited on so many of the so-called large land-owners in New South Wales. Those persons in the electorate of Eiverina are threatened with a visit by a State Government official, who will suggest to them that they must accept for their land the values of 1942 plus 15 per cent., otherwise their properties will be resumed at the 1942 levels, no more and no less, and the people will be left without a living avea. What shameful thing it is that I , the honourable member for Eiverina, for my sins, have to tell this chamber that I dare not mention the names of the members of a deputation that I introduced to a responsible Minister last Tuesday, because those persons would be certain to lose their land without further warning. Such a condition of affairs should never be tolerated in any free, democratic country. Yet that threat has been made to the relatively fittest members of our community, the people who have made a success of land utilization and occupation. I commend this bill to all those persons who want to recover a situation that is rapidly becoming a positive and menacing danger to every property-owner. I discount as worthless the opposition that has been expressed to this bill by the Labour party. believe that it will be fitting at this stage of the debate if I give a brief resume of the background of this legislation. The War Service Land Settlement Agreements Act was sponsored by the Chifley Government in 1945, because, of the realization of the debt that the community owed to ex-servicemen in order to help them to rehabilitate themselves and to assist them to realize their desire to settle on the land. Another feature of the war service land settlement scheme is that it helps us, a3 Australians, to increase our primary production, and thereby play our full part in respect of providing food not only for ourselves, but also for the less fortunate people of other countries. That brief summary of the history and objectives of this legislation is necessary in order to enable the House to understand the real purposes of the bill. I shall now discuss the progress that has been made with the scheme. I do not propose to give detailed, figures, but a few facts and statistics are necessary for my purpose. To date, the Commonwealth has approved the inclusion in the war service land settlement scheme of 1,763 properties of a total area of 9,905,665 acres. The subdivision of 8,645,051 acres has been approved, and will provide 6,471 farms. Approximately 4,800 of those properties are being worked by ex-servicemen on their own account at the present time. Nearly all the farms which have been provided but have yet to be allotted are in production and the selected ex-servicemen are in occupation of them, but the official allotment and the issue of the leases will not take place until certain developmental work has been completed. Approximately 37,800 ex-servicemen have been classified by the States as persons who are eligible and suitable to participate in this scheme, but some of those men have not yet completed their training. It appears, from the number of applications which have been received for holdings which are becoming available, that less than one-half of the 37,800 applicants are genuinely interested in settling on the land. Commonwealth assistance has been given, in addition to the war service land settlement scheme, to ex-servicemen to enable them to purchase farms or to improve their farms through the medium of agricultural loans and allowances under the Re-establishment and Employment Act. It is correct to say that, in all the States, ex-servicemen are able to obtain finance on concessional conditions from State banks to enable them to purchase their farms, and, in most instances, the money which has been made available for that purpose has been supplemented by the Commonwealth agricultural loans. The Commonwealth accepts a second mortgage as its security. Under the war service land settlement scheme, the States are responsible for the classification of applicants and the allotment of holdings. I propose to summarize the work that Commonwealth has done on its own account. The House is aware that, in this matter, the Commonwealth acts as a partner with the principal States, and provides most of the finance for the other",41,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War
136,Mr Dean (Robertson) [3.28],"IStates which arc classified as agent States. A summary of the assistance that has been given under this programme reveals that the Commonwealth will provide 50 per cent, of the write-off in respect of excess costs of the acquisition and development of the land. The figure of 50 per oent. applies in the case of the principal States. The Commonwealth pays a living allowance to an ex-serviceman settler for the first twelve months of his occupancy, and one-half of the-rent and the interest remitted during that period. Once again, that figure of 50 per cent, applies to the principal States, but the Commonwealth meets the whole amount in respect of the agent States. The Commonwealth also bears one-half of any lasses which may he involved in advances to sellers of stock, arid for improvements and general expenses. That arrangement applies in respect of the principal States, but the Commonwealth bears the whole of the cost in the case of the agent States. That brief summary -justifies the belief of honourable members that it is necessary to continue the war service land settlement scheme. Some wild ideas have been canvassed during this debate by Opposition members. What does the bill provide? Clause2 states(I.) Moneys appropriated by the Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Act 1951 and moneys appropriated by an Act passed after that Act, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, for the purpose of financial assistance to the States in connection the action of the Government of New with war service land settlement, are payable to the States in such amounts, and subject to ouch conditions, as the Minister determines. The information that has been given to the House by the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn), the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) and others shows clearly the necessity for this new provision that the Minister shall be the determining authority. other words, the responsibility is to rest with this Parliament. said about the actions of the New South Wales Government and, indeed, of certain other State governments. As the representative of a New South Wales constituency, I shall confine my attention to what is happening in that State. I shall cite figures relating to the resumption of certain estates of which I have some personal knowledge. first is the Inverell estate of 15,000 acres. Mr Dean. The price paid upon resumption was* £5 10s. an acre, although the value of that and the adjoining property was then £9 an acre. Thus, the owner of the Inverell estate lost at least £52,000. The Ellersly estate of 34,000 acres was resumed for £5 12s. 6d. an acre although the value of that property and of surrounding lands was £10 an acre. In other words, the owner lost at leasi £136,000. Speeches by Government supporters have shown clearly that while we on this side of the .House appreciate the necessity to assist the war service land settlement scheme in every way, we believe that any financial loss or sacrifice involved should be borne not by individuals but by the community as a whole. It is the community as a whole thai owes a duty to ex-servicemen; therefore, the community as a whole should give the ex-serviceman his chance. We do not contend that soldier settlers should be compelled to pay inflated prices for their holdings. Where possible, tbe values of properties should be written down, but any loss so entailed should be borne equally by the Commonwealth aud the States as partners in the war service land settlement scheme. No argumeni advanced by the Opposition in the course of this debate has tempted me to alter that belief. My colleagues have drawn attention to South Wales in holding a gun at tbe head of certain land-owners and saying, in effect, "" If you co-operate voluntarily, you will receive the 1942 pegged value plus 15 per cent., but if you indulge in litigation you will not get that 15 per cent."" Such action is of course in accordance with the platform and objecIn tives of the Labour movement, and of socialists generally. The Government of Much bas been New South Wales sees an opportunity to get land on the cheap and is thus becoming a great land-owning authority. Whilst we should do everything possible to assist ex-servicemen, we should not do anything to destroy the independence of spirit and courage of our primary producers who, as a group, have contributed so much to our national life and played The an important part in making Australia a strong nation. If honourable members opposite will ponder on that matter for ihe flexibility of mind enjoyed by memn few moments, they will realize that bers of the Opposition which enables the man on the land has played an imthem, almost at the drop of a hat, portant part in the development of the to adapt themselves to any given set Australian character and the establishof circumstances, even to the degree of ment of Australian ideals. Too much using to-day an argument that is diametbureaucracy and dictatorship may rob rically opposed to the argument they used him of the spirit of independence that is yesterday. A typical example of this so necessary in the community. Whatever conduct occurred during the consideration short-term benefits may flow from such of a measure of unhappy memory, when compulsory acquisitions, in the long run members of the Opposition presented we shall find that a great disservice has themselves to the public as the great probeen done not only to primary producers tagonists of British justice. They held but to the country generally. The pasup their hands in pious horror at the mere sage of this legislation will assist the suggestion that a "" red"", a potential maintenance of our national character traitor to his country, should be called by encouraging self-help. In the brief contribution that 1 shall make to this debate, I shall deal with possible order, they were able to divert principles and possible consequences rather than with specific examples, fire during this debate has been accused which, 1 think, have already been sufficiently elaborated to prove the Government's fa.se beyond all doubt.

137,Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [3.43],"National Parliament, but sometimes, wben we are dealing witb extraordinary events, we must use extraordinary language to describe them. In essence, it is a legalized form of robbery for a government to use its power to force a man to sell bis property at the price that it determines instead of at his price. Blackmail is practised when one person has a strong advantage over another person and says to his victim, "" Unless you do as I say, certain dire consequences are bound to ensue"". The Government of New South Wales has said, in effect, to certain farmers, "" We want your properties for ex-servicemen and we want to buy them at their 1942 values, which, we admit, are ten years out of date and far below their true values. If you are spineland for which they fought. But they less enough not to defend your rights and stick up for your families, we shall give you 15 per cent, more than the 1942 values, but if you dare to exhibit any British manliness and defend your rights as citizens, we shall not pay the extra 15 per cent, but will give you what we choose to pay"". That is how blackmail has entered into this business. It has been a proud boast for centuries that an Englishman's home is his castle and that he is entitled to defend that home against any marauder. But the socialist Government of New South Wales has told its victims that they have no right to defend their homes. It says, in effect, "" Your home, is no longer your castle. It remains your property only until we decide to put you out on the road "". That is the sort of thing that happens behind the Iron Curtain. I have known the "" reds"" to evict land-owners from their properties and force them to accept compensatory payments that would not even cover the cost of the furniture in their homes. Most honourable members are agreed that such practices should remain behind the Iron curtain. But when that sort of thing raises its ugly head in this land of alleged freedom and opportunity, it is time for this Government to take cognizance of the threat to our security. member suggest that the Government assailed because it is of their political should do? honourable member. Unlike him, I am prepared to support my arguments with constructive suggestions. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) waxed eloquent last night and worked himself into a fervour of patriotism as a champion of the ex-serviceman. I deplore this tendency on the part of honourable members opposite to ride on the hack of the ex-serviceman. They have less justification for talking about ex-servicemen than have honourable members on this side of the House. The honourable member said that the land acquired under the settlement scheme was for the use of ex-servicemen who had fought in its defence. That is true, and nobody will deny that such men are entitled to have a share in the should obtain that share at the expense of the community, not at the expense of the present owners of the land. The Government of New South Wales, however, is forcing owners of large propertiesto bear a large part of the cost of reestablishing ex-servicemen on the land. I have no quarrel with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro over the general principles of the war service land settlement scheme, but I should like him to be consistent. I believe that he is enterprising enough to be the owner of his home. What would he do if a government official came to him to-morrow and said, "" This house cost yon £3,000 or £4,000. You have devoted years of effort to beautifying it and making it a home fit for heroes to live in. Unfortunately, many ex-servicemen are without homes. Get out on the road. The Government will pay you what it wishes for the house, not what you consider to be a fair price "". I believe that the honourable gentleman's enthusiasm and patriotism would drop into his boots and that he would lose interest in providing land for ex-servicemen at what he now describes as reasonable, economic prices. The honourable gentleman would admit the fact if he were consistent. But perhaps this ridiculous situation is not the fault of honourable members opposite. They are obliged to colour. It is natural that they do so. If I were in their place, I should do so",46,Camebon Coul D The The Power To Administer Funds For War

139,Mr Bowden,"I shall tell the as well, but I should he consistent enoughto stand up for the rights of land-holders in New South ""Wales, and to resist their present treatment which the Opposition maintains is proper. In many instances, ex-servicemen settlers in that State are heing placed upon land that has been filched from land-holders. It has been acquired for much less than its value. It is the duty, not of land-holders, but of the community generally to bear the cost of establishing ex-servicemen on the land. gentleman says tbe community should bear the cost of war service land settlement. Why should the landless bear the cost? not landless. As a member of the community, I pay taxe3. The money required to settle ex-servicemen on the land should be found from taxes. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro should not be compelled to surrender his house for half of its value to make room for another person. If the community desires that a returned serviceman should go into hi3 house, the community should pay him the value of the house. I agree at once that the big estates suitable for closer settlement must be broken up before we can increase food production to a degree that will enable Australia, not only to feed its own people, but also to assist in feeding the starving millions of the world. It is disquieting that, although we are faced with the tremendous national problem of increasing food production and are urging landholders throughout Australia to do their very best to assist us to reach our objectives, in New South Wales there is a sword of Damocles hanging over the heads, not only of large land-holders, but also of all primary producers. If a primary producer wishes to assist the Government to achieve the laudable objective of increasing food production, he must spend large sums of money to improve his property and make it more fertile and productive. But would any land-holder in New South Wales, or in any other State controlled by a socialist government, expend large sums of money to improve his holding in the present circumstances? would assist the national effort in that way, he would require to have a feeling of security, but those in New South Wales know that at any moment some of the gentry employed by the New South Wales Government may decide that they want to acquire a farm upon the improvement of which a considerable sum has been expended. The actions of the New South Wales Government have a detrimental effect upon the efforts of the Commonwealth to increase food production in ourselves, but also of humanity generally. Many excuses have been advanced in an attempt to justify this legalized bushranging. The honorable member for a comparison between war service land settlement after World WarI . and after World War II . He said that the land settlement scheme that was put into operation after World WarI . failed owing to high land values. Eveni f that were true, it would not justify robbery of men who own land. But I say that the statement of the honourable member for Wannon was not true. It was a half truth which it would have been better to leave unsaid. However, I believe that the honourable gentleman thought that what he said was correct. The reason for the lack of success of war service land settlement after World WarI . was that the bottom dropped out of the markets of the world. Eveni f land had been given to the settlers as a gift, they could not have made a living from it under those conditions. Let me point out that in Victoria the cost of writing off the debt owed by ex-servicemen settlers was borne by the community, not by' the people who owned the land. Between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 was written off as a bad debt, which was paid from the taxes of the general community. That is the principle for which this Government stands to-day. The burden of settling ex-servicemen upon the land should not be borne by unfortunate and defenceless people who have devoted the whole of their lives to improving areas of land.

I suggest, therefore, that in future we should concentrate as far as possible on the settlement of ex-servicemen in irrigated areas. Until the last war the method of financing irrigation schemes was such that big land-owners were able to filch millions of pounds of money from the community. After the last war had ended the Chifley Government told land-owners, when it irrigated the Yarrawonga area, that they must not sell land to war service land settlers except at just and reasonable prices. Prior to that move by the Chifley Government millions of pounds of the nation's money was expended on reservoirs and reticulation systems that increased sixfold the productive capacity and, therefore, the value of land. Because it takes more labour to work an irrigated farm than it takes to work a dry farm, big land-owners sold or rented their properties. They, did not sell them or rent them at the dry farm value, however, but at the irrigated farm value, which was six times higher. In effect, they made ex-servicemen and other settlers pay a proportion of the cost of irrigation, although the vendors themselves had not borne any of the cost. Settlers were unable to pay these huge costs in addition to having to pay for the irrigation system through the charges for water, and also make a good living, and so they asked the State governments to reduce the cost of water. Every State did reduce the cost of water. la Victoria an amount of £27,000,000 was written off the debts of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission and transferred to Consolidated Revenue. That, in effect, meant that the landowning community was relieved of the cost of the irrigation scheme, which was paid for by the taxpayers. I should not object to that if the contribution thus made by the community had been made to the settlers, but it was made to the land-owners who sold the land to settlers and themselves went off to live, in many instances, in luxury and idleness. The honourable member for Gippsland has spoken about the finances of the State being plundered. If ever there was a case of plunder it is that which I have just cited. The Chifley Government rightly told the land-owners in the Yarrawonga area that, as they would have sold their land to ex-servicemen at the dry value had the area noi been irrigated, they would not be allowed to charge six times the dry value for irrigable land. The sentiments that I am expressing are not revolutionary. Their birth place is not behind the Iron Curtain, as is shown by events in America. The Government of the United States of America built the great Boulder Dam, which brought into existence one of the greatest irrigation systems the world has ever known. That system irrigates more than 1,000,000 acres of land and produces electric light and power for land-owners. The American Government took care, however, that land-owners would noi be able to make unjust gain from that great national undertaking. Congress passed legislation to prevent land speculation, wbich provided that an individual could own only 40 acres of irrigable land. It decided, in effect, that it would not compel anybody to sell his land, but that it would not allow land to be sold at any price other than the dry price and wuuld not irrigate land that had been sold in contravention of the law. It would not allow the American Government, or the American people, including settlers, to be plundered and the primary production of the country to be impeded. The primary production of Australia is being impeded because of the fact that it is impossible for people who wish to settle on the land to purchase good land from the big land-owners except at ruinous prices. Victoria has four irrigation schemes in hand at present Adermann) -Order! The honourable member may not'continue to discuss irrigation at such length.

153,Mr Peters,"I was speaking on theheard the honourable gentleman speak of nothing but irrigation since he began his speech, and I now ask him to come to the subject-matter of the bill, which is war service land settlement. only correct method of settling people on any land in Australia that is not already properly settled, j3 to settle them on irriland for soldier settlement. The Ausgated land or on land that is to be irrigated. If that be the case, Mr Deputy Speaker, then I consider that I am entitled to require that settlement of people on such land shall be on a basis of justice, equity and fairness, three qualities about which honourable members opposite speak so glibly. I am entitled to ensure that, in future, people going on to the land shall not be plundered to the amount of £27,000,000, as happened in Victoria. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) no doubt closely followed the development of irrigation in Victoria when he was a member of the Victorian Parliament. I do not think that he would doubt that the propositions that I have submitted constitute a real contribution to the solution of the problem of the settlement on the land of ex-service personnel and others. These propositions constitute a realistic contribution towards the solution of the problem of diminishing returns from agriculture in relation to the growth of population. The adoption of the course that I have proposed in relation to the four irrigation schemes that I mentioned would increase primary production by 66,000,000 gallons of milk, 3,000,000 pounds of various types of fruit, and £9,000,000 worth of wool each year. Payment for that contribution to the primary production of Australia would go to the ex-servicemen who would work the land. There has been blundering in the past, not only in the sphere of government, but also amongst the land-owners. The great difficulties experienced by the owners of the Yarrawonga areas wanted Opposition in the New South Wales six times the values of the uniriigated Parliament is that as soon as the House land.

Injustices have been done for too long in the acquisition of tralian Oovernment, having no power "" f its own in this matter, can no longer be a party to the infliction of this sort of injustice on people by the Government of New South Wales. No one doubts the desirability of soldier settlement and this Government has done everything possible to facilitate it. The existing scheme is eminently sound and should commend itself to every Australian who is concerned that these opportunities should be open to ex-servicemen. But surely the settlement of ex-servicemen is a national responsibility, the cost of which must be borne by the Treasury. It must not be left to individuals to finance the cost of a national function of this type. It is on those grounds that the Government has introduced this bill and honourable members on this side of the House will give it their unqualified support. If there is to be soldier settlement, land has to be acquired. The Australian Government is obliged to acquire land on just terms. The States are under no such obligation because they can plead sovereign rights. But surely no government, whatever its political persuasion, is entitled to be unjust in the administration of the country's affairs.""

159,Mr Fairhall,"Yes. One of theon in New South Wales with the idea of ensuring that the socialist Labour Government will not lose control of the treasury bench and so permit a Liberal government to institute a more just system of dealing with this and other matters. It is not any coincidence that the worse examples of injustice and oppression under the war service land settlement scheme have been experienced in New South Wales. Those examples have arisen out of the decided policy of the State Government and out of the envy and hate which always motivates a socialist government to take action against property-owners. When it has been necessary to acquire land for irrigation schemes or to prevent erosion in the water sheds of New South Wales those lands have been acquired at something less than their market value. Because their payments have been delayed for years people who have been dispossessed of their land have heen prevented from acquiring an alternative property on which to earn their livelihood. The worse aspect of this situation is that grazing lands that have heen acquired by the New South Wales Government have almost immediately been released for grazing purposes to people, whom I strongly suspect are friends of the New South Wales Government. Rents have been pegged in New South Wales on an entirely fictitious basis. Opposition members may plead that the State Government is endeavouring to keep down costs, but that argument cannot hide the injustice that has been done to property-owners. Owners of property in New South Wales are paying for its repair and providing accommodation and maintenance for tens of thousands of people. This is another example of individuals having been required to carry the responsibility of the Government of New South Wales. happened in relation to the acquisition of land for housing in that State borders on a national scandal. Tens of thousands of blocks upon which purchasers had planned to build their homes have been resumed by the State Government and are out of use. That Government has been responsible for the worse of those actions to which the honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters) referred. The acquisition of land for soldier settlement on the basis of 1942 values was merely the extension of a principle which had been well established in New South Wales. It is very obvious that property-owners are slated for extinction at the hands of the socialist government of that State. The gentlemen who form that Government and their supporters are not only prepared to plunder the individual; they are prepared to plunder national funds. During the last few weeks some of the gentlemen to whom I have referred have gone into dishonourable retirement in well-paid positions. Moreover, they are positions for which those gentlemen have no qualifications. Enough cases have been quoted in the last few days to indicate the great extent of the raids that have been made on private property by the New South Wales socialist Government. but it the Labour Government is returned in New South WalesI can only say that the people who are foolish enough to put them back deserve all that they get. But I do not believe that the people of New South Wales, who can see what their Government is doing to-day, would allow such actions to continue. I suggest that the people will welcome this move on the part of the Commonwealth to curb the unjust actions of the New South Wales Government. The record of that Government is blotted with acts of vandalism which bring into prominence the story told ahout the 40hour week by an honourable member opposite. An editorial which appeared in the Sydney press this week affords us some idea of what the people are thinking about the activities of the McGirr What has Governmen t The bill does not deal with the activities of the McGirr government. the New South Wales Government are bound up with the land settlement of ex-servicemen^ and the editorial that I mentioned illustrates the way people in New South Wales are thinking.",51,Fbaseb Th E Honourable This Country For The Good Not Only Of

There is no right of self-determination when the police are standing by to eject the landowner if he dares to object to the goverruneut's confiscation of his land. Yesterday the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) made a speech to this chamber iu his usual fashion, but did himself little justice when he tried to cloud the issue with an emotional appeal about the soldiers fighting for the land. Nobody denies that men who fought for the preservation and protection of Australia should have a right to settle ou the land, but that is not the issue. The issue is the justice of the terms upon which they will be given access to the land. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro should remember that the ex-servicemen also fought for the preservation of justice and freedom from oppression. The present transactions in the field of land acquisition reek of injustice and oppression at the hands of our State governments. The terms upon which land is resumed to-day is the one great blot on an otherwise acceptable scheme. I hope that the passage of this bill will lead to a diswith the Commonwealth on the basis of continuance of proceedings which have caused widespread disgust. The honourable member for Burke told a long story about irrigation areas and the attempts of certain land owners to secure inflated values for their properties because of the provision of improved water supplies. Tf the honourable gentleman put forward a proposal whereby the value of improvements made at public expense could be recovered. I might be on his side, but there is no point in bringing forward instances of that kind in support of the rank theft that is being carried out in New South Wales. In that State, the Government arbitrarily takes over a property regardless of what it is producing or whether it is in full production. In New South Wales, and probably in every other State of the Commonwealth, thotisands of acres of land are occupied but are not fully productive. There are. certainly good grounds upon which the Government should insist that the land be made productive or that the person who is not using it to advantage should make room for some one who will use it. No one denies that there should be a right of acquisition. The point is that such a right must be exercised on just terms. No one wishes to see this Government acquiesce any longer in a state of affairs which reeks of injustice. Surely no honourable member will query the right of rhe Australian Government to exert whatever influence it may command against a continuation of such a state of affairs. Cameron) -It appears to me that for a considerable time past I have heard nothing new during this debate. I think that it is time the House began to consider whether it should carry on like this, '.rhe Standing Orders have something very emphatic to say about, repetition. matter that I wish to raise is a new one. ft concerns war service land settlemem administration in Western Australia. Since the War Service Land Settlement Agreements Act 1945 was invalidated by tbe High Court, land settlement in Western Australia, which is one of the agent States, has continued by agreement the 1945 act, subject to one or two minor modifications. The matter that I wish to raise relates to the last clause of the second schedule to that act which, as far as Western Australia is concerned, i still in force. That clause gives to thfState Government power to set up an appeal board to safeguard the rights of ex-servicemen who are placed on the land under this scheme, and reads as follows :In the State, there may be established an authority to investigate nnrl determine sue!"" matters arising betweu a settler and the State as the Commor.wpnlth ar-d the State ajrrec may be referred to it for determination The form nurl constitution of this authority shall be agreed upon hy the Commonwealth and the State. In spite of the fact that that provision still exists in the present agreement, the Western Australian Government has failed to take advantage of it. As a result of its failure to set up an appeal board, instances have occurred in Western Australia which can only be described as atrocious. I should like to cite a particular instance concerning a man by the name, of G. H . Wooldridge, of Koionup. He was settled on the land as an allottee",53,Fbaseb Th E Honourable This Country For The Good Not Only Of

170,Mr Grayden (Swan) [4.37],"Th edesignate under this scheme two and a half years ago, his property being situated 25 miles from Kojonup. ""When he went on to the property it consisted of 2,000 acres, on 1,600 acres of which the trees had been felled. Over this entire area sucker growth was several feet high. What old fences remained on the property were in a poor state of repair. There were no improvements; there was no house or shed of any kind. Wooldridge went out there and erected two tents. He has since improved the property to such a degree that it is ready for lease and is one of the best properties in the district. However, he has now received a letter from the Western Australian Land Settlement Department asking him to vacate the property within fourteen days. He received that letter five days after it was written because the mail services in the district are very poor. Wooldridge is an ex-serviceman with an outstanding war record. He served in the 2/16th Battalion, in wbich I also served, for five and a half years. Although he has improved his holding greatly, out of the blue and without prior notice he received an order to vacate the property, to remove his wife and children from it, as well as his stock, including 125 sheep, and all personal effects. given ? state shortly what I consider to be the reason. By devious means the Land Settlement Department contacted the firm from which Wooldridge had purchased his stock. When the firm became aware that he was required to leave the property, it immediately went out and took possession of the stock, which, if they had been sold on the open market on the following day, would have realized at least £100 more than was in fact received for them. Ultimately, a cheque was sent to the Land Settlement Department. I victimized directly as a result of my intervention on his behalf many months ago. Wooldridge's wife was going to have a child. He approached the Land Settlement Department and asked that a vehicle be supplied to him. The department refused his request. I went to the Director of Land Settlement, but obtained no satisfaction. Ultimately, the Land Settlement Department said that it would send a vehicle which was stationed in the district, but the vehicle did not arrive. Since that time he has been victimized to a shocking degree. A great deal has been said to the effect that lessons have been learned from the soldier settlement schemes which were commenced after the first world war. It has been said that no longer are ex-servicemen settled on farms the hard way. I suggest that, in the instance to which I have referred, Wooldridge was settled the hard way. He was sent to a property which was 25 miles from the nearest town. He was not provided with transport and was obliged to live in a tent. He received orders from the Land Settlement Department to the effect that he must wash his superphosphate bags, which meant that he had to carry several hundred bags on his back for 1 mile to the nearest dam, wash them, and carry them back. Certain persons were sent out to repair his tank, which is tbe only source of water supply for the home. They punched five holes in the bottom of it, drained out the water, and left it. He was instructed to plant 400 acres of crop, which he did. When the crop was ready authorities to give him the equipment to harvest it, but they refused to do so. A change in the weather resulted and the crop was flattened by winds. In spite of his suggestion that the only way out was to cut his losses and put the stock on it, the department instructed him to go ahead and harvest the crop. In addition he was given a harvester which came from a rubbish heap and was obsolete. It was one of those that had been discarded by the Land Settlement Department. There are innumerable cases of the kind which, in all, constitute a black record of maladministration in the Katanning branch of the Land Settlebelieve that Wooldridge was ment Department of Western Australia.

If he wishes to speak I am content to allow him to precede rae. may well agree to allow to happen on this occasion what has frequently happened on other occasions. When a Minister rises to his feet, is seen by the Chair and receives the call to close the debate, and his attention is then drawn to the fact that another honourable member wishes -to speak,' it is customary for the Minister not to insist upon his technical right but to give way and allow the debate to continue. It would be a pity if those honourable members on this side of the House who still wish to participate in this debate were deprived of the opportunity to do so because of a misapprehension about the existence of a list of speakers. I hope that Mr Speaker and the Minister for the Interior will agree not to insist on the Minister's technical right and that they will allow debate to continue. for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) has said that a number of speakers on the opposite side of the House wish to participate in the debate and, if Mr Speaker's decision is upheld, they will be denied an opportunity to do so. I point out that Government supporters have entirely carried on this debate since the suspension of the sitting for lunch. It is obvious that honourable members opposite expected Government supporters to carry on the debate during the whole of the afternoon, in bad listening time, and that they would be able to participate in it during the better broadcasting time after 8 p.m. Opposition members made a mistake in not rising when the honorahle member for Swan concluded his speech and, as an act of charity, we are prepared to allow the honourable member for East Sydney to speak notwithstanding the fact that he has no technical right to do so. matter for the Chair.

192,Mr Toji Bueke,"Unde r the Standingother honourable members wish to be heard. The Minister has no continuing right to close the debate after having given way in favour of the honourable member for East Sydney. In the circumstances he should ""not exercise his right to speak until all other honourable members who wish to participate in the debate bave been heard. deference to Mr Speaker's ruling. But for Mr Speaker's ruling I should have no reason for agreeing to a proposal to permit the honourable member for East Sydney to address the House because, during the whole of the afternoon, only two Opposition members addressed themselves to the bill. I am prepared to postpone my remarks only until after the honourable member for East Sydney has concluded his speech. Regardless of the impression under which the Minister may have been labouring, he has now given way. The honourable member for East Sydney has been called, and I submit that the debate should now continue until the list of speakers has been exhausted or until the Government moves for the closure of the debate. Speaker and, I am perfectly sure, for many years previously, it has been the practice of the Chair to give the call in accordance with a list that is provided by the party whips. That is a perfectly logical and very convenient method of conducting debates. Buti f , as has happened to-day, I have no list from the Opposition, I am entitled to take the action that I took over half an hour ago when I called attention to the fact that nothing new was being said in the debate. I might have added that of the nine lionorable members who have spoken this afternoon only three are members of the Opposition while six are Government members. it is argued, as it was a few minutes ago by one honorahle member, that the existence of the list does not preclude an honourable member from coming into the debate, we shall have to decide shortly whether or not the list is to exist. If we intended, after the honourable memare to work on a system under which the whips supply to me, or my deputies, a list of those intending to speak, that list should be adhered to. If , on the otherhand, some honourable members object to that, I think that we shall have to revert to a system under which there is absolutely no list whatever and, as the Standing Orders provide, Mr Speaker shall call the honourable member who, he thinks, has risen first in his place. I admit that that procedure has awkward tags attached to it, because some honourable members, due to their physical condition, are more on the alert than others; and in such circumstances the race would always go to the swift. Eor that reason I think that it is better that the Chair should be made aware of the intentions of the parties. A further advantage of such a system is that each party must have some idea as to the identity of honourable members within its ranks who are best able to deal with particular subjects. Since 2.15 p.m., I have heard the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) from the Opposition side. He was followed by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) from the Government side. ThenI heard the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) from the Opposition side, and he was followed by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton) and the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden), both from the Government side. The next speaker was the honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters) from the Opposition side, and he was followed by the honourable member for Paterson( Mr Fairhall) and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Grayden), both from the Government side. ""When the honourable member for Swan sat down, no other honourable member rose in his place and after some little delayI exercised reasonable forebearanceI called the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes. The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), who is the OppoIf sition Whip, then claimed that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) might have been under some misapprehension.

195,Mr Speaker,"Sinc e I becamethe Minister in reply to the debate. That is still my intention. If the House wishes to depart from that procedure, that is a matter about which I have no feelings whatever. It is not often that I intrude into a debate that relates to land settlement because I prefer to leave the discussion of such a matter to my colleagues who have had more experience than I have had in relation to it. I rise to speak now because of the intemperate language which supporters of the Government used to describe the activities of the ""New South Wales Labour Government. That Government has been properly constituted and elected; but, after listening to the speeches that have been made by some honourable members opposite, anybody would imagine that it had in some way usurped authority in that great State. They applied to that Government terms which any member of the Opposition, if he used them, would have been obliged to withdraw. It is regrettable that any honourable member should be permitted in this House to say that a responsible State government is engaging in legalized robbery and blackmail. Other similar terms were applied by supporters of the Government to the ""New South Wales Government. believe in the sanctity of private property above all other considerations and are not concerned about handing out even-handed justice to every section of the community. F can understand why they are so perturbed at the fact that the Government of New South Wales not only talks about helping returned soldiers but also acts in order to do justice to them. Aftsr listening to the speeches made by Government supporters, the public might be led to imagine that Ministers in the New South Wales Labour Government were seizing the property of various landholders and were deriving some personal gain by doing so. The impression that the average person would gain from such speeches would be that those Ministers are engaged in corrupt practices and are misusing their power. The fact is that all that that Government is endeavouring to do is to obviate a repetition of the mistakes that were made by preceding anti-Labour governments in respect of soldier land settlement after World WarI . Supporters of the Government who have spoken in this debate have said, in effect, "" We are in favour of helping the returned soldier and getting him settled on the land. We admit that some properties must be selected for that purpose. We are all for that procedure, but only so long as some other persons' properties are selected "". They have said, "" hands of f "" wljat they claim is the right of certain people to do what they like with their properties. The New South Wales Government is not resuming properties without paying compensation. It is acquiring them in order to give to returned soldiers a reasonable opportunity to succeed by ensuring that land to be used for settlement shall be acquired at reasonable values. After World WarI . , as the honourable member for Wannon of pounds had to be written off the value of soldier land settlements in Victoria alone because those properties had been acquired at inflated values. The New South Wales Labour Government is endeavouring to obviate a repetition of that experience. Some honourable members opposite expressed peculiar ideas Government supporters with respect to land values in reply to the lionorable member for Burke( Mr Peters) who said that owners of land which had been irrigated at public expense and the value of which had consequently increased should be obliged to make some contribution towards the cost that must be incurred in respect of soldier land settlement. The value of land has also been increased as the result of the expenditure of public money in the provision of other facilities, such as roads which, with the application of labour, have brought the land into production or increased its productive capacity. That is how the value of land is created. Why should land-owners only be permitted to reap the benefit of increases of values that result from the expenditure of public money? Why should not such owners be obliged to make some contribution, in conjunction with other members of tbe community, towards giving ex-servicemen an opportunity to succeed on the land?",59,Fbasek Th E Minister Minister Has Agreed To Give Way To The

197,"( Mr Mcleod) Has Pointed Out, Millions","The honourable member for Gippsland has said that an Englishman's home i? his castle, and he is entitled to defend it against any marauder. The implication of that statement is that the farmer is entitled to regard as his own, any increase of the value of his land, resulting from tbe expenditure of public moneys. The honourable gentleman has rather a peculiar idea of who is entitled to this unearned increment. labour cannot be obtained to operate it, U completely valueless. Therefore, it is the workers in industry who create the value of the factory. The honourable member for Gippsland contends that the farmer is entitled to claim that, solely as a result of his efforts, his property has improved in value, and, therefore, he is entitled to obtain the f u ll market price for it. Why, then, is not the industrial worker entitled to obtain some benefit from the value that he has created by operating the machinery of the factory? The honourable member for Gippsland adopts an inconsistent line of argument where the workers are concerned. The waterside workers have placed a ban on overtime, as a protest against their working conditions, which they regard as unreasonable. I inform the honourable member for Gippsland that the industrial worker has only one commodity to sell, and that is his labour power. If the worker is dissatisfied with the price that he is obtaining for that commodity, he is just as entitled to refuse to sell it as the dairy-farmer is entitled to refuse to sell butter at a price below the cost of production. Th;' honourable member for Gippsland has said that, because industry or transport has been held up, drastic action should be taken, in the national interest, against the waterside workers, and the full weight of the law should be directed against them. Yet he does not regard the dairy-farmers as being on strike when they refuse to produce cream for butter, because they are dissatisfied with the price. He regards such a refusal as just. about time that Government supporters in general, and members of the Australian Country party in particular, began to view industrial problems from a completely different stand-point from that of the past. They demand certain rights Mr Ward. for the people whom they claim to repre sent in this Parliament although, in my opinion, they misrepresent those sections of thn community; but they should recognize that people in other walks of life also have rights. The Opposition is eager to assist ex-servicemen to settle on the land under conditions that will enable them to succeed. A. factory, if Many Government supporters, who are ex-servicemen, are now expressing great concern for the problems of ex-servicemen. I remind those honourable gentlemen that mere service with the forces has not proved in the past that they have practical sympathy for some of their fellow ex-servicemen who are placed in different circumstances from themselves. For instance, an examination of the records of this Parliament shows that unstinted support has been given to ex-servicemen by many members of the Opposition who certainly cannot claim to have served in the forces during either of the two World Wars. Ex-servicemen appreciate the assistance that we have given to them. One has only to speak to ex-servicemen to realize the truth of that statement. Ex-servicemen have not received from this Government the benefits that they might have expected as the result of a great preponderance of ex-servicemen on Government benches. Many ex-servicemen are living to-day under most unsatisfactory conditions in emergency housing settlements. Ex-servicemen, among others, have been dismissed by this Government in accordance with its policy to reduce the strength of the Public Service by 10,000. is not relevant to this bill. reference, Mr Speaker, to indicate to the Parliament and the public generally that this Government's consideration for the welfare of ex-servicemen ends in wordy It is speeches in this chamber.

It is just as innocent as I said it this bill. that, as the result of a judicial decision, the Government of New South Wales has been unable to proceed with its work of providing land at reasonable prices for ex-servicemen. But we do not desire, to hinder land settlement; and even though ex-servicemen cannot now obtain properties on such reasonable terms as they would have obtained them had the New South Wales Government not been practically dominated and "" stood over"" by the Commonwealth, most of them may get some benefits from the bill.

With the exception of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), ' who really understands the measure, every Opposition member who has spoken in thisdebate has called the bill various names, and used such words and phrases as "" coercion'', "" unprecedented in the history of legislation in this House "", and "" subtle disguise"". I was accused of ""blackmail"" and ""dictatorship"". The Government was accused of desiring to slay the States. The bill was described as "" similar to a Communist act imposed on a satellite state Those are only some of the expressions that have been used to describe the measure. I believe that the House will be well advised to recall the history of the war service land settlement scheme. The original legislation wasenacted by the Chifley Government in ]945. The schedule, to the act was an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, and included a reference eo the land values in 1942. That fact has not been mentioned in this debate. In 1945, land sales control was still in operation, and prices were based on the values in 1942. The Government of New South Wales was the first government to abolish land sales control. That action was taken late in 1947 or early in 1948. I was a Minister in the Victorian Government at that time, and the absence of any warning of the intention of the New South Wales Government caused considerable embarrassment in our negotiations for the purchase of land for soldier settlement. Now, the position is reversed, and New South Wales is the only State that is insisting upon the 1942 price. However, whether New South Wales does that or not, as an individual I agree with everything that has been said about that matter by honourable members on this side of the chamber.

Members of the Opposition generally would look at the matter in a very different light if , for instance, the Commonwealth Government were to say, "" We are short of office space in Sydney; we propose to resume the Trades Hall at the 1942 value "". he had no power to do that. power to do it. This bill is the result of a conference of the Ministers for Land of the three principal States. Originally, the States had an opportunity to come into the scheme as agents, in which case the Commonwealth would have paid the whole of the general working losses, and the States would have borne 40 per cent, of the write-off losses and carried out the measure, in pursuance of section Ofi of the administration. However-and I make no criticism on this ground-Queensland , New South Wales and Victoria refused. They decided that they wanted to run their own soldier settlement schemes. They are now called the principal States. They entered the scheme on a 50-50 basis in respect of losses. The Commonwealth pays the living allowance for the first twelve months, half of the rent and interest remitted during the first twelve months, and half of the loss on advances to settlers for plant, stock, improvements, and working expenses. Those provisions were all embodied in the agreement. When the Magennis case was decided in November, 1949, the whole act and the agreement were declared ultra vires. The various State Ministers conferred with the Commonwealth Minister for the Interior on the 24th May, 1950, at .Canberra and the question of a new agreement was discussed. The Ministers decided that the constitutional issues involved in the continuance of Commonwealth co-operation in this field should be Commonwealth and the requirements which referred for legal advice. I hope that honourable members opposite will take particular note of this because, although I mentioned it in general terms in my second-reading speech, I did not go into details. The legal advisers included the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth, the Crown Solicitors of New South Wales and Victoria, and the Solicitor-General of Queensland. They advised the Ministers as follows:The question of future arrangements can now be considered without making any general provision in respect of action taken by the States prior to the judgment in Magennis's case; In other words, there is no difficulty over what had happened prior to that judgment. The advice continuedAs to future arrangements, the initial assumption is tliat State law now makes (or in Queensland will as revised make) substantive provision for war service land settlement, independently altogether of any financial or other arrangement with the Commonwealth. I invite honourable members opposite who have criticized the action of the Commonwealth as dictatorial to take particular note of the following passage:On that assumption it is recommended that-the Commonwealth should enact a short Constitution, granting financial assistance to the States in connection with war service land settlement, on condition that settlement has been effected in a manner acceptable to the Commonwealth Minister for tlie Interior. SoI say to honourable members who have been making these accusation that this is only the legal way of applying section 96 of the Constitution which provides that grants may be made to the States on such terms and conditions as this Parliament deems proper. no knowledge of the Minister's letter to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro or of the speech made in this debate by the Postmaster-General. the whole story.

The report of the legal advisers continuedThe Commonwealth legislation of 1945 consisted of a short Act authorizing the execution of an Agreement substantially in the form set forth in the schedule. If this form of legislation were adopted for the new arrangement then either the scheduled Agreement or the Act itself would need to contain a provision The report then stated that a form of an amendment of their legislation in order . to provide for the payment of compensatechnical requirements of the expression "" just terms"" in accordance with the Constitution. The State Ministers, as the representatives of sovereign States, were fully entitled to do so, and nobody tried to apply compulsion to them. The report then statedThe mere omission from the Agreement of the provision relating to the acquisition of land (Clause II . ( 1 ) ) would not make the legislation valid, for the Agreement would necessarily imply the compulsory acquisition of property, the Act would therefore be a law with respect to such acquisition, and just terms would not be affirmatively provided. I hope honourable members w ill take notice of t h a t . The r e p o r t concludedI t follows that validity cannot be secure hy a mere revision oi the Act of 1945 and the schedules Agreement. Appropriate legal foundation for future action can however be provided, as outlined in paragraph 4 above, by means of a grant of financial assistance to the States in pursuance of Section 96 of the Constitution, supplemented by an informal arrangement between the Governments setting out the conditions to bo observed. I realize that the advisors presented their legal opinion in that form for the purpose of acquainting their Ministers of the actual position. They said to the Commonwealth, in effect, that the provision could not be embodied in any schedule or act because it could be declared ultra vires the Constitution, but that the Commonwealth could make grants under section 96 of the Constitution without terms and conditions. That was an invitation to flout the provisions of the Constitution hy means of an informal agreement. As the Minister for the Interior, I considered that administrative procedure should conform to the requirements of the Constitution, and that I should not take advantage of procedural loop-holes in order to achieve results that could not validly be achieved by direct legislation.",63,Fbasek Th E Minister Minister Has Agreed To Give Way To The

230,Mr Speaker,"Detailed discussionSpeaker. I have tried to state my position and the position of the Government very clearly, but, if necessary, details can be discussed at the committee stage. I do not think that there will be any need for writing off costs in relation to pro^ perties that may be acquired at this stage on the basis of 1942 valuations. This Government has tried to conclude informal agreements with the governments of the three principal States. Two of those governments have not replied to letters that were sent to them some months ago. ments are they? which they are. We have reached agreement with the third government on four of the major points, and the divergence of views in relation to the fifth point is not serious. a little more information about the four points on which agreement has been reached ? points are exactly the same as they were in the original agreement. The only difference that has arisen concerns the stage at which an estate should be finally valued. The State favours the commencement date of the purchase lease. The alternative is tp hold over the writing off for a period of three years after the lease has been granted. The Commonwealth is willing to share in the cost of writing down the valuations if it can be proved at any time during that period of three year.? that the purchase lease is not fair. That is the only point of disagreement in this case. I am trying to arrange a roundtable conference with the State Ministers to see whether we cannot settle this matter. It is probable that eventually we shall have to hold a ministerial conference. Two of the principal States work upon the leasehold system and the other upon the freehold system. cannot negotiate the same agreement with each of them. Various other factors that operate in the two States that work upon the leasehold system also prevent us' from doing so. Therefore, we must try to make the informal agreements fl4] principal States as uniform as possible, although there will be slight variations. I have tried to explain to the Leader of the Opposition what the arrangements are and what wci are trying to do. If there is any further information that I can give to Mi'n, I shall be pleased to do so. The form of the bill, which has been Criticized so much, follows the unanimous recommendations of the legal advisers of the Commonwealth and States. Wo accepted the advice of Our legal advisers. They did not suggest What the terms and Conditions of the agreements should be. They suggested clearly-, without putting the matter in so many W6rds> that we could operate only under the provisions of section 96 o-f the Constitution, and that, although they believed the terms and conditions of the agreements should not go outside the provisions of that section, it would be desirable to make the agreements informal, and thus avoid the whole scheme being upset again if some of the States did not adhere to the agreements. We have acted on the unanimous recommendations of the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth, the Crown Solicitor of Queensland, the Crown Solicitor of Victoria and the Solicitor-General of Queensland. I do not say that any honourable member is more eager than another to see ox-sorvicemeh settlers put on the land, but it is wrong to use the emotional aspect of war service land settlement as a kind of Trojan horse to introduce Gommunist principles, or principles that seem to savour of communism. Land is not the only kind of property. If some returned servicemen wanted to engage in hotel-keeping, we should not resume hotels at 1942 values and hand those hotels over to them, giving them a gratuity greater than that given to other ex-servicemen.

I should like to know what would happen if the New South Wales Government, acting under the New South Wales acquisition laws, resumed an estate for the purposes of war service laud settlement, and if the Commonwealth, having been requested to provide financial assistance, decided that the terms under which the estate had been resumed were not the terms that would have applied if the estate had been acquired under Commonwealth law. In those circumstances, would the Commonwealth provide the assistance that was requested ? man has just voted for the second reading of the bill. the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) that the Opposition desires to co-operate with the Government in this matter, and that, whatever happens, we shall probably vote for the measure. We do not propose to give "" Clever Alecs"" like Anthony) an opportunity to go round the country and say that we have deprived ex-servicemen settlers of governmental assistance.

The Minister for the Interior has said that the Commonwealth would not refuse to give financial assistance unless it considered that the terms of acquisition were outside reasonable limits.

I think that, Opposition members are beings who have above anything else, the soldier desires sentiment, imagination and ambition, and fair treatment for others, as well as for who have chosen holdings in certain parts himself. The power to acquire property places a very great responsibility on any government whether it be State or Commonwealth. That power should always be exercised with restraint, tact and diplomacy. There is nothing in this world that the Government that is more calculated to arouse resentment against the society which condones it than an ultimatum which allows of no latitude or elasticity and which leaves no room for conference or consultation. A basic principle of trade unions is that conferences and consultations should be held before the. members are committed to a decision.

252,Mr Opperman,"There are a large ment. There is a human aspect of thisthem. When some people lose their land under acquisition tliey feel as though they have lost a part of themselves. One cannot possibly exaggerate their feelings at the unfairness of the entire arrangement when the loss of their property has been allied with the bitterness and overbearing attitude of a bureaucratic administration. I know from ray own personal contact with people who have had land taken from tbem in various States that that is so. A returned soldier had a block of land on which he intended to build his house taken from him by the Victoria Government. He received only £60 in compensation and cannot now obtain another suitable block for less tban £200. Consequently he must wait for a further period of time before he can build his house. Many men succeed because they are prepared to work with a singleness of purpose, without engaging in any other activity. Very often, when their land is taken from them they have to commence another undertaking and do not progress as well as they would have progressed on the land that they originally selected. The Labour party claims, above everything else, to be conscious of the rights of the individual, but Opposition members have provided evidence in the course of this debate that they are prepared to consider the State first and to subject the individual to its power. In opposing this bill they have again emphasized the dominating phase of their policy. As it is in New South ""Wales now, so it was in Victoria when land was being acquired there by the Labour The principle of control and socialization is part of the platform. Opposition members have admitted that land which has been resumed belonged to some one. But what concerns me is not only the monetary adjustments but also the morality of these transactions -the example that has been given to the community at a time when it needs guidance from its leaders. In resuming property on unjust terms the New South Wales Government has taken the property of those who have given evidence of achievement and prosperity. The ideal of government should be that people should be prosperous. But when they Mr Opperman. become prosperous the Opposition would take their property from them.

BOURKE (Fawkner) [8.10] -The honourable member for Corio( Mr Opperman) has followed the example of the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) and used this debate as an opportunity to attack the New South Wales Labour Government. He has done that because honourable members on the Government Bide of the chamber wish to draw a red herring across the trail to distract attention from the worthy record of achievement of the New South Wales Government in the land settlement of ex-servicemen. The New South Wales Labour Government has not merely won the confidence of ex-servicemen, but it, has also won their support in the course of action that it has adopted, and the support of the whole of the people of New South Wales, particularly the people in rural areas. The evidence for the truth of that statement is that the Labour party in New South Wales usually wins more than half the rural seats in the New South Wales Parliament. In the federal electorate of Hume that that has anything to do with the bill Administration. before the committee. Opposition's Labour Government of New South Wales have been made the subject of constant attacks by supporters of the Government, and the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) made it clear that the Government intends to use this measure to interfere with the rights of the State of New South Wales to carry out the land settlement of ex-servicemen in its own way, according to its constitutional powers.

The ""New South Wales Government knows that the settlement of ex-servicemen failed after World WarI . because the land was over-capitalized, and hecause the big estates then taken over were not acquired compulsorily at a fair valuation, but were bought on the open market. When the price of primary products fell in the 1920's the value of rural property was reduced and settlers suffered a heavy capital loss. The ""New South Wales Labour Governing from a drastic fall in food production ment has adopted a very realistic attitude. is that tbe land should be used to its full Honourable members on the Government productive capacity.

Honourable, members on the Government side, particularly the honourable member for Corio, spoke of the rights of the individual. They are not recognizing the fact that the ownership of property involves obligations as well as rights. I am one who believes in the private ownership of property, but I do not believe in the system of monopoly ownership, of property.. The aggregation of property that has taken place in the business sphere and on the land affords only a few people a share in ownership. If we are to have that ideal form of social order in which the, ownership of property shall be spread among the people, we must break up monopolies, whether they be in the industrial sphere or in the rural sphere. It is pertinent to call to mind that the ownership of property involves obligations as well as rights. One of the obligations of the ownership of rural land in this country, where we are suffer1 The attitude of the New South Wales The Commission feels compelled to emphastrongly that suitable Crown lands in the various States are limited in extent, and tliat cient land, at a fair price, by voluntary negotiation are remote. It appears inevitable, therefore, that to obtain sufficient land for the purpose of settlement of returned soldiers, powers to take land compulsorily must be exercised. That is what the New South Wales. Labour Government is doing. The report, which was submitted to the then, government in 1944, continuesThe next pertinent point is the date which should be taken for the determination of the value of land for acquisition. The Commission recommends that, in the national in-, tercst and in that of the settlers, the date should be the lst September, 1939, for the following reasons:The reasons that then follow are applicable to-day. The commission that made those recommendations, which are the basis of the present procedure of the New South Wales Labour Government, examined the matter of land settlement of ex-servicemen in very great detail. It travelled all over the Commonwealth, called and examined witnesses including men who had been ex-servicemen settlers after World WarI . , and finally decided upon a scheme in which the mistakes made after World WarI . would not be repeated. It gave the following reasons why land should be acquired at 1939 values and not at current inflated values:There is little doubt that the tendency has the land in Queensland is perpetual lease led to an upward trend in land values. . . . honourable member's time has expired. [8.20] -Honorabl e members on this side of the committee have fully demonstrated their sincere desire to see that ex-servicemen are settled on the land. They have also made it clear that they wish to see that both the ex-servicemen wbo are so settled and also the persons whose land is acquired receive fair treatment. This afternoon the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) stated that New South Wales is the only State which still enforces 1942 values. I vernment agreed to the amendment of that provision, but in fact it is still offering prices which are comparable to 1942 values. It says to property-owners, in effect, "" If you are not satisfied with the price that is offered, you can go to the Land Appeal Board "". In forcing land-owners to go to that tribunal, the Government is putting them to a great deal of additional expense. I could cite many instances in which properties in the Wandoan district of Queensland have heen acquired at prices comparable to 1942 values. Such prices were offered, before the large increase of the price of wool occurred. In 1946 the Queensland Government threw a blanket restriction on sales of land in the whole of that area of 600,000 acres. Outside that area, land was selling at much higher prices than those being offered by the government. In one instance, £2 7s. 2d. an acre was offered by the Government for a property of 3,000 acres. The owner of the property engaged an independent valuer, who at one time had been a Commonwealth valuer. He stated that the true value of the land was £5 9s. an acre. In another instance, the Government offered £2 14s. an acre for 2,000 acres, whereas the correct price was £6 an acre. A great deal has been said this afternoon about the opportunities given to ex-servicemen to buy their land As the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce) stated in this House on a previous occasion, approximately 80 per cent, of country. An ex-serviceman cannot own OrderJ The such land. Wheni t is resumed it becomes the property of the Crown and the ex-serviceman rents it from the Government. He cannot buy it. The rental is based upon the value of the land and may be increased or decreased according to tbe judgment of the Land Valuation 'Court. In 1947, land adjacent to the Wandoan area, to which I have referred, was subjected to re-valuation."" The owners were then obliged to pay rent on the basis of 1950 values, and rents were made retrospective to 1947. When the Queensland Government wishes to acquire land it offers prices comparable to 1942 prices, but when a person dies, know that the Queensland Goprobate is assessed on current values. In the Wandoan area there are many settlers who are ex-servicemen of World WarI . They are old diggers who went into the country and carved a living from it when it was infested with prickly pear. Their sons went to World War II . and when tbey came ba.ck they were taken onto the properties as tenants in common. The Queensland Government has since resumed the area and has informed those people that tenants in common are entitled to only one retention area. The Government promised that the matter would be considered and relief given to such tenants if possible, but nothing has heen done and I do not think that the Government intends to take any action. Many of those ex-servicemen were so poor when they settled on that",69,Fbasek Th E Minister Minister Has Agreed To Give Way To The

257,Mr Brimblecombe (Maranoa),"land that they were unable even to get married. They batched, were married late in life and now have young families. They have been cattle men all their lives and know nothing of farming, but the Government has expressed the intention of putting them on mixed farming areas. It should not be done. I consider that the decent thing would be to leave the old diggers on their present properties until they die. The properties in the Wandoan area, which I know well, are too small. The country could have been subdivided into larger areas, because only a few miles away there are thousands of acres which are just as good, although undeveloped. I am certainly eager to see Australia fully settled. Many of the people from whom the Government proposes to acquire land are also in favour of closer settlement, but they want reasonable and fair compensation for their properties. If we are to inrrease our food production we must encourage more people to go on the land. I consider that this hill will help such people find that it will also ensure a fair deal for persons whose land is resumed. The CB""AIRMAN"" Order! honourable member's time has expired. Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory) [8.30] -This measure seems to turn on the meaning of "" fair and just terms "". I still believe that the Minister who is at present in charge of the administration of the war service land settlement scheme is normally and usually a fair and just mau but honourable members on the Government side have given greatly divergent interpretations of ""just terms"". Indeed, one can only gather from their speeches that "" just terms"" in the acquisition of land means paying the highest inflated price for the land that is to be acquired. One speaker after another on the Government side has used the debate to attack the Labour Government of New South Wales. Perhaps they see the writing on the wall in this Parliament and hope to gain something in a future election in that State. I believe that the criticism of honourable members opposite has been completely unjust. Many speakers on that side of the House have criticized the New South Wales Government for applying the 1942 values as a basis for the acquisition of land. They maintain that that is completely unfair, but I believe that there is much misconception about the application of 1942 values to land sales. It is true that land values were pegged as at the 10th February, 1942, but there is no list setting out the names of all properties and attaching a value to each one. The practice of the New South Wales Government has been to assess a value approximately on the level that obtained in 1942, and I believe that in all cases the assessment has been generous. In its approach to the owners of the land, the New South Wales Government has gone even further than that. Where co-operation has been forthcoming, it has offered 15 per cent, above the level to which I bave referred. Land values are not static. They change almost from day to day and it may well be that the 1942 land value most accurately represents the average value of land over the last twenty years. I have heard honourable members on the Government side advocate the averaging of incomes from land for income tax purposes. It might be just as correct to average the value of land itself The over a period of years. Certainly it would be wrong to assume, as every honourable member on the Government side appears to do, that the only just system for the acquisition of land is to pay the highest inflated price that is asked by the owner. Every honourable member whom I have heard speak from the Government side has spoken on behalf of the owners of land and has expressed criticism of governments, but very little has been said about the ex-servicemen. After all, the overriding consideration must be the interests of the ex-servicemen. It is their interests that the legislation is designed to promote. It is true that land values have changed and that land was at a lower value in 1942 than it is in 1952. It is also true that a higher value was put on the soldiers in 1942 than the value that is placed on them in 1952. The honourable member for Paterson( Mr Fairhall), when speaking this afternoon, said that 1942 was a depressed year for land values. No doubt that is so. Maybe that was because there was fear of compulsory acquisition of Australian soil from other quarters. The men who are seeking land to-day nnder this scheme are the men who fought to save that land from compulsory acquisition by a foreign foe. When the Postmaster-General( Mr secured such leases by way of transfer Anthony) spoke on this measure he said that every soldier had a right to settlement on the land on fair and just terms. Returned servicemen in the Australian Capital Territory do not have an opportunity to acquire land within the territory on terms similar to those that are provided under the war service land settlement scheme. It is true that after World War I. some blocks of land were made available on lease to ex-servicemen. land was granted by the Commonwealth under the Leases Ordinance and Regulations. Under that ordinance a lease may be granted for any purpose for a period not exceeding 25 years and under such terms and conditions as to rent and otherwise as may be determined by the Minister. It appears that following the termination of the 1914-18 war, a rural subdivision of 24 blocks in the Ainslie' Majura area was made available to returned soldiers. required to state their previous experience in wheat or sheep farming, and their ability to fulfil the conditions of the lease. The blocks ranged in area from 190 to 574 aeres and were offered for terms of from five to 25 years, according to the situation in relation to probable city development. The conditions required the lessee to erect fencing, destroy rabbits and noxious weeds, and maintain existing improvements. granted in approved structural improvements that were erected by the lessee during the currency of the lease. A further subdivision of 27 blocks in the Jerrabomberra-Tuggeranong ranging in area from 200 to 1,140 acres, was also made available in 1920, for application by returned soldiers and residents, of the territory who volunteered for active service abroad. The terms of those leases were five, ten or 25 years, and the conditions were similar to those of the earlier leases. All the blocks that were offered were leased and lessees could obtain a repatriation advance of £625 if desired to assist in establishment. few of the original lessees are now in occupation. Many disposed of their lease Mr J. B. Fraser. interests by sale. Returned servicemen and others subsequently secured grazing and other classes of rural leases when they were offered to the public, and others from existing lessees. The existing 25year leases provide for reappraisement of rental in each fifth year of the lease. The valuations for reappraisement purposes are made by a competent valuer of rural land who is not connected with the department and lessees have the right to ask for review by the Minister. If notsatisfied, they may refer the matter to a land commissioner. If they are still disThat satisfied, they can have the matter heard by a land court presided over by a judge. I refer to these matters because they cover the leasing of land to soldiers after World WarI . , but no such action was taken following World War II . I suggest to the Minister that when he has these matters under consideration, he should devise some means by which ex-servicemen in the Australian Capital Territory who desire to go on the land Applicants were and take up small blocks for orchards, vegetable-growing and other purposes, should have made available some of the eminently suitable land which is to be found in the Australian Capital Territory. had no intention of speaking on this matter Tenant rights were about it. honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) does not keep quiet, I shall have district, to exclude him from the committee. of the statements that have been made to pass without comment. Throughout the debate there has been a tendency to drift away from the bill that is before the committee. The purposes of the bill was very clearly explained by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) just before the dinner adjournment.

261,Mr Cramer,"I cannot allow somebecomes an act. That fear exists only in the minds of the representatives of New South ""Wales constituencies. Evidence has been advanced in the Parliament to-day which proves conclusively that the methods adopted by the New connection with the resumption of certain lands can only be described in parliamentary language as reprehensible. There is no element of justice in these transactions. It is true that that Government is resuming land on the basis of its value at the 10th February, 1942. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. E. Fraser) referred to the subject of valuations. A fact that does not seem to permeate the minds of honourable members opposite or to be understood by many other people is that we are living m circumstances that are vastly different from those that prevailed in 3942. The present purchasing value of money is much less than it was then. Property of all kinds has risen in value by 100""per cent, since 1942. Blanket notices of intention to resume were issued to the owners of certain properties in New South Wales and the other States as far back as 1942. Honourable members opposite have contended that resumptions for the purpose of war service land settlement should be made on the basis of 1942 values hecause the properties of other landholders had been acquired in that year. Those whose properties were resumed in the ensiling four years suffered no loss as the result of the acceptance of the 1942 value because the purchasing value of money did not greatly decline until 1947. Having regard to present circumstances, however, it is unjust for any government to resume properties now on the basis of their 1942 value. The Minister for the Interior is charged with the responsibility of administering the provisions of this legislation fairly and justly. He has no alternative but to do so, having regard to the provisions of section 51 of the Constitution. Under the New South Wales Constitution Act 1902 the New South Wales Government may do practisition members object to this bill, not cally what it likes in connection with land because they believe that it will be unsymresumptions and it is inflicting injustice pathetically administered by the Minister on land-holders whose properties are take'n over in connection with this scheme, which no one with an element of reason could tolerate. If the ordinary man and woman in the street realized the.magnitude of the injustices that are being inflicted on a South Wales Government in minority of the people of New South Wales they would rise in their wrath and quickly remove the New South Wales Government from office. Ex-servicemen who desire to take up farming as an avocation do not wish to do so at the expense of the person from whom the land is taken. That is contrary to the spirit manifested by the ex-servicemen of this country. All they ask is that they be given an opportunity to purchase blocks of land at a fair price which will enable them to make a decent living. To ensure that that shall be possible is the responsibility not of the person from whom a property is taken but of the appropriate State Government. Any necessary writingdown of the values of acquired properties should be done at the expense of the State governments and not of individual property-owners. Honourable members opposite have lost sight of the facts. I do not doubt that this Government, and the Minister for the Interior in particular, will properly and generously administer the provisionsof this bill. I do not believe that there is any real fear in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) or that of any other honourable member opposite on that score. It is high time that action was taken to remedy the injustices that are being inflicted upon land-holders whose lands are acquired by the New South Wales Government for war service land settlement purposes. The land resumption policy of that Government is adversely affecting rural industries. Honourable members opposite should consider this proposal in the light of existing circumstances and support a bill of this kind, which is intended solely to facilitate the resumption of land on a fair basis so that the land settlement of ex-servicemen on land may proceed without hindrance.",73,Fbasek Th E Minister Minister Has Agreed To Give Way To The

Many of those old titles were issued for land which had been granted to persons as an inducement to: thena ta purchase building blocks in what is now the town of Darwin, but what was then the town of Palmerston. Those titles gave to the land-owners all the mineral and timber rights on the land. No government, Commonwealth or State, issuesa similar title to-day. This bill seeks to re-invest in the Crown, in conformity with modern practice^ the mineral rights on that land. It will enable prospecting and mining to be undertaken on land that otherwise could remain locked up and idle indefinitely. : The Minister has also informed the House that 2,000blocks are affected by this bill. I know that the areas of those blocks range from 200 acres to 3,000 acres, and the Minister has said', that the total area is 650 square miles. That is a considerable area of land, especially fn view of the timber and agricultural wealth involved. Many of those blocks qaihe into the possession of speculators in England by virtue of the fact that they happened, to purchase a block of land in Darwin. worked the land, and indeed, never intend to work it: So far as I am aware, the majority of them have not even set eyes upon. it. However, I realize that some of the land was taken Up by pioneers. They wanted the land to settle on it. and todevelop ii They deserve due. credit for their-efforts and their interests should be protected whenever legislation concerning their landsisbeing enacted. The fact remains however^ that, after the collapse of the land boom, just prior to the assumption of control of the territory by the Commonwealth in 1910, most of this land was abandoned, and to all intents and purposes, has remained tied up ever since. Only during the last five or six years has it become apparent that at least some of the land has a potential value because of its mineral wealth and agricultural possibilities. On the subject of minerals, r agree that the Commonwealth Government has already assumed full control ""over uranium and other atomic materials under the Atomic Energy (Control of Materials) Act of 1946, and. from that time, has accepted responsibility for the Mr Nelson. payment of compensation for acquisition made under that, legislation. Section6 of the. act states(1.) Ail prescribed substances existing iu their natural condition, or in a deposit of waste material obtained from any underground or surface working, on or below the surface: of any land in any Territory of the Commonwealth, whether alienated from the Crown or not and, if alienated, whether alienated before or after the commencement of this Act, is hereby declared to be the property of the Commonwealth. The act then goes on to deal with compensation for acquisition. I emphasize, however, that that legislation deals only with uranium-bearing minerals. It does not give to the Commonwealth any control over the lands themselves. Considerable publicity has heen given to uranium discoveries at Rum Jungle in respect of which claims are to be made for considerable sums. The House should realize that other deposits similar to those at Rum Jungle could still be locked up. As our laws stand at present, the Government cannot give any one permission to search for mineralson land that is held under the old South Australiantitles. It is quite possible that Those investors have never other strategic minerals, such as tin, copper, zinc and silver-lead. would be found if prospectors had access to such lands. Surely it is in the national interest that all potential sources of strategic minerals should be investigated. Certainly it is not in the national interest that the development of our mineral resources should be neglected^ The Rum Jungle uranium deposits might never have been discovered had the prospector who found them realized that he was on land held under those particular titles. He had no right to be prospecting in that area. Honourable members will realize, of course, what an asset deposits of uranium and other minerals are in this atomic age. I come now to the matter of land-a n aspect of this measure with which the Minister did not deal in his second-reading speech. Not only the mineral wealth, but also the agricultural potential of considerable areas of land in the Northern Territory is locked up. Instead of playing its part in the campaign to increase primary production, that land is lying idle. The owners are apparently unable or unwilling to put it into production. They have had plenty of time to do so> because it is 40 or 50 years sinee the land was originally alienated. The Commonwealth Government should step in and acquire those holdings, observing, of course, its obligation to pay compensation on just terms. Many men in the north are only awaiting an opportunity to put that land into use. In my opinion, tn view of tbe sparse population, that opportunity should not be denied to them. I support the bill, btit I should like an assurance that, as a contract is involved, the Government will instruct its nominees in the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory to ensure when legislation is introduced to give effect to this bill, that provision is made for the payment of compensation on just terms both for the acquisition of mineral rights and for the resumption of land. If such provision is made, this measure will remedy a situation which should never bave been allowed! to develop. It is only to bo expected that protests will be made by interested individuals. Already we have read reports of injunctions being sought; but, significantly enough, I have yet to learn that the Premier of South Australia has protested that this bill is not in the national interest or is a violation of the Commonwealth's undertaking to South Australia when it assumed control of the Northern Territory. If* increased population is to be attracted to the Northern Territory, and particularly the northern areas of that territory, there must be a prosperous mining industry which, of course, will require considerable labour. Secondly, there must be prosperous agricultural industries, and thirdly, there must be a prosperous pastoral industry. I realize, of course, that although the pastoral industry can contribute much to our national wealth, it cannot support a big population. It is imperative, therefore, that we should push on with the development of mining and agriculture. We must explore all the potentialities of the territory. The Opposition supports the bill because it will open the way to the discovery of materials that may prove to be as valuable, if not more valuable, to the nation than discoveries already made in the'Northern Territory. [9.1S} -^-JVIost honourable members will find themselves in full agreement with much of what the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) has said. In many ways, this measure is long overdue. The. urgent need for it arose from the discovery of uranium in that very small area of the Northern Territory where the mineral rights happen to have been alienated beforethe surrender of that territory to the Commonwealth. Three questions must be considered. .First, what is the Commonwealth's power' in this connection-? Secondly, what is the present legal position? And, thirdly, what should we do about it? Answering the first question, I point out that the Commonwealth's power is exercised under section 122 of the Constitution, which reads, in partThe .Parliament may make laws for the tioveriuueiit of any Territory surrendered by any State tn, and accepted by, the Commonwraitb. In December, 1907, an agreement was signed between the Commonwealth and South Australia for the surrender of the Northern Territory in accordance with that provision of the Constitution. In the same month South Australia passed the necessary enabling legislation, but not until 191Q did the Commonwealth pass the acceptance act which became effective on the lst January, 1911. On that date, the conditions required by section 122 of the Constitution were fulfilled. Since that time, the Australian Government has had power to make laws for the government of the territory. The provision is not qualified by any phrase, such as "" subject to this Constitution"", which is included in section 51 of the Constitution. The power is absolute, and therefore the Government is fully sovereign in the territory and can make such laws in relation to the territory as it wishes. It is under no compulsion, for example, to pay a just price for land that it acquires. That is a matter of fact. Whether we like it or not, the Government is bound by no restrictions except such as may be imposed by decisions of this Parliament. That is the first fact to remember. It arises under section 122 of the Constitution. Every honourable member is probably-aware of the terms of the act that",76,Hasluck
267,Mr Wentwoeth (Mackellar),"was passed by this Parliament in 1910. Tbe Northern Territory Surrender Act of South Australia, which approves and ratifies the agreement made in relation to the territory, statesSuch surrender is subject to all freehold, leasehold or other estates or interests in or agreements, securities, or rights in respect of hind within the said Territory in existence at the time of the acceptance of such surrender by the Commonwealth. Section 10 of the Northern Territory Acceptance Act contains a corresponding provision. The result of that is clear. The power of this Parliament is not trammelled except by its own act. In terms of the Constitution, this Parliament accepted the surrender of the territory. In terms of the Northern Territory Acceptance Act, it chose to impose a certain limitation upon itself. limitation is subject to the will of this Parliament. It implies that we recognize aud acknowledge the rights that were in existence at the time of surrender, but it does not bind us for the future in relation to those rights. This Parliament has performed two important actions under the Northern Territory Acceptance Act. terms of an ordinance of the territory, it has made the Land Acquisition Act of the Commonwealth applicable to the territory. The legal validity of that provision is, perhaps, questionable because, as far as I have been able to determine, the Lands Acquisition Act embodies -no specific repudiation or amendment of the Northern AlthoughI believe the ordinance to be good, it is not good beyond dispute. Secondly, this Parliament has enacted the Atomic Energy (Control of Materials) Aet, which, in sections 6 and 14, provides thnt minerals, particularly shall be the property of the Australian. Government. Sub-section (2.) of section 6 specifically provides that the act overrides other Commonwealth Therefore, there is no doubt in my mind that any uranium in the Northern Territory property of the Australian ment, whether or not it is located within flip bounds of the freeholds that were granted before the territory was surrendered to the Commonwealth. Atomic Energy (Control of Materials) Mr Wentworth. Act was introduced in 1946 by another government. Section 14 very properly provides that compensation shall be payable for the acquisition of minerals. The method of assessment of such compensation is* not directly stipulated. Therefore, compensation should be calculated on just terms. I am vigorously opposed to socialization in general, but, because atomic energy is of such a character that its peaceful uses are inseparable from its warlike uses, and because its warlike uses must be nationalized as a prelude to their being internationalized, I consider that the uranium resources of Australia and every other country must inevitably be brought under control insofar as it is humanly possible to do so. International control of weapons that could destroy the world is essential. That Therefore, I am in favour of the principle enunciated in the Atomic Energy (Control of Materials) Act. It is essential to the safety of humanity that such principles be accepted in every country. AlthoughI am opposed to socialization, I believe that this is an exception that proves the rule. First, in The present situation is that rights in uranium have already passed to the Australian Government in exchange for compensation on just terms, which remain to be determined by the courts. Whether the Australian. Government has a further right to acquire freehold under the Lands Acquisition Act is a question on which there is some doubt until this act is Territory Acceptance Act'. passed. So far, I have dealt with the facts as they exist. I have not dealt with the moral facts, which determine the action that we can and should take. We must, and I am certain that we shall, give fair compensation. uranium, The Minister has pledged himself to do so. The payment of fair and just compensation is a fundamental principle to which I , and. I think, other honourable acts. members on this side of the chamber are irrevocably committed. Although we are not bound to pay just compensation by has already become the any legal tie, we are bound to do so by Governa moral tie. Governments in other places may not recognize the existence of such a tie. but I know that this Government The will recognize it. We must pay fair and just compensation for the things we take. It is worthwhile to reiterate to the House the terms of the surrender and acceptance of the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth said that it would recognize estates existing on the lst January, 1911, the date of surrender and acceptance. In regard to those estates, we must bear in mind the law of South Australia that was in operation at that date and which determined the rights that existed then. We are not legally bound to observe any of them. I am talking only of our moral obligations. I am certain that this Government will accept and honour its moral obligations, even though they are not confirmed by any legal tie. Let me direct the attention of the House to the terms of the Mining on Private Property Act, which was passed by the South Australian Parliament in 1909, before the surrender and acceptance of the Northern Territory was confirmed in terms of the extract that I read previously. Under that act, there was a right to mine on private property, even though miners' rights had been alienated, on payment of a royalty. The royalty was fixed as 2-£ per cent, of the .gross money value of the minerals raised. Those provisions were set out in section 32 of the act. As I have said, that measure was in operation in 1909. Therefore, it must he relevant to the estate that was transferred to the Commonwealth in 1911. By sections 8 and 9 of the act, it was enacted by the South Australian Parliament that there could be provisional resumption and subsequent absolute resumption of the land in question, subject to certain conditions. Section 11 reads as follows:In assessing the amount of purchase money and compensation and damage payable under this part, no allowance shall be made for any metal removed from any private land after aii3 provisional resumption thereof, nor r for anv metal known or supposed to be thereon or thereunder. Therefore, it is obvious that the rights of these estates had been impaired before the surrender of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth. That may effect the question of what is fair compensation, but it does not. and should not, affect the obligation of the Commonwealth to pay fair and just compensation. The bill now before the House proposes that section 10 of the Northern Territory Acceptance Act shall be amended by making it subject to ordinances passed by the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory. Doubtless all honourable members have studied the Northern Territory (Administration) Act, which established that council and determined the validity of its decisions. A majority of the members of the council are nominated by th= Governor General and hold office at his pleasure. Therefore, its decisions are virtually decisions of the appropriate Commonwealth Minister. By section 4 of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act, determinations of the council become law unless they are disallowed by the Minister. May I say something now that goes a little beyond the matter that we have under consideration? I believe that that provision in the Northern Territory (Administration) Act, which was passed in 1947, is wrong. It is wrong to gi ve any Minister those powers. I ask the Government to give consideration to an amendment of the act to provide that ordinances passed by the Legislative. Council of the Northern Territory shall be valid unless they are disallowed by either House of this Parliament. That would place such ordinances on the same footing as other regulations. They are ordinances that are, or could be, virtually made by the Minister, who controls thu majority of the members of the council. For that reason. I believe that we should amend the Northern Territory (Administration) Act. During the last few hours, we have, talked about abuses of power by Ministers who have sovereign authority over lands in New South Wales. There is no doubt that this Government will not abuse the powers that it has over lands in territories of the Commonwealth. But, quite apart from what the present Government may do. I believe that a. question of principle is involved here, and that a major amendment of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act along the lines that I have indicated is well warranted. We are talking about only a very minor part of the Northern Territory, but I believe that, in the interests of the territory a.= a whole, we should do what I bave suggested. I do not believe that this measure should be held up. Above all things, it is essential that nothing shall be done to impede the development of Australia'? uranium deposits. Statements, which I believe to be correct, have appeared in the press, that Australian uranium is important in the world picture. As Mr tbey are being used. A canard, which has Churchill said, it is only our atomic power which holds from us the reality of a Russian attack. Our atomic power is, in fact, bottleneckerl by lack of supplies of uranium. The potentialities of the Northern Territory, developed or proved in detail, would seem to indicate-and I use these words advisedly--that here we have something that eoxild tip the whole balance of world power. It is our responsibility, therefore, to ensure that nothing is done by this Parliament, or by any other body or any person, to hinder the development of uranium production in the Northern Territory. The development of our uranium is by far our most important defence effort. is many times more important, from the point of view of the world as a whole, than is the development Army or Air Force. Those forces, gallant though they may be, are only small in the. world scale. resources may not be small in the world scale. It is true, unfortunately, Communist as always, as the agent of the Soviet imperialists this possibility. bers to an article that appeared in the April, 1952, issue of the Review, which is described as the "" Organ of Theory and Practice of the Communist Party' "" and which, in point of 1 fact, sets the tempo for all the activities of the Australian Communist party. The article is headed, ""No Uranium for US. A-Bombs "", and sets out a diabolical scheme for sabotaging and impeding the development Let me reiterate that, from the point of view of the Soviet Union, what happens in regard to Australian uranium is much more important otlier kind that happens in The Communist party's policy regarding uranium will be dominant over all other Communist policy. The scheme that is set out in 'the article is cunning because, like Stir. Wentioorth. Most Communist schemes, it is designed to use the pressure of people who are not Communists, and to direst the efforts of those people to use for Communist purposes, without allowing them to know why already been raised-that Australian uranium should not be stripped from this land-wil l be raised again, regardless of the fact that the uranium resources already known in Australia are more not known or than sufficient to maintain for thousands of years the power that we would need for peaceful purposes.

A story is to be put about, and will no doubt mislead a number of innocent people, to the effect that we of our Navy, must not develop our Northern Territory uranium resources because that would not be in the interests of the aborigines.

I think, by the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths), to the effect that it would be anti-British to allow tbe uranium to bo used. Lastly, a cry is to be raised that we must not interfere w it h private property. Not all of those people who are to be used are of uranium in Australia. Communists. The Communists' idea is to mobilize them for Communist ends. There must be no delay of any kind in than anything of any the development of our uranium resources. Australia. Nothing must be done that would in any way impede that development. A t the present moment our capacity to resume the land in question is in doubt, although it is perhaps only a littl e doubt.

269,Mr Wentworth,"W it h all duedoubt will be set at rest by the passage of this measure. I hope that after the measure has been passed the Government will take steps forthwith to come to some amicable arrangement with the owners of the land concerned, or failing an amicable arrangement, will use its powers of resumption to make certain that the uranium development programme is not delayed. That is the paramount consideration which outweighs, by many times, any other possible consideration. Anybody, whether he be a member of the Government a member of the Opposition, a member of the Public Service, or a private individual, who holds up, for one moment, the development of our urn nin m resources is an enemy, not only of this country, but of humanity in general. Opposition) [9.47] I wish to make a few supplementary points in elaboration of the statements of the Minister for the Territories ( Mr Hasluck) and other honourable members. First, I consider that we are indebted to the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) for having emphasized the practical side of this problem. Summing up the position, I consider that the first point that we should recall is that atomic energy minerals belong to the Commonwealth, and have belonged to it since 1946. There is no doubt about that. They belong to t he Commonwealth subject to payment of reasonable compensation which, in the event of a dispute, will be assessed by a court. That position is the result of an act that was passed in 1946 during the Chifley Government's term of office. The second point is, that it is not clear that there would be authority with respect to those minerals. It is, therefore, necessary that clear authority should be given by this Statute, and the only question is whether legislation should be passed by this Parliament, or whether power should be given to tlie bodyresponsible in the Northern Territory, that is, the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory. I approve the decision of the Government to give additional authority to the local body to pass necessary ordinances, instead of having to come here to have passed legislation that may well be necessary in view of the constitutional position that has been pointed out by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). The agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia, and the terms of the Commonwealth legislation that was passed after the agreement was reached, show that an act of this Parliament is needed to alter titles that were taken over from South Australia. The intention of the bill, expressed in one sentence, is to take the position that existed in 1910 and to give to the local authority in the Northern Territory the power that this Parliament would have to deal with those matters. That is not only vitally important from the point of view of atomic energy and the minerals used in connection therewith, but also from the point of view that was emphasized by the honourable member for the Northern Territory-the development of the territory and putting its agricultural resources to the best use. Questions might be raised as to the power required to develoo the territory in those ways. Those questions will be set at rest by this bill which I think represents a step forward. I consider that this legislation is necessary and I hope that the Government will push forward with the development of atomic energy resources in the Northern Territory, It is extremely important that it'should do so. The minerals, concerned belong to the Commonwealth although the Government must pay compensation for them. If there is any attempt to interfere with the working of the deposits, legislation which was introduced by the Chifley Government will meet that contingency. I refer to the defence projects legislation which was passed in 1947, when there was a flagrant attempt to interfere with the establishment of the long range weapons establishment by the Chifley Labour Government. Apparently there is general agreement among honourable members concerning the wisdom of this measure and accordingly I do not want to detain the House for more tban a moment. The uneasy world situation provides the overriding necessity for the realization of the objectives of this bill. Nevertheless, I feel",81,Hasluck

It is true that there are only about 2,000 of these land-holders and I understand that most of them are resident in the State of South Australia. Those people believe, rightly or wrongly, that if this bill is passed they will receive either no compensation or a purely nominal amount which will be of no real value. Their fears have been heightened by a doubt as to whether section 51 of the Constitution, which provides for the acquisition of private property on just terms, applies to the territories. I do not consider myself to be sufficient of a constitutional authority to pronounce on that subject although I should have been interested to hear the opinion of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). The fact remains that these fears are held and I was particularly pleased to hear the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), in the course of his thoughtful speech, ask the Minister to ensure that provision for the payment of fair compensation shall be written into the ordinance which will shortly be passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Council. In view of the doubt that exists concerning the constitutional position I hope that the Minister will ensure that provision will be made for the payment of genuine compensation on just terms to the land-holders of the territories concerned. Territories) [9.53] -in reply-The subject-matter of this bill has been covered very comprehensively and fairly by those who have contributed to the debate. I should only like to offer a few comments on some of the points that have been raised and try to correct one or two wrong impressions regarding the bill. The points with respect to this legislation which were raised by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr me that it was intended simply to make Wentworth) seem to lie apart from the other subject-matter of the debate. He suggested that the Government should consider the introduction of an amendment to the Northern Territory (Administration) Act in order to provide that ordinances of the Northern Territory Legislative Council, or at least some of Parliament before they became law. I do not wish to prejudge that issue, which cannot be determined in this debate. However, I remind honourable members that when this Parliament passed the Northern Territory (Administration) Act it delegated to the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory the power to make those laws in respect of the territory which previously could have been made only by the Commonwealth Parliament. Having delegated that power it seems to me to be slightly contradictory to insist that the exercise of the powers so delegated should be subject to further review by the Parliament which has delegated them. The Northern Territory (Administration) Act provides that every ordinance that is passed hy the Northern Territory Legislative Council and assented to by the Administrator shall be tabled in this House. In other words, details of the ordinances are available to members of this House and of another place, who may raise in this Parliament any of the matters which have come before the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory. Passing to the main subject-matter of this bill, I want to emphasize that the bill has one very simple purpose. 'Ihe passing of this bill will have the effect of rendering all the lands in the Northern Territory subject to all the laws of the territory. At tbe time of the transfer of the Northern Territory from South Australia to the Commonwealth it was provided that the rights and interests in land which existed under the laws of the State of South Australia should continue to he held under the same terms and conditions from the Commonwealth. The land was transferred from a State tenure to a Commonwealth tenure. After reading the act which accomplished that purpose and the debate which preceded its passing, it appears to that transfer from one tenure to another and that it was not intended to create in perpetuity a. special group of land-holders whose rights in respect of their land were to be immune from the laws to which other land-holders were subject. The titles that were transferred under",82,Hasluck
272,Mr Hasluck (Curtin,"Minister forthat legislation had already heen impaired to some extent before the time of transfer because legislation had been passed by the South Australian Parliament which affected the enjoyment of tlie rights and interests in that land. A certain amount of disputable ground still remained. The purpose of this bill is to remove that ground for dispute by making it clear by the insertion of certain words in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act that the lands transferred from the State to the Commonwealth shall be subject to the laws in force in the territory. That is all that the Government is attempting to do in this bill. In introducing the bill I made it clear Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has that the Government had certain action in mind, particularly in respect to mineral rights. We make no secret about that. We do not wish to do something under the cover of darkness. It is the declared intention of the Government that if this bill is passed action will be taken in the Northern Territory Legislative Council to introduce an ordinance which will make it clear that the mineral rights are reserved to the Crown in respect of all lands in tbe Northern Territory. No special disability will be suffered by any one type of land-holder. No honourable member has disputed the necessity, wisdom or justice of that proposed action. The doubts that have been raised bave relation only to compensation. I give a categorical assurance that in the measure to be introduced in the Northern Territory Legislative Council iu respect of mineral rights, provision will be made for the compensation of laud-holders for any right in property that they may lose as a result of the passage of that legislation. The pattern of the conduct of this Parliament and of Australian governments has already been fairly clearly established. The Constitution, whether or not it applies to the territories, clearly provides that compensation for any property acquired through the action of the Parliament or of any delegate body of it, shall be paid for on just terms. will, intention and objective of this Parliament has heen clearly expressed in the Lands Acquisition Act, which provides for the resumption of lands either by agreement or compulsorily. As honourable members know, the simple expression of that act is to the effect that if land is compulsorily resumed the resumption automatically becomes a claim for compensation. It is implicit in past acts of this Parliament, and I believe that it will be in those of the future, that in any case of resumption of rights in property there shall be compensation paid to the person who owns those rights. the Atomic Energy (Control of Materials) Act. indicated that the same intention is expressed in the Atomic Energy (Control of Materials) Act. At present there are some rather exaggerated notions abroad. Some rather fantastic stories have been published, so fantastic as to be almost ridiculous, about millions of pounds being involved. Without reflecting on any citizen of Australia, I may say that those stories have aroused the cupidity of some persons who may think that some title deeds that have been mouldering away in their cupboards for years have suddenly become titles to fortune. I make it quite clear that it is not the intention of any one to compensate people for their dreams, or for the loss of their dreams. Compensation will be settled on the basis of claims lodged in respect of rights that can be proved. Very few of the 2,000 titles will, I believe, actually be proved to be titles to land in which minerals have been found, or are known to exist in such a way as to justify a claim for compensation. guessing that they hold valuable titles. dreaming of riches on the strength of a story that uranium has been found in certain parts of the territory, and they know that their title deeds relate to land in those parts. Just compensation will be paid, but it will be compensation only for rights that have been Moreover, the lost. The effect of this legislation will not be felt only in respect of mineral rights.

That act appliesat present to lands outside the Northern Territory. By an ordinance of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory the Commonwealth Lands Acquisition Act has been made to apply to lands within the territory. The passing of this amendment to bring the freehold titles under the laws of the territory will place it beyond doubt that they will be subject tp the Lands Acquisition Act in the same way as other land in the territory is subject to that legislation. I remind honourable members that there of the continent. are .aspects of the matter which do not involve the finding of uranium.

Mr Hasluck. that have come to my notice during the last twelve months I assure the House, without being specific, that the Government has received information about mineral possibilities in the Northern Territory which are so encouraging as to lead it to hope that within the next year or two, given the enterprise by Australians to develop it, the northern part of the Northern Territory will be transformed, so that it will contain, not only cattle stations, but also thriving inland towns based on mineral production.

The first is for the attention of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), and it concerns what I consider to be an anomaly in the amendments which were made last year to the Superannuation Act. The particular case that I have in mind is that of Mr that time. If the act that is in operation W. G. Jensen. I have had correspondence with the Treasurer on this matter and he has informed me that Mr Jensen is not entitled to a refund of contributions ask the Treasurer to consider introducor an increase of pension. amendments were made to the act last year. The first provided that where a a officer is retained in the Public Service after he has reached the retiring age, he can get an increase of pension for each year of service after the age of retirement. The other was that where superannuated officers were recalled to duty during the war years, the amount of pension which was stopped at that time would be paid to them. Mr Jensen made application under the provisions of section 14 to have his pension increased, but that application was refused because he had served for only six and a half months. I made representations on his behalf for the payment of the equivalent sum that he would have received in that six and a half months had he retired. If the payment had been made, it would have put him on a similar footing to retired officers who were recalled, but the ruling of the Treasurer is that the act does not provide for any payment of that kind in this instance. First, under section 14, he did not have one complete year of service, and under section 30, he had not retired but had continued on duty. The actual position is that if this man had retired from the Service and had gone back after one day's retirement, he would have heen entitled to receive a full pension for the period of in the Service at the request of the department and at a time of emergency during the war when suitable men could not be obtained, he was refused payment. AlthoughI do not think it was intentional, I think that a grave injustice has been done to this man, and probably to quite a number of others. I am not questioning the interpretation that has been placed on these two sections of the act, but I ask the Treasurer to give special consideration to this case and others of a similar nature to ascertain if it is not possible, under the existing provisions, to make the payment, and place this man and others like him on exactly the same footing as retired officers who returned to duty for various periods at at present will not give this man .and others in a similar category the payment to which I believe they are entitled, I Two ing a small amendment which will ensure that justice will he done to public servants oyer the retiring age who rendered eood service to the Government at a time when it was most required during the war years. I wish to bring to the attention of the Postmaster-General a matter touching the administration of the transport section of his department in Melbourne. That section has worked efficiently for many years. It has been attached to the Postmaster General's Department since federation but the service is rapidly deteriorating with resultant discontent among the staff. Unnecessary expense to the Department is also being caused. Ten years ago at least ten or twelve trucks, with a capacity of 4 tons or more, were in operation in that section. The work of the section has been doubled or trebled but it has now only three trucks. Many more are required. On occasions, as many as 24 trucks have been hired in one day for the carriage of mails and",86,Second Reading
282,Motion (By Mr Eric J. Harrison),,87,Postal Department Over Six Months But Because He Continued
283,Mr Bryson (Wills) [10.21],"Istores and for other work. Most of those trucks are provided from the pool that is controlled by the Department of Supply, but when the trucks are hired, each truck has to travel twelve miles in the journey to and from the Department of Supply's depot. That amounts to twelve miles of waste running which would not be incurred if the Postmaster-General's Department had its own vehicles. I am told that a contract was let for the supply of vehicles which were to be delivered in March, 1951, but the trucks have not been delivered yet and I understand that last year, the Postmaster General's Department paid £99,000 for the hire of trucks for what is essentially work of the Postmaster-General's Department. Most of that money was paid to the Department of Supply, but a considerable portion was paid to private owners. I am informed that the service that is rendered by the Department of Supply and private contractors is not nearly as efficient as the service that is provided by tbe experienced transport drivers of the Postmaster-General's Department. In the carriage of mails from railway stations and boats, the Post Office drivers the 7th May, that a certain taxpayer, can take 150 bags of mail in one load with a 4-ton truck. The average load that is carried by the Department of Supply or by private contractors, varies from 80 to 100 bags. There is also much unnecessary running because the men outside the Postmaster-General's Department are not experienced in the work. There is another aspect to the question which is causing discontent. The driving of trucks, particularly heavy trucks, carries with it promotion for the permanent drivers of tbe Postmaster General's Department. Special allowances are paid and the drivers receive a higher rate of remuneration than that provided for driving 30-cwt. trucks. Appointment to the heavier trucks is regarded as promotion, but for three or four years that avenue has been closed to the drivers. Most of the motor drivers are on the lowest grade salary that is provided for the job. Por the benefit of the men and in the interests of efficient service and economy, I suggest to the Postmaster-General that this position should be remedied. At one time provision was made for a breakdown gang, but that has been dispensed with. When breakdowns occur, private contractors are given the work at expenditure much higher than would be incurred by the department if it did its own work. The question of suburban delivery of parcels is also involved. Previously, that work was done by departmental officers with departmental vehicles, but the work is being let to private contractors now, and they charge lOd. to Is. for each parcel. That is higher than the cost would be if the job were done by the department. The Postmaster-General should give special consideration to this question and have an investigation made. I am sure that if that is done he will agree that the time is past when the department should be provided with efficient vehicles and have that freight carried by employees of the department responsible to it and working under proper supervision all the time. wish to refer to the statement made in this House by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) on Wednesday, after paying his tax assessment, had only £100 left out of an income of £14,600. As press reports of the honourable member's statement were very misleading, perhaps the honourable gentleman may be able to tell us clearly what he did say. Under the heading, ""£100 left out of £14,600 incomeMr Calwell quotes grazier's tax"", one newspaper reported the statement as follows:A grazier who had to pay £14,500 in tax on an income of £14.C00 was mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Caiwell) in his attack on the Government in the House of Representatives to-day. able member must be identified by his constituency and not by name. ber is merely quoting from a newspaper report. matter. report continues"" I w ill get the assessment and table it in the House,"" he said, when his statement was challenged.",87,Postal Department Over Six Months But Because He Continued

288,Mr Turnbull,"The newspaper1 understand that the honorahle member for Melbourne telegraphed the taxpayer asking for the assessment to be sent to him and that it arrived to-day. He did not table it in the House as he promised to do. . Whether he would have tabled it had a question which he sought to ask in the House this morning been allowed, I do not know; I believe that he would have endeavoured to do so. On Wednesday, the 7th May, the honourable member told me that he had sent a telegram asking for the assessment. I then asked him whether, when he obtained it, he would allow me to see it. He agreed to do so. When he did not table it in the House to-day I asked him if I could examine it. He replied that I could examine it in his office. Subsequently, lie .""showed it to me and was good enough to give me a .copy of it. Before he handed me the copy I told him that I intended to use it as the basis of a speech which I proposed to make on the motion for the adjournment of the Mouse to-night, and that in any event I proposed to raise the matter at this stage of our proceedings. With the consent of honourable members. I incorporate the copy of the assessment in Hansard. The asses3me1.1t is as follows:Thomas Palmer, Esq., Box IS, P.O., WlMJANJilA. Asst. No. 247046. File No. C.2537. Taxable and eontributable incomePersonal exertion 14,64(5 Total Net tax and contribution ou income 30/6/51 Provisional tax in respect income 30/0/52 Sub-total Lesis provisional tax Total tax and contribution . . Instalment deductions credited Amount Dated at Sydney Mr Turnbull. The document shows that the taxable income earned by the taxpayer was £14,646 and that the amount of tax payable was £14,513 16s. The statement of the honourable member for Melbourne would have been correct had that amount of tax been levied on tlie total income as set out in the assessment, but that was not so. The total income on which tax was assessed amounted to double the amount stated by the honourable member, or £29,292. The amount payable by the taxpayer covered two years' income at an average of £14,646 a year. The tax due by the taxpayer for the two years amounted to £19,122 18s., which would leave him £10,169 2s. The assessment covers the full amount of tax for the year ended the 30th June, 1951, on an income of £14,646 and provisional tax for the year ended the 30th June, 1952, on the same amount. Therefore, the tax is on two-yearly amounts of £14,646, and not on one amount as was suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne. The taxpayer, Thomas Palmer, of Wilcannia, had a taxable income of £14,646 in the financial year 1950-51, but in that year he made a provisional payment of only £1,123 2s. instead of the full amount of tax, which was £9,106 3s. Thus, he paid £7,983 Is. less than the amount of tax relative to the income. The amount of provisional tax paid in 1950-51 was based on the previous year's income and, as the amount of tax paid was £1,123 2s., his taxable income in 1949-50 was considerably less than £4,000. However, owing to high wool values, his income increased to £14,646 in 1950-51. An amount equal £ s. d, to 20 per cent, of the taxpayer's gross wool proceeds was collected from him under £ the provisions of the Wool Sales Deduction Act-the certificate for £3,486 being credited against his tax for 1950-51 as . . 14,648 also was the provisional payment of £1,123 2s. When both of these amounts 0,100 3 0 were deducted, the taxpayer was finally debited in this assessment with the 10,01(i 15 0 amount still owing in respect of last 10,122 18 0 year's income, namely, £4,497 Is. It is 1,123 2 0 interesting to note that, on the basis of the credit for wool sales deduction, the 17,000 16 0 3,486 0 0 taxpayer's gross wool proceeds for 1950-51 amounted to £17,430. payable 14,513 10 0 I come now to the taxpayer's position for the year 1951-52. Under the pro24/3/1052. visional tax law introduced by the Labour Government the provisional tax assessed for the current year is based on the previous year's income. As the taxpayer's income during the previous year was £14,646, the provisional tax was assessed at £10,016 15s. There is a widely held mistaken opinion that provisional tax is intended to provide for payment of tax on the following year's income. It has nothing whatever to do with the following year's income. It is levied to meet the tax commitment for the current year. Adjustments are made when the assessment for the following year is issued. As more than 20 per cent, of Mr Palmer's income was derived from wool, on application he will be granted a 40 per cent, reduction of his provisional tax, or £4,006 14s. which, when deducted from the amount assessed, leaves £6,010 Is. The taxpayer will therefore pay £10,507, of which £4,497 Is. represents the balance -f tax payable in respect of the income of the previous year. There is not the slightest doubt that when the honourable member for Melbourne cited this case in the House he believed his statement to be correct, and he made the most of it. When he received the assessment to-day and examined it, he was not so keen to air the supposed grievances of this taxpayer. I challenge the honourable gentleman to justify his statement. I issue a similar challenge to the two taxation experts on the Opposition side of the House the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) and the honourable memto justify similar inaccurate statements made by the latter on this subject in this House. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports went so far as to have the details of somewhat similar cases published in the SwanH ill Guardian. which circulates in my electorate. I answered his criticism but he did not pursue the controversy further. The Labour Government introduced the provisional tax in 1944 and the system worked smoothly when incomes were fairly even; but, in 1951, as the result of the great rise in wool prices, it was thrown out of gear. able member's time has expired. -The honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) has brought me reluctantly to my feet. He put the position fairly enough with regard to the preliminaries of the matter to which he referred. He came to my office, and I gave him a typewritten copy of the tax assessment with which he dealt. Apparently he then worked out for himself the calculations that he has just detailed. But he was in error in saying that two taxation assessments were issued in respect of tbe one year. That could not possibly happen under the taxation legislation. ber said something about two years being covered. Sir ABTiru.it EADDEN -The incomes for two years. always happened that tbere has been an overlap and, perhaps, a forward lap, in respect of tax liability. The honourable member for Mallee endeavoured to protect this unfortunate Government from the consequences of its sins. Ordinarily, I am not a friend of graziers. The Labour party has always stood for justice, and, on this occasion, I am pleading for justice for persons coming within this category of taxpayers. WhatI did was to present to the Parliament-althoug h in the time at my disposal I had not the opportunity to deal with the matter as fully a3 I should have wished-a n assessment that was issued by the Commissioner of Taxation, and which showed income for the year ended the 30th June, 1951, at £14,600. The assessnient. as I said previously, involved a series of deductions, additions, and subtractions and provisional tax for this year minus provisional tax for last year, and, under it, the unfortunate person concerned found that he was liable to tax amounting to £14,553.

WbatI said previously is borne out by an editorial in that widely circulated organ of public opinion, the Bombala Times, which, like most provincial and rural newspapers in this country, has been criticizing the Government on this issue. That editorial readsThere are many instances in this district he takes the trouble to do so, will find of graziers whose taxation assessments exceed similar instances of that kind in his own their taxable incomes by varying amounts from electorate involving persons who, in the £1,000 to near £10,000."" Big money is involved past, voted for, and supported his party both ways, no doubt, but neither the bane nor the bounty of Big Money comes into this financially, but who will not do so in the issue. The principle of the thing is the sameand it can't be right! To the mind of the from the Bombala Times states, this Goordinary man all the cold logic and learned explanation in the world about the intricate vernment will surely die; the sooner it workings of the "" system ""-al l the most caredies, the better it will be for Australia. f ul and honourable "" adjustments of inevitable anomalies""-al l the fulsome official assurances about the power and readiness of the Department to give relief in cases of hardship-ar c so much "" baloney "" in the face of a tax assessment that claims more than the whole of his taxable income on any single return. The honourable member admitted that in this instance the taxpayer concerned was left with only £100 out of an income of £14,600. Commissioner of Taxation says. The article continuesI t is just something that doesn't make sense to him, and he is uot comforted by being told that there will be a rebound in his favor on his next assessment, perhaps. plotted his affairs that way. Nor will this Government be excused on the plea that the '""""""system"" was set up by the last Government. The simple fact is that the "" system "" is doing something to the ordinary man that is breaking his heart and twisting his mind and bogging him down deep in disillusion and bitter frustration. Unless the Government can think up a "" system "" more fitted to the realities of the situation it v.ill surely die-and in such circumstances a great deal that is far more important to the times in which we live and the future of this country w ill die wit h it . That opinion has been expressed by a newspaper which normally is a supporter of the non-Labour parties. The Treasurer should try to explain why hundreds of other taxpayers find themselves in similar circumstances as a result of the issuance of similar tax assessments. He should also explain why such taxpayers are being obliged to pay not tax amounting to £14,500 out of an income of £14,600, but tax at the rate of 28s. in respect of every £1 of income for the current year. ber read that in the Bombala Times1 member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce), if future. As the article that I have read I take the earliest opportunity to protest against the campaign of victimization by the Department of Territories of men because they were appointed by a Labour government and because this Government disagrees with their political opinion rather than for any reason that is related to the standard of their work or ability. I refer first to Mr W. Webster, who was appointed by a Labour government, of which I was a member, as Australia's representative on the British Phosphate Commission. This Government recently terminated Mr Webster's services, not because it had any cause to charge him with a dereliction of duty, or because it He hasn't was dissatisfied with the quality of his work. In fact, the Government gave no reason for dismissing him. However, Mr Webster happens to have been a member of the Australian Labour party practically all his life. That is the only reason why the Government has dismissed him. At present, it is terminating the services of al] men who were appointed hy a Labour government to high positions. I should think that members of the Australian Country party would admit that it is a matter of some importance that members of the British Phosphate Commission should include a primary producer. So far as I know, Mr Webster was the only practical primary producer on that body. He performed valuable work in the interests of Australia. It was upon his report and recommendation that the Labour Government decided to acquire tbe",90,Income Taxand Social Services Contribution 1051

That transaction has since been hailed as an achievement in the interests of the Australian community, particularly its primary producers. This Government has decided to dispense with his services, and as it has advanced no reason for doing so-I believe that it actually commended him for his work-w e can only assume that it took such action because it suddenly discovered that all his life he because he was known to hold very liberal had been a member of the Australian Labour party. I come now to the second instance of victimization by this Government. Colonel Murray, the Administrator of the Territory of Papua-New Guinea, has been suddenly removed from his post. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) tried to elicit some inforin those territories. He was doing mation about the matter from the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), who, however, was most evasive. The honourable member for Macquarie desired to know whether Colonel Murray had resigned, whether his services had been terminated because he had reached the retiring age, or whether he had been removed by the Government. All that the Minister told the House was that Colonel Murray was appointed at the pleasure of the Governor General-that , iu fact, means the pleasure of the Government -and gave no other reason for the change. Now, it has been common gossip not only in this country but also in the territories that Mr Cleland, who was Cleland supposed to have for the position formerly a high official in the Liberal as Administrator? It is quite true that party, is to take Colonel Murray's place he was associated with the Australia and as the. Administrator, and this act of the New Guinea Administrative Unit, which Government is, no doubt, to fulfil a had control of New Guinea during the promise given to Mr Cleland at the time war, and was also a member of the New he was made Deputy Administrator that Guinea Production Control Board, but it would not be long before he occupied those are not particular reasons why he tbe higher post.

There was a stage when Colonel Murray was even considering resigning, but evidently he decided to "" hang on "". I remember the objections that were raised when Colonel Murray was appointed Administrator by the preceding Labour Government. The. great objection of the then Opposition to the appointment of this . gentleman was opinions-libera l in the real sense of the word and not as used by members of the Liberal party. Colonel Murray has always displayed a great humanitarian feeling towards the native races, and he was resisting, with all the means at his disposal, the attempt by the Government to create opportunities for private enterprise to exploit the native races everything within his power to resist the attempt of the Government to alter the humanitarian policy which had been introduced by the preceding Labour Government. That is Colonel Murray's only offence. I have not been in communication with him, but I should like to hear his version of the circumstances in which his retirement was enforced. Eveni f he submitted his resignation, I am perfectly confident from what I already know that it would only be as the result of ' pressure applied by this G overnment. What particular qualification is Mr judge of what it proposes to do, it will be useless for anybody else to apply for that office. From time to time, supporters of the Government have criticized the appointment of Labour men to various positions. I believe that the Government is setting an example that might well be followed by Labour governments. When the Labour party assumes office again we can reciprocate by rooting out of every position where we find them people who have been appointed by an anti-Labour government merely because they hold its political opinions. Hardly a Labour appointee remains. The Government has abolished the Australian Shipping Board in order to get rid of the Labour representatives on that body. The Government describes its action as the reconstitution of the board. But we can see that a policy of victimization, merely because a man holds certain political opinions and not because of his inability to do a job, is being viciously pursued by this Government. My purpose in rising to-night was to inform the Parliament and the people of the exact position. |'10.55] I should be most appreciative if the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) will bring to the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) the position in relation to the importation of timber. I shall read, by way of explanation of my request, a telegram which I received to-day from MrM . Fennell, who is the general secretary of the Australian Timber Workers Union. It is as follows:Tlie Australian Timber Workers' Union which work must be stopped hecause of strongly object to licence being granted to the failure of the Commonwealth to cotimber importers until sucb time as the imported timber which is already iu Australia operate with the States at the last meetis absorbed as large stocks are held in all ing of the Australian Loan Council in States at the present time and it is detriorder to provide them with sufficient funds mental to the production of our native timbers. for their public works programmes.

I be stopped, or delayed. Because of that, suggest that, before such a licence is I desire to ask the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur granted, the Minister should confer with Fadden) a few questions about the posirepresentatives of the Australian Timber tion. As the result of the majority of the Workers Union. I have no doubt that Premiers voting against the Commonthe information which is given in the wealth, the Loan Council decided that a telegram is correct. The Government claims that import restrictions have been imposed in order to conserve our sterlingbalances. If adequate supplies of Australian timbers are available, licencesshould not be granted to import timber until the position has been fully explored.. The honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) referred to. the payment of provisional tax. I have no doubt that,, in the near future, the House will begiven an opportunity to discuss that matter. I inform him that I did not. contribute any correspondence to the SwanH ill newspaper to which he referred, but it appears that the journal sometimes takes notice of political opinions other than his own. His suggestion regarding the 40 per cent, variation in provisional tax at the time the Income Tax and Social Service Contribution Assessment Bill was debated last year also requires a reply. I point out that no such provision existed then, and even how it is only a temporary provision, and legislation must be passed to ratify it. The honourable gentleman did not have even the courtesy to supply me (Melbourne Ports) with a copy of the letter which he had published in the SwanH ill newspaper. My electorate of Melbourne Ports does not extend to SwanH ill , and I am not a regular reader of that newspaper. I consider that the honourable member should have had the courtesy to approach me before raising the matter, as he did, in the House.

I am speaking of the manner M matter which the Loan Council ia by this Agreement empowered to decide shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement. Therefore, I assume that the decision of the 31<oan Council to borrow £257,500,000 is binding, not only upon the States, but also upon the Commonwealth. The finanr-ial agreement also statesThe Commonwealth arrange all borrowings for and on behalf of the Commonwealth or any State, and for all conversions . In other words, once the Loan Council Iras decided that a certain sum should lie raised, the responsibility for raising that money rests with the Commonwealth Government. The position to-day is that the Loan Council has decided that £247,500,000 should he raised by way of loan to finance State works. After severe pruning of original estimates, the States decided that tliat sum would be required to carry on undertakings already under way. That decision by the Loan Council is, in the terms of the financial agreement, binding not only upon the States but also upon the Commonwealth and, as I have said, the responsibility for raising the money lies with the Commonwealth. The financial agreement was freely entered into by all the parties and the Commonwealth voluntarily undertook the responsibility of raising money in accordance with decisions of the Loan Council. In view 6f the anxiety not only amongst workers but also in all other sections of the community about the fate of various State' projects, I should like to know what the Treasure? proposes to do to give effect to the Loan Council's most recent decision. |""11.2J -The honourable member for Malice( Mr Turnbull) has rendered to-night a notable disservice to country people, whom he is supposed to represent, by justifying and defending in this House a system. of .taxation assessment that is causing so much heartbreak and upset in rural areas. duced by a Labour government. concerned with what government introin which it is operating to-day. I say that the system is causing the utmost distress in country districts, and is bringing many rural producers to the point of despair. It is completely destroying their spirit and their incentive to work for this community. It is incredible thai the representative of a. rural electorate shall shoiild -endeavour in this chamber to justify such a system, and I am amazed that not one of his colleagues of the Australian Country party has risen to tell the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) that an alteration of the system at the earliest possible moment is absolutely necessary. So that the Treasurer will not have the idea that country people as a whole are satisfied with the manneT in which the system operates, I propose to refer to one more case. Lt concerns a young man with a wife and a family of five small children. He started out on a 500-acre property thirteen years agoj and has since worked hard-harde r perhaps than the Supreme Ruler of the Universe ever meant any man to work. Until the wool boom came, the going was tough, and he built up his personal credit, if not his bank balance. He leased another property of 1,300 acres and mortgaged his own place to pay the first year's rent of £928 in advance. He got the wool firms to stand by him to stock the lease. Then he worked on in high hopes of better things for himself and his family. He even shore all his 1,800 sheep single handed. He had setbacks from time to time, including the loss of 170 ewes in a severe winter season when his total lamb marking was 130; but his net income for the year was mon 1 than £9,000, and he was satisfied-unti l his tax assessment came along. It was £10,351. He said, "" That puts me back to where I was thirteen years ago, and I'm fed up. Communism could not do anything worse than that to me "".

Either the State Government is dishonest when it announces such schemes or it is being financially crippled by the niggardliness of its brother Liberal government in the Commonwealth sphere.

But the result was that the Labour candidate gained a majority of 1,042 in a poll of a little over 5,000 votes. The former member for that electorate, who had held his position since 1938, had gained a majority of only 492 votes at the preceding election.

For the purposes Liberal Government of South Australia of illustration, I shall refer to the case and preventing it from carrying out its that was raised by the honourable member grand promises, or perhaps the truth is for Eden-Monaro, although I have not the that the State Government is just as crook as is the Commonwealth Government.

It is time that they were told whether this Government is hampering vide the necessary funds or whether the State Government consists of nothing but a gang of crooks'whose object is to mislead the people whenever elections are pending in order to retain their confidence by false pretences. If the truth is that the State Government is guilty of deceit, I predict that it will be annihilated at the next general election in South Australia, notwithstanding the gerrymandering that it has practised. The Liberal party should not have risen to take part in the debate if tbe honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) had not made another complaint in relation to income tax. I believe that honourable members on the Government side of the House would wish one of their number to make a few unbiased comments on the subject before the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) replies to the honourable member for Eden Monaro. We all know that many taxpayers, including wool-growers particularly, have received this year income tax assessments for amounts that exceed their income for the last financial year. But such complaints sbould not be accepted without making a study of the basis on which the assessments are made. introduced in 1944. Therefore, any The ment has had. Let us consider the system by which",95,Income Taxand Social Services Contribution 1051
308,Mr Clyde Cameron,I should that the basis of the present system of,96,Income Taxand Social Services Contribution 1051
309,Mr Hulme (Petrie) [11.14],"Ifull details of it in my possession. The taxpayer had an income of £9,000 last year. The actual tax assessable on that income must have been about £5,000. To that was added the provisional tax payable in respect of the current year's income. For the purposes of illustration, I assume that the provisional tax on this year's income was fixed at £5,300. Those two amounts make up the total of £10,300 that the lionorable member mentioneclWhat honourable members opposite overlook is the fact that, in such examples, the income for only one year is taken into consideration whereas the assessment refers to tax for two years. It is wrong for honourable gentlemen to make broad condemnations of the Government on such misleading facts. I have heard many statements on this subject both inside this House and elsewhere, and I protest against this sort of ill-informed criticism. I point out that by the time the taxpayer to whom the honourable member for Eden Monaro referred pays the total amount of tax specified in the assessment, he will have received his income for next year as well. I believe that very few citizens would object if they found themselves in the position of that man. Assessments are not received usually until the second half of the financial year is fairly well advanced. The taxpayer is normally given 60 days iu which to make payment, wbich means, that payment is not made until perhaps April, May or June, by which time practically every wool-grower has received his income for the current year. Therefore, when he pays his tax, he has in hand the income for two years with which to pay his assessment for two years. That fact should be emphasized. Let us consider this matter further know that any wool-grower who took to Members of the Opposition are well aware that, during the current financial year, wool-growers have received dividends from Joint Organization funds. Those payments are additional to their normal incomes. account for taxation purposes. are included in the income tax returns for the current year, but the tax will not become payable until next year. They have received also a repayment of the contributions that they made to the Wool Stabilization Fund. In addition to their income for this year and last year, they will have their dividends from. Joint Organization and the payments made to them from the Wool Stabilization Fund. Mr Clyde Cameron interjecting, Mi-. HULME -If the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) does not know what Joint Organization is, it is obvious that the remark I made the other night about his ignorance was fully justified. This Government, by administrative action, has made provision for a 40 per cent, provisional tax rebate. cent. reasonably early date, realized the situation in which wool-growers who had received tremendous income tax assessments would be placed, and did all that it could to assist them. Therefore, these people are not as badly off as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has tried to make out. A tremendous concession has been granted to them, which will bring their provisional income tax into a proper relationship with their incomes this year. As a tax agent, I had many dealings with the Taxation Branch. I know that the officers of the branch are most reasonable in dealing with cases of the type to which I have referred. I have never brought to their notice a case of apparent injustice Avithout receiving the greatest possible consideration from them.

318,Mr Daly,"The Australian Counthat the honourable member for Eisher( Mr Adermann) should advocate a longer working week. So that there will be no doubt in the minds of the people, let the Acting Prime Minister reveal the attitude that the Government will adopt to the application by the metal trades employers that will be heard soon by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. If the right honourable gentleman were to make such a statement, the people of Australia would know whether the Government intended to take a backward step in industrial affairs, and, as a further step in the implementation of its plan to increase production, support a proposal to revert to the old order. Let the right honourable gentleman tell us whether we have a government in office that will go before the people and advocate an extension of the working week. If the Government has no intention of supporting an extension of the working week, surely it has nothing to be ashamed of, and could quite easily make a. bare statement to-night that because of the Government's import it supports the 40-hours week and has no intention of intervening in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to have it increased. I appreciate this opportunity to speak on this important matter, because we have been constantly fobbed off when it has come -before the House at question time, and I sincerely trust that the Acting Prime Minister, who is so generous as far as outspoken statements are concerned, will take the opportunity to-night to let us know whether this Government supports the principle of the 40-hour week. rare for me to speak on the motion for the adjournment about matters that normally should be easily settled by means of letters to, or personal interviews with, Ministers. Unfortunately, I have not been successful in resvect of two cases that I shall now mention. The matter is vital, because it relates to food production, and every honourable member has for months been emphasizing the great necessity for increased production of food. ""We all know that in this modern age the food production of this country is largely dependent on the utilization of tractor power. As a result of the Government's import restrictions, and apparently hecause there is not sufficient flexibility in the relevant regulations, or, alternatively, because the restrictions are so drastic in their application that the administration is cluttered up, two farmers in my constituency are unable to obtain tractors that they require urgently. One of them is a man who has three sons under the age of twenty, all of whom have decided to stay on the farm. As his sons are to continue to work the farm with him, the farmer has undertaken additional obligations by purchasing more land, and is making a great effort, in response to the appeal of the Government for more food production, to sow more crops this year. Prior to the imposition of the import restrictions he had arranged with Victorian Tractor Supplies for the purchase of a re-conditioned Massey tractor from the United Kingdom. That firm has now been informed that, restrictions, that tractor, which was on the wharf in England ready to be shipped to Australia, cannot now be shipped. The other case is similar, and concerns a farmer who ordered from Victorian Tractor Supplies, an organization that is giving very good service to farmers in Victoria, a second-hand Ferguson tractor. The firm has now been informed that second-hand reconditioned Ferguson tractors may not now be imported. I made representations to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) about the matter, and placed the f u l l facts before him early last week. Nearly a fortnight has passed, and I have had no result from my representations other than an acknowledgment of them and a statement that the matter will be investigated. Production of food entails sowing of crops in time to catch the good rains which it is hoped will fall in sufficient volume to assure a good yield. Both those farmers are outraged hy the treatment that has been accorded them. I have been told by the Minister himself that the case is still under consideration. He will have to make a satisfactory decision quickly, for the crop cannot be sown before the decision is known. The Minister also told me there are already in the country plenty of new",98,Income Taxand Social Services Contribution 1051
319,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [11.31],"It istractors that those farmers could buy. That may be so, but there are many farmers who cannot afford to buy new tractors. Many of them are competent enough mechanics, as are their sons, to be able to make satisfactory use of a reconditioned second-hand tractor, and thus save vast sums of capital. would not be a vast sum to the honourable member, but it is a vast sum to a struggling farmer. settlers of World WarI . and, no doubt, of World War IL , survive only by the facts that they husband their resources by purchasing agricultural machinery at concessional prices and that they use their mechanical knowledge to make second hand machinery serve them efficiently. I do not say that it is always wise or satisfactory to use second-hand machinery, but when a farmer has the aptitude to obtain good results from such machinery he should be commended for husbanding his capital resources and should be assisted in every possible way to acquire such machinery by a government that urges increased food production. These two men are just not able to proceed with normal cropping operations as a result of the inflexibility of the Government's import restrictions. I regret the necessity to raise this matter in the House, but I have already given the Minister ample opportunity to deal witb it. I do not hunt publicity or, normally, speak on administrative matters in the Parliament, but, after all, ten days is a long time. The days are flying past and the tractors are still in the Affairs, as our representative on the United Kingdom. It seems to me that somebody in authority has a tender regard for people who can afford to buy new agricultural tractors, and also that there is a tendency to ask why farmers who want to buy second-hand tractors do not buy new tractors instead. I appeal to the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden), or the Minister who is responsible for making such representations to the Minister for Trade and Customs, to urge him to wake up and see that reasonably prompt attention is given to a reasonable request by those two primary producers. I hope the necessary decision will be made soon. Surely it will not be decided that those farmers will not be allowed to obtain the tractors. After all, they are second-hand tractors from the United Kingdom and do not involve the expenditure of dollars. In addition, they were ordered before the import restrictions were imposed. The position has now reached a stalemate. That is sheer stupidity, and I urge prompt attention to its rectification. Many ex-servicemen Territories; [11.37] -The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) made certain references to two public appointments that have recently been made in connection with matters that come within the administration of my department. The first appointment was that of tbe Australian representative on the British Phosphates Commissioners. Tbe position in regard to that appointment is that Australia has become a member of two similar bodies, one of which is the Christmas Island Phosphates Commission and the other the British Phosphates Commissioners which operates in Nauru. The activities of those two commissions are not related to the agricultural uses of superphosphate or to the products that are derived from phosphatic rock. Their operations are concerned solely with the business management of the Australian Government's financial interests in the winning of the phosphatic rock on Christmas Island and Nauru. We found ourselves in the position that we had an official of the Government, Mr J. B. Halligan, who holds an appointment in the Department of External Christmas Island Phosphates Commission, and Mr W. M . Webster as our representative on the British Phosphates Commissioners. It seemed to us to be an economical and sensible arrangement to have one commissioner to perform both functions. No question of criticism of Mr Webster's services arose in the consideration of which of those two gentlemen should perform the combined functions, nor did any question of Mr Webster's past associations come under discussion. I have nothing to say about Mr Webster's services to the Commonwealth for a period of six years except that I have no reason to believe that they",99,Income Taxand Social Services Contribution 1051

It seemed to us, however, that Mr Halligan was better suited, by reason of his training and. imputation of ulterior motives to other general qualifications, to carry out the job of Australian representative on both commissions, than, was Mr ""Webster. In addition to that factor, as a result, of various re-organizations of duties that have been going on inside my department as a part of the general reconstruction of the department, Mr Halligan was also in a position to take the general responsibility of what might be termed the international side of external territories activities. He is our representative on the South Pacific Commission and, customarily, our special representative at meetings of the Trusteeship Council. It seemed to the Government that his work on these two international bodies fitted in very well with the other functions. That is why we preferred the appointment of Mr Halligan to the joint position rather than the appointment of Mr Webster. appointment for the loss of which he was compensated ? going to raise that aspect of the matter. will be considered. venue will benefit by the appointment of Mr Halligan inasmuch as the fees due to him in respect of both commissions will be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and he will be paid his salary by the Government. of compensation to the man whose services were terminated. was paid and I do not think that any claim for compensation can be fairly made. The honourable member for East of opinion in relation to policy? Sydney passed on to another subject in which, he seemed to be slightly more at home. There are, perable member for East Sydney suggested haps-, two subjects in connection with that there had been differences of opinion. which the honourable member has had There have been no differences of opinion more extensive and peculiar experience between myself and Colonel Murray. The than most other honourable members. One is New Guinea and the other is the people. He was able, in his remarks this morning, to obtain full play for his predilection in both, fields. From his statements about the position of Colonel Murray, whose services as Administrator of Papua and New Guinea will cease on the 30th June, it would appear that he has not obtained the permission of that gentleman to ventilate his private affairs in public. Consequently, I shall deal only with those aspects of this matter which seem to me to be of a public, and not of a private, nature. Colonel Murray has served as Provisional Administrator and as Administrator in New Guinea for over six years. There is no fixed term of appointment for the Administrator of New Guinea, who holds his office during the pleasure of the Governor General. Colonel Murray's appointment as Provisional Administrator commenced on the lst July, 1946, and therefore another year of service will be completed on the 30 th J une next. Colonel Murray's age is 63 years, which is considered rather advanced for service in a tropical country. In view of the long and difficult period of reconstruction through which he has served as Administrator, it seemed to me that the question of the termination of his appointment should be considered. I do not wish to cast any reflection, in public, on the services that he has rendered to Australia. I think that Australia can express its thanks to him for what he has done. But because a man has given good service for six years, it does not follow that at a time when very onerous duties are to be laid on the occupant of his office, he is certain to be able to sustain those duties. Until1 hear that Colonel Murray himself ha. c raised some objection to the arrangement that has been made, I do not propose to entertain the proposition that he considers he has been dealt with unfairly.",100,Income Taxand Social Services Contribution 1051

330,Mr Hasluck,"No. The honorhonorable member for East Sydney suggested that Colonel Murray had resisted. a policy of more intensive development which this Government is trying to inaugurate. That is not so. ihe Government's policy of allowing private enterprise extended opportunities of exploiting the native races. of his accusation, the honourable member for East Sydney is still incorrect. There has been no difference of opinion, nor has any contradictory view been expressed by Colonel Murray on the Government's policy towards the natives or concerning land settlement. So far as I know. Colonel Murray is completely satisfied with the policy of the Government and has certainly raised no objection to any aspect of it. In continuing his speech, the. honoramount.

337,Mr Calwell,"What about mySir. ARTHUR FADDEN I shall deal with that matter now. ""With regard to the new-found love of the Opposition for taxpayers such as the gentleman mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who had an income of £14,000 a year, I inform the honourable member that the whole principle of provisional tax and pay-as-you-earn tax was brought into existence on a recommendation by an all party committee to the Chifley Government. Taxation was to be deducted at the source from all wages and salaries each pay-day. applies to those taxpayers who are not companies or wage and salary earners. It was designed to apply the principle of pay-as-you-earn to taxpayers of that class. There are 2,500,000 wage and salary earners throughout Australia whose taxes are deducted at the source each pay-day. Those wage and salary earners have in general to pay no extra tax at the end of the financial year. In many cases they are entitled to a refund if their allowable deductions are greater than the amount estimated in the tables that are used in determining the deductions. The provisional taxpayer pays a provisional tax in the current year based on the previous year's income. Let us now consider how the woolgrowing industry fares with regard to provisional taxation when wool incomes are rising. The committee that introduced the provisional tax system and the pay-as-you-earn system recognized that an anomaly would occur because of the rise and fall of wool incomes. In 1945-46 the taxable income of the wool industry wa £25,000,000; in 1946-47 it s was £40,000,000, in 1947-48 it was £88,000,000, £120,000,000, in 1949-50 it was £220,000,000 and in 1950-51 it was £480,000,000. It is only common sense if provisional tax is calculated on the previous year's income and wool prices are rising that there must be a deficiency of tax payment or provision. The following table will be of interest to honourable members as it refers to the advantage received by all primary producers from provisional tax, a substantial proportion of which advantage has, of course, accrued to wool-growers:Provisional Actual Year of Income. tax paid In liability OB respect of Income. Income. £ millions. £ millions. 1947-48 22 44 1948-49 38 55 1949-50 47 79 1950-51 76 211 That table will make it clear to honourable members that unlike wage and salary The provisional tax earners, wool-growers did not pay their full taxes during the year in which their incomes were earned. [Extension of time granted.] Those who benefited by the difference between the amount of provisional tax and the amount of their liability for income tax now have to make up the deficiency. That has happened in the case quoted by the honourable member for Melbourne. That gentleman's income tax for 1950-51 was £9,106 and the provisional tax paid towards that liability was only about £1,100. right honourable gentleman referring to? ring to the new-found friend of the honourable member for Melbourne. Consequently he paid provisional tax of £1,123 in the previous year to meet a tax liability for the current year of £9,106. In other words, he benefited to the extent of £7,983 from the deficiency of £135,000,000 in that year to which I have referred. The system of provisional tax, which was introduced by the Chifley Government and continued by the present Government, necessitates an ultimate adjustin 1948-49 it was ment unless provisional tax is to be wiped out altogether. Accordingly, the gentleman in question has had the wrongful use, in all circumstances, of £7,983 for more than eighteen months. That is the position, and those are the circumstances in which the honourable member for Melbourne sheds crocodile tears, whilst neglecting entirely the position of 2,500,000 wage and salary earners who do not benefit from a large deficiency in tax payments, such as do the wool-growers of Australia.",102,Income Taxand Social Services Contribution 1051
338,Mr Calwell,Which taxpayer is the,103,Income Taxand Social Services Contribution 1051
339,Sir Arthur Fadden,"I am referThe honourable member, who would have us believe that he sympathizes with wage and salary earners, brings forward an example such as this in an attempt to illustrate an injustice which, he claims, has been done, by the system of provisional tax, to 100,000 wool-growers who enjoyed, in the aggregate, a taxable income of £480,000,000 last year. Upon that income they were required to provide provisional tax which was based upon an aggregate taxable income of £220,000,000 in the previous year. Friday, 16 May, 1958. Opposition) [12.3 a.m.] I apologize to the House for rising to speak at this late hour, but I wish to make two points clear. The first concerns the illustration given by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). Nothing that has been aaid by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), by the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hume), or hy the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) oan alter the fact that in one year, in one assessment, almost 100 per cent, of the income for that year was required to be paid as tax. I am not dealing with the history of the matter. The Treasurer has aaid that if one looks back the assessment can he justified. , I suggest that to apply such an impost, in a year when this Government altered the averaging system of taxation, is to impose an intolerable hardship. I think that that is admitted. The necessity for it cannot be justified and that is why complaints have heen made. The second matter to which I wish to refer is more important. It concerns the subject raised by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon). The poinfis not so much what people say about the recent decisions of the Australian Loan Council. The important thing is what the terms of the Financial Agreement say. It is of no use to criticize the States. They have cut their programmes for this year by 10 per oent. of the physical volume of works to be carried out. Nominally, of course, there appears to be an increase, but in fact it is a 10 per oent. reduction, which was decided upon by the Loan Council in respect of developmental works. The Commonwealth is bound by that decision as strongly as are the States. The Commonwealth is bound to do its utmost-and X am not speaking of legal details-to raise this money for the works which were agreed to by the Loan Council, the decisions of which override all other considerations, even sections of the Constitution. honourable gentleman refer to amounts to be raised hy loan? loan. I am not speaking of anything else. In various speeches, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer have said that it will be impossible to raise so much money. In making such a statement they are indirectly repudiating their obligations. I made a press statement about it. honourable gentleman made a press statement, .but even to-night he has expressed the view that the decision is impossible of performance, and that it is silly. that. remark is fair comment on the statements of the right honourable gentleman to-night, and on the statement which he made at Canberra on the Saturday night after the Loan Council meeting. I ask him to consider the position of the 'Commonwealth and to refrain from saying that it is impossible to perform the undertaking. In certain circumstances, such a statement amounts to repudiation. that. Saturday night after the Loan Council meeting, and in the Financial Statement which he recently made to the House, the right honourable gentleman stated that it will be impossible to perform the undertaking. I say that, in the circumstances, that is practically equivalent to repudiation of -a binding contract. Question resolved in the affirmative.
