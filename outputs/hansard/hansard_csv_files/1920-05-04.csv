Question (by leave) amended accordingly, and resolved in the affirmative, honourable members rising in their places. Government to give the House an early opportunity of amending the Conciliation and Arbitration Act with a view to providing an easier method of dealing with the raanv cases now cited for hearing? have been giving a great deal of attention to this matter. Parliament has amended the Act many times, and every time the House has been led to expect that there would be a great improvement, that cases would be more expeditiously heard, and that justice would be more effectively and speedily done; but it can hardly be said that the facts of a very lengthy experience of the working of the Act have warranted those expectations. The Government are very anxious to exercise the limited powers at their disposal to the very best advantage, and for that reason have convened a conference of all persons interested, in order that we may seek counsel and advice from them. Those who are charged with the conduct of industrial affairs in unions will agree with me that there is great room for improvement. I have no bias in one direction or another. If we can secure industrial peace by means of the Arbitration Court well and good, but it is obvious that we must use every effort to secure it. I am hopeful that those who from their long experience are very familiar with the causes that lead to industrial disputes as well as the means that now exist for their settlement will at this conference be able from their joint wisdom to suggest to the Government a The heartmeans whereby, at any rate, we may improve the existing machinery. More than bhat I cannot say, but it would be an unwise policy ""to amend the law by patching it up on the lines we have already followed in the past. I see no reason for believing that from such a means any lasting good could come. asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon noticeWhether, i i i view of the fact that the National Rifle Association of New South Wales proposes to hold its annual meeting on the ANZAC Rifle Range, Liverpool, in October next, and that teams from al l parts of the Commonwealth, New Zealand, and Great Britain w ill be competing in the matches, making the competition the second largest rifle meeting in the world, w ill he take immediate steps to have all necessary work carried out in order to put the range in proper condition for the competition f range will also be required for military purposes action is heing taken in the direction indicated.

How many bales of wool were shipped from Australia during the quarters ending 31st December, 1919, and 31st March, 1920? 2. How many bales is it estimated w ill be shipped during the quarter ending 30th June, 1920? 3.

I am n ow in a p o s it i o n to s u p p ly the honourable member w it h the f o l l o w in g replies:1. For quarter ended 31st December, 1919, 461,884 bales; for quarter ended 31st March, 1920, 549,946 bales. The above periods included 100,000 bales shipped for sale in America, and 113,000 bales shipped for sale in Antwerp, and the quantities shown are in excess of tliat shipped during the quarter ended 30th September, 1919, namely, 414,857 bales. 2. On the basis of shipping space allotted for April, and also those quantities which have been cleared during April, the estimated quantity to be shipped for the quarter ending 30th June, 1920, is 490,000 bales. This is ' based on theoretical calculations, which, in practice, have rarely been confirmed. 3. From a minimum of 1,250,000 to a maximum of 1,500,000 bales. 4. Owing to the uncertainty regarding shipO n 2 9 t li A p r i l the honourable ping space allotments and the absence of information regarding requirements for countries other than the United Kingdom, it is impossible to fix a reliable date by which the surplus wool w ill have been shipped from Australia. The Central Wool Committee are not hopeful of the carry-over wools from 30th June, 1920, being shipped before the end of 1920 or early in 1921. WAR GRATUITY BILL. Assent reported.

True, there are not so many left who still require that provision mains that numbers have not yet been re-established in civil life, and it is these whom I wish to help. The establishment of such industries as I have suggested would certainly prove of very great assistance to men who are without regular employment, who do not follow any defined trade or calling.

That is to eay, out of my suit length, the producer would get 14s. 5d., while the manufacturer and the middleman would make Â£ 5 5s. 7d. Do not honourable members think that that example suggests a good opportunity for our returned men to make a payable proposition out of the establishment of a woollen mill? they not think that here is demonstrated a f a r better opportunity to succeed than returned men are ever likely to have on the land ? I do not wish to' say anything with regard to' tlie Government's land settlement policy; b u t I fear there will be a lot of failures among returned soldier settlers. The principle held by the various Governments of buying out one man in order to put another on the land is most unsatisfactory, and altogether unsound. land values have appreciated from Â£ 1 to Â£ 4 an acre during the past three months, and more land has changed hands during, those three months than in the course of the previous three years. There are large areas of unalienated land in the Commonwealth. I do not know to what extent they exist in other States, but, presumably, they would be even larger than in Victoria. In our north-western mallee country there are 5,400,000 acres which have been graded as first,, second, and t h i r d class land. I have consistently advocated that this land should be given to our returned boys in living areas of, say, 640 acres of first-class land, or 1,000 acres of second, or 1,500 acres of third-class land. There are very few but who would make a success upon such, blocks. Of course, I would stipulate certain conditions, and not leave the way Â©peon for returned soldiers to leave their holdings in twelve months, or in two or three years. live on their lots for a certain time. It would be "" u p to "" the Government to furnish necessary improvements, such as good roads, railway facilities, water conservation, and the like. There is suffifor cient land in the north-western mallee areas to repatriate 5,000 men; and, as It was not good enough an outcome of their activities, the opening up of this territory would mean, within five to ten years, an increase of the wheat yield in Victoria amounting to between 40 per cent, and 50 per cent. The suit length contained The Government have oontinually cried out for increased production; the only way to bring that about is to place more men on the land. They cannot hope to look for increased production, however, by going in for a policy of buying out one man and putting in another. The thir d reason given by the Senate for disagreeing to my amendment isBecause grave financial loss to the Government and disappointment to bodies of men Do may result from the starting of enterprises which may not prove successful. I am perfectly sure that a number of the returned soldiers have been settled on the land under conditions which make it i m possible for them to hope for success. I regret to have to say that I believe we shall have a great number of failures amongst the returned men settled on the land. I w ill not say that there would be no failures under my amendment, but I believe the number would be less than In my own district, we may expect under the land settlement proposals for repatriation. In any case if we advanced a certain amount, and I have suggested Â£250, in connection w it h the building of soldiers' homes, the bricks, mortar, and machinÂ«ry would not r u n away, though a number of the men might become dissatisfied, and leave their cooperative organizations. In regard to the last reason given by the Senatef o r disagreeing to my amendment, I should like to say that the Government, by accepting the amendment in the first-place, showed that they approved of the proposal. No provision has been made for soldiers' industrial concerns. I challenge the Government to say whether any provision has been made for the proper repatriation of large numbers of men who are not skilled in different trades and callings. My main reason for submitting my amendment was to meet the case of these men.

I could mention a number of things in connection with which men co-operating might do much to develop the resources of the country. I For instance, the greasy wool now exported from Australia could be scoured here by unskilled labour. We have plenty of water, we have the wool, and I expected that the M in we have unemployed labour. All that would be necessary would be for the Government to assist returned men in different parts of the country to work co-operatively in the scouring of wool The honourable member for before it was brought to the large centres of population. In that way the Government would be doing much to settle people in the country districts. Again, if we consider the building trade, we know that great difficulty is being experienced in providing homes for returned soldiers. If returned men were allowed That branch of this Legislature to co-operate in. the building trade for the building pf soldiers' homes, a very great deal of good might be effected. If the Government were prepared to advance to me a working co-operatively Â£200 or Â£300 to buy material for the purpose, a very considerable stimulus could be given The Government would have a lien on the buildings, and practical control of the whole business.

I regret exceedingly the impression that might reasonably be conveyed! by the reference of the honourable member for Echuca to the attitude of the Government in regard to the fulfilment of their promises to our'returned soldiers. I am quite sure that that reference must 'have been made unwittingly, and that if its author had thought the matter out calmly he would never have made the suggestion which he d i d . In so far as it was possible to redeem them, the Government have f u l l y redeemed their promises to our returned soldiers. Literally, they have absolutely redeemed them. There is no country in the world which has acted more generously to its soldiers than has Australia through the medium of the Commonwealth Government. The State Governments, too, have acted similarly to the very l i m it of their resources. I admit frankly that the services of the splendid men from this country can never be adequately recognised in a material sense. But we have gone to the very uttermost of our resources in order to show our gratitude to these men. I am opposed to the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , and I ask the Committee to be guided by the reasons which have been submitted tb this Chamber by the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen). industries proposed to be established are to be subject to the approval of the Minister. all about that, and I shall deal with that phase of the matter, presently. I tell the honourable member, as I told him the other day, that I believe the Minister, on the spur of the moment, accepted the amendment because it contained some sort of a financial safeguard. I am i u entire sympathy with the object of honourable members of the Country party. I wish to place it upon a solid foundation. Thi r ty years ago I was a foundation member of what is to-day one of the strongest co-operative societies in Australia. For about twenty years it had to struggle against great difficulties, but today it is one of the best institutions of its kind in the world, because it is upon a financially sound basis. If the honourable member for Echuca wishes us to embark upon similar enterprises, why does he not seek to establish co-operative industries for our soldiers by the application to that purpose of their war gratuities? soldier's gratuity to land settlement? encouragement of land settlement and in the repatriation of our soldiers the Government have behaved handsomely. Experience has already proved that we are going to lose millions of pounds upon our scheme of land settlement for our soldiers, and that scheme rests on an infinitely sounder basis than does the establishment of co-operative industries in the way that is now proposed. In South Australia there are returned men who intend launching out on the co-operative principle to the extent of Â£250,000 by applying their war gratuities to this purpose. the honourable member for Capricornia, we should have to advance those men another Â£250,000. going to accept the lesser of two evils.

A t that time concerning his fears, because he knows I was a shearer, or shed hand, and was also casually employed on railway or other work. But I was young, with plenty of ambition, and I succeeded because I was helped. Do honourable members who are opposing the proposed new clause say that the men whom we say should benefit are not competent to be their own masters? Why should we ask them to find Â£ 1 0 0 ? We did not ask them for anything when they were going to fight for us. we asked them to subscribe. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) seems to think that co-operative undertakings of the character mentioned are not likely to bo successful. know that many who start in business f a l l by the wayside, but most of these men, if given the opportunity, will be successful. Many who have benefited largely by their experienoe abroad would prove satisfactory employers, and I do not think a large percentage would make mistakes if given the opportunity. Many of the returned soldiers who have been placed on the land in Queensland are doomed to failure because they know nothing of rura l work, and when they realize that they do not understand the business they naturally become disheartened. Certain sections of the industrial community are seeking to l i m it a week's work to forty liours, but we have to remember that men engaged in rural pursuits are in many instances endeavouring to do forty hours' work in twenty-four hours. When many men who have recently gone on the land realize that they have to work laboriously and continuously to reap any reward, they will lose heart. The honor-, able member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard 'Foster) has said that the land is always an. asset, because it cannot be removed; but every one knows that. In Queensland some years ago Mr Barlow established a group system of land settlement, and I , in common with obhers in terested, hoped that we were going to show what could be done by successful cooperation. A t the time. I was earning 9s. per day at railway work, and I placed 4s. of each day's earnings into a co-operative concern in the belief that it would succeed. The incident occurred' after the 1891 strike, and I do not quarrel w it h the honourable member for Capricornia what happened'. short of cash at the time. we are dealing with men possessing the independent spirit that most Australians have-and , thank God, they have it-w e have no occasion to fear. In connection with the Alice River settlement, to' which I am referring, the Government of which Sir Samuel Griffith was then leader helped the settlers, and in 1900, when only five settlers were l e f t , freeholds were granted', with the result that the settlers immediately disposed of their land to the highest bidder. The honourable member for Capricornia believes We that something similar w ill occur in this instance, but he must remember that there is a different feeling abroad to-day, and men know that they have to work to live. Our returned soldiers have gone through fire and water, yea, in many instances, hell itself could not have been worse, and' surely they are able to launch out now on their own account in their own country. Even supposing the proposal may mean a loss of millions, we should be prepared to give the system a trial, without which there is no chance of achieving success. Fancy asking men to put up Â£100 when all the money they possess is what they earn. The honourable member for Wakefield is afraid that men will desire to be assisted in "" wild c a t "" schemes-enterprise s that are not likely to prove profitable. Quite a number of people would say that the honourable member himself is not a success. than that. It must be remembered that no co-operative concerns can be established without the consent of the M in ister. ter is not sure, he will take the proposal before Cabinet. ministering the Act, and any doubtful schemes were submitted, I would not have any hesitation in telling the men why the Government could not give their support. as firm as the honourable member.",32,Foster No T I N A By The Senate A T The Present Time The

He has been both sympathetic and firm. He has made a lot of enemies by his firmness, b u t he has steered clear of all danger, and the public of Australia, and the soldiers particularly, should be grateful for what he has done. Knowing now what the feeling of the Committee is, I feel sure that the Minister w ill stand by the clause, and' I can imagine I hear him saying, "" Colonel, don't shoot; I will come down.""

' But , generally speaking, success or failure depends largely on management. A number of soldiers could take up milling, some devoting themselves to the finding and felling of the timber, others acting as teamsters, others working at the mill. They would have to choose one of their number to manage the concern, but there is as much intelligence among working men as among those of other classes, and, given a chance, many men would make a success out of a business of this kind. Of course, in a case where all wished to be the boss, the thing would f a i l . What better can we do than to give these men a chance?

Full significance is rarely attached to the .gradual drift of population from the country to our seaport towns, and the gradual decay of once flourishing and important country towns -Yearly during the past decade the capitals have grown at the expense of the country districts, and at the present time in two States the population of the capital is greater than that of the rest of the State. In 1918 the population of Adelaide was 235,751, and that of the rest of South Australia 210,000; and the population of Melbourne was 723,500, and that of the rest of Victoria 700,258.

157,Mr Poyntort,"I am well awareWhen the honourable member for Capricornia estimated that the cost of these co-operative concerns would probably be Â£50,000,000, an honourable member in the Country party's corner said that it would not be more than 25 per cent, of that amount-as if 25 per eent. of Â£50,000,000 was a mere bagatelle. No proposal has ever come before this Parliament involving greater danger of the waste of public moneys. Even with the reservation that I was the means of having inserted in the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) the provision to which another place has taken exception is an inducement to all those soldiers who are now settled in vai'ious occupations to give up their positions and make application to shave in the advantages bestowed by it. Very few of the honourable members who support this proposal would put their own money into a project unless they had control over it. We are here as the custodians of public money. money would the Minister put into the land settlement policy at present in force? that counts, and his final step was to sisted on the land unless he has a qualification certificate. To start with, there is an approval Board, and under the original arrangement with regard to land settlement we were very careful to get the whole of each man's experience before he went abroad. In that way we were assured that the men placed on the land would be those who had training for the occupation, but apparently no training is to be demanded from the man who asks to be financed in a co-operative concern.

Maranoa( Mr James Page) has not hesitated to say that no man could have done better than the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) has done. Has not the clause come back from' that very Minister in another place ? He is the man who most dreads this proposal. I ask the Committee to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia, because it will protect us if men are required to put their own money into these concerns. We have just listened to one of the most surprising addresses ever delivered in this Chamber. One would hardly imagine that it came from a gentleman who only last week readily accepted the proposal of tbe honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill). I have never seen such a change to the right-about. member read what I said about the proposal. much of his own the honourable gentleman may have said in a dozen speeches. It is the final step assent to the proposal, which his silence when the clause was put to the Committee signified. The Minister( Mr Poynton) has not an ounce of backbone. Last week he was doing something which to-day he says was diametrically opposed to the interests of the country and those of returned soldiers. Why has this change come about? Simply because of a cursory discussion in another place, not a heart-to-heart talk such as we have here among men who are engaged in. u practical sense in certain industries wo are desirous of helping. flections on another place in order? to be reflected on for having sent us a Bill which had to be completely overhauled and sent back to it with &n entirely new face on it.

They have already been engaged in the practical work; but are we always to keep them in subservient positions, and say that we will do nothing to help them ?

The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) has said that if this proposal were taken to any financial institution it would be turned down. Co-operative companies are nearly always dependent upon bank overdrafts to help them to carry on, and if a bank is willing to assist them they are all r i g h t ; but I was associated with one co-operative rural industry which,, just as it was on the eve of success, and because it happened to be pushing certain private persons out of business, was told by the bank, "" We will not assist you any f u r t h e r . "" Many a co-operative concern in its initial stages has been frowned out of existence by financial institutions.. [72] seems to me that a plea has been put up this afternoon for vested interests. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr. Six men may James Page) has shown very clearly The how necessary it is that we should stand by these men, and help them to provide for their own requirements. In the building . of homes for returuefl soldiers, for instance, who could better supply the timber, the bricks, and other material required than the returned soldiers themselves ? And who has a better right to supply them? If , however, we adopt the Minister's proposal, we shall deny them tliat right. According to a statement in thenewspapers to-day, we have, unfortunately, in Victoria no' less than 4,500 returned soldiers out of work. That is a disgraceI know a young fellow at Redf u l state of affairs. There may be. some who are unemployable-som e whom it is hard to fit into any position-bu t I am quite certain that they are not all unfit to take up some kind of employment.

In this amendment we are making a plea for the cooperative principle and its application to returned soldiers.

In other words, we ask the Government to say to a co-operative society of soldiers, '-' We w ill set you up with Â£2,000 worth of plant, over which we w ill hold a lien.

190,Mr Fleming (Robertson) [5.36],"members on this side have been doing as much as has any one else to help the returned soldiers. We have as much sympathy for the man who threw down his pick and shovel, and went to the war, as we have for any other soldier. Many of that type were amongst the best men who went to the war. Quite a number, by their own ability and hard work, raised themselves from the ranks to high positions in the Army. Others, however, failed, and will continue to f a i l. Every honourable member is agreed that the present Ministerf o r Repatriation) (Senator Millen) is an excellent man for the job. He is a man of wide views and broad sympathies, and of firmness and courage, and he understands the repatriation question. The Government are taunted first with having accepted this amendment, and now with opposing it, but it has been submitted to the Minister for Repatriation, who has declared that it cannot be accepted without a risk of direct failure. proposing a vote of censure upon the Minister whom everybody applauded, and who is conceded to be the best man for the job. He has told us what should be done, and I think we should respect his advice. the Minister. qualified for the job; yet it is proposed that we should tur n him down, and act in our own way regardless of what ruin may follow. Had the Minister accepted the amendment, there would have been no question as to its wisdom. We do not understand the -repatriation problem as he does, and, for that reason. I cannot support the amendment. [5.39] I can only characterize the remarks of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat as a piece of special pleading. One might have expected to hear from the honourable member some reasons or arguments against the proposed amendment, but all he told us was that we were trying to "" t u r n down "" the proposals of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), who, in his opinion, is the best man for the job that could be found in any part of the world. the other alternative was to "" t u r n down "" thousands of the Australian I m perial Force. not; all he did was to bring in the name of the Minister for the purpose of cover^: ing up the injustice proposed to be done to a great number of the men. I do not know that it is admitted that the present Minister is the best man in the world for the job. I make no reflectionon the Minister for Repatriation, but I know there has been a waste of money in connection with his Department-mone y that would have gone a long way to establish men in various industries. I understand that the annual amount paid for sustenance is something like Â£2,000,000, and that is paid ' only because men who axe willing to work cannot find avenues' of employment. This amendment affords ;an opportunity to save a great deal of this annual expenditure of Â£2,000,000 by giving the men opportunities to launch, out for themselves. I point out to the honourable member for Robertson. ( Mr. Fleming) that nothing can be done under this amendment without the approval of the Minister for Repatriation, and if that honourable gentleman is all that he is Now honourable members are claimed to be, he will be able to say yea or nay to any of the ventures proposed. vote against this amendment who have ho faith: in the Ministerf o r Repatriation. We admit that he is I have not the exalted opinion of the Minister for Repatriation that some honourable members may have; but I would hesitate to cast any such reflection on him by suggesting that, although he has the deciding voice, these ventures will be a failure. When the war ceased we heard a great deal about "" Labour's new w o r l d "" ; every newspaper had something to say on the subject; but now the war is over, and our liberties, for which our men bled and died, are won, the survivors are asked to go back into their old' avenues of employment. a common experience to hear such utterances every day; but, as the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) has said, the men are asked to return to their old grooves. The honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) is to be commended for his action. We all believe in the new world for labour, and, instead of asking the men to return to the old avenues, believe in providing fresh avenues where, they may strike out on their own account.

A great number of the returned men are engaged in vocational training in technical schools and other places, and several of these whom I have met tell me that when they do finish their training there w ill be nothing for them to do except go back into the old ways under a boss. I hope there w ill not be many honourable members found refusing the right of the men to the "" new world of labour,"" where they w ill have a chance to launch out on their own. previously discussed the advantages and disadvantages of this 'amendment. On a previous occasion the House approved of the principle involved. set out various reasons for disagreeing to this amendment, and, while the fourth of ,these is one to concern, us, jit should not shake our confidence in the principle. I suggest that a Committee be appointed to draw up a fresh clause. The one now before us is admittedly iri,a crude form , and I wonder that the draftsman should have approved of it . If . it is desirable to promote enterprises by the help. of Government advances, then, rightly, the matter 'should be the subject of special legislation. The objection of the Senate embodying that point has weight, and it is only-reasonable and proper that the clause should be amended to meet that objection. Outi n proper form , together with a statement of adequate safeguards., This House, in agreeing to the co-operative principle', did not feel for one moment that it . was opening the way to a sink in which to throw millions of money. It has been stated that the land section of repatriation has nothing to do with the matter. minent part in the repatriation of soldiers upon the land in m y State, I am-quite aware of the necessity for qualifying machinery in the legislation dealing with the subject. It was necessary for Boards to examine applicants with respect to their fitness generally to ' accept the responsibility of going upon the land and -bearing the consequential financial burden. therefore, Government should be responsible for the launching of a principle such as is involved at this moment without requiring every necessary form of secur.ty. The clause should be amplified, but I shall be greatly, surprised if honourable -members depart from their agreement with the principle as it was originally placed before them. I have not consulted the honourable member for Echuca( ME . H ill ) , but I believe that he will see the wisdom of sending on for the consideration of another place a more adequately detailed clause, which would safeguard -both returned soldiers and the country, and which would provideno opportunity for money to be wasted upon "" wild c a t "" schemes. I cannot conceive I have that either Â£50,000,000 or Â£25,000,000 is likely to be spent in the direction involved by the principle. Por example, I would not be -' prepared to entertain The Senate applications for the establishment in cooperative' businesses with 'respect to men who have already been ' properly "" ref : 1 patriated"".

' There will be very great' disappointment in the country, and -particularly 'among returned soldiers,...if'^.the .principle ofi-cor operation as applied ' to the t'ask'r .of v repatriation is rejected.

At present every man is required to possess a qualifying certificate before he can take up land, and it will be just as necessary for a man to hold a qualifying certificate when seeking to enter into a co-operative concern.

Every returned man, in whatever business may be established, should understand that' he is. to be regarded as a working partner, and under an obligation to the Government for a certain proportion of the money laid out, just as sums are being returned to the State Governments to-day with regard to land settlement. I trust the Government will take this opportunity-bein g one of the best ever provided-of establishing new industries throughout Australia. There is any amount of room and necessity for them. Honourable members need not be afraid of money being lavishly poured out. . The merits and qualifications of every applicant should be gone into, and I feel confident that there would be far from"" a rush of returned soldiers seeking to be repatriated along these lines. The honourable' member for Wimmera( Mr this afternoon. Stewart) referred, to saw-milling plants.

The Government today have .nosecurity for the Â£625 lent to the States for each man settled on the r&kd. and stock ? ties of the State Governments, and not pf the Federal authority. There are failures in every avenue of business. Some of our returned men have failed, or will fail, in their efforts upon the land. The fact that there are likely to be a few failures among those who may be set up in co-operative enterprises should not be regarded as an argument against the principle. trial. Take the proposition of establishing men with saw-milling plants of their own. for the building of war service homes involving.millions of feet of timber. There are'. any number of men who are quite capable of .starting themselves successfully with, saw-milling plants in various parts of the country In my 'own. district"" there are returned soldiers working in mills fo'r other parties', who could be just as well making profits for themselves along the same lines.

Honourable members will be prepared, I feel sure, to assist the Government in creating the necessary legal macliinery to'insure -that the right class of men are launched in co-oiterative projects. | 6.6] -It is quite evident that this proposal .has' been ill-considered, and that honourable members are . supporting it from widely different motives. The proposition has not been given that careful thought which should be brought to bear 'upon any project contemplating the raising of from Â£10,000,000 to Â£25,000,000.: will do that. judging by. remarks which I have heard There are more than' 300,000 returned men in Australia. If the proposal in its present form is to be applicable to every one of those men-and > if it were not I would not be prepared to support it-then , undoubtedly there will be many millions involved. I knowof ho reason why a returned soldier should be enabled to come under a scheme such as this merely because he proposes to start a woollen mill in some decaying Victorian town which, itself, could not launch an industry of the same character without assistance from public money. It has been stated, during the course of debate, that there are numbers of decaying towns, and that if only industries were started, by individuals-n o doubt, with more money than sense-it would be a good thing for those towns.

There is. an excellent opportunit y here for honorable members to give apractical illustration -of their faith in the principle of co-operation I am perfectly certain thathonorable members of each of the parties in this House have the interests of returned soldiers at heart, and desire at the same time to conserve the interests of the Commonwealth. I am satisfied also that honourable members are all interested in the 'establishment of new industries wherever practicable and possible I -should like to say that, although I ' dp not believe that the Minister (Senator Millen) is infallible, I ' do believe that he has genuinely the interests of the returned soldiers at heart; he has more experience of the practical work of repatriation than any other man; and I have always found him to be a keen, practical business man. M v suggestionis that a representative of each.party in this House should meet the Ministerf or Repatriation, and discuss with him the whole question of co-operation for the benefit of returned soldiers. They might see whether, in co-operation with the Minister, it would not be possible to formulate a scheme that would find acceptance at the hands of every member of ' this Committee. I do not see why that should not be possible. If that suggestion is not adopted, I must say that I am strongly in favour of the alternative amendment proposed by the honourable member for* Capricornia ( Mr. Higgs). I have little faith in the success of co-operative ventures controlled hy in experienced men, and in the interests of the Commonwealth, if a proposal of this kind is to be adopted, some guarantee of the bonafides of the co-operators to beassisted should be required, and they might well be asked to put down Â£ 1 for every Â£ 1 advanced to 'them by the Government. ber think that a man cannot be qualified to take part in a co-operative enterprise unless he has a few pound* in his pocket ? perience has taught me that not one man in a hundred is capable of running a business successfully.

But I ; nevertheless, ""wish to emphasize the suggestion which I have already made. The question is an exceed-ingly important one, becausethere are great possibilities for good in the cooperative movement. Tlie movement is one which may confer decided advantages -upon our returned soldiers. Why, then, should we not meet together and discuss the matter in a friendly way? As one who is accustomed to get to the seat of any disease at-the-earliest possible moment, I confess that I am becoming bewildered by the forms of parliamentary procedure just before the suspension of the sitting for dinner.",45,Tempora Ry Chairman Trary Regulation Of The Repatriation De

With that object in view I interviewed the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) Bill, it empowers the Commission to do everything, even without this proposition. exercised by the Commission will depend the value of that body to the community and to the soldiers themselves. If the Commission is not to have the powers which the Minister says, it possesses, it will not be worth much.

If it is to be a useful body it will need to be absolutely independent of political control. .last Eriday because I considered that if it is to be a plenary Commission, it should New South Wales has been over-valued ? be vested with all these powers, whilst if it is not to be a plenary Commission it will riot be worth much. BeforeI conclude, I would like to deal witli a few of the matters mentioned -by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) in the comparison which he instituted between the settlement of our returned soldiers upon the land and the points raised by the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) . I was rather astonished to hear him preface his remarks with the confession that, to a considerable extent, the attempted settlement of our soldiers upon the land had been a failure. He then went on to suggest that the adoption of any proposal based upon similar Jines would only bo inviting failure. But those of our returned soldiers who desire to settle upon the land number only a few thousands, whilst those who wish'to engage in other occupations number hundreds of thousands. There should be no invidious distinction drawn between these two classes. The returned soldiers of New South Wales are allowed to purchase land up to a value of Â£3,000, and there is no denying that this fact has considerably enhanced the value of farm properties in that State. At first, an applicant was required to deposit 6 per cent, upon the total value of his purchase before he was permitted to secure the land. But some fifteen or eighteen months ago the Minister for Lands in New South Wales abrogated that provision, so that to-day the' whole amount is advanced' to the soldier to enable him to purchase his land. In addition, he is entitled to a grant of Â£625 to enable him to secure a house, stock, and implements. It is well known that in the great majority of cases settled in New South Wales has been considerably over-valued. The local Repatriation Committees have regarded the The amendment does claims of our soldier applicants with more favour than 'they would have done If the Commission under normal conditions. As a result men have been ..settled upon land which is not worth by hundreds .of pounds the money that has been paid for it. Of .course} that is no argument in favour of making' a worse deal. I voted as I did does not say that the bulk of the land upon which soldiers have been settled in of it has. In several instances big estates have been purchased by the .Government at exorbitant prices. These estates have been subdivided for the purpose of soldier settlement. Before the men have entered into possession of their blocks, the Minister himself has admitted that the land has been purchased at too high a -price, and has reduced the valuation of it to the soldier purchasers. In that way a dead loss of Â£ 3 or Â£4 per acre has been sustained by the State. There is one settlement, of which I have some knowledge, which is to be devoted to the cultivation of prune trees. In that case provision has been made that for seven years a certain amount of sustenance will be paid to the soldier settlers until the prune trees come into bearing. In such circumstances it seems only right that soldiers who wish to enter into our secondary industries should receive at least equal, or",46,Tempora Ry Chairman Trary Regulation Of The Repatriation De

Let. us suppose that a saw-mill is for sale-not saw-mill which is a "".wilderness of machinery,"" as we have been told. As a matter of fact, despite the statement of the Minister for. Repatriation to the contrary, asaw-inill is usually distinguished by the comparative absence from it of machinery. I admit that there is often a wilderness of tramways leading into the bush. L e t us assume that a sawm ill is worth Â£1,200. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. vocate the establishment of any secondary industries without adequate security, but I am endeavouring to show that the proposal, as presented by'.the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), does not furnish a. sufficiently liberal margin for co-operative undertakings by soldiers who may desire to enter bhis field of business activity. In connection with the establishment of saw-mills, I have in mind ii case, which came under my own observation, of three soldiers who were able to muster about Â£200 or Â£300 between them, but could not purchase outright, as they were unable to find a deposit equal to half the value of the mill, which was about Â£1,200. I am satisfied from, my own experience of these men that the venture was a thoroughly profitable proposition, and would have given a return of about Â£ 5 per day. I believe the margin of security should be such as to enable men to engage in co-operative undertakings of this nature, and carry them through successfully, without being worried by the fact that tlieir working capital is hopelessly inadequate. proposal will provide this safeguard for the soldier. The honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) has told us that his only wish is to consult the soldiers' interests. But if I understood the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) aright, the purpose of the new Tariff is to decentralize industry. I do not know of any proposition calculated to do this more effectively than the proposal submitted by the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) . another phase of the question with which I should like to deal. This scheme will permit of returned soldiers engaging in occupations of a nature different from those with which jthey' were associated prior to the war. Under the present a repatriation scheme the men have only the right to apply for assistance if they wish to engage in a business with which they were connected prionto enlistment. Every country member can give instances of men whose earlier business undertakings were not remarkably successful, and who only found their real avocation during the war. I know of many men, formerly blacksmiths and engineers, who,, since their return, have become very successful saw-mill owners. Erom a. business point of view they have I would not adnever looked hack. These men did not find their real job until the multifarious activities of the war disclosed their capabilities. They -have come back, and it is now only f a i r that Government assistance should be available to enable them to undertake those business enterprises which are more attractive to them, and for which they may be more fitted. .1 desire to refer briefly to the reasons furnished by another place for disagreeing with the amendment made by the House of Representatives. The first statesBecausei t is not considered equitable to extend to collective bodies of soldiers benefits for which individual soldiers might not be eligible. If there is one blot on the Repatriation Acti t is the provision that even individual men are not eligible for positions which they did not fillprior 'to the war. I know of one man who had half-finished his tailoring apprenticeship before enlistment, but the Repatriation Department demurred at his request for assistance The original to become a cutter, so that he could set up in business for himself, the objection being that he was not following his pre-war occupation. If the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Echuca is incorporated in the B ill , there w ill be provision enabling bodies of men to engage in occupations with which, as individuals, they were not connected before the war, and thus a substantial benefit w ill bo conferred upon our returned soldiers and the country. It has There is been stated that men w ill be rushing into these co-operative enterprises, but if our soldiers are properly repatriatedI take it that is the desire of this P a r l i a m e n t it would be remarkable if those who are",47,Tempora Ry Chairman Trary Regulation Of The Repatriation De
245,Dr. Earlepage,"satisfactorily placed evince a desire to venture into co-operative undertakings which one honourable member has described as wild-cat schemes. As the dividends of co-operative concerns would be paltry in comparison w it h the financial returns of men satisfactorily repatriated it is unthinkable that they would relinquish their businesses or .positions to take up these other occupations. matter of fact, the men who w ill engage in co-operative enterprises w ill be those who at last see a chance of making good. There are many thousands of men who at present appear to be misfits. I know a' Victoria' Cross winner in my owii electorate, a man who for the last three years has not been doing much good because he has not found his proper niche in civil life. It is therefore the duty of this Parliament and the Government to devise schemes to enable such men to become useful citizens and a benefit to the Commonwealth. The third reason given by the Senate is startlingBecause grave-financial loss to tlie Governprovision specifically in the measure. ment and disappointment to bodies of men may result from tbe. starting of enterprises which may not prove successful. Now, we have been told that the Commissioners should have a tenure of five years, so that the Government may reasonably expect to get capable menwhose value would be unquestionable, and capacity extraordinary. now learn, on the authority of the M in ister for Bepatriation (Senator Millen) that Parliament would not be able te trust the Commissionersto give permission for tlie establishment of co-operative enterprises by returned soldiers. for fear that their non-success would occasion "" g r a ve financial loss to-the Government, and disappointment to bodies of men.""' The argument is absurd. better drop the B ill altogether. declare, that the Commissioners would be able to do their work satisfactorily. Finally, we are told that another reason for disagreeing to the amendment isBecause if it is desirable to promote enterprises by means of Government advances, the proposal should be the subject of special legislation. . . . Apparently, then,' the acceptance by the Government, of the amendment by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) to give Â£1 for Â£ 1 sub-, sidy removes this fourth objectionCan anybody believe that the Government are serious in this matter? The proposal introduced by the honourable member for Echuca, was almost unanimously accepted by honourable members, but it appears that, because it came from the Country party, it cannot . be adopted in its, entirety by the GovernAs a ment, and there,' is now an attempt to stultif y the whole position. the Government are opposing the original proposition, the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) said, 'by way of interjection this afternoon, that the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) already has power to do what is asked. being put into the Bill?

To put it in other words, we advance the man on the land ten ' times as much as it is suggested will be enough for men to start in these Government had industries. It is only advanced, and the security in one case is just as good asi n the other.

Had tlie measure come before the House three years ago, when the war was in progress, not one member would have objected to this proposal; but some members would now say to men who, as soldiers, covered themselves with honour, and acquitted themselves on active service in a way that has never been surpassed: "" If when you enlisted you were employed at a mill or in a mine, you must go back to that employment."" We have no right to require that of men who made good. The returned soldiers who took up the weaving of cloth, making what is known as ANZAC tweed, have done well, and would have done a great deal better had they been given a fair run; and is there anything that would be more advantageous to the men themselyes, or to the country, than the formation of small co-operative concerns by returned soldiers? It is to .the credit of the Government and of Parliament that the returned' man who when he enlisted was a farm labourer has been given a chance to acquire a farm of his own, and it would be unjust if we refused to give like opportunities to men who formerly were mill hands or miners. I ask the Committee to insist on its amendment. The clause to which the Senate objects was agreed to without a division, and no good reason has been given to us for reversing our decision regarding it . It would be absurd to entrust the Minister for Repatriation and the Commission with the expenditure of scores of millions of pound's in other directions and to say that they cannot be trusted to study the interests of the community in the granting of assistance to cotowards co-operative effort was when Mr operative bodies of returned men. I never thought it would be necessary in any Parliament in Australia to use an argument to defend co-operative effort, or that I would ever hear it said by Government supporters that the man who lives in a town and follows a trade is not fit to be trusted or helped to the same extent as a man on the land. If the Government's idea is to take men from the cities, I would say to them, "" Let. them go into country centres and start co[73] operative establishments."" If a Minister would go through the Red Cross handweaving factory in Sydney, he would be a better. man for his experience, and would have greater confidence in his fellow men. Only this afternoon I have received samples of the workmanship in that factory. .Sworn evidence says that the tweeds turned out here are more than the equal of those which come from Europe. The price is 15s. per yard double width, with an extra charge of Is. 6d. per yard for cloth in which what are known as solid dyes are used. It is made wholly from worsted. If those engaged in the hand-weaving industry in Victoria had had only half, the chance of those who are turning out such fine cloth in Sydney, they would have made their establishment a success also. Mr Frood, who has contradicted some statements in the report read by the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) the other night, has just returned from Sydney saying that he was never more delighted in his life than when he inspected the Sydney factory, where there are fifty men employed, each earning up to Â£5 5s. a week. They are not treated as the Repatriation Department treated the Melbourne men by deducting their paltry pension from their earnings. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Atkinson) -Does the honourable member intend to connect his remarks with the amendment? the Government to give returned soldiers in Melbourne the same chance of making good that returned soldiers in Sydney have. The amendment calls upon men who have risked their lives to put up Â£1 for Â£1. The only experience I have had of a Government giving Â£1 for Â£1 McColl, the then Victorian Minister of Mines, subsidized on the Â£1 for Â£1 basis men who were prepared to go fossicking about the gold-fields, and the amount of gold gained certainly justified the action taken during that extremely ill period of unemployment in Victoriaj but out of some hundreds who went out on that search, .the average amount put up was about Â£6.

A man can start with a selection before he gets a station. from the arguments which have been put forward to-day, it seems that the object which the honourable member for Echuca had in view in securing the insertion of this clause was to provide employment for a maximum number of returned soldiers. It would be absolutely impossible in the circumstances for the Government to consider any proposition of the kind. I propose to explain what is being done by returned soldiers in my electorate at the present time. a capital of Â£100,000, employs 500 hands. The honourable member has cited an extreme case. mill where, perhaps, the employees work under better conditions than do those at Ballarat. The returned soldiers in Geelong and the surrounding district recognise that the f u t u r e of Australia depends, not only upon the primary industries, but -also upon, the secondary industries -They met together, and having, as intelligent men, reasoned the matter out, they put before the soldiers of Victoria a proposition for the establishment of a woollen mill on a. co-operative basis in Geelong. The shares held by any one man are limited to five at Â£ 2 0 each, and the majority of soldiers are. paying for their shares with their gratuity bonds. If the men in the Corio district are able to do that, what is to prevent men ""in other parts of the Commonwealh coThe operating similarly?

That is the outstanding feature of the debate to-day. Undoubtedly; but We have .before us an amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) upon a proposition by the honourable member for Echuca that the Government should give financial assistance to a system of co-operatidn amongst soldiers.

289,The Honourable Mr Anstey (Bourke) [ 9 . 3 ],"It isearlier had heen abhorrent to him, but because he found that the numbers were against him. Again, we see how numbers count, and how they dictate principles. The amendment having been carried here, it was sent to another place, and, on the recommendation of a representative of the Government, was turned down. Four grounds for its rejection were given: Firstly, that we could not give to ten men what was notbeing given to one, and therefore we should not give anything to anybody; secondly, that we should not settle any soldiers, because it would unsettle them; thirdly, that we should not support any enterprise, or, indeed, anything at all, because it would probably be unsuccessful. Of course, if it would be unsuccessful, we could not do anything; and therefore the whole scheme of repatriation should go by the board. We should not give a man anything, because if we gave him, say, a horse and cart to carry on his industry, he might be unsuccessful, and the money would be wasted. So why do anything? Fourthly, that, after the principle had -been condemned and rejected, if it had any excellence in it at all, the proposal should be embodied in another Bill. Thus the rejected amendment comes back to this Chamber, where the Government moves that it be set aside. Then comes the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) with another amendment, which is a whittling down of the original proposition. The honourable member for Echuca proposed that, instead of soldiers individually receiving Â£500 each for their repatriation, to buy a horse or cart, amendment do? Honourable members opor start in a business in which they might fail, or to settle on the land, we should be prepared to treat with any number of them as a collective body, and give to them as such a lump sum of money representing the total of what each man could have claimed as an individual. What does it matter, if we are dealing with half-a-dozen individuals, whether the Government advance Â£500 to each of them or to say to them as a body: ""If you care to engage in any industry or occupation together, the money tliat should be advanced to you individually will be advanced to you as a corporation? But the Government say ""No"" to that proposal. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) then proposes that if the Government will not go the whole hog, they shall have Mr Anstey. power to at . least subsidize .any cooperative enterprise to the extent of Â£1 for Â£1 of the amount subscribed by those engaged in it. What do the Government do then? Do they say that they cannot accept that amendment, and the principle it embpdies? Do they denounce it for the four reasons for which another place rejected the major proposition? Not at all. Yet there is no argument against the major proposition which is not equally applicable to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia. If the original scheme might involve failures, might unsettle men, and might be a waste of funds, and if the principle which the Minister for Repatriation denounced in another place should be embodied in another Bill, on what grounds do the Government consent to embodying in this measure the same principle which they said was an absurdity and would lead to failure? Driven by the force of numbers, and seeing the possibility of whittling away the amendment moved by the honourable member for Echuca., they accept the alternative put forward by the honourable member for Capricornia, and propose to embody in the Bill the same principles and the same objections as led to the rejection of the original amendment. Andi f the amendment be insisted upon, it is quite true, as has been said by the honourable member for Corio( Mr. Lister), that the Minister will have absolute power to say whether these advances shall or shall not be made. That argument being valid, what harm can the posite say that they know the Minister; that they can rely upon him; and that, holding the opinion he does, he would not give any assistance in the terms of this amendment. If that be true, not only the amendment, bub the original proposition, may be accepted with safety, for the reason that the Minister might make it a dead letter. What, then, is the objection, to the amendment? new clause in the Bill, and cause disappointment and delay to the men who put in applications? disappointment and delay but. the man who has the administration of the Act? As has already been said, if this proposal is incorporated in the Bill, and a Minister dares to repudiate the .decision of Par-",55,Tempora Ry Chairman Trary Regulation Of The Repatriation De
290,Mr Listek,Why incorporate this,56,Tempora Ry Chairman Trary Regulation Of The Repatriation De
291,Mr Anstey,"Who will create theliament, the responsibility will rest on him; Parliament at least will have done its duty. We have heard much about the fear of non-success under a clause such as that proposed, but if we had judged all repatriation cases on their merits and asked whether each was likely to be a Success or not, repatriation would not have been advanced at all, for probably thousands would have been judged on the possibility of non-success."" The money for repatriation has been advanced, I take it, on the ground of justice. Hundreds of men have, unfortunately, been unsuccessf ul in their enterprises, but, on the other band, thousands have heen successful. It may be quite true .that under this new clause a few would be unsuccessful, but some good would be achieved, at least, if a certain section of the men were successful, and a number of industries established throughout the country, with the workers, as proprietors and shareholders, bound to do part of the work and to carry part of the responsibility. That, in itself, would demonstrate to every man that he was not merely a workman drawing wages paid by another, but that he could exist by his own enterprise, activity, and thrift. It would, I repeat, be good work to develop a class of men capable of carrying on their own businesses. However, the whole position is largely farcical. Eveni f it were likely, as has been said, that the Minister for Eepatriation would make the clause a dead letter, I cannot see why tbe Government cannot accept it now. There is no stronger condemnation of the Government than its present absurd position. I could have understood the Government saying that they could not accept the proposal, but it is surely ignominious on their part, after saying they could not accept one proposal, to accept another, the same in principle, and against which the same arguments can be applied. I propose to vote for the retention of the new clause agreed to before on the motion of the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , but I do this with no ill feeliug against the Government. At this crisis, in view of the advent of a very important immigrant whom we are to presently welcome to our shores, I do not wish to offend or embarrass the. Government in any way; the idea of a double dissolution is disconcerting-even to me.. But, surely, in spite of the coming of His Royal Highness ..the Prince of Wales, and the risk of the loss of their salaried positions, the Government might, for one night at least, stand on some ground of principle-no t permanently, but just for a little while. An honourable member near me suggests that the principle of L.S.D. is the most important one; and I cannot ask the Government to cast such a principle to the winds. I would not do so myself; hut, at the same time, I think the Governmentj in their own interest, ought to take some solid stand. If the Government objected to the clause and the amendment on the self-same grounds-'that , if either were carried into effect, it would unsettle people, would be likely to prove unsatisfactory, and that this is not the measure in which to embody a principle of this character-an y man could understand the position, though he might not agree with them. Eor my part, I shall vote for the new clause, but without any great hope that the Government will he overthrown. [9.15] I am sorry that the one ""baa lamb,"" which promised to be of some use in repatriation, should have been shorn of the short wool it had when it first left this House. Why do the Government object, to this proposal, and why are the returned soldiers on the Government side going to vote against it? Have they been ""nobbled,"" or do they still desire to go about the' country howling that every man should be sacked from his position who did not go to the war? Are they still going to say that old men should be put out of positions ihey have occupied for -years in favour of returned men-ol d men whose sons went to the Front, while others were put in their jobs at home? Or will they, on the other hand, seek to repatriate our men in a civilized way? If the latter, an opportunity is now presented. The other day the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) moved the adjournment of the House in order to request that some girls should be sacked in Sydney, and returned soldiers put in their places; and on that occasion the Government explained the whole position away. Their proposal was that all skulkers, even if they could not pass the examinations to entitle them to go to the .Front, should be discharged, and returned soldiers put in their places. We now have proposed a comprehensive system* of employing",56,Tempora Ry Chairman Trary Regulation Of The Repatriation De
292,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"soldiers without putting girls and old and invalid men out of work. Do the returned soldiers opposite desire to find work for returned soldiers? Do they believe that it is fair to place a "" digger"" on the land, and give him a chance to make good, and refuse a man in the city a 'similar chance? One of the most surprising arguments was used by the honourable member for Grampians . ( Mr ment it will be leaving positions open for Jowett), who had the infernal impudence to suggest that no soldier in the city should be able to avail himself of such a clause as this. member would compel a man to go to the soldiers will be in the minority; and they country whether he liked to do so or not, cannot expect a fair deal then if they do or forfeit his right to any assistance.

The amendment I wish to move is not my own, but. is, as I have said, the suggestion of the honourable member for Fawkner, that a member of each party in this House should consult with the Minister for Repatriation and frame a clause for insertion in this Bill to assist in the repatriation of returned soldiers under the co-operative system which would meet with the approval of honourable members generally. Will the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) stand up to such a proposal, because I have no desire to steal his thunder ? If he is prepared to carry out the intention which he has already expressed, I sh.aH not move in that direction. His suggestion, I think, is a fair one, and one which the Government should accept. It was because several amendments were before the Committee that, earlier in the day, I was induced to suggest that they should be left in abeyance, and that meanwhile a representative of each party in this Chamber should consult with the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), for the purpose of formulating some scheme of co-operation which would achieve the end we all have in viewnamely, that pf advancing the interests of our returned soldiers. However much we may differ in regard to the methods which should be employed to give effect to such a scheme, honourable members are unanimous in desiring to secure that objective. how the honourable member can say tliat in view of the last vote. ber is drawing on his imagination. I believe that honourable members aim at conserving the interests of the country, and do not desire to engage in any indefinite scheme. Thev wish to secure something tangible and practicable, and if I shall be in order in so doing, I shall move for the appointment of a Committee such as I have indicated, to confer with the Minister for Repatriation, with a view to devising some practicable scheme which will meet with the approval of all parties in this Chamber. all that the Committee has done is to carry the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs). It is quite competent for us to insert any words that we, may choose after the word ""enterprises."" We may, for example, insert the words, "" such enterprises shall be started in country districts."" The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Atkinson) -If any words are inserted, they will require to be inserted after the word "" repayable."" to the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia may be made. The Government are very "" cocky"" just now. A bridge has been built for them by an honourable member which allowed them to escape from an awkward dilemma. It is by no means the first bridge of the kind that has been constructed, and it will not be tFe last. built on the co-operative plan.

But it is clear that he either had an opportunity of hearing Senator Millen's speech or that he thought on exactly similar lines. quite possible, however, for any honourable member to move an amendment in the form suggested by_ the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) or the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) to add to the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia. in the proposal put. forward by the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) was a definite one Personally, I have already objected to differential treatment as between those soldiers who settle upon the land and those who follow factory occupations, in which they are not finding the new industrial world of which we have heard so much. 1 move That the following words be added to the words added to the main question :"" Such industries and enterprises mentioned in subclause 1 of clause 47A to be established in country districts and country towns.""

The whole object of the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) and of this amendment is to enable every returned soldier to take advantage of co-operative enterprises. Believing as I do that if these industries are established in country towns and dis[74 ] tricts they w ill assist our soldiers very much more than would otherwise be the I read Senator Mitten's case, I desire to see the B ill altered in that direction.

The honourable member for Wakefield knows of this d r if t , but is he so acting as to check it ?. I wish to i m press upon honourable members the fact that in two States of the Commonwealth -Victori a ' and South Australia-the population of the capital cities is greater than that in the whole of the remainder of these States. In Victoria the population of Melbourne is 723,000 and' in the rest of the State only 707,000; and in South Australia, the population of Adelaidei n 1918 was .235,000, as compared with 210,000 in the rest of the State This deplorable d r if t of populaM y object is rather to assist tion has reached such aggravated proportions that it is now almost impossible to find houses' in the cities.

In a large number of cases, if they have children, they are unable to get a house. member can point to one country town in Australia where a similar question is asked. Every one knows that everything possible should be done to arrest this d r if t of population. The problem should bo tackled, not only on general principles, but in detail, and so far as I am concerned any B ill containing a provision that will have the effect of dragging population away from the-country to the cities will meet with my strongest opposition. old friend of mine once reminded me that ou one occasion Wellington agreed that there was wisdom in retreat. I think the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) had better Tetreat, for the simple reason that on this occasion he is going to he defeated. Great as is my objection to the Government, and anxiety to displace them, I am certainly not going to follow the honourable member for Grampians oni this occasion, because he seeks to put a limitation upon the operation of the amendment so that, even if it were carried,, it would be valueless. anyhow. matters except that we shall have a number of conversations across the chamber. of time. 'what we are here for. Our business is to talk. The work is not done here, but -elsewhere. If the original proposal had any good in it at all, it would have been wrong to l i m it its operation to any part of the country, or any part of Australia. In order to buttress his position, the honourable member for Grampians makes an allegation that the policy of Governments in the past has had the effect of dragging population away from country districts, and he contends t h at the position will be restored by , the encouragement of these co-operative enterprises in country districts only. Victoria is concerned, his argument is of no value. The trend of population in Victoria towards the cities is due; in part, to the decay of the mining in .dustry. work forty hours in the city, while we work eighty hours in tlie country disN o ^honourable tricts. tage of the cities. ber w ill pardon me, I will remind h im that his statement does not explain the d r if t of population in South Australia. It is not due in that State to the decay of the mining industry. the honourable member for Grampians. But I said tliat the decay of the mining industry was one reason for the d r if t of population to the metropolitan area. The decay of mining in this State has l e f t desolate large areas of land which are -not fit for agricultural operations. cline of mining, is bigger than ever. the argument used by the honourable member for Grampians. It does not disprove what I said. Small as the Country party is, it seems to be divided on great questions. In any case, apart from Ballarat and its population, we have not merely to deal w i th such places, and say that the country is dead, and that the cities are is no good now, drawing away thousands .of men. ' It is a question of the country being and nothing developed on a larger scale, and machinery being employed for agricultural purposes.

It is one of thedo not wish to occupy time by referring to other States, but to confine my remarks to Victoria, where, in the Western District, those on the land have given up farming to engage in sheep raising. The Wimmera district is also an illustration, and the statistics of the municipalities show there has been a gradual decline in the population, and that where ten or twelve farms existed, only one now remains. Through a process of absorption, adjoining properties have been acquired, and larger areas have been worked with the aid of machinery to enable wheat growing to be undertaken more successfully. In the district represented by the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) the small holdings of forty years ago were being worked as pastoral propositions, but they are now coming hack into small holdings under the Closer Settlement Act. Why do manufacturers congregate in cities where men are packed together when they can go out into country districts where, in many instances, they find the workmen disorganized, receiving lower wages, and working longer hours? question of water supply and motive power, the transportation of coal, and the handling of their products? These are factors which all manufacturers consider in connection with country districts. One farmer buys out another until he has a larger area under control, when he employs machinery to do the work, and the men who were employed on farms drift towards the city and make machinery used by the man working the larger holding. The population drifts from one place to another, and it is the economic result of the conditions under which we live. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has moved an amendment, and I agree with the honliams) that there is very little in it. What does the amendment as originally submitted or as amended by the honourable member for Grampians really mean? If ,the statement of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) is true, the Minister will have the power, if he so desires, to be hostile. The amendment of the honourable member for Grampians places too much power in the Minister's hands. For instance, it may be said that an industry to be established in Toorak or St. Bulda is likely to be profitable, although it may be unreasonable to advance, say, Â£10,000 of public money in a country district. It is giving the Minister power to say whether a particular industry should or should not be established in a country district. If there were a dozen men willing to subscribe pound for pound, and a business could be successfully carried on in Melbourne, and not in the country, the Minister would be prevented from giving approval. I certainly cannot support the amendment of the honourable member for -Grampians, and I think he will be well advised to withdraw it, and allow the original proposition to stand. I have listened with interest to the dissertation of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) regarding the congregation in big centres, and the only thing that is wrong with the statement of the honourable member is that it is not quite true. He has given reasons why manufactures and population congregate in the cities, but what are the Is it not all-a facts? Why do our principal cities increase in size? I know that the circumstances credited to Melbourne by the honourable member do not apply to Sydney. Why has Sydney iacreased in size? During the whole period of responsible government in New South Wales up till 1913, five-sixths of the money borrowed in that State, with the exclusion of that spent on railway work, was spent in and around Sydney for local purposes, which should have heen undertaken hy a Greater Sydney. Manufacturers congregate there because it is not made profitable to haul coal to the country where the raw material is, and hecause differential railway rates are imposed on' a railway system designed to kill secondary industries in the country. I do not know what has happened in Victoria, but that is the experience of New South Wales, and great cities have grown up in consequence of the disproportionate amount of public money that has heen spent. We have .been told that in England, France, Germany, and the United States of America, in the interests of the nations as a whole, manufactories are being decentralized, and this is being done largely because electric power is now able to be cheaply transmitted to outside centres. As the Minister for Trade",62,Paibs
352,Orable Member For Franklin ( Mr Mcwil,,63,Paibs
353,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [10.5],"and Customs( Mr Greene) said when introducing the. Tariff, there is no reason why manufacturers here should congregate in the large cities, where workmen have to grow up with dirt and coaldust in their lungs, and, in consequence, rear children who are physically unfit. There is no reason, under modern conditions, why industries should not be established where the raw products exist so that men could live in decent homes and in comfortable surroundings. men are allowed to work in country districts with attractive surroundings, we shall be able to rear men possessing the best characteristics of our Australian soldiers, and, in the next war, we shall not have men such as those who came from crowded centres like Shoreditchmen whose chest you could span with two fingers, though their spirit was indomitable. merely our returned soldiers by 'assisting them to conduct secondary industries with co-operative effort, but to benefit also the neighbourhoods in which those industries will be established by bringing to them the comforts which now attract our population to the cities. present time there is hardly a country town in New South ""Wales that possesses modern Inverell, Lismore, and Grafton, which are surrounded by prosperous districts having a production almost equalling .that of Victoria, have hardly increased in size in twenty-five years, because no secondary industries there. take advantage of this opportunity to make a practical step towards decentralization. leagues everywhere. was' reported as meeting in Melbourne only on Saturday last, and there is now an opportunity to give effect to decentralization.

I trust that honorahle members will not be swayed by local prejudice and parochial feeling, but will take this opportunity of giving a national direction to the industrial life of this Commonwealth. If [10.13] I am now able to make those comments on the proposal of the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) which I could not make earlier in the discussion, and I am glad that my speech has been deferred, because the position now is clearer than when I sought to address the Committee before. The soldier, it appears, is unwilling to go into those places where the honourable Our desire is to benefit not member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) and the honorahle member for Grampians wish to put him, and therefore he is to be compelled to go there. He is to be denied the assistance which a little while ago we were told would be the salvation of unemployed men, unless At the he is prepared to pursue his industry in the decaying country towns of Victoria. We have been told that it is the long conveniences. Towns likehours, the low wages, the hard conditions of country life, coupled with high freights and other disadvantages, that drive the people into our cities, and yet the honourable member for Grampians would force the soldier to accept are established those hard conditions or forego the I hope that the Committee will assistance of the Government. The object of the proposal is to build up the decaying towns of Victoria, and the We have decentralization soldier is to undertake this work. I obA Victorian league ject to that. OUT repatriation efforts should study first the interests of the soldier. If he wants to go to country towns, hy all means let us help him to do so, but if he does not, he has the same right to assistance in a city occupation .It will imas he would have to assistance in a country occupation. Those who talk about the need for populating the country districts do not live in the country; they live in the city. The farmers, too, when they have ""done their bit,"" and are able to retire, come to the cities; and one of the causes of the decay""of the farming industry is that so many farmers have 'become city-dwelling landlords. 1",63,Paibs

I object to those who, accepting the comforts of the city, attribute the ills of society to tbe fact that other persons seek the pleasures which they themselves enjoy. Bourke( Mr Anstey) has accurately described the causes which draw men fro m the country to the city. to be overcome by any such proposal as that now before us The future of the dwellers in cities is to be secured by improving sanitation, abolishing slums, and making the cities habitable, so that the physique of . their people may be as good as that of the young men whom we sent to the war.

I agree that something will need to be done soon to relieve the industrial arbitration congestion, or we had better give up the ghost. The fundamental basic reason for these delays is that we have not an arbitration Court, but a law Court. Instead of the Court giving decisions by and large, and adjudging what is a fair thing as between arbitrators, matters are argued as if lives ware at stake.
