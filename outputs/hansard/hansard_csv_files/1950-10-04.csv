MB. C. -W. FEOST. ter a question that arises from the answer zation ? that he supplied yesterday to a question that I had asked earlier concerning the cancellation of the appointment of the former High Commissioner for Ceylon, Mr 0. ""W. Frost. In the answer that he submitted yesterday as the acting ministerial head of the Department of External Affairs, the right honourable gentleman said, in substance, that Mr Frost, having insisted upon his claims, is to be paid by the Government the full amount of the salary for the remainder of his term of office, which was to expire in 1952. He also referred to some objection that had been taken during the life of the previous Parliament by the Opposition of that time to the appointment of Mr Frost. Can the Prime Minister now inform the House whether Mr Frost's appointment was terminated because he had not performed his duties as High Commissioner for Ceylon properly? If that was not the reason for the cancellation of the appointment under conditions which have involved the country in such a large expenditure of money for work not performed, but willing to be performed, by Mr Frost, what was the reason for it? honourable member for Barton that nothing is to be gained by initiating an argument on a matter of this kind. I have nothing to add to what appeared in the answer that I gave yesterday. of the Postmaster-General been drawn to the large number of telegrams that have been forwarded recently to senators and to members of this House over the signature "" Ruralaust"" and couched iu threatening language ?

4,Mr Gullett,"Has the attentiontain inquiries concerning those telegrams because thcy have been transmitted in hundreds. I have found that ""Ruralau8t"" was registered as a telegraphic address at the General Post Omce, Sydney, on the 23rd May, 1949, by V. L. Molloy,' 374 George-street, Sydney, the manager of a. magazine called Rural Australia. So far as I can learn, the magazine has not yet come into existence. Mr Molloy, I understand, is also a director of C. & M. Publications Limited, at thc same address. "" C. & M."", I believe, stands for Chapman and Molloy, the Chapman referred to being one of the signatories of the telegrams. Those telegrams are undoubtedly offensive in character, but I do notthink that they come within the prohibitions of the Post and Telegraph Act. As an indication of the language used in the telegrams I shall quote one that was despatched to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, part of which reads, as follows :Suggest you watch your step otherwise domestic repercussions Hurray electorate (signed) Chapman United Farmers Assn. I agree with the honourable' member that messages of that nature are threatening and intimidatory, and whilst members of the Parliament have a responsibility that they must discharge on the floor of the House when they cast their votes, they are certainly not responsible to pressure groups of the kind mentioned. Concerning that part of the honourable member's question that relates to the organization which calls itself ""United Farmers Association"", so -far as I can ascertain that body consists only of Mr the Public Servioe Board. I realize that Chapman. I have made inquiries 'in Sydney from the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, from the Primary Producers Union and also from officials of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, all of whom have informed me that they had not heardof this organization until a couple of days ago, when the advertisements appeared in the press. The organization does not, therefore, appear to be founded upon a proper constitutional basis' and its bona fides seem to be open to very serious challenge. Mr W. M . BOURKE -I s the Postmaster-General aware that considerable discontent exists among postmen who form a very popular and hard working section of the Public Serviceand have an outstanding record of loyal and efiicient service? They are complaining strongly about two glaring injustices which affect their conditions of employment. Their first complaint is that although they work long hours, commencing at 6.30 a.m. each day, including Saturday, they do not receive penalty rates for week-end work, whereas other employees in public utilities, such as railways and tramways employees, receive such penalty rates. Their second complaint is that whilst the award that the Public Service Arbitrator made recently granted officers in . the Third Division of the Public Service in receipt of a salary of £449 a year an increase of £75 a year, senior postmen who at present receive £450 a year were granted an increase of only £12 a year and even that miserable increase was not granted to postmen in receipt of less than the maximum rate. Is the Postmaster General sympathetic towards the postmen's claim that these just grievances should be remedied? If so, will he instruct his departmental officers not to oppose the postmen's case when these anomalies are placed before the Public Service Arbitrator for rectification ? member has indicated in the latter portion of his question, the determination of rates of pay of postal employees, and also of all other Commonwealth public servants, rests with the appropriate tribunals, which are the Public Service Arbitrator or a certain amount of discontent exists among employees of the Postal Department on the lower ranges of salary and that they claim that the recent increase of salary awarded by the Public Service Arbitrator was inadequate. I have instructed the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs to go into this matter with the Public Service Board with a view to seeing whether a more satisfactory solution can be evolved. It must be realized, however, that the determination of these matters rests with the Public Service Arbitrator or the Public Service Board.",12,Postal Depabtment

6,Mr Anthony,"As the honorablequest was made to the Minister for the Navy by the people of Albany, Western Australia, for the establishment of a naval training unit at that port, but the Minister was then unable, for very good reasons, to accede to the request. However, in view of the acceleration of the defence programme by the present Government, will the Minister now reexamine the request in order to see whether it can be granted ? Will he ascertain whether a small naval vessel can be stationed at Albany to form the nucleus of a training unit? ber, who has been very persistent in pressing this request, has put his case forward with enthusiasm and ardour on all occasions. I should be very happy shortage of tradesmen in the building to help in the matter if it were possible industries, and of the continuing and to do so, but at the present time, in view growing need for the training of sufficient of all the other demands that have to young men for our future development, be met in connection with recruiting will the Minister for Labour and and the provision of accommodation National Service say what positive steps necessary for the extension of the naval are contemplated for the establishment of services, I am afraid any such help will a scheme to take the place of the former be somewhat delayed.

In an effort to meet this problem we are arranging in our British migration programme for the selection, under the -Commonwealth's own nomination scheme, of a considerable proportion of building tradesmen. These men are beginning to .arrive in Australia. Having regard first to an acceleration in the production of building materials and, secondly, to the .additional number of building tradesmen who are coming to this country, we have to consider whether, taking these two factors together, there would still be need for a training scheme along the lines proposed by the honourable member. The matter is very much in the Government's mind and we shall do what we can to obtain sufficient building trade operatives for the desired purposes. .to the Treasurer I refer him, by way of .explanation, to a statement that he wai reported to have made prior to the last .general elections, in which he said that he would never agree to revaluation of the Australian £1 to parity with sterling.

The matter raised by the honourable gentleman is one of policy, which will be dealt with in the right way .at tlie right time. ter whether it is a fact that the present rate of exchange on the Australian £1 is purely artificial and has a detrimental -effect upon the cost of living? As a consequence, are not wealthy graziers becoming fabulously rich by being subsidized b.y importers and by the Australian consumers ? Is it not also a fact that the Australian £1 will purchase more commodities in any Australian capital city than the English £1 will purchase in London? Is that not evidence that the Australian £1 is not rated at its true value? ""Will the right bonorable gentle:man review the present rate of exchange with a view to appreciating the Australian £1 to its proper value, and subsidizing weak industries that may be adversely affected as the result of such action ? debted to the honourable member for hia contribution to this matter. I point out to him, if he will accept a word of advice from rne, that I can see that it is a subject upon which he should most urgently have a discussion with his leader. If he could make the discussion retrospective for about twelve months, it would be extremely interesting. Minister whether it is a fact that the official flag of the Commonwealth is the blue ensign with the Union Jack and the stars. If this is so, has the right lionorable gentleman's attention been drawn to the fact that the official painting of the opening of the Commonwealth parliamentary buildings displays the red ensign, which I understand is the merchant flag of Australia? If these are facts, will the Prime Minister arrange for the correct flag to be painted on the official Commonwealth that the blue flag with the Union Jack in the corner and the stars is the oflicial flag of the Commonwealth ? tained in the earlier portion of the honourable member's remarks must be answered in the affirmative, but I think that his request that a certain painting should be altered must be answered in the negative. WAR GRATUITY. that returned soldier organizations in New South Wales have requested that thu war gratuity which falls due in March, 1951, should be increased by 50 per cent., will the Treasurer consider granting such an increase in order to preserve the value of the gratuity as it was at the date on which it commenced to accrue in 1939 ?

The Apple and Pear Board originally came into being in 1939; but, because of war-time circumstances, its functions were allowed to lapse pending a return to normal marketing conditions, and the tenure of office of its members expired in 1942. The board was reconstituted by an amending act of the Parliament in 1947, and it recommended operations as from the 1st July, 1949. It consists of seven, members who represent the growers of apples and pears, three members who represent the exporters of apples and pears; one member who represents the employees engaged in the apple and pear industry; and one member who represents the Australian Government. The board is concerned with the regulation and supervision of exports of apples and pears from Australia, and for this purpose the act prohibits the export of those fruits except by persons who hold licences issued by the Minister ou the recommendation of the board. production of apples in 1950 did not come up to expectations, particularly in Tasmania and Western Australia, and, as a result, the quantity of 1,784,000 cases shipped to the TJnited Kingdom was far short of the 3,500,000 cases sought by the British Ministry of Food under the cont-act with the Australian Government. Shipments of apples to all destiapproximated 2,675,000 cases. A pleasing feature of our export trade was the resumption of exports to Western Germany. The quantity shipped to that country was 348,000 cases, which compares favourably with pre-war disposals to that market. Pear exports during this year totalled 565,000 cases, of which quantity the United Kingdom market absorbed the highly satisfactory quantity of 480,000 cases. BILL 1950 [No. 2].

68,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [3.28],"and in other ways. At the outset of my speech I sliould like to make a statement concerning one matter upon which I consider the Government can be congratulated. I refer to the persistence of the Minister for External Affairs in raising the subject of former enemy prisoners of war still in Russian hands. I consider that in persisting with that matter, and in continuing his attempt to discover what has become of slave labour that has vanished behind the frontiers of the Soviet Union, the Minister is doing humanity a service. It is unfortunate, however,that the Gowhen its government was carried on subvernment's programme on what one might term international humanitarian work is so contemptible, inadequate, and mean in its motivation. Since the Government took office it has taken no step to give any financial or other assistance towards British recovery. It has also abandoned the very valuable work of the previous Government on international children's relief, which is a -very valuable sphere of international relief, because upon it depends the future sanity and well-being of many of the world's citizens, including many of Europe's citizens, and possibly, in some respects, the question of whether they are to be open, as fhr»y grow up, to constructive or destructive influences. The Cbifley Government, in addition to donating £28,000,000 to Unrra, gave £4,500,000 to the International Children's Relief Organization. It gave that amount in regular sums. To-day, in Australia, we have the disgraceful spectacle of the United Nations appeal for childven being conducted, with the sanction of the Government, by tottering voluntary workers. That sanction means that the Government admits that the need for assistance in international children's relief still exists, but it does nothing effective to meet the need, as the previous Government did, by making substantial grants of money for that purpose. In the recent debates at the General Assembly of the United Nations the policy of the Minister for External Affairs was, in my opinion, gravely mistaken. He quite unnecessarily and foolishly intervened in the dispute between South Africa and India, and in such a manner that his policy was so unrealistic, was so based on Mr Beazley. a lie, that it did not obtain support in .the General Assembly of Great Britain, the United States or any other dominion or nation. It is well known that for many years the relations between India and South Africa have been tense because of the underprivileged position of Indian nationals in South Africa. That is not new. It was one of the causes of the Boer War. Because of the maltreatment of Indians in South Africa by Kruger's Government, Gandhi in his early days supported the British in that particular conflict. Even when India was not independent, and stantially by a British viceroy, it constantly protested through the viceroy about the treatment of Indian nationals in South Africa. I remember the Marquis of Linlithgow making a very impassioned statement on the deep and burning indignation felt by India on that particular issue. The dispute has been raised again in a particularly acute form by tbe present Government of South Africa which seems to have an apologist in an Australian Country party back-bencher who, being an ex-resident of South Africa, is a very interesting example of how Lord Milner's hope that the British point of view would triumph over the Boer point of view has been completely reversed in that the Boer point of view has triumphed over the British. The dispute was raised again by India when it became clear that the Prime Minister of South Africa, Dr. Malan, intended to introduce into the South African Parliament a bill to classify citizens of South Africa into first, second and third classes according to their approximation to a white skin. Now that is a dispute in which Australia need not involve itself. We desire the goodwill of both South Africa and India. The Minister had no need to involve himself in the dispute and if he did, he might at least have taken his stand on realistic grounds. But he alone in the General Assembly of the United Nations acted out the lie that this was purely a domestic matter for South Africa. He did that at a time when racial oppression is one of the strongest cards that international communism endeavours to use in seeking to win the sympathy of Asia. I suppose that racial oppression and malnutrition have been among the main reasons why.Oommunist influence has spread in Asia. The Minister pretended that it was purely a domestic matter for South Africa alone and voted in support of that view. expected Asiatic nations or India, a very great fellow dominion, to regard the maltreatment of Indians as being no business of India and hence, not an international qnestion, I do not know. It appears that the Minister has decided that he must support this sort of proposal and that he believes that he has some sort of obligation to make a cleavage which has always been avoided in the United Nationsa cleavage on racial lines between Europeans, and Asiatic countries. Luckilyf or us and the Minister, such foolish policies do not prevail among other European governments or our fellow dominions and tlip mischievous incompetence of the Minister did uot have the effect it might have had in bringing ilhvill to this country. I turn now to the subject of Korea. I urge that the Government should state its view on Korea, ancl make known advice that it intends to give on tlie future of that country. I well remember that when there was an all-party committee, which included people outside this Parliament, on the Japanese peace settlement, we were discussing Korea which was then divided between the United States and the Soviet Union. deavouring to set up representative government in Southern Korea, in compliance with the promises given at Potsdam. We were then told that within a few months of the commencement of efforts to establish representative governKorea. Whilst that is all very well in ment in South Korea there were 479 contending political parties and, of course, the assembly which was produced from that state of political confusion became inept and the trend in the country, especially after the United States left, was towards dictatorship. It should be recognized that any attempt to establish what we call democracy in a country such as Korea which, in inefficient landlordism has extracted 10,000 years of history, has not had one single democratic political tradition, must 70 per cent, of their annual crops and that be an extremely thankless and difficult task. Russia established 'a dictatorship in the north. There may have been an Opposition, but if it existed it was in the cemetery and not in the assembly. Therefore the southern government, while it was representative, rested on a virtually impossible foundation. The northern governPlow he could have ment rested upon dictatorship and tbe government by force which is a feature of the whole history of Korea. Therefore, I do not make any complaint about the inferior inefiiciency of the southern government by comparison with that of northern Korea. It s inefficiency proceeded from an attempt by the United States to be decent and to give democratic institutions where no democratic tradition existed. But there is one problem in Korea, on which I think Australia should reverse its attitude and advice insofar as the Australian Government iv called upon to give advice to the United States ancl other members of the United Nations. Such advice should be quite clearly in favour of the destruction of landlordism in southern Korea. I recognize that the Communists, in their propogf.nda, always give as evidence of superior good faith on the part of Russia the fact that the Soviet regime in northern Korea handed over, the land of the landlords to the peasants, thereby tending to make them contented while in South Korea that was not done. I know that the United States did not adopt that course because it took a strictly correct viewpoint which was that there was to be, ultimately, an Tbe United States was enindependent Korean Government and that the settlement of the land question was not a matter which should be decided by the United States as a temporary interloper but was one that should be settled by the future government of theory, it would in no way be appreciated by the illiterate peasantry of Korea. The legal nicety which restrained the United States from carrying out a redistribution of the land would not commend itself to a people to whom its mere explanation would be unintelligible. Korea, like India and Chinai n the past, has been rack-rented witb debt. Generations of debt have accumulated in families and rentals from its tenants of up to 60 and has reduced the great majority of the population to a state of peonage. That is an ancient and festering sore which can only be cut out in the manner in which it was cut out in Northern Korea. I am well aware that Eussia, in adopting that policy, did so in order to buttress its Communist regime in North Korea, but its actions were based upon a recognition of what the Korean peasantry desired and the TJnited Nations will not be able to establish stable institutions in Korea on the basis of an ancient and vicious feudalism. I apologize for using the word "" feudalism"", for there is nothing in Asiatic landlordism to equal the restraints and the regulations which did place some limitations on the bad features of what we called ""feudalism"" in Europe. But the Australian Government ought to be pressing for the solution of the land question in Korea. It should recommend tihe complete ending of landlordism and not the half-baked method of trying to end it by paying compensation to old families who have battened on serfs for generations. If representative government is to be supported in Korea, it should be established on healthy, economic foundations and not on ancient rottenness. early part of his speech the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) launched an attack against the Government's foreign policy. I do not suggest that any government has a foreign policy which is entirely free from fault. As Disraeli once said, it is easier to be critical diverted to Korea because they had been than correct. Foreign policy is an aspect of government which involves all sorts of difficulties. The scene changes quickly and the best that the Government can do is lay down a broad realistic policy and adjust it to events from time to time. Furthermore, this Government has an adequate foreign policy. That is more than can be said of the Chifley Government. The foreign policy of the previous Government consisted fundamentally of a blind support of the United Nations. When the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) was abroad no member of the Cabinet had any idea of what our foreign poliey really was. Moreover, this Government has not allowed the waterside workers to dictate the foreign policy of Australia in any respect. Millions of pounds were lost to this country as a result of the ineffective and futile foreign policy of the previous Government. Its policy also engendered ill feeling between Australia and nations overseas. The honourable member for Fremantle spoke of the mischievous incompetence of the present Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender). point. point. As he chose to use that phrase, may I remind him of the mischievous incompetence of the previous Government in regard to Sergeant Gamboa, Mrs. O'Keefe, Jang and various other people of foreign nationality. As a result of the mischievous handling of those affairs, this country lost a great deal of the goodwill of its neighbours in the near north which it could ill-afford to lose. In a recent speech the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) laid stress on the close association between defence and foreign affairs. That was probably the most signincant point that emerged from his general outline of present-day national affairs. The Government has been criticized in some quarters for its delay in sending ground troops to Korea. The fact is that the Government was unable to send ground forces any earlier than it did because .the Australian Regular Army, under its enlistment terms, could not be sent abroad. Nor could Australian troops in Japan be specifically enlisted for service in Japan. That lends point to the argument of the Prime Minister that this country should extend the terms of enlistment to enable our soldiers to serve in any part of the world.. That is a most important feature of this Government's foreign and defence policy. It manifests a broad realistic approach to world affairs and it indicates the realization that defence and foreign affairs must necessarily go hand in hand. It must be a source of satisfaction, not only to Australians, but also to our friends in other democratic countries, to know that at least Australia bas a Government wbich is taking an international view of ita",22,International Affairs

It is of no use to pay only lip-service to the United Nations and to say, "" We believe in the United Nations "", because there is no doubt that we do believe in it on both sides of this House. We must go further than that. If we were to restrict our defence policy as advocated by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), Australia would be in no position to fulfil its obligations abroad. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Will Australia be the weak link in the chain of democracies and let its partners down by not being strong enough to take the strain? Australia certainly will not be the weak link if it continues to advance in the direction already indicated by the Government. Just as citizenship involves duties and obligations as well as rights and privileges, so does partnership of the family of nations involve duties and obligations at home and abroad. An attack can be warded off only if a nation is strong, but the best and quickest way of inviting attack is to be weak and vacillatHong Kong to fight with the Americans ing. We all know that international communism is on the march. The world scene is changing rapidly and communism is spreading its red shadow over more and more of the world. Hitler, in comparison with Stalin, was an amateur at the game of acquiring territory and power. During the last few months a war has occurred in Korea. It appears to be reaching the final stages now because of the magnificent leadership of General MacArthur. It is disappointing that the call made by the United Nations to its members did not receive a readier response from them all, but Australia can be proud that its forces were on the sceue very early in the piece and have played an effective part in the campaign, in proportion to their strength and our ability to send them quickly. The prestige of the democracies has risen greatly as a result of our success in Korea, but much lost ground must be made np in the East because of what occurred in the last few years of the term of office of the previous Government. It is most important that we should have tbe goodwill of all our neighbours. It has almost become trite to say that to our north lies approximately one-third of the people of the world and that we cannot afford to antagonize any section of them. The stand of the democracies against aggression in Korea has, we hope, been a lesson to Eussia. We hope that there will be no repetition of the Korean incident but, as the Prime Minister said, we must be ready to meet any attack such as could occur against Eormosa, Siam, Tibet or Iran. Eussia covets the oilfields in Iran. According to reports from various parts of the world Russia is concentrating troops here and there. The only way to safety lies through strength, and the readiness to meet aggression wherever it appears. In Indo-China there is a great deal of trouble. Bao Dai's troops are fighting against those of Ho Chi Minh. Many Erench troops are also engaged in that country, which is the reason, why France was unable to render more effective aid to the United Nations in Korea. The British are fully occupied in Malaya, but were able to despatch forces from in the battle for Korea. In tbe Philippines there is trouble from the Hukbala Haps, and behind the scenes are the agitators from Moscow. India and Pakistan are at loggerheads. Sir Owen Dixon's mission was not successful, and. if anybody could have succeeded in bringing tliose countries together it is Sir Owen Dixon, because of his brilliance aud ability. The importance of the Middle East to Australian security must not be overlooked. The withdrawal of the British garrisons from India and the Middle East generally, including Egypt, has made a great deal of difference io Australia's strategic situation. Many Australians do not recognize that our future is bound up with the security of the democracies in the Middle East. Our strategic position in the Indian Ocean was recently mentioned by the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Hasluck), and I agree with bis statement that we must build up our defences in the north and the north-western regions of Australia because it is from those directions that danger may come. The Indonesians are talking and acting aggressively. Soekarno is still making outbursts periodically against the Dutch in advancing Indonesia's claim to sovereignty over Dutch New Guinea. The future of Dutch New Guinea is of vital concern to Australia ancl is one of the main reasons why the Minister for External Affairs is now abroad. Unfortunately, Pandit Nehru supports Indonesia's extravagant claim to sovereignty over Dutch New Guinea. That territory joins Australian New Guinea and, therefore, it is of great sigready to meet that, threat wherever it may nificance to this country. For that reason be translated into action.

The British Socialist Government acted pi-ecipitately in acknowledging the Government of "" red "" China, l n doing so it was out of step with the United States and other members of the United Nations. The Japanese problem still awaits solution.

Whilst Japan must play a significant part in any efforts to mainAustralia be enabled to play its part, tain the balance of powev in the Pacific, nevertheless we must have regard to its conduct in the past. Australians would not Japanese military power, because, when we remember its past record, we have no reason to believe that given the opportunity it would not again attack Australia fighting when they reach the 3Sth as it did in World War II . As the honourable member for Curtin has said, power politics are the dominant factor in world affairs at present. Germany presents another grave problem. I should very much like to see the treaty with tliat country finalized. I do not believe that in defending western Europe the democracies can afford to be without the support of the German army which, next to the Russian army, is the greatest potential military force in Europe. Unless the western democracies take Germany into their camp that country will certainly go into the Russian camp. I agree witb the statement that was made Mr Drury. by Mr Churchill that if it were not for the atom bomb the world would now be iii the throes of a third giant conflict. Only the atom bomb stands between peace ancl war.

Korea divided permanently? vote of this Parliament was not obtained on the basis of those ideas for the sentatives of North Korea as well as the entry of Australia into the struggle in Korea as part of the United Nations forces. The unanimous view which the Parliament expressed only a few weeks ago was that the United Nations forces sliould enter Korea for the purpose of defending South Korea with tbe object, not of prolonging, and extending the struggle, but of localizing and ending it. Some people believe that the struggle in Korea should be prolonged and extended into a third world war, as they regard this opportunity as propitious to make war against Russia rather than wait until Russia becomes stronger and able to wage war against tbe democracies. I repeat that that was not thc idea on which the Parliament voted unanimously for the entry of Australian forces into the conflict in Korea in support of the United Nations and neither is it in keeping with the ideals on which the United Nations itself was founded. The idea, was that action by the United Nations must be for the restoration and preservation of peace, and not for the extension of the struggle and its conversion into a third world war. It was the military aggression of North Korea, quite irrespective of the political complexion of the government which existed there, that the United Nations forces took up arms to oppose and defeat. It was not the brutal Communist set-up of the North Korean Government that the United Nations took up arms to oppose and defeat, any more than it was the brutal fascist set-up of the South Korean Government that the United Nations took up arms to defend and maintain. Therefore I consider that many people, who see the United Nations as the great force for the future peace of the world, fervently hope that the United Nations forces will not proceed beyond the 3Sth parallel at this stage; that, as soon as possible, the United Nations will endeavour to arrange for free elections throughout the whole of Korea with a view to establishing a united Korean government; and that, as soon as possible after that government has been established, the United Nations forces will withdraw from Korea. It seems only logical to me that in tbe making of those arrangements, the reprerepresentatives of South Korea must be heard by the United Nations. On a matter of such obvious interest to China, the actual government of that country should surely be recognized, irrespective of distaste of its Communist nature, and an end should be made to tbe ridiculous pretence that Chiang Kai-shek can any longer speak in the name of the 400,000,000 people of China. I suggest that, in accordance with its constitution and its original objects, the United Nations has no right to be deterred from making those arrangements, and from taking that course, through contemplating the possibility that the Korean elections may produce a Communist government dominated by Moscow. I imagine that such a set-up must be quite a possibility, and no one here contemplates it with pleasure, but it does not appear to me that the United Nations, in accordance with its constitution and charter, should be deterred by that possibility, provided it can give to the people of Korea the opportunity to choose freely the kind of government under which they will live. No one here denies the need to counter the spread of communism in the world. The war against communism is largely a war between opposing ideas. The way in which to counter communism is not to pervert the United Nations from its original concept of a league of all the peoples of the world, joined together to resist aggression and to promote peace, into merely an anti-Communist military organization of the non-Communis""t nations. That would be a betrayal and destruction of the idea on which the",27,International Affairs

It would be a betrayal of the faith and support which millions of ordinary men and women in so many countries give to-day to the United Nations ideal. If the men in the Kremlin are, as so many people believe, power-crazed lunatics, determined on world conquest, we have no alternative. Their aggression will have to be resisted. But unless the men in the Kremlin are in that category, they must desperately wish to avoid war, as every sane man in the world desperately wishes to avoid it. If they desire world domination nothing can stop them from starting a war which may end the world itself, and which will certainly smash our civilization as we know it. But if the Soviet leaders are not entirely powercrazed lunatics, they cannot be deliberately other responsible men who are close to planning a world war. If they are obsessed by a fear of western attacks on their country, just as we are obsessed by a fear of Soviet attacks on us, then out of that two-sided fear that breeds suspicion, hatred and misunderstanding, a third world war could come without any one wanting it. If the Soviet leaders fear that a mass attack will he suddenly launched on them, we should not be astonished. Had Soviet .spokesmen uttered against us the threats, incitements and unofficial declarations of war which have been uttered in recent weeks in the United States of America and in this couniry by reckless warmongers, we would know that there was nothing on earth for us to do but to plan the most propitious moment to begin a world war before they began it and destroyed us. Such statements as have been made by the leaders of the war party in the United States of America, and by the leaders of the war party in this country, if they had been made by Soviet leaders would cause us to believe that a third world war was inevitable. The Sydney Sunday Herald, which blind ourselves to the very real possibility is certainly not a Communist jourthat every shot fired in that conflict has innal, published, on the 10th September creased the Communist grip on the minds last, an article from its Washington of the people of Asia. I sball quote from correspondent. double-column headings, and occupied ifr. Franar. a great deal of space. I have tiniu only to summarize the article, and t >""iiote one or two excerpts from it. ; Ifi.i.ever, the whole tenor of it was to the effect that the advocates of deliberately launching war against Russia now, have become a considerable minority group not only outside, but also inside the United Sta: Govern nr t. The correspondent wroteThe argument runs: ""Why not put an end to dread and uncertainty by getting there fustest with the mostest, to use a famous military dictum of the American Civil War. Let's get at Russia now, overwhelm her with atom bomop, and live i-i peace ever alter. ""This argument has ooen '.Icvcloped openly, tacitly, frankly, and in disguise by some of the most iiiHuciilial men in the TJnited States. ""In the last fortnight preventive war statements have av.Uaiiched."" I believe th:it those words do not represent the view of President Truman or of him. They have done their utmost to damp down statements of that kind, which must be so extraordinarily harmful to the development of peaceful relations in the world. Yet it seems to me that if there is such a strong opinion among influential men in the United States of America that, we should deliberately launch a third world war now against the Soviet Union, and if they find that such action would be unacceptable to their own people through their present attitude to bhe termination of the Korean struggle, they must be contemplating a certain possibility. What is it? It may be that they think that, by continuing the struggle in Korea and by forcing it right to the Manchurian border, they will perhaps be able to provoke Russia at this stage into a third world war. As I have stated, they believe that such a conflict should be deliberately begun by us, yet they feel they cannot obtain the support of their countrymen to begin it. Therefore, they may hope to bring it about by continuing the Korean struggle in the present circumstances.

77,Mr Townley,"Yes, and I alsohis indiscretion. The fact remains that there are men in the United States of America, as no doubt there are in Eussia and in other countries, who would suggest that an immediate all-out attack would be preferable to the continuance of the present tension. That is a dreadful conception of international relationships and the functions of the United Nations, and we should be most grateful that there are men like President Truman who have sufficient influence to curb those superpatriots, as they might be termed. President Truman and his advisors realize to the full the horrors that would be involved in a future war. They know that if America released atom bombs over Russia, similar weapons would inevitably be used figainst the United States of America. We and our allies emerged victorious in the military sense from both World WarI . ancl World War II . But what did victory mean to us? We certainly have not won the peace. International problems have multiplied and become magnified after each world conflict, and to-day we are threatened by the world-wide expansion of communism. Notwithstanding the arguments that are advanced b.y men in. the United States of America who advocate an all-out attempt to crush Russia by launching atom bombs against its key cities, I consider that we may rest assured that President Truman and his advisers would never hecome parties to any such scheme. It is not very difficult in these days to prepare some form of brief address on the subject of international affairs. Over recent years, international affairs have assumed an ever-increasing importance to us. Not only have activities between nations increased but also the press, the radio and international travel have led to more frequent contact between individual citizens of different countries. By these means we have become increasingly more conversant with the events that take place in other parts of the world and thus we have gained a greater appreciation of our international responsibilities. Australia is isolated from the rest of the English-speaking world, yet approximately 1,000,000,000 people live not far from its shores. Although we are situated 10,000 miles away from Europe, we have been engaged in two world wars Mr Townley. within my lifetime. Australia participated in World WarI largely because of its empire associations. It took its stand with other members of the British Commonwealth to fight against aggression, and we were victorious. In joining the conflict, we honoured certain guarantees that we had given to foreign nations. Australia entered World War II . also chiefly because of its membership of the British Empire. Before that war had been in progress for twelve months, units of our navy, our army and our air force were engaged in the struggle 10,000 miles from their homeland. During that war we had to face the real threat of invasion for the first time. That was a danger that most of us had not considered previously. I recall that, when I was a boy, my friends and I were accustomed to laugh about the ""Yellow Peril"". We saw Japanese seamen walking the streets of our cities, often carrying bunches of carnations or chrysanthemums, and we thought that any suggestion of a threat from such men was fantastic. But the laughs were wiped off our faces in the south-west Pacific later. I believe that, in theevent of a third world war, the principal scene of conflict would again be the Mediterannean Sea and the continent of Europe. However, Australia's isolation would not protect it from the consequences of such a war. It would be forced to meet dangers near its own shores as it did during World War II . In a very notable contribution to this debate last week, the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Hasluck) spoke about the situation in the region of the Indian Ocean. He referred to thf! strategic value of the Indian Ocean and pointed out that it lay along the whole of Australia's western seaboard. Formerly, all approaches to Australia through the Indian Ocean were in friendly hands, but the situation has changed and, in the event of another war, those approaches would probably be denied to us with results that should be obvious to everybody. In connection with tbe remarks made by the honorahle member for Curtin, who is, I submit, an authority on these matters, I point out that in addition the sea lanes through the Indian Ocean being imperilled in the event of war, similar difficulties would present themselves in the Pacific, particularly in the Panama Canal area. If it is reasonable to anticipate enemy interference with the sea route round, the Cape of Good Hope, it is just as reasonable to anticipate interference to the Pacific sea lanes. The only route that is regularly used by ships that come to this country from Great Brit a in via the Pacific is that which passes through the Panama Canal, and I propose to say something about that important link of communication between Australia and Great Britain. First of all, we must bear in mind that the submarine blockade that we shall encounter in the Pacific w ill be much more intense than any we have ever known. It is estimated that Bussia has no less than 500 submarines, and that by the end of next year it w ill possess at least 1,000 submarines. Those figures are taken from Jane's Fighting Ships and Brassey's Naval Annual. When we recall that although Germany commenced World War II . with a total fleet of only 57 submarines we were nearly brought to our knees, we realize the enormous damage that could be inflicted by a fleet of 1,000 submarines. Indeed, such a fleet of under-water vessels would be sufficient to alter the balance of sea power, which has been in our favour for generations. I propose to make some remarks now about the Panama Canal and the countries immediately surrounding it . Can we be sure that in any future emergency that canal will be available to our ships? members who are conversant with the history of recent developments in Central America, particularly in the last two years, know the degree to which the Communists have infiltrated those countries, which are now probably more subject to Russian domination than is any country outside Europe. In Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Nicaragua and other South American countries the headway made by the Communists has been most alarming. through which the canal passes, was, until recently, f a i r l y free from Communist influence, but in recent months a big change has taken place in that state. Its population' contains a high proportion of Chinese. The Communists have intimidated those Chinese by threatening to take reprisals on their relatives in China unless they co-operate with the Communist party. The consequence has been that large numbers of Chinese have joined the Comniunist party. For verification of my statements I refer honourable members to publications by Keesing and Harper and to De Courcy's Intelligence Digest. The history of Communist infiltration of Central America and of the formation of the Caribbean legion is well worth reading, and should be known to every honourable member. It is clear, therefore, that we must expect our enemies to subject us to a severe submarine blockade, and that, use of the Panama Canal, in particular, will be denied to us. Apart from any efforts that we may make through diplomatic channels to enable our ships to use the canal, we shall probably have to rely on military intervention on our behalf by the United States of America. However, it is quite possible that the canal itself may be destroyed by the use of atomic weapons. The development of those weapons makes it possible for an atomic bomb to be dropped at the entrance to the canal by air, or released by a surface vessel or a submarine. Furthermore, if the dread possible of the hydrogen bomb materializes, the area may be infected by radio-active vapours that would render it unusable for a period of as long as five years. In view of tbe potential menace to our Those honorablo sea lanes through the Indian Ocean and the Panama Canal, I suggest that we should turn our attention to the development of an alternative sea route round Cape Horn. WhilstI do not like to commend that route to any sailor, I point out to honourable members that tlie development of radar as a navigational aid has overcome most of the perils associated vvith it . In the event of war occurring it would be much safer to send ships round CapeH o r n than to run the The Republic of Panama, risk of sending them through the Panama Canal; the use of which,, as I have already pointed out, may be denied to us altogether. {Extension of time granted.] It is vital to our interest that we should be on good terms with the nations of Soutli America, particularly East, in which the principal danger Chile, Brazil and Argentina, where ports spots are Formosa, Indo-China and are available for ships to refuel and to Malaya. In passing, I point out that take on water and stores. Whilst paying many honourable members feel that all due deference to the arguments Malaya is a particular responsibility of advanced by the honourable member for this country.

I know that I am stating the point of view of the Australian people when I say that I was very concerned by many of the aspects of the Leader of the Opposition's speech. It was disappointing at a time when dangerous conditions exist in the world to hear the right honourable gentleman, speaking on behalf of the official parliamentary Opposition in this country, say that he would take no part in assisting the Government's present recruiting campaign. A statement made by a Labour party official outside this House at about the same time, indicating that it was the intention of that party to block, in another place, the Government's national service training plans, was also very disturbing. Without wishing to presume too much, I consider that those views, even if they liave been well considered by the party which honourable members opposite represent, are not representative of the majority of Labour opinion in Australia. Honourable members opposite will never convince this side of the House that the honest-to-goodness Labour man, especially out in the country districts, believes in the view advanced by the Leader of the Opposition last Wednesday. I do not wish to detain the House the world the sincerity of our protestawith autobiographical details, but I s'hould tions. like to say that during the recent war I had the honour of serving for five years in the ranks of the Sth Division.

The Kremlin. The attitude of the Leader honourable member for Mallee( Mr of the Opposition reminds me of the Turnbull) will confirm, that statement, famous statement of the great French because he was there with me.

I ask the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) how he, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition and of a great party, with all his experience as President of the TJnited Nations General Assembly, and as a man who probably knows more about the actual working of the TJnited Nations than does any other person in this chamber, can possibly support such an unrealistic and futile policy. The right honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that in order to make the TJnited Nations effective we have to put some teeth into it. He also knows perfectly well that although Australia is only a small country it produces a brand of troops and fighters who are the equal of any in the world. He knows perfectly well that to make what in part, at any rate, could well be called one of his children, the TJnited Nations organization, effective, we have to be prepared to shoulder our obligations and to prove to The effects abroad of the Leader of the to Australia, to develop our industries, to put more country under the plough, and generally to develop our resources"". Compare that curiously isolationist, antiquated and unrealistic attitude with that of the socialist party in Great Britain. It would be very easy indeed for Mr antiquated prejudices that should have Attlee and his friends to say, "" We want to put more men into production. We want to increase our exports. By doing that we can make ourselves less and less dependant on American aid."" It would be very easy for them to say, "" We shall cut down our defences. We shall unburden ourselves and disavow our imperial responsibilities."" But the British socialists, who are the colleagues of honourable members opposite, are doing the very opposite of that. They are saying now that they will extend the period of military service under conscription-that word that is so hateful to honourable members opposite from eighteen months to two years. They have announced recently that they are sending extra forces to Western Germany. Honourable members know how readily the British Government participated in the war in Korea, irrespective of their political ideology the English socialists have given many manifestations of their determination that Britain shall discharge its responsibilities to the Empire and to the United Nations. The same might very well be said, and with more force, about the United States of America. The position is so obvious with regard to America that it would be presumptuous of me to weary honourable members by emphasizing it at this stage. In both the United Kingdom and the United glorious spectacle of no real political division on the issues of preparedness and intervention. Britain socialists are as one in these matters of foreign policy and military preparedness. Similarly in the United States the Demo cratic and Republican parties are of the one opinion. Canada and in New Zealand, but fairly comprehensive plan for the defence we have the deplorable situation that of the three services. It may well be Australia is the only English-speaking that this Parliament and the people of country of any importance in the world Australia will have to be willing to do in which there is a great cleavage between more than the Prime Minister has the Government and the Opposition on already asked of them. Our security Mr Doumer. foreign policy and military preparedness. I appeal to honourable members oppositeand I am sorry that there are not more of them present to hear my appeal-to be realistic about this matter of defence and to be prepared to abandon outworn and absolutely no place in the world to-day. I suggest to them that it is about time that we woke up in this country to the necessity to play the part of the Good Samaritan. This year of 3950 is no time for a defence policy that would indicate that we intend to pass by on the other side. In our isolated and strategically dangerous position we cannot afford to do that. As the last war showed, we are dependent for our security upon the goodwill and the protection of powerful friends, primarily America, and to a lesser extent, because of the altered balance of international relationships, Great Britain. But unless we are prepared to show our best friends that we on our part will do more in peace-time in the future than we have done in the past, then it will be idle for us, when the emergency comes, as undoubtedly it will come again, to hold out our hands in supplication and expect them to come to our assistance as soon as we give the call. Since 1945 many people have had a suspicion that the Australian Government has been prone to talk too much and to act too little. I suggest to honourable members opposite that Australia must speak to the world with a united voice on matters of foreign policy and defence. Party catch cries or sectional differences do not count when we are confronted with these matters which States we have the go to the very basis of our being. One of the principal reasons why honourable members are present in this House is to In Great achieve the security of the people of Austhe conservatives and the tralia. It is not enough to legislate for improved standards of living. Oiir task is to maintain the security which has : already been won. The same applies in The Government has announced a will not be accomplished merely by populating and developing Australia as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested. It will be achieved only if we engender the idea that the people of Australia, must be trained to meet whatever emergency may arise and that they must be willing to participate instantaneously in resisting aggression wherever it rears its ugly head. becoming necessary, not only for members of the National Parliament, but also for members of the public, to take a greater interest in what is happening in the world to-day. It is still more important that honourable members who are charged with the responsibility of attending to international affairs should make themselves f u l l y conversant with what is happening and the significance of past as well as present events. This afternoon I was rather astonished to hear the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), who would have himself accepted as an authority on international affairs, wrongly stating that certain events have happened in history. When criticizing the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) for his attitude to the Indiansi n South Africa, he said that the treatment of the Indians by the Boersi n the early days had been a factor which had contributed to the outbreak of the Boer War. That is incorrect. orable member for Cunningham ( Mr Davies) also is unaware of how wrong his beliefs are. Cecil Ehodes never, at any time, had Indians under his control. The Indians settled in only one part of SouthA f r i c a , namely Natal, which was never at any time a Boer colony. It has always been a British colony. The treatment of the Indians was the responsibility of the British Colonial Government, and later on, of the Union of SouthA f r i c a Government. I suggest that when the honourable member for Fremantle speaks on international affairs he should be better informed on past as well as present events. memher say that there are no Indiansi n Capetown? town are, and always have been, under British control. The main factor in tha outbreak of the Boer War was that thrKruger Government repeatedly broke agreements with the British Government regarding the treatment of foreigners in the Transvaal, which was the only part It is of SouthA f r i ca that was held by the Boers at that time. What right have we to interfere in the domestic affairs of other nations? What right has any group of nations to interfere' in the internal affairs of another nation? I am not stating a case against the Indians or the SouthA f r i c a n Government but I do say that the Indians went to South. A f r i ca under the same conditions as the new Australians are coming to Australia. When the national? of one country enter another country it is incumbent upon them to accept the conditions that prevail there. They arrive there as guests. When a group of nations interferes in the domestic affairs of another nation it is asking for trouble. I suggest that the Minister for External Affairs acted quite rightly when he voted to keep South Africa's internal affairs outside the United Nations' discussion. There is a time when the domestic affairs of any nation must incite action on the part of other nations. was that there was an international conN o , it is not. vention between the Indian and South African governments regarding the treatment of these people. Therefore, it was not entirely a local"" matter. this or any other nation would be justified in interfering with the domestic affairs of South Africa would be when those affairs were a danger to world peace or to the security of other nations, economically or otherwise. When the Indians went to SouthA f r i ca they had to accept conditions as they existed, just as the new Australians who come to Australia accept the conditions which operate in this country. Very few people outside of SouthA f r i ca actually know what tlie argument is between the Indians and the Africans.",33,International Affairs

85,Mr Leslie,"The only time whenGovernment members bave been charged vvith having changed their attitude to the United Nations organization. I , myself, have been severely critical of the United Nations organization in the past. I was doubtful whether it was going to do any good in view of the history of the League of Nations. The United Nations organization was founded on lines similar to those of the League of Nations and honourable members who support the Government previously saw nothing to give them confidence that it would be able to do any more than pass pious resolutions. Before the last war, Italy, Japan, Germany and other countries figuratively put their thumbs to their noses to indicate their contempt for the League of Nations and told the League to do whatever it liked. What was it able to do? Honourable members interjecting, Kr. SPEAKER -Order! There are too many interjections. nothing whatsoever. The governments that defied the League of Nations got away with their defiance because the League of Nations was not backed by force. The United Nations organization has now demonstrated that there is a force backing it. Therefore we can change our attitude of distrust to one of trust. We can say that the United Nations organization will function successfully as long as the nations continue to back it. Had it not tion ( Mr Chifley) speaks with the been for the preparedness of the American nation at the commencement of the Korean hostilities the United Nations organization would have been as impotent in that matter as the League of Nations was in relation to events that occurred during its existence. United Nations organization must have a force, whether it is a single force or a combination of separate forces, which must be on hand constantly in order to enforce, at a moment's notice, what the United Nations, in its deliberative conferences, decides. The United Nations organization has gone beyond the stage of merely passing pious resolutions. In a holding camp for immigrants in Western Australia. I had the opportunity of speaking to new Australians from Western Germany and the overwhelming majority of them consider that Western Europe has been lost to the democracies. How many honourable members have received applications from continental European-born Australians in the last few months urging expedition in bringing tlieir relatives from Europe? I have received scores of them because in Western Europe there is already an absolute absence of confidence in the ability of the Western democracies to resist the Russian steam roller. Why? Because there is no tangible evidence of the strength of the Western democracies. They are not prepared to accept our pious suggestions, resolutions ancl anxiety on their behalf nor our protestations that we shall support them if trouble comes their way. Only when the United Nations is able to point to tangible forces backing its decisions will the world be sure of peace and harmonious international relationships. It is evident that international affairs and defence go hand in hand everywhere. Behind our international activity there must be an adequate defence policy, and we cannot allow defence to be treated as a matter apart. Defence must no longer be considered one of the minor or incidental matters connected with the government of the country. I support the criticism, already voiced in this chamber, of the attitude of the Labour party towards the attempt of the Government to strengthen Australia's defences. If the Leader of the Opposivoice of the Labour party when he opposes the Government's policy, then be indicates his party's scandalous lack of a sense of responsibility towards the welfare of Australia. His views do not reflect the opinion of the rank and file of the Labour -party. Those who vote for the Labour party, whether because they are trade unionists, or wage earners rather than employers, or for some other reason, are definitely not all as disloyal to Australia and the peace of the world as was indicated by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. If tbe right honourable gentleman has stated the official attitude of the Labour party, and his views are backed by Labour leaders throughout Australia, then the less the Labour party has to say about international and defence matters, as well as about internal affairs, the better will it",36,International Affairs
86,Mr Leslie,"It was able to dobe for this country. I cannot be too severe in my castigation of that attitude when I think of its being the considered attitude of a band of people who are supposed to be able to assume the responsibility of governing this country. They exhibit a lack of a sense of responsibility to such a degree that they may jeopardize the safety and security of the nation. ara dealing with what the. Labour party has said. is putting a wrong construction on it. construction possible on the plain words used by the Leader of the Opposition. .Recently, I attended a meeting in ""Western Australia in connection with the recruiting campaign. The meeting was expected to be representative of all sections of the community. Eighty or ninety people attended, and the only section conspicuously unrepresented was the Lahour movement. The Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of Western Australia was not there, nor was any representative of the Trades Hall or the Labour party. Eveiy other organization present pledged its support for tbe Government's policy; but there was not one word from the people whose co-operation we sincerely want in the task of national defence. When talking of international affairs, it is necessary to mention war, although the settled desire of this country is to live at peace with everybody and to avoid war. There are two main causes of wars. The first is imperialistic ambition for territorial conquest. The second is the ageold struggle between the "" haves"" and the "" have-nots "". Certain nations which are poorer than others have a legitimate pared to take his part in a. war to defend desire to improve their standards. inember think that there are such things mately have it. But at the present time as trade wars? avoid, by sympathetic negotiations, wars all sections of the people. If the right that are brought about by the second honourable member for Barton (Dr. cause, but the threat of wars caused by Evatt) is sincere when he talks imperialism can be met only by force. We about his faith in what the TJnited have evidence that at least one of the great Nations can do, he must support us nations of the world is to-day inspired by in our attempts to hack the United the old imperialistic ambition. Whether Nationsi f called upon to do so. We can or not this ambition is described in terms of a new ideology makes no difference. One of tbe countries of Europe is at present Communist, but is not dominated by Russia. The fact that Russia does not accept this country as an independent Communist State, but seeks to bring it completely under its thumb is sufficient to prove that Russia is actuated by imperialistic ambition. Such ambition can be curbed only by force, and we must be prepared to meet force with force. [Extension of time granted.'] The threat of war between the "" bave"" and the "" have-not"" nations can be avoided by means other than force. It can be met by economic adjustment between the probable belligerents. The removal of the second cause of war must concern Australia to-day because of present-day conditions in the near north. We are not preparing armed forces to fight our immediate neighbours; our job is so to arrange the economic relationships between ourselves and our neighbours that the bonds of friendship between us will become stronger and stronger. That can be done by providing the nations to the north with economic assistance. The policy of the Minister for External Affairs is a good one. We wish to have the friendship of other nations, and in obtaining that friendship Australia will be benefitted by better trade relationships. Causes of war between us and our immediate neighbours can be removed by economic means, and ultimately they, with us, will form a strong protective alliance. I therefore urge that honourable members on the Opposition benches of the House should review their attitude towards the defence programme of this Government. I believe that every man should be prehimself and the nation at any time. I believe in a system of national universal we are relying upon a voluntary system",37,International Affairs

The Government is tackling the matter of helping to provide power for the United Nations and must get the co-operation of the Opposition. The alternatives to many possible wars are wise economic relationships. The urgent immediate job of the Government is to pursue with all its vigour the matter of establishing better conditions and happier trade relationships with our near neighbours. We can help our neighbours because we have the goods they want, and the matter is merely one of arriving at a basis upon which help can be given. Australia can afford to be generous in view of its circumstances, and that generosity will be repaid over and over again so long as Ave do not stand out for our quid pro quo immediately. We shall have to make sacrifices if we are to maintain our position in the future. Let our immediate neighbours realize that they have a real friend in us, one who will offer tangible evidence of friendship, and they will become friendly towards us and will ultimately build such a bulwark around us that with their aid we shall be safe in the years ahead. as the Opposition is concerned, this debate has centred largely on the events in Korea, and what has arisen from those events. I propose to devote some time to this matter, because in following the speeches of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr last? I should like to remind honourable Fraser) I seemed to perceive in both their minds, particularly in that of the latter gentleman, a considerable confusion of thought. Tbe honourable member for Fremantle expressed his views as to the general set-up in South Korea before there was armed aggression from the north. He pointed out, quite rightly, that the governMacArthur issued following tbe surrender ments of both North Korea and South Korea were not quite in accordance with Australian ideas of democratic government and he also said, again quite accurately, that we cannot expect uneducated Eastern peoples who for many years have been governed by feudalistic methods to imbibe promptly western views relating to the processes of government. The honourable member made the further remark, which struck me as curious, that he did not like the general system of land tenure in existence in Korea, and he claimed that in some respects it was wrongfor the United States of America to intervene in that country after the end of World War II . Anybody who knows thefacts will recall that the United States of America intervened in Korea with theobject, not of itself setting up a government, but of setting up a government in accordance with recommendationsthat were made by a commission which the United Nations appointed for that purpose. In due course, the United Statesof America set up such a government. Obviously, it was out of the question for that country to impose upon South Korea a government of the type that it has been instrumental in establishing in Japan. That is the first thought that the honourable member's remarks aroused in my mind. Is it thinkable that when aggression in Korea has been crushed the United Nations should restore the status quo ante, that the United Nations forces should cease fighting when they reach the 38 th parallel which, incidentally, is merely a line on a map, and that we should permit an iron curtain to be drawn down along that line? Past events indicate that such a curtain would be rather thin. Is it suggested that North Korea should be allowed to restore the situation that existed before it launched its attack against .South Korea on the 25th June members of some of the events that occurred in Korea before that date. I believe that most of us will recall two important facts. The first is that the line of demarcation between North and South Korea was established at the 38th parallel under the first general order that General of the Japanese. Under that order it was decreed that all Japanese troops north of the 38th parallel were to surrender to the Russians and those south of it were to surrender to the American forces. Subsequently, partly in pursuance of the Potsdam Declaration, the United States of America and Russia by agreement in Moscow in 1945 undertook to engage in consultations with the object of setting up an independent, democratic government",38,International Affairs
93,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [5.28],"As farin Korea which was to be a free and independent State. A commission consisting of Bussian and American representatives was appointed to engage in consultations with representatives of the Korean people as a whole with the ultimate object of arranging for the election of a democratic government. However, we know what actually happened. The Russians caused a complete deadlock by refusing to receive representations from certain parties in South Korea which they contended were net democratic. Consequently, the members of the commission failed to reach agreement. Later, the United States of America appealed to the United Nations to appoint a commission to arrange for the election of a democratic government in Korea as a whole. But, again, the Russians caused a complete deadlock by refusing to allow members of that, commission to enter North Korea. In March, 1948, general elections were held in South Korea, and a government was formed more or le»ss of representatives of the right ancl centre parties which elected Dr. Syngman Rhee as president. In addition, one must have regard to the economic situation that developed in Korea. ""When the South Korean Government was established the North Koreans also set up a government which was recognized by Russia. curtain was drawn down between the north and the south. South Korea was denied all supplies from North Korea which, as honourable members know, contains the great bulk of the mineral resources, industries, water ancl irrigation schemes and sources of electric power and fertilizer. Consequently, South Korea was confronted with extreme economic difficulties which caused serious unemployment ancl discontent if not actual unrest in that territory. A t that stage the United States of America came into the. picture again by sending supplies and industrial plant and equipment to South Korea and within a year the position improved to such a degree that further general elections held in May, 1949, resulted in a slight ricrht. independents. of the 210 persons elected of 2,235 candidates were independents, the new parliament supported D r . Syngman Rhee as president, and it can be said that the general complexion of the new parliament was that of the right. There was no evidence of Communist sympathies among the South Koreans. In fact, the improvement of the economic position in South Korea was favourably commented upon even by North Koreans, among whom, I am informed, that knowledge caused considerable discontent because in North Korea conditions were much worse. In the meantime, events in North Korea followed a somewhat different course. In talks that I had with the American authorities in Japan when I visited that country about two years ago I was informed that on the military side all that the South Koreans did was to set up a police force which was more or less casually armed, but, at the same time, the Russians had summoned representatives of the North Korean Government to Moscowi n March, 1949, and given them their brief. The Russians told them what they were to clo. Subsequently, the North Koreans set up a general staff. M i l it a r y units were formed and equipped with the latest Russian weapons, and, in addition, Koreans who had fought with the Chinese Communist army were Then a brought back to North Korea and formed the nucleus of a powerful army which was not, only well equipped and well trained but also consisted largely of troops that had had actual battle experience. That, was the position that existed when the North Koreans attacked the south on the 25 th June last. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Fraser), apparently, believes that when the Communists who have now been defeated have been mopped up they should be allowed to return to North Korea and that fighting should come to a f u l l stop at the 38th parallel. It would be quite impracticable to permit the re-establishment of a situation of the kind that led to the recent serious disturbance of the peace of the world. I swing to the agree that it will be very difficult to deal with a country, particularly an eastern swing to the country, except through the United Nations.

95,Mr Ryan,"Althoughbelieve that the conflict has not been extended simply because the TJnited Nations took the initiative so promptly when hostilities broke out. If a real settlement is to be reached tbe United Nations must take control of Korea as a whole until law and order have been re-established and a new regime has been set up. The honorablo member for Eden-Monaro naively asked why the conflict should not be stopped immediately and arrangements made for the holding of elections. It is clear that elections for Korea as a whole cannot be held under present conditions. 'Ihe object of the United Nations' intervention is to clean up the situation and ensure the establishment of a united, free and independent Korea. Eor reasons which I shall now discuss, only the United Nations can achieve that goal. It is true, as has been pointed out in this House on several occasions, that a nationalistic spirit has been aroused among all the Eastern nations. They remember what they describe as their exploitation in the past by the white man. Throughout the East to-day there is a general dislike, to put the matter mildly, and real hatred in some instances, of the white man, regardless of nationality. The Eastern peoples remember their domination by the white races in the past. Therefore, however altruistic any white nation may be in its approach to Eastern Nations and wliatever it may do to help Eastern peoples, tbeir feelings will be whipped up on the score that the white man is again seeking to establish supremacy over Asiatic peoples. In . these circumstances the United Nations, which insists on justice for not only the white man but also peoples of all colours, for Asiatics as well as for Europeans, is the only body that can achieve results. I suggest that the United Nations should appoint a commission to report upon the Korean situation. Such a body might be presided over by an Indian or a Pakistan Ian or, at any rate, a representative of one of the eastern nations which should have substantia] representation on it. representatives. lionorable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) that Australians may be less suspect in the East than is any other white nation because we have never had any imperialistic aims. However, the United Nations should appoint a commission of the kind that I have suggested, and I should hope that, perhaps, an Indian would be prepared to accept the presidency of that body. If that is done, we may have some hope of obtaining a solution in Korea that will be satisfactory not only to the Koreans, who, I suppose, will have to be satisfied with whatever happens, but also to the masses in eastern Asia. They are the people in whom we should endeavour to instil a feeling of confidence in the value of the United Nations. That organization has been weak on some occasions, and strong on other occasions, but no one can accuse it of having any imperialist ideas. As we all know, its principal purpose is to maintain peace, if necessary by force of arms. A peaceful settlement can be achieved in Asia, and above all, in Korea, only through the United Nations. That thought brings me to another matter. I speak not idealistically but very realistically, because I have an intimate knowledge of some of the problems of the world. I believe that if the influence of the United Nations can be brought to bear on them through the medium of commissions, and, if necessary, by force-again , that remark applies particularly to Asiatic and African problems-greate r success will be achieved in tbe long run than will be possible if an attempt is made to solve the difficulties through the medium of the ""Western democracies. All of us are, to some degree, suspect in the eyes of many nations.. So long as people are suspect, they can never gain the results that can be accomplished by others in whom the peoples concerned have faith. The honourable member for Eden Monaro, in his concluding remarks, appeared to me almost to speak through the mouth of a member of one of the well known peace councils. I consider that the honourable gentleman put forward Soviet Russia's case, not because I believe that he has any great sympathy for Russia that the honourable member for Eden Monaro has any great sympathy for",40,International Affairs

99,,"I agree with the right Mr Ryan I really do not thinkRussia, but be appeared to me to put forward that country's case. I listened closely to bis remarks, and it seemed to me that be did not understand the true position in relation to the Soviet. He spoke of Russia's fear that the Western democracies might launch a heavy attack upon it. A9 he was developing that theme, I said to myself, "" How can anybody, even the Eussians believe that story ?"" One has only to examine cursorily the military position of the Western democracies compared with that of Russia to realize that the Soviet has no reason to fear an attack. We are almost ""bone dry"" of military strength. That remark is definitely applicable to Australia, largely to Great Britain, to a considerable degree to the TJnited States of America, and, above all, to Europe. At: present, the Western democracies in Europe could raise, at a pinch, about twelve divisions and a few aircraft. That is a'bout the limit of their strength. Yet Russia, as is well known, has a minimum of 175 divisions, and an air force so great that one is almost too frightened to mention it-five air armies totalling more than 40,000 aircraft-and that force is adding to its numbers every day. As the honourable member for Denison( Mr that should be approached, if posTownley) has stated, the Soviet also possesses a large and powerful fleet of submarines. With those overwhelming forces confronting the weak Western democracies, what has Russia to fear from any nation or group of nations ? [Extension of time granted.] I thank the House for its courtesy. Some people believe that the possession of the atomic bomb by the TJnited States of America is the only factor that deters the Soviet from unleashing its forces against Western Europe. Yet Russia also has the atomic bomb. I believe that the Soviet TJnion could not be defeated by atomic bombing alone. Of course, that kind of warfare might make Russia a most unpleasant place for the Russians themselves, but no conclusive military result could be obtained by its use. It just would not be possible. Eor those reasons, I believe that the rulers of Russia do not fear an attack on their country by the Western democracies, and cannot fear that their military strength will be overwhelmed by atomic bombs. The Russians know just as well as we do that such a result is simply not possible. When the honourable member for Eden Monaro speaks of Russia's fear of attack, he sees the situation in reverse. The truth of the matter is that Russia is badly informed about the conditions of the democracies, and believes that they are decadent. It considers that our themselves, systems of government will crash, and is quite prepared to give them the final push when it thinks that the time is ripe to do so. But fear us ? Not on your life! Sitting suspended from 5.52 to 8 p.m. [8.0] -This is a subject that the House should approach with a sense of imminence and realism. It is much more important, even though it is not nearer to us, than is any other subject that we have debated. Other subjects concern merely our livelihoods, but this concerns our very lives. Let nobody think that our lives are not threatened, and threatened at no distant date! Only by the correct estimation and implementation of foreign policy can we, not as a people and not as a system but as individuals, hope to survive. Yet this is a subject sible, without heat and without fervour, but with cold and dispassionate logic. One regrets that epithets such as "" war-mongers "" should be bandied about this chamber.. After all, the people who are raising that cry now were shouting ""war-mongers"" in 1936 and 1937 at those of us who were endeavouring then to stir up some kind of opposition to the growth of nazi-ism in Germany. Who were the real war-mongers? Were they the people who thought that Hitler should have been stopped in 1936 or 1937, when he could have been stopped without war, or, at the worse, with only a little war, or were they not the people who counselled appeasement? The supporters of appeasement described themselves as the makers of peace, but they made war. Two main concepts in relation to international affairs have been expounded in this House, and the difference between them marks one of the great changes that occurred when the present Government assumed office. I consider that the change in the direction of our foreign",41,International Affairs
100,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar),"policy was one of the most notable features of the change of government. That change of policy direction was made because we on this side of the House had a certain basic concept that was different from that which had animated the foreign policy of the Labour Government. The Labour Goverument considered that Russia was good at heart and that Stalin, though a little misguided perhaps, was really rather a nice type fundamentally. It believed that all that the democracies had to do in order to ensure world peace and harmony was to kid him along until his rough corners were rubbed off and then all would be for the best in the best, of all possible worlds. This Government, on the contrary, believes that although the Russian people are not our enemies, the men who rule and control the Russian people are a gang of criminals of a viciousness unprecedented in historyworse even than Hitler, if that be possible. We regard Stalin as a thoroughgoing, irreconcilable villain. The Labour Government looked upon him as somebody who could be talked into tlie course of common sense. The view of the Labour party can be epitomized conveniently in the words of thu man whom it put forward as the leader of Australia's foreign policy. 1 refer, of course, to the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), who was Minister for External Affairs in the former Government. I shall quote a passage from a statement that he made in this House when reviewing our relations with Russia. He saidThe real question is, not wliether the Soviet Union territory and zones of influence have expanded, but what is the underlying intention and purpose of the Soviet Union. Isi t to secure tlie political domination of other countries, or is it merely to protect Russia against any repetition of the so-called cordon sanitavre which united all reactionary influence in Europe against her during the period between the two great wars? . . . that the Soviet Union's policy is directed towards self-protection and security against future attack. In my opinion, her desire is to develop her own economy and to improve the welfare of her peoples. The speech contained much more to the conflict. But a great world conflict was same effect. Admittedly that quotation what Stalin wanted, and because of that dates back to 1946, but it would not be he played for time. We lost time becanse difficult to demonstrate, by reference to we allowed Stalin to waste it deliberately. later utterances and actions of the right He kept us talking while he was arming honourable gentleman, that he maintained atomically and preparing tbe means for Mr ""Wentworth. that line almost consistently to the end of his term of office. That line still is basically the Labour line. I have only to refer to the speech that was made this afternoon by the houorable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) in order to support my statement. Although he may not have repeated the same sentiments verbatim, that honourable gentleman nevertheless drew inferences that could have been drawn only from the basic supposition about Russia that was enunciated by the right honourable member for Barton in 1946. The observations of the honourable member for EdeuMonaro usually follow the Soviet linewhether by accident, by design or because of his inherent nature I do not know; I simply record the fact. Once that initial premise so clearly stated by the former Minister for External Affairs is accepted, the whole foreign policy of the Labour party follows logically. Unfortunately that basic misconception, which strikes not only at Australia but also at the rest of the world, was preached, not from the small stage here in Canberra, but from the world stage because of the unfortunate accident of historv that elevated its propounder to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations. It was in the two vital years when he was first gaining power and later acting as president of the General Assembly of the United Nations that the damage was done and the time was lost. We stood then in a period that was analogous to that of 1936 and 1937 in relation to Hitler. War could have been avoided or, at the worse, there would have been only a little war if we had but acted with resolution. case represents the United Nations, of which Australia is a member and of I take the view tbe General Assembly of which tbe right honourable member for Barton at that time was the President.

To-day we stand, not in the position' of 1936 and 1937, but in the position of 1938, or perhaps even of early 1939. That is where the clock stands. The certainty of settling our differences peacefully has now been irrevocably lost stiil a small chance of a peaceful settlement, but the disasti-ous exchange of certainty foichance must be laid at the -door of the right honourable member for Barton, who, I believe, is the only Australian in history as yet who bas been able to do damage upon a world scale. When the history of these times is written, if it be written anywhere else than in the Kremlin, the man who will appear as the villain of irresolution w ill be the right honourable member for Barton. I have never said that the right honourable gentleman was a Communist. I do not believe that he is a Communist, but I do believe that he has been a Soviet stooge. I do not believe that he adopted that role deliberately, but he has been made use of by adroit men working behind the scenes. If one reads the statements that were issued in his name during the late years of the war and the early years of the peace, one finds that they were f u l l of phrases and jargon peculiar to communism. That little phrase about ""reactionary influence"" that I quoted earlier is typical. How aptly it falls into place; it might be a phrase lifted direct from the Tribunal] example. A single phrase, of course, would not give a positive indication, but hundreds of such phrases are to be found in statements that have been made by the right honourable gentleman. I have not the .slightest doubt that, although he may not have known what was being done to him, Communist hands were directing his policy when he was the Ministerf o r External Affairs. Whether by accident, by design or because of his inherent nature, that policy fitted almost exactly into the pattern of world aggrandizement that. Stalin was planning. member is only making a laughing stock of himself. be more pleased than I if I were making a laughing stock of myself. Unhappily 1 believe that my statements are true. Within a few years Russia w ill have suflicient atomic stocks to destroy completely every large city in the world within ten minutes of the outbreak of war and that destruction might occur ten minutes before or after the outbreak There is of war. Fortunately, Russia is not j'et in that position. The prognostication that I have made will not be fulfilled in 1950, of course. The point that I am endeavouring to emphasize, however, is that if the present d r if t continues, Russia will be in a positionto deliver a mortal attack on us in 1953, 1954 or the following year. One cannot foretell the exact year, although we all can see quite clearly the pattern of coming events. On the night of the outbreak of the Korean conflict no one in Sydney need have lost an hour's sleep because of fear for his own personal safety. Nothing could have happened to Sydney. However, if another international "" incident "" were to occur three years hence-and it migbt not even take the form of an armed conflict-n o one in Sydney could go to bed with the certainty that he would wake up in the morning. Atomic missiles, as the honourable member for Denison( Mr Townley) pointed out, could be rained on us from submarines without any formal declaration of war, and they would be capable of razing -the City of Sydney and probably of inflicting casualities on 95 per cent, of the popuNor is it a solitary lation. honourable member's solution of the difficulty? to tbe honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron). I shall give my solution in a moment. The position that confronts us now is the consequence of our failure to seize the golden opportunities that were available to us in 1947 and 1948. Those opportunities were lost because of the dithering in which the right honourable member for Barton played sucb a conspicuous part. However, the question that confronts us now is, what can we do to avert war?

106,Mr Wentworth,"I am obligedmoment ago. It is not.sufficient merely to study a problem, and leave it at that. We should at least attempt to form some clear picture of the way in which we should go. I shall put forward a course of action for the consideration of honourable members, although I do not say that my proposal is necessarily the best course. Other honourable members may know of better courses. However, it is only too clear that the world is rushing rapidly to disaster, and that many people do not perceive the danger because they are unwilling to think of the menace that confronts us. Disaster will be inevitable unless we can bring about world disarmament, including disarmament of atomic weapons. typically Communist "" line "" ! nothing short of the establishment of a world authority with power to inspect atoinic plants, weapons and stock-piles, and armed with the necessary sanctions to enforce its will on the nations, will suffice. The TJnited Nations cannot enforce its will on Russia because of the paralyzing effect of the veto which Russia wields in the Security Council. However, I confess that I do not believe that world disarmament can be achieved by any organization other than the United Nations, and, in anj' event, in the short time that is left to us to protect ourselves I do not think that we shall have the opportunity to establish any alternative organization. As the United Nations exists at the moment it is incapable of taking resolute action because of the paralysing effect of the veto in tbe Security Council. I was interested to hear a member of the Opposition comment a little while ago that I was adopting a typically Communist line of argument. [Extension of time granted.'] I do not believe that we can act effectively through any organization but the United Nations. The Communist "" line"" in this case is a very clever one, that is, it is one which characteristic of tbe spirit of frustration seems to go in the rigbt direction, and then veers off. Tbe Russians advocate, "" Act through bhe United Nations"" ; but what they really mean is, "" A ct through the United Nations because the United Nations is hamstrung by the veto power They advocate atomic disarmament, when what they really mean is nothing more than nominal disarmament without adequate powers of inspection and enforcement. They start off by saying something that is true, and then, using the normal Communist technique, they give the truth a twist in order to prevent the people who are the objects of their propaganda from taking the normal path. We must place the United Nations in such a position of strength, that it can enforce atomic disarmament. I have already pointed out that the power of veto exercisable in the Security Council of the United Nations renders that organization useless for this purpose. I do not .need to go beyond the Korean ness of that assertion. We were able to intervene effectively in Korea only because of 'something wbich the right honourable member for Barton has described as an historical accident. In other words, Russia's representatives had withdrawn from the Security Council wben the vital debates on Korea took place. Erom the reports of the discussions that are now taking place in the Security Council of the United Nationsi t would seem that the impotence of that organization has at last been recognized, and it is now proposed to overcome bhe difficulty by a scheme that is really nothing more than an extension of the "" little assembly "" proposal that was put forward a few years ago. The proposal is that the Security Council shall he by-passed and the General Assembly kept in constant session so bhat action will emanate from the latter body, in which the power of veto does not operate. Tbat is a good proposal as far as it goes. It bas, however, the fundamental defect that it can only be implemented if we are prepared to take the initiative in connection with this Russian question. In other words, the situation that will probably develop in the General Assembly will be that marred the Atomic Energy Commission in the palmy days of the right honourable member for Barton. Although that organization was in continuous session, the Soviet representatives were able to prewwvt the commission from making any",44,International Affairs

108,Mr Wentworth,"I repeat thateffective inspection of atomic plants. Therefore, I say that the proposal based on an extension of the idea of a "" little assembly "" may well fall short of what is needed despite its many appealing features. The only hope of success for such a proposal would lie in the development of the new General Assembly on lines quite different from those of the Atomic Energy Commission, so that it would not be marred by a repetition of the happenings of 1947 and 1948. Certainly the proposal holds out some hope for mankind, but we cannot say yet with any certainty that it is right. My personal feeling is that no action which falls short of expelling the criminal Eussia from the TJnited Nations will be adequate to meet the present position. If world disaster is to be avoided the United Nations must now demand complete atomic disarmament; not "" phoney "" disarmament, but disarmament subject to sanctions and enforced by an adequate international inspection force operating in Russia and throughout the world. Anything short of that will be useless arid will inevitably lead to disaster. tions which the honourable member is putting forward original, or are they merely something that he has read about? inember for Hindmarsh knows perfectly well, or at least he ought to know that matters such as those which I have just been discussing have been widely canvassed. It seems to me that what we should do now is to demand world disarmament and free the United Nations of the restraints inherent in the veto power, so that that body can enforce practical disarmament. WhilstI believe that the United Nations is the onlybody tliat can achieve disarmament, I do not hold that view so tenaciously as I adhere to my belief that Russia should be expelled from the United Nations. However, if we could free the United Nations of the restriction imposed by the "" veto "" power we might be able to establish a force do so or not I cannot say, that Avar was that would be effective in preserving world peace. honourable member's own argument, would commence war straight away. Later in not the Russian representatives in the United Nations veto any such proposal? to the honourable member for Hindmarsh for his inquiry, because it affords me an opportunity to remind the House that the expulsion of a member nation from the United Nations is one matter that is not subject to the exercise of the veto power. I certainly believe that it is most important that we sbould not accord diplomatic recognition to ""Red"" China at the present moment and that it would be utter folly for us to agree to the Chinese Communist Government being represented in the United Nations. If the Chinese Communists were admitted to the United Nations they would be entitled, as a major power, to a seat on tbe Security Council. The consequence would be that the Communists would then have two veto votes, one exercisable by criminal Russia and the other at the disposal of its accomplice, Red China. If the Chinese Communist Government were admitted to the United Nations, the proposal to bypass the Security Council and to utilize the General Assembly to promote the interests of world peace might not be capable of implementation. However, I feel that it is idle to spend any further time discussing Communist China's admission to the United Nations when we are confronted with such life-and-death issues as atomic disarmament, because our survival will depend upon the banishment of atomic weapons. All such matters are of far more importance to us than the application of Communist China to be permitted to join the United Nations. In conclusion I thank the House for its indulgence in granting me an extension of time. found it somewhat difficult in the early stages of the speech just concluded by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) to decide exactly where he stood on foreign affairs.

113,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [8.30],"Ihis speech, however, he made his position somewhat clearer, and I obtained a better idea of what he was driving at. sincerely regret that the honourable member for Mackellar attacked, for what motive I do not know, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt). 1 consider that, in fairness to that right honorin a discussion of this description an able member, who has already spoken in this debate and therefore is unable to reply on his own behalf, and also in order that his reputation shall not be clouded even by irresponsible remarks, I should remind the House of several features of the right honourable member's record. He participated at San Erancisco in the founding of the United Nations and was, in fact, the most outstanding opponent of the introduction of the veto system that was adopted by that conference. Right along the line he has consistently fought against the application of the veto. So apparently the honourable member for Mackellar and the right honourable member for Barton are unanimous on the point that the veto should not operate. It also should be pointed out that one of tbe outstanding features of tbe work performed by the right bonorable member for Barton at the San Francisco conference was his advocacy of the recognition of the rights of the small nations and of the desirability of giving them the opportunity to express themselves on world affairs in a manner calculated to increase the possibility of world peace. I suppose that the greatest tribute that could be paid to the right honourable member was the adoption by the honourable member for Mackellar of the very proposals that were placed before the United Nations by the right honourable member five years ago-that atomic disarmament ancl other forms of disarmament should be subject to control by the United Nations in all the countries associated with that organization. I also remind the House, and the honourable member for MackeUar in particular, of the outstanding work that was done by the right honourable member for Barton in connection with both the Palestine dispute and the Indonesian dispute. I also point out that he received the personal thanks of the Governments of the United States of America, Britain and other countries ilr. Clarey. for his services as President of the United Nations General Assembly. If I there is one man who has earned the appreciation of those associated with the United Nations, it is the right honourable member for Barton. I consider that it was very indiscreet, to say the least, that honourable member should have taken the opportunity to make an attack upon the right honourable member for Barton. One bright feature that faces mankind as the result of World War II . is the existence of the United Nations organization. Another bright feature is the fact that that organization has been able to demonstrate such strength of purpose in connection wi th the suppression of aggression. It is a fine tribute to the work of the United Nations that this House should have approved unanimously the action of the Government in making forces available to that organization for service in Korea. The fact that the United Nations has met, in a determined and persistent manner; its obligation to resist aggression wherever it may appear, constitutes, in my opinion, one of the greatest hopes for peace in the world. If the 60 nations which constitute the United Nations are prepared to make it clear in a resolute manner that they will take action to resist aggression, to protect those whose territory is invaded, and to compel aggressors to cease their efforts, we shall have a much greater chance of achieving and maintaining peace in the world than we should have if we carried out the suggestion of the honourable member for Mackellar that the best way to achieve peace, is to expel from the United Nations those nations with whom we are in disagreement. That is not the way to peace. Had tbe policy of the League of Nations 'been based upon the same resolute determination as is being expressed by the United Nations, there would have been a big possibility that World War II . would not have occurred. But when the League of Nations allowed the invasions of Abyssinia, Manchuria and China to go unchecked, it gave a very clear indication that, although it was equipped with the power to impose sanctions as well as to raise forces to resist aggression, it was not a body that was capable of carrying out the very great responsibilities i m posed upon it . To-day we can say with justification that the TJnited Nations has endeavoured to bring about peace by mediation in various parts of the world. That organization has taken the necessary action in Korea and, as a consequence, the peace-loving nations of the world have indicated that they are prepared to ensure that aggression shall be stopped, if necessary by the shedding of the blood of their own peoples. It seems to me that the next step that should be taken by the United Nations is that of determining what are the responsibilities that are to be undertaken by each of the 60 constituent nations in respect of any fresh aggression. Action taken along tliose lines, involving the adoption of a far-reaching policy laying down the responsibilities of each nation, would of itself be the best indication possible to all the nations of the world that the United Nations is determined, and prepared to make the necessary arrangements, to see that future aggression shall be properly resisted. I suggest that as f a r as Australia is concerned-and indeed this might also be said of any other nation-mer e support of the United Nations is not in itself suflicient to meet our needs. We, in this country, are more vitally concerned with what is transpiring in Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific than we are with events in Europe or America. For that reason it is necessary for this country to adopt a policy in connection with its own internal affairs that will assist in thc maintenance of peace through the defence and development of this country. suggest to the House that Australia, as an island nation, has problems perhaps greater than those of any other nation in the world. We have a land area that is only about 25,000 square miles less than that of the United States. Our coast line extends for more than 12,000 miles, and a large section of our country is under-populated. We have a tremendous developmental programme to carry out. From the stand-point of the defence of this coimtry we are hopelessly underpopulated. We can find no solution of the external problems that face this country unless at the same time we f u l l y appraise the internal difiiculties and problems that we have to overcome. I suggest, therefore, that the policy that should be followed in Australia should provide, first of all, for the proper development of this country. That policy should be combined witb a defence policy that will be suitable and applicable to our present conditions of development, and with a foreign policy that will aim at achieving peace and goodwill with our neighbours. A further factor that we have to consider is the suggestion by some people that this country has to face the possibility of either imminent invasion Qr aggression from countries to our north or elsewhere in the Pacific. L find it hard to conceive that that is an immediate possibility, because an aggressor would require ample ships, ample arms, standing armies and a capacity to reach this country, in order to invade it . western democracy were to go down in Europe? the 'honourable member has mentioned by way of interjection took place to-morrow, and assuming that we had every man under the age of 40 under arms, would vve be able to defend Australia if a large and powerful nation invaded it? Beforr honourable members opposite talk about what might happen elsewhere in the world they should consider the position that Australia is in to-day with a population of S,000,0.00 people and a great land area and a long coastline to defend. Unless we had the mean's of being self I contained and of providing all the things necessary for our defence, even if we had the means of defence and bad half our population under arms, it would be extremely difficult for us to defend this country. assistance from the United Nations. wbo make interjections sbould realize that when they say "" western democracy"" they are also saying "" the United Nations"".

The mere making of interjections, does not assist in a conexpect aggression from countries with sideration of this matter. Our problems must be understood and examined. We have a population of 8,000,000 and a vast area of country to defend. It is necessary to develop this country so as to enable it to .produce the proper means of defence. Unless we do so we shall have no possibility of defending ourselves. 1914 and 1939. started, in 1939, we sent our forces out of this country and in 1941 and 1942, because of the imminent danger of invasion, it wa3 necessary to bring these well-armed, well-trained and well-seasoned troops back to defend this country. Honourable members interjecting, interjections must cease. that at the beginning of the last war we sent our very best men out of our country, quite rightly and properly we believe, in order to resist aggression overseas but that world will be greatly aided if this country it was necessary to recall them to defend Australia itself from aggression. With an island continent which has a small population, and a large coastline, and which presents great dimculty in providing all the things necessary for the maintralia can assist both Asiatic and Pacific tenance of safety during a war, one has to concentrate on the development of those factors inside the country that will afford safety and security against aggression. It would be foolish to overlook those problems and we cannot escape them merely by walking out of the chamber. What do the people of Australia want? They want security, the right to live their will. There should be a clear recognition own way of life, and freedom from aggression. The question, then, arises as to what foreign policy the Government should adopt in order to secure those three things. It is vital for the Ausneighbours, otherwise they cannot have security. I therefore suggest that the Government must follow a positive and direct policy whicb will develop goodwill and understanding. I suggest that this country does not need defence pacts three countries seem to infer that they which they have not entered into defence pacts. This country requires non-aggression pacts with its neighbours which will make it known that we are prepared to respect their rights of self-government and assist them in the development of their country and whicb will result in the avoidance of aggression on their part and ours so that there shall be mutual understanding and mutual efforts for the establishment of goodwill. It is essential for Australia to state its friendship in genuine terms to the countries of the Pacific, South-East Asia and Asia. Those nations do not wish to be patronized or to be the objects of condescending action, but, they do appreciate goodwill, understanding and a genuine desire to assist them in the problems whicb beset tbeir communities. There is no better way of arriving at a peaceful understanding with one's neighbours than by indicating in a practical form one's wish to assist them in their problems. The peace of the can assist in the improvement of the living standards of tbe people of Asia and the Pacific. [Extension of time granted.] I suggest that one way in which Auscountries is by making greater facilities of education available in Australia to the people of those countries. That is being done to a large extent by the subsidiary organization of the United Nations known as Unesco but a considerable extension of all forms of educational facilities to these Asiatic and Pacific countries would greatly stimulate goodby Australia of the self-governing rights of people in the Pacific and in Asia.

121,Mr Clarey,"We must bear in mindgranting to India, Pakistan and Burma the right of self-government. That action has enabled certain portions of Asia to proceed with the establishment of their own governments and, as a result, has prevented conflicts which might have taken place in those areas. There is an awakening in the East and the Pacific. There is in those countries a desire for self-government which is being freely expressed. I think it is essential for the Government to state that Australia recognizes the rights of other countries to choose the class of government that will give them the best results. To resist self-government in other countries is to engender hostility. If , by action on the lines that I have suggested, this country is able to indicate to the Asiatic and Pacific nations that it is anxious to help them in their development and to see that they assume the government of their own countries and take their place in the councils of the world, we shall be doing much to ensure peace in the future.

Are honourable members on the Opposition side content to come into this chamber and debate matters, then go to the bar for a drink and then come back here for more debating, or have they a responsibility to their fellow men behind the Iron Curtain? Do honourable members opposite intend to leave millions of people behind the Iron possibility of peace in the world. The Curtain without attempting to alleviate their sufferings? enough not to consider others then perhaps they should consider how they themselves may be affected. Both the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) said that defence is an integral part of our foreign policy. That policy is taken from a leaf of the Russian book, because the Russians use their powerful army as a part of their foreign policy. Yesterday throughout the metropolitan press of Australia full-page advertisements appeared signed by the Prime Minister. Those advertisements did not exaggerate the danger to Australia. The Prime Minister has returned from a trip overseas where he was able to see and hear things which enabled him to form a. correct opinion on world affairs. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) said that we should, resist aggression. I ask him, with what shall we resist it? The honourable member for Mr Charles Anderson. Bendigo said that it was right and proper that we should resist aggression. I also ask him, with what shall we resist it? There can be no resistance without a defence force. The line taken by honourable members opposite is in the nature of a tragedy. I ask them to consider the astronomical The Russian peasant comamounts being expended on defence by America.

Although the North Atlantic Pact is our. present hope, it does not take the place of the United Nations, being merely complementary to that body. Yesterday thc Minister for External Affairs submitted to the United Nations a motion inviting member nations to supply evidence of the failure of Roumania, Bulgaria and Hungary to fulfil their treaty obligations. That is an attempt to form world opinion, but what value will such world opinion have if the Iron Curtain effectively prevents any information from, being published there. As long as there is an iron curtain which prevents the movement of thought and opinion there will he no only reason why there has not been a If they are selfish war before this is that America has had a stock pile of atomic bombs. The democracies lie wide open except for that stock pile. But behind the Iron Curtain there is great activity. Are the Russians to be given years more of time to develop their atoinic weapons and their methods of bacteriological warfare? It is an axiom tliat a new weapon is soon countered by another. In time a counter to the atomic bomb will be found, and perhaps it will be found by the Russians. All that the Government is asking at present is that the defences of Australia shall be improved. That cannot be done without sacrifice ancl through harder work, vvith everybody playing his part as the Prime Minister has requested. It makes me angry when people say that our first task is to develop this country, and then loaf on the 40-hour week while all our production is destroyed by Communists. Should we say, ""-Develop our country while conscripts from England and America fight our battles "" ? We have responsibilities to the TJnited Nations and we must carry them. I foresee the time when we shall become tired of the continual threat of war. Supposing that we re-arm in the hope that the Russian system will change before the need arises to use those arms, and go on arming while there are a thousand things left undone that could be done to better the lot of mankind. I cannot see why, as soon as we are strong enough, we cannot take stronger action and demand in places like Czechoslovakia that a plebiscite be held under the auspices of the TJnited Nations to decide whether or not the people are satisfied with their government. Why not take the initiative from Russia, because if we are strong there will not be a war? The United Nations must fulfil its obligations and there is no reason why a plebiscite should not be taken in, for a start, say, Poland and Czechoslovakia. We cannot live for ever with a threat of war hanging over our heads. People are seldom benefited by historical events in their own generation, hut events have moved very fast in the last few years and we all remember the history of Hitler and Stalin, which proved that appeasement is absolutely useless, and that any one who advocates it is a menace to liis race. If we remain strong, and back our foreign policy with our armed force, war is not inevitable. [9.7] I wish to refer to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). He made a most remarkable speech, one of the most remarkable of all his remarkable speeches in this House, and one that caused a great deal of consternation among his own followers, if I am correct in my judgment of the reason for facial expressions of honourable members on tbe Government side. It was a speech that consisted mainly of a violent personal attack on the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt). It reminded me of a similar speech that the honourable member delivered not long ago when he made a similar attack ahle member cannot refer to a debate which took place during this session of the Parliament. Mr Speaker. That attack upon the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) probably occupied 'the mind of tbe Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) when he was abroad. Possibly the Prime Minister, in a prophetic state of mind, was able to foresee the shape of things to come, because we find this report in the Adelaide News of the 5th August, 1950The United Nations secretary-general ( Mr TrygveL i e ) , fresh from a security council meeting at Lake Success, engaged Mr Menzies is earnest private conversation for ten minutes after he arrived late at a reception here this evening. He and Mr Menzies talked oblivious of the other 80 guests, whom the Australian Consul General (Lieut -General E. K . Smart) had invited to meet Mr Menzies at his New York Hat. I have been wondering whether the Prime Minister might have been discussing with Mr Trygve Lie some of the statements made about him by the honourable member for Mackellar some time ago in King's Hall. It is well known that the attitude of the honourable member for Mackellar towards Mr Trygve Lie is one of complete contempt and hostility; this he has made known on more than one occasion. One of the most remarkable suggestions made by the honourable member was that the Soviet members were criminals and because of that they Should be excluded from the United Nations. Having so excluded them, he said, the United Nations should control atomic stock piles and engage in and enforce a system of world disarmament. How could the United Nations possibly succeed in disarming the world if a large section of the world were excluded from the United Nations before it started to supervise the world ? The honourable member for Hume( Mr Charles Anderson) stated that it was wrong for this country to continue to develop its resources with men loafing on a 40-hour week. Just imagine a statement like that coming from an honourable member of this House, a statement that the people of Australia are loafing and are no more nor less than a pack of loafers.",50,Cameron Tha T Is A Affair For An Illustration Of The Correct

125,Mr Clyde Cameron,"Very well,a good many who are loafing. honourable memher says that a good many are loafing. The real loafers in this country are not the people to whom the honorahle member refers, that is, the working people whom I have the great honour to represent, but those who profit from the system that is operating here and is causing the international difliculty that is facing all the western democracies. The problems of the world to-day will not be solved by rabble-rousing attacks by members of the Government side. Those problems cannot be solved by making accusations against the working class. Nor can they be solved by the sabre rattling of tbe honourable member for Mackellar nor by the mock attacks that the honourable member made one night when he arrested Field-Marshal Blarney in his bed. The only way in which the problem can be solved is by attacking the causes of communism. Those causes throughout the world, including Australia, arise from the evils of monopoly capitalism. honourable member had better keep to the subject, which is foreign affairs. Nehru, who often expresses his opinion on foreign affairs, was reported in the Adelaide Advertiser of the 21st August, 1950, as follows:"" In tlie west tlmre is a lot of .talk about government and ensuring that their goCommumisni and the Communist danger, and there is a great deal in it. However, the average Asian cannot be swept away by the cry of Communist danger, because he has not so much to lose"". Mr Nehru said that the west should abandon its condemnation of Communism as such and take up political and economic, freedom as a more effective rallying cry, I thinlc that Pandit Nehru exposed the whole core of the situation when he said that it was of no use for us to scream our heads off about communism and about the evils that confront us to-day from international communism, but that we should pay some attention to the causes of communism. The honourable member for Hume said that red China was a satellite of Soviet Russia. I am one who does not believe that to be the case. I may be wrong, but I believe it to be impossible for anybody to assert justifiably that 460,000,000 the Soviet TJnion, which has a population of something less tban 200,000,000. come that. has happened is that tbe Chinese people have acquiesced in a movement led by a small section of the Chinese against the corrupt and putrid Chiang Kai-shek regime. The 460,000,000 people in China are not Communists. Indeed, they do not know anything about communism. Mao Tse-tung would not have succeeded in ejecting the Chiang Kai-shek Government bad that Government shown any regard for the welfare of the ordinary Chinese people. A similar situation existed in India, French Indo China. Burma and tbe Philippines, where, at some period during the last 20 or 30 years, governments which showed no consideration at all for tbe common people bad been in power. Instead of wasting thousands of lives, and expending hundreds of millions of pounds, in attempting to prevent tbe spread of communism in Asia, Australia and other democratic countries should avert such further loss of lives by expending money for the purpose of curing the causes of communism, wihich can be effectively combatted by giving to the Asiatic peoples some semblance of selfvernments sball be fair and efficient. I venture to say that had it not been for the timely action of the Attlee Socialist Government in England in giving self government to Burma, Pakistan and India, those former British dominions would now be completely under Communist control. tries, in Asia have not"" self-government ?

133,Mr Clyde Cameron,"First,Korea was supposed to have self-government, and the people of that territory were supposed to have the right to elect their own government, the fact remains that only one party, a la the real Eussian style, was permitted to nominate candidates. In Soutb. Korea, something like 1.40 parties were permitted to nominate candidates, butfchatdid not mean that the South Koreans, from a democratic viewpoint, were so many times better off than North Koreans. South Korea? Just prior to the last general election held in that country at least half the candidates were arrested by the fascist police force that then conby introducing in those countries to trolled 'South Korea and many of them were executed because they had dared to nominate for election to Parliament. does the honourable member make that statement? authority of bhe report of the royal commission that was appointed by the TJnited Nations to investigate conditions in South Korea. That report is available in the Library and may be perused by any honourable member. A similar position arose in Kashmir. That province looked like going Communist but was prevented from doing so by action taken by Sheik Abdullah, who, realizing the demand of the Asiatic peoples to control their lands, years have shown that the Australian Labour decided to confiscate all holdings in Kashmir of an area in excess of 125 acres. Observers say that that announcement was probably prompted by reports that a Communist-organized army was gaining the support of the peasants who had been complaining that the Kashmir Government's land redistribution programme was being delayed. Plainly, the real cause of international communism must be laid at the door of monopoly capitalism, the imperialism that has been allowed full play in Asiatic countries for the last 200 years. The peoples of those countries aTe fed up with being exploited by European imperialists. For too long have they merely been told that they are to be given self-government. demanding self-government. It is sheer waste of time on our part to talk about defeating communism by arms and by the use of the atom bomb. Unless we deal with the root causes of communism and give to the peoples of Asia the right to live decently we shall not defeat .communism. Let us give to the people of India, for instance, living conditions which will increase their expectation of life from 26 years to the standard that pertains in Australia. Unless that is done we can never expect the people of India to be satisfied with their lot. ""What happened in Present international problems cannot be solved so easily as supporters of the Government appear to imagine they can be. They can 'be solved only wbich I have referred a form of socialism that will prevent some small section of the community from exploiting and impoverishing the many. The reason why communism in Australia is at such, a low ebb, although it has commenced to rise since the present Government assumed office, is that during the last eight years Australian Governments have bad the courage to take effective steps against that section of the community whicb had exploited the ordinary people during the preceding 150 years. An advertisement that was published in the Australian press in the name of the Liberal party stated. What is the Australian situation? Recent party's adherence to socialism has contributed to the growth of communism as a force in Australia. That is a plain lie. The result of the general election held in 1949 showed that the methods that the Labour party recommends should be employed to fight communism in Asiatic countries reduced the Communist party in this country almost to a shadow. If those methods have proved effective in this country they will prove equally effective in combating communism in other countries. I am not prepared to send Australian soldiers to fight in any theatre of war that some irresponsible war-mongers decide would be a nice place in which to shed tbe blood of Australian men.

Three forces are operating in the world to-day. The first is the force of nationalism. It has been operating, particularly in Europe, for some centuries, but it is now beginning to be accentuated throughout the continent of Asia. All of us are familiar with it , and it has been blamed, rightly or wrongly, for a great deal of the struggle and warfare that the world has experienced. The second great force that is operating in the world to-day is the ideological for Hume( Mr Charles force of communism and it , being a revolutionary force, is necessarily an expansionist force. No revolutionary force can be anything but an expansionist force, exerting either armed pressure or some The third force, to which I shall refer later, is another potent force that has an (Oxley) immensely powerful effect on foreign nationalism to further is own aims.

140,Mr Clyde Cameron,"The honourable haps in Korea, and in China, it seeks toBalkan States. The situation in Yugoslavia is unique. There, a Communist ruler is not entirely ready to be dominated by the forces of international communism. Whilst he believes in establishing in his couutry a Communist state, he is unlike every other Communist in the world, so far as I am aware, because he is unwilling to adopt the party line from Moscow. The result is that an anomalous situation has arisen between Yugoslavia and the Kremlin forces, and we witness the extraordinary spectacle of a Communist country being subjected to pressure and intimidation by the mother of communism, that great power, Russia. What the result of that clash of interests will be, Estonia, Czechoslovakia and Roumania, we do not know. Let no one in this House think that I defend the Government of Yugoslavia merely because it opposes Russia, although I certainly admit that that is a very good reason for taking a better view of communism in Yugoslavia, than we take of communism anywhere else. 1 pass to the consideration of other factors in the world situation that I call the factors of instability. First, I shall consider the position of Russia itself. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics embraces a huge country that possesses tremendous resources of manpower. A large part of the population may be described as only semi-civilized. In the whole course of history Russia has never been open to the influences of the western world. Behind the I r o n Curtaini t is now closed off more securely than ever fro m those influences. It is a country with a controlled press that prints only what its rulers wish to be printed; a country with a controlled radio through which its people hear only what its rulers wish them to hear; a country in which the whole course of education is directed and controlled in the interests of the State; a country in which everything must conforan to the needs of the State and in which propaganda is poured out in accordance with the wishes of the small ruling clique; a country in which the very principles of right and wrong are degraded and debased to the Communist purpose; a country that is ruled by a police for m of government; and a country fchat possesses the greatest military force that the world has ever known, the strength of which is constantly and steadily increasing. Those are not factors that make for stability in the world. Russia must exert, by its mere existence, a tremendous pressure on every other country. Let us now consider other factors of instability, namely, the subject States bordering Russia. First, I mention Poland, an ancient kingdom with a long history, certainly a history of frequent conquest and oppression, but, at any rate, a national history. In that country the force of nationalism is subject to the force of communism. Other countries in this category are Lithuania, which are sealed off from western influences by the I r o n Curtain. What is the effect of their subjection on the Continent of Europe, on the minds of the people who live in Europe, and on the minds of people in other countries? East Germany is also one of the subject States. Beforei t was overrun by the Russians, it was the centre of German military thought. Millions of people who are now held down in East Germany dominated the Continent a few years ago. Tbey regarded themselves as the leading race, ancl set out to conquer the world, yet they are now held down by a conqueror. There are other nations which I may describe as the fringe of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and its subject States. The first of them that occurs to my mind is West Germany. On its eastern borders are the Russians, the mortal enemies of the Germans, with whom tliey were recently engaged in a life-and-deatb struggle. AVest Germany exists only because it is supported by other enemies and conquerors, the British and the Americans. What are the conditions in recently liberated countries such as Holland, France and Greece, which may be described as being on the fringe of the I r o n Curtain? Instability of government prevails in all of them; instability of l if e ; instability of almost everything that makes for ordinary democratic and decent living. All those are factors of immense instability in the world. Another factor is the Communist f if t h column that is operating in Australia, in the countries on the fringe of the I r o n Curtain, in the United States of America and in Canada. Everywhere that fifth column is seeking to upset, destroy and overthrow all the forms of democratic government. With all those forces of instability, the foreign policies of this country and of other democratic countries have to contend. Indeed, the foreign policy of every country 'has to be orientated in the midst of all those factors the people who express them are willing of instability. I now come to the third force to which I referred earlier, namely, the growth of population. Perhaps, it will exert a more powerful effect in the world than either nationalism or communism. It is not an immaterial force. The population of the world is increasing rapidly, and, in some countries, out of all proportion to the increase in the democratic countries. I have collected a few figures on this subject, and I shall read them to the House. They are not quite up to date, and they are only approximate, but they illustrate my meaning. The population of India in the twenty years to 1941 increased by 40,000,000; the population of Japan in seventeen years increased by 22,000,000; and the population of Indonesia in 20 years increased by 20,000,00. Whatever else we do in our foreign and domestic policies and whatever else any other nation does, we all must find means of living in a world in which that growth of population is taking place. With further progress in science and in medicine, and with improved living conditions, the pace will increase. The foreign policy of the various democracies must take that matter into account. Something may be done by argument and discussion to alter an ideology, but nothing can alter the situation that arises from the growth of population throughout the world. It is easy to ask what are the Nations means within the capacity of any factors that make an unstable world. country than has the Prime MinisIt is also easy to point to the ter whose policy is a shining light rocks amongst which we must steer illuminating the darkness of the prethe course of our foreign policy, but sent political situation. perhaps it is not so easy to say what point is perhaps not an object of foreign we should do. I am not competent to policy, but no foreign policy would be state in detail what we should do, but I worthwhile without it. It requires the should like to indicate to the House what discharge of our plain national duty to I believe, in principle, we should do. In defend the country. I remind honourable my opinion three things form the basic members in conclusion that one of the principles of our foreign policy., When objectives of any good foreign .policy must I speak of basic principles, I mean the be the maintenance of freedom of every basic general principles of right conduct kind. I recall the words that were Hr. Donald Cameron. in foreign policy, and not the kind of principles that are expressed by muddledheaded people who write slogans on walls, who scribble on footpaths, or who attend peace congresses at which fatuous resolutions are carried. I refer not to those kinds of principles, but to the basic principles of right and honest conduct which to defend. The first principle is, that we should do our utmost to cultivate good relations, and effect a unified policy with those who think as we do. No one has given a greater example of the way in which that should be done than the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), whose recent triumphal tour abroad has done more for this country than perhaps any one realizes. The second principle is that we should support the United Nations. In fact, we should do more than that. We should give it real support, and not mere lip-service and the kind of support that the Australian Labour party advocates, because that amounts to nothing at all. Earlier in this debate, the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) referred to the defence of this country. He said, in effect, that we had to bring hack to Australia during World War IL , our well-armed, well-trained and seasoned troops. The policy that is now advocated by the Labour party is to have no well-armed, well-trained and seasoned troops. that the Labour party wishes to do is to invite a few people to train for home defence.

Those proposals are identical with the objective that was agreed upon at Cairo, Moscow and Potsdam. Eurther proposals are that Uuited Nations forces shall not remain in any part of Korea, except in so far as is necessary for the achievement of the objectives specified in the first two provisions, and that all necessary measure?shall be taken to accomplish the economic rehabilitation of Korea. Those are sensible and practical proposals for the establishment of peace and stable democratic government under the control of tbe Koreans themselves. Unfortunately, they have not been accepted by the Soviet Government, on whose behalf its representative at the United Nations, Mr Vishinsky, has submitted other proposals. He has declared, in effect, "" We want the United Nations forces to get out of Korea, immediately as a "" precondition to the establishment of law and order and the setting up of a sovereign democratic government "". Such a proposition is utterly unacceptable to sensible people. It is the height of absurdity for the Soviet to say, ""After all the trouble we have put you to and after the loss of thousands of lives by the United Nations forces, give us another go and we will get our satellites to commit further acts of aggression in Korea "". The idea is intolerable. I sincerely hopy that the day when a sovereign government will be established in Korea under the aegis of the United Nationsi -= not far distant -Our great task is to play our What does the future hold for us? LatelyI have been reading a great deal about Soviet Russia. Honourable members should realize that Russia is a great conshall be free. What eaii we do to carry tinental power. It has a vast army of perhaps 250 quickly mobilizable divisions, but it is important to note that it is neither a great maritime power nor a great air power. It has a very small mercantile marine. possesses one active battleship, the old October Revolution. Three more battleships are being built. It has a very small auxiliary fleet. Its fleet of destroyers consists of about 75 vessels, of which 25 are stationed on the Pacific coast. It has over 330 submarines, of which, I understand, perhaps 25 are in Pacific waters. RecentlyI read a translation of an article that was published in the Hamburg Times, which is considered to be a fairly authoritative journal. It declared that, although Russia had a very great tactical air force, it had a very small strategic air force. That means that it has a very small force of heavy bombers capable of long-range activities. Another interesting article, which was written by Mr Ellsworth Raymond, who was for several years the statistician at the United States Embassy in Moscow, appeared recently in an American journal. Mr Raymond stated that Stalin himself had admitted, as a result of the Korean conflict, that Russia would need to increase its productive capacity to three times the present level before it could attempt to defeat the Western democracies en bloc. Therefore, there is much to be said for the argument of the right, honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), who declared that, by intervention in Korea, a great stroke had been performed for the cause of the United Nations, which was the cause of the world itself. Russia has suffered its second great rebuff. This must affect its immediate intentions and impose caution on it. 1"" also agree with the statement b.y the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) that Australia is not in imminent danger of attack. The simple fact, therefore, is that we have no need to look to our own defences at present. part as a democratic nation and as a member of the United Nations so as to ensure not only that we shall be free but also that every other democratic nation out that task? I agree with the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) that something must be done rn the United Nations about Russia. I agree with the honourable gentleman's conAt the most it clusions without agreeing either with his arguments or with the method of action that he proposes. The time has come for us to consider whether or not we are. prepared to permit the United Nations to exist in its present form. I doubt very much, as a matter of law, Avhether we could expel a permanent member of the",57,Cameron Th E Chinese Are To Become An Appendage Of
143,Mr Mcmahon.,"Security Council of the TJnited Nations against its veto. In fact, I do not believe that we could do so. Nevertheless I believe that we must think in terms of establishing a united group of nations that are actuated by goodwill and have peaceful intentions. If that were done we might consider United Nations and forming another organization on truly democratic and liberal principles. Ever since the United Nations was formed the activities of tbe democratic nations have been stultified by Russia's use of the veto. If we wish to take action to ensure that in the future the forces of democracy w ill be able to act as effectively as they have done in Korea then we must remove the shackles inherent in the use of the veto by the Russians. If Communist China were admitted to the United Nationsi t would have to be given a seat on tbe Security Council, which would mean that Russia would bave a valuable satellite that could also exercise the veto power against the democracies. The proposal that I put forward to to the United Nations. overcome the difficulty that confronts the world is similar to that advanced by the Communist Government is that Russia honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr has attempted to make a deal with us Wentworth). The fact is that we have in the matter.

It would also be psychologically stitute the. United Nations that it w ill bad for us to do so because the admission he composed only of friendly democratic of an aggressor nation to the comity of nations that are prepared to defend nations would have an adverse effect peace and liberty. The time has come upon the Asiatic countries. However, for us to take decisive action to ensure assuming for a moment that there were that the democracies shall have sufficient good and sufficient reasons for admitting real power to defend themselves against the Chinese Communist Government to the Soviet. Afte r all, if Russia is bent the United Nations., and to the Security on making war, as we believe it to be, Council of that organization, let us conthe only fact that w ill deter it from that sider the position that would arise in the course w ill be the overwhelming strength event of aggression by, say, Eastern Gerof the democracies. Concerning the proposal that the voting power of Red Chinai n the Security Chinese Communist Government should Council would, undoubtedly, be used to be admitted to the United Nations, I veto any proposal to check the aggression. point out that de facto recognition of that country under international law by some countries is not a valid argument for admitting it to the United Nations. Obviously, no nation should be admitted to the United Nations unless it complies with the provisions of Article IV . of the United Nations' abolishing the Charter, which requires that an applicant State shall be a peace-loving State and one that will accept the obligations contained in the Charter. In view of what has happened in China, can any one reasonably contend that the new government has given any evidence that it is now, or is likely to become, a peaceloving State? Is not all the evidence to the contrary? Only recently the Chinese Communist party was leading a revolutionary movement which ultimately overthrew by force the legitimate government of that country. In my opinion, that alone is sufficient evidence that the present Government of China is not a lover of peace. Furthermore, I think that it would be a mistake on moral ancl psychological grounds to admit China The moral objection to the admission of the Chinese many and Poland, which are satellites of Russia, against Western Germany.

I .understand that those claims have been considered and rejected. The rejection of the claims seems to me to be particularly unjust, because all honourable members are aware that whether they are actively engaged in the transaction of parliamentary business or seek refreshment or a little recreation they are well and faithfully served by the pariiamentaiy attendants. so engaged in our own pursuits that we quite nonchalantly disregard their services and display obvious unconcern at the demands that we make on their time. I. do not know, and therefore cannot understand, why their just claim for payment for overtime worked should be disregarded. However, it appears that two factors that militated against the success of t'heir claim are, first, that there is confusion about the identity of the appropriate officer to submit recommendations concerning them, and, secondly, that difficulties have arisen in the presentation, as well as in the consideration, of the claims because the men are engaged in various departments of Parliament House, which gives rise to anomalies and special considerations. However, the fact remains that the amount of overtime worked by the attendants for which they receive no pay is scandalous. When the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Dr. Nott) raised this matter he pointed out that the Commonwealth Public Service (Parliamentary Officers) Regulations provide in respect of hours of employmentThe hours of duty of officers of any Department of the Parliamentary Service shall be such hours as are specified from time to time by the Permanent Head of that Department and approved by the Parliamentary Head. In this instance the parliamentary head is Mr Speaker. I understand that Mr Speaker, who has taken a lively interest have since discovered that that in the welfare of the employees of ParliaHowever, I do not ment House and who is able to view this matter from the standpoint of personal knowledge as well as from his position as parliamentary head, submitted a. recommendation supporting the claims put forward by the attendants, but that the appropriate Minister and the Cabinet rejected his recommendation. My inquiries reveal that the reason why the claim was rejected was that the Public Service Board, to whom the claims had been referred for comment, recommended that they be not granted. It is obvious that the Public Service Board, wbich is not really concerned in this matter at all, merely wants to cast its net of authority over every one. I stress my protest against the interference of that body in Often we are this matter, and I insist on being informed by the Government of tbe real reasons wby it rejected this just claim.

150,Mr Haylen,"In reply to a questionleave of absence annually for recreation, and, if leitve is not taken in the year in which it court or arbitrator would award the men accrues, it shall lapse. Honourable members will realize that tbe regulation is hedged round witb all sorts o£ qualifications designed to minimize the just claims of the employees. If these men were members of a trade union which bad any militancy at ally tbeir union would not tolerate such injustice for a moment. But they should not be denied justice because they do not belong to a militant organization. I shall now place before honourable members some factual information from a document wbich supplies damning evidence of the injustice suffered by these employees. That document is in the form of a statistical return that has been prepared to show the average hours worked by parliamentary attendants during the last period of the parliamentary session, wbich commenced on the 22nd February and concluded on the 22nd June. That period is a fair sample of the hours of employment of tbe staff during a parliamentary session. The statistical return is available for perusal by honourable members and representatives of the Government. I shall not do more now than cite from it some actual instances of excessive overtime. For the week ended the 4th March the average hours of duty performed by the staff was 50 hours 30 minutes. For the week ended the l l t h March the comparable period was 51 hours 40 minutes, and for the week ended the 18th March the comparable period was 54 hours 45 minutes. For the week ended the 1st April the hours of duty were 54 hours 45 minutes, and for the week ended the 6th May they were 52 hours 15 minutes. For each of the remaining weeks of the session not less than 51 hours were worked, and in one week 54 hours 45 minutes duty was performed. Altogether, the hours of duty in excess of Public Service conditions amounted to 233 hours, and the' hours whicb the attendants contend should he paid for at penalty rates totalled nearly 350. If the staff had been paid for the overtime performed at the appropriate rate of 5s. an hour, each attendant would have received approximately £87. I suggest to houorable members that, having regard to the spread of hours worked and the nature of the work, no less than £100. In other words, these men have been mulct of that amount. The facts are simple enough for any one to comprehend. First, the staff has a legitimate grievance. Then a claim is made, whicb is properly supported by factual evidence. The claim is unjustly rejected. We l^ave the documentary evidence to support the claim. This matter was brought before the Speaker of the House, who is the man responsible as the parliamentary head of those officers, and his subsequent recommendation was cavalierly rejected. I consider that we, as members of the Parliament and as custodians of the law, which prescribes certain hours of labour wherever men are employed in this country and whatever may be the industry in which they are engaged, with certain special exceptions, should have this matter investigated. I therefore ask the Minister for a reasonable explanation of why overtime persists, why there is no payment for it, and why no true leave is granted ex-' cept at the whimsy of certain bosses who decide that because things are slack at some particular time employees may then take leave. The whole affair is scandalous and is a reflection upon this Parliament. Whilst we on this side of the House may have overlooked it ourselves when we were in office-and we accept that impeachment-w e consider that something should be done now. The Minister should let us have the facts and should let us know why the man who knows all about it and who, armed with all the valid reasons and with the facts before him, approached the Government with a recommendation in favour of the employees, had that recommendation rejected in the manner that has been stated. Does it mean that the Public Service Board is to be allowed to determine what shall be done in this matter? I consider that we ought to take some action. able gentleman's time has expired. support the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen).

152,Mr Edmonds (Herbert) [10.17],"Imember for Hindmarsh Cameron) I approached you in connection with this matter. To your everlasting credit you received us very favourably. You more or les3 accepted the validity of the points that we placed before you, and later the matter was discussed at a meeting attended by you, the President of the Senate, the Clerk of the Senate and some other officers. You will recall that on that occasion the Clerk of the Senate suggested that the matter should be placed before the Public Service Board, and that, again to your credit, you refused to have it go before that body. You argued that it was your prerogative, as Mr Speaker, to deal with the matter as it affected the attendants on zation. I make that statement with the this side of t.he Parliament, and that the President of the Senate had a similar prerogative in respect of the Senate attendants. promised the honourable inember for Hindmarsh and me that you would have the whole matter investigated. Canberra at the beginning of the recess quite convinced, knowing what your attitude was on the matter, that wben I returned it would have been settled and that those employees would at long last be receiving the justice to which they are entitled. Unfortunately we now find that the whole thing has been crushed. Recently, when reclassification of offices was being considered, it was put to tbe committee in control of the matter that those attendants Arbitration Court through whatever union should not be considered for reclassificathey might consider tbey should belong tion on the ground that something was going to be done for them in connection with the payment of overtime. From what I can gather, although I am not in a position to know exactly whether or not you made a recommendation or what was the nature of the recommendation if you had made one-although statement that you did make one and that it was favorable to these men-the Secretary to the Treasury or some one else has rejected that recommendation. At the time that this matter was brought before your notice, and later at the meeting of those concerned, it was argued that those attendants should not be entitled to overtime payments during sessional periods because during periods of recess there were many days Mr Edmonds. ( Mr Clyde on which they did not work the full daily hours. The answer to that argument is now, as it was then and always will be, that for tbe last quarter of a century arbitration courts in this country have refused to take a slack period into accouat when the matter of excess working hours during a busy period is under consideration. Surely this Parliament does not wish to go back to the dark, dismal days when people could be compelled to work sixteen hours a day on some occasions on the ground that a few months previously they had not been called upon to work their full daily hours. The case of these men is tragic. They are not covered by an effective industrial organiutmost respect for the organization to which many of them subscribe. Some of them do not even subscribe to that On that occasion you organization. The tragedy of the case is that they have no access to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and that I left they are placed in tbe position of having to take or leave the conditions that are determined by you, Mr Speaker, or whomever you may consider yourself subject to in connection with such matters. I assert that there is no other section of industry in this country in which men are called upon to work under the conditions under which men in this National Parliament are asked to work. If they had access to the Commonwealth to, they would have absolutely no difficulty in gaining justice for themselves. I have had some experience of arbitration courts and I know what the members of any arbitration court in Australia would think if I told them that the manager of the Parliamentary Refreshment RoomsI accept the worked 650 hours without payment of overtime in a period of less than three months. Another employee whose name I Cabinet, the Treasurer, the shall not mention, because I do not trust many of the people who might have something to do with the continuation of his employmentI do not refer to persons in this House-and who works in the refreshment-room area, worked 110 hours overtime during the first five weeks of the present Parliament and did not receive one penny for the extra hours worked. Unless something is done in this matter it will not be long-before it will be extremely difficult to find people who w ill be prepared to work here.
