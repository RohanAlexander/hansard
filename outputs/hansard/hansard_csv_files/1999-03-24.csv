223,Like To Pay Tribute To A Great Australian. To Mr Mcgauran To Present A Bill For An Act,"Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4289 Wednesday, 24 March 1999 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 March, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time. Ms ELLIS (Canberra) (10.00 a.m.)-The Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 seeks to make a number of significant changes to payments to people who are caring for a disabled person in their home. The bill contains three schedules which I will very quickly and briefly go through. Schedule1 introduces the new assessment of an adult's disability for entitlement to carer payment and allowance. The schedule also makes a number of significant changes to the carer payment. Schedule2 proposes to replace the domiciliary nursing care benefit and the child disability allowance with a single new payment to be called the carer allowance. Schedule3 provides for transitional arrangements relating to the carer payment and carer allowance measures introduced by schedules 1 and 2. Looking at this in a little more detail, schedule 1 of the legislation introduces a new method of assessing an adult's disability-the adult disability assessment tool. It extends qualification for carer payment to carers of disabled adults who have children under 16 where the carer provides care for both the adult and the child and where the child is either disabled or is under the age of six. It allows a person to qualify for carer payment for 63 days in a calendar year whilst the person being cared for is in hospital and the carer participates in that hospital care. It also extends qualification for carer payment bereavement payments on the death of a partner who was receiving a social security benefit, and it applies the full carer payment qualification requirements in cases where the care receivers are two or more disabled children. I also note that schedule 1, parts 2 to 4, include amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Schedule 2, part 1, introduces from July of this year a new social security payment, a carer allowance. That replaces the child disability allowance-currently in the Family and Community Services portfolio-that is payable to carers of children with disabilities, and the domiciliary nursing care benefit-currently in the Health and Aged Care portfolio-that is payable to carers of adults who would be eligible for entry to a nursing home. The carer allowance represents a simpler and more consistent system of income supplement for carers of people with disabilities of all ages. Also, the assessment of entitlement of carer allowance will utilise two new tools: the child disability assessment tool for the assessment of a child's disability, and the adult disability assessment tool for the assessment of an adult's disability. Schedule3 is where the transitional arrangements are listed. We generally support the beneficial measures of this bill. However, we do have some concerns that we are being asked to agree to very significant changes to the way in which a number of payments will be assessed before the final version of the adult disability assessment tool-a key part of that assessment-is available. If there are significant problems with the assessment tool, then we may in the future be forced to seek disallowance. The government, I believe, should provide the opposition and others interested in this particular legislation with",152,Adjournment For Those Who Seek To Make Headlines In The
224,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,"4290 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 the final version of the assessment tool as soon as possible so that we could avoid that occurring. We would also seek a commitment from the government to review the operation of the new schemes after they have been implemented to ensure that people who should be receiving the payments are not in fact missing out. Whilst we are happy to stand behind the beneficial measures of this bill, we are concerned about those aspects, as I have outlined, but there are a couple of other brief notes I would like to make as well. I know that there have already been changes to the method of assessment for child disability allowance and I would like to take this opportunity to mention one area that many members of my community have come to talk to me about. It is the cystic fibrosis area, which I am sure other members opposite are aware of, where the new assessment tool for child disability allowance is proving a little bit troublesome, and will in the future, for some people who have children that fall into that category. I have been told-and I would be happy to receive advice to the reverse-that, where there has been a question relating to child disability allowance qualification from this category of client, the overwhelming majority of those who appeal in this area in fact win the appeal. So you would wonder why there would be a need for them to be sidelined in the first place when they attempt to qualify for the disability. I know that there would be very few, if any, members of this parliament who would disagree with me when I say that people who have children suffering from any form of disability where a disability allowance is being paid should not have to face any future difficulty in going through the process of applying for and receiving a disability allowance payment. I am not for one moment suggesting that there would be any intent of any kind by anyone to do this, but, when we make changes to these assessment methods, we must be very cognisant of the fact that, if it is going to create any level of difficulty anYWhere, that should be forecast, tested and eliminated. In some cases, where the legislation is fairly complicated, some unforeseen things can occur and action must be taken as quickly as possible to ensure that it does not happen again. Whilst we are talking about carers legislation, I would like to take this opportunity to mention my own personal concern, and I know the concern of a lot of people on all sides of the House, in relation particularly to the child disability allowance; that is, inequity can occur if we change assessment tools of measurement and do not predict carefully or compassionately enough some of the outcomes. Speakers on both sides of the House have recognised the ongoing role of carers in our community and commended them for it. I take this opportunity to join them in those comments. I know from thy Carers Association and from my links with the community in my own electorate that the recognition that the community at large now pays to carers has been long in coming not only in a governmental or legislative sense but also in a societal sense. But it is finally happening. We need to recognise-and recompense where necessary-the overwhelming burden that some individuals and family groups find themselves with when they are caring for aged parents or disabled or chronically ill family members and children. Whilst a lot has been done and is continuing to be done in this area-and I commend both government and those in the community for all of the action that has been taken so far in this regard-I still think we need to talk about it more often. Wednesday, 24 March 1999 . MAIN COMMITTEE 4291 I am very pleased that a children's carers supportive group is now being provided by the Carers Association. That is another aspect of caring that has finally been recognised and is starting to receive attention-not only in monetary terms but also in support terms. We know that many children in families are, either directly or indirectly, caring for parents and siblings with illness, chronic illness or disability-an additional load. I cannot think of anything more difficult for an 11or 12-year-old child than having to come home after school and do their homework-carry on with their own lifestyle-while caring for someone within their family who has a chronic illness or disability. We have to recognise, support and salute those who are doing that. Wherever we can we should ensure not only that the mechanisms around that family, which have been put there by government and by society, are strong and secure but also that the families and people concerned know that they exist. To conclude-my comments this morning are brief-in general terms, we are supportive of the beneficial aspects of this bill. We need to know how the adult disability assessment tool is going to operate after the changes connected to it; that we are not being asked to support something at this point when we are not sure of its implications. If that information is available during this debate, we would be very happy to hear it. It would make our position a lot clearer and a lot safer in terms of our own judgment of this piece of legislation. I salute those people in my electorate and in other areas of the community who are carrying out the caring role. I reiterate my comments-because I do not think we can say it enoughthat governments, political parties, the community and society in general simply must continue to be asked to pay more attention, in any possible way that we can, be it monetary or otherwise, to the roles that people take in caring for others within their families and within their communities at large. Anything that any of us in this place can do to enhance and improve the lot of those people, I think we would all agree, we should do and encourage each other to do. Amendment Bill 1999 delivers on measures announced in the government's Staying at Home package of April 1998 and a related measure announced in the 1997-98 budget. The new and improved arrangements are scheduled for introduction on 1 July. I am very pleased that, under this bill, the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance for carers of adults will be liberalised to achieve a net increase of 14,000 recipients and that the carer allowance will not be subject to any income or assets test and also will be untaxed. Generally, this bill extends the benefit, including the bereavement payment, to all carers, and the minister and the government are to be congratulated on this progressive and enlightened initiative. The extended, more liberal arrangements are reflected in the budget impact, with a rise from an estimated $6.195 million this financial year to an estimated $33.571 million in 2001-02. It is estimated that there are more than two million carers in Australia. To varying degrees, these dedicated people look after older people and those with disabilities. The latest detailed statistics were compiled in 1993 by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They showed that there were some 1.5 million people caring for another person in the same household and 728,000 caring for a person in another household. The ABS identified 541,000 of these as principal carers having the major responsibility of caring for another person. The dedication, selflessness, sacrifice and love of a carer can never be underestimated. Carers are that all too rare breed in our often cynical society who have given up so many of their",153,Representatives Main Committee
225,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson) (10.11 A.m.),"The Assistance for Carers Legislation4292 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 own dreams and aspirations to tend to the frequently very demanding needs of the elderly and those with disabilities. They need and deserve proper and practical recognition and the provisions of this bill go a long way towards making their lives just that little bit better. Undeniably, the need for carers is going to increase-and increase at a considerable and accelerating rate. The number and proportion of the population aged more than 65 years is estimated to double over the next 60 years, from 11 per cent of the total population to 22 per cent. Obviously, a better, healthier lifestyle and advances in medicine will see people living longer and the number of people over the age of 80 will steadily increase. While old age in the future should be more active and more fulfilling, nevertheless even the most independent older person will require care to some degree or another. Running parallel to this reality is the other reality that older people rightfully want to stay, for as long as their general health permits, in their own homes with the comfort of familiar surroundings and established networks of family, friends and social activities. This should be encouraged at all levels, for it gives older people a very real sense of identity and independence, and that makes for a happier, healthier life. The days of shipping old people off to institutions simply because they have reached some arbitrary age are, hopefully, long gone. Those with disabilities, especially those with profound disabilities, need constant care and attention throughout their lives. Equally, they have a right to an independent life as far as is possible, respect as human beings and every opportunity to pursue their special individual interests. Again, if humanly possible, they should be allowed to live in their own homes and know they are part of a loving and concerned family. These emerging changes in the demographics of society and in our attitude to the care of older people and those with disabilities present all of us with an enormous challenge. Our response to these realities, of course, has to be made within the context of those other realities-a low birth rate and a comparatively low immigration intake. As I said earlier, there are an estimated two million carers now in Australia. Our ageing population and our policy of encouraging those requiring care to live at home whenever and wherever possible have enormous implications and policy challenges. In the past, when there were larger families and very different social attitudes, there was reliance upon family members such as maiden aunts, unmarried daughters and so on as the unpaid carer in the family. Predictably, today women are still shouldering most of the carer's burden. A 1995 study revealed that two-thirds of principal carers were women, with 33 per cent caring for spouses, 23 per cent caring for children and 30 per cent caring for parents. While men and women were fairly evenly represented as principal carers for spouses, the principal carers of children were almost entirely-at 93 per cent-women and almost three-quarters of principal carers of parents were daughters. While the author of the study, Mary Lindsay, did acknowledge that the emphasis on principal carers did tend to underestimate the role of male carers who contribute significantly to the care of parents, it was nevertheless true that care by men tended to be more intermittent and less intensive than that provided by the principal carer. Almost all the principal carers of a spouse or child lived in the same household as the recipients of care, but less than half-38 per centof the principal carers of a parent lived in the same household. This disproportionate reliance on women as carers does reflect the fact that, generally, women are better suited to this demanding task. However, it also reflects the fact that women Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4293 are either less likely to be in the work force in the first place or more likely than, say, a spouse, brother or other male relative to give up jobs when a need in the family arises. I spoke earlier about the various emerging realities that provide the context for our ongoing policy considerations for carers, and to those I would add one more. In the future there is certain to be an increasing resistance among many women to sacrifice their own careers and personal ambitions to take care of an aged relative or even a child with disability. In acknowledging that resistance, it would be cruel and unfair to say that this is an uncaring attitude. Rather, it is the not unreasonable request by women that men, too, must make their own contribution and, if necessary, their own sacrifices if a relative is to be provided with the necessary care to remain at home. Therefore, we need to consider how work and other responsibilities can be shared between men and women who jointly have a responsibility for care. There needs to be recognition that equality means flexibility both by individuals and by government. This is reinforced by the fact that the study I referred to earlier also showed that female principal carers are younger than males and more likely to have dependent children. The number of women caring for children and also for elderly parents is expected to increase, especially with the later age of childbirth. Unless we can respond as a community to these emerging realities, the only other option is vastly increased spending on various institutions. While I-and I am sure everyone else in this room-have a great respect for these institutions, which do a magnificent job and generally provide a high standard of care, they will never replace the security and love of the family home. I believe it is far better to adopt the strategic approach of encouraging both men and women to share the carer's responsibilities equally. There needs to be encouragement of a partnership between carers and government agencies at all levels so that the best possible care can be provided while the carers' own lives and outside careers are not put on a more or less permanent hold. I want to congratulate the minister and the government in going a very long way to achieving these most important aims through this sound legislation. 1999 proposes a number of changes to arrangements for carers. The most significant of these changes are the provision of a new adult disability assessment tool to determine eligibility for carer payment and replacement of the domiciliary nursing care benefit and the child disability allowance with a single new payment to be called the carer allowance. The changes are extensive, and I raise my concern that they are being implemented at a time when Centrelink's budget and staff numbers are under more pressure. Last year we saw the administrative debacle associated with the implementation of the common youth allowance. Carers must now be wondering how and by whom these changes to carers payments will be implemented when the government is set to cut a further 2,000 staff from Centrelink. The system is already overwhelmed, so further cuts in administrative resources are going to. mean serious inconvenience for clients. The adult disability assessment tool will not be welcomed by carers who are already eligible for payments and who are continually dismayed and appalled at the number of times their disabled family member must be tested for eligibility for services. The tool will be another battle with bureaucracy they could do without. The new adult disability assessment tool is going to be more complex than the previous assessment process.",155,Representatives Main Committee
226,Mr Cox (Kingston) (10.19 A.m.),"The Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill4294 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 We are being asked to pass this legislation before we have seen the final version of the adult disability assessment tool. That would be an act of faith I cannot say I am comfortable with. The government may argue that it will be a disallowable instrument, meaning that, if the parliament finds it unacceptable, it can strike it out. That is not satisfactory for two reasons: the first is the chaos it will cause to carers in the event that it is necessary to strike it out; the second is that there will probably be little time to assess its deficiencies between its promulgation and the last possible day for a disallowance motion. It would have been much better to have the final version presented with this bill so that both could be considered together. The tool attempts to establish the disabled person's degree of independence from any help, physical or verbal, however minor and for whatever reason. Concerns have already been raised that it will not adequately address episodic conditions. It also seems likely that it will not adequately assess the level of care required by a person with an intellectual disability. This is an issue with existing assessment procedures. Carers of intellectually disabled people have often said to me that they feel they would get more support if they were caring for someone who is physically disabled. The reason is that the assessment procedures seem to significantly underrate the amount of supervision that some intellectually disabled people require. That is something the government should consider before finalising the adult disability assessment tool. There are no questions which focus on daily living skills such as shopping, transport and mal'l:aging menstrual cycles. The government must ensure that the tool will effectively and fairly assess the reality of caring for people with disabilities in these areas. Carers are also concerned that the adult disability assessment tool categories have an emphasis on age related disabilities such as dementia. The government will claim that the changes represent an enhancement of the program extending eligibility to carer payments to a larger group than currently receives them. I suspect that the so-called enhancement is financially motivated as a cheaper solution for the Commonwealth than having to subsidise nursing home beds. The tool's emphasis on age related conditions like dementia adds weight to that suspicion. I recently received some disturbing advice from a nonprofit organisation that are building a new nursing home in my electorate. They have been in the business of operating nursing homes for a very long time and know what they are doing. The home they are building is a modem, efficient design with a secure dementia unit. It will require minimum staffing. They told me that had they known what the Howard government's funding arrangements for nursing homes were going to be they would never have committed to the project. They believe that it will always run at a deficit and have to be subsidised by their other operations. If that is the general case, the present funding arrangements for nursing homes will not facilitate sufficient growth in the supply of nursing home beds. A growing gap between demand for nursing home beds and their availability will mean increasing dependence on carers. The government needs to remember that there is not a free market for carers. People do not do it for money, certainly not the kind of money the government provides. They do it because they love the people they care for. The payments they receive from the Commonwealth make it possible for them to provide that care which, in many cases, means giving up paid employment. Those carer payments are not payments for services rendered and were never intended to be. I have a real concern that the government is not moving far enough or fast enough in providing support services and respite for carers from their caring roles. Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4295 The Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill represents significant changes to the new carer payment in respect of caring for a disabled person in hospital for up to 63 days in addition to the 63 days respite period currently available. While these changes are a welcome improvement of the rules for carer payment, they raise the issue of respite availability. The government must recognise the difficulties facing carers when seeking respite from their caring role. I remind the government of a key initiative of the Liberal Party's family policy which promised a better deal for carers, but which it has failed to deliver. The experience of carers in my electorate is that 63 days a year respite from their caring role is a dream and nothing like a reality. It is simply not available to them. The problem is that the demand far outweighs the ability for the system to respond. This is particularly so in relation to high-level care for the disabled, and more specifically for dementia sufferers. There are current unmet needs in the community and carers are calling for an immediate increase of funding to support full-time carers with regular respite. Waiting lists are long and range from weeks to months, depending on the assessed level of need. This is the case both for those carers seeking respite services and any other services subsidised by HACC. Carers need respite services that are cost effective. While there are some commercial providers of care services, the costs are often beyond the means of most carers. They need those services to be acceptable to the service users. There needs to be more long day care to allow full-time carers to remain in, or have some access to, the paid work force. With a rapidly ageing population the disparity between needs and services has to be addressed. The HACC program's objective is to keep people in the community and out .of nursing homes and hostels. Support services are a prerequisite for preventing or delaying institutionalisation. The Howard government's cuts to HACC have reduced its growth rate and resulted in the imposition of fees, in many cases on families with very low incomes. These amendments to carer payment. and carer allowance are an important step but cannot be considered in isolation from the support necessary for carers to provide that care in the community. In real terms the government has not addressed HACC funding, especially not in the long term. During 1998 the Intellectual Disabilities Services Council in South Australia undertook a review of services aimed at providing family support to families with an intellectually disabled child. Although the final report has not been completed, the review has so far raised a number of important considerations for families, services and governments in planning for future . services. It is worth mentioning some of them here. There is a lack of transport services. The average age of family carers, which is approximately 50 years, is increasing. That means the carer's capacity to provide care will diminish. Many older parents are extremely concerned about what will happen to their son or daughter in the future, given the lack of accommodation support services. It is an unacceptable situation where support is so lacking that an aged mother tells you she hopes her disabled late middle aged son dies before she does because she does not know who will care for him when she is gone. The median household income of families interviewed was $300 to $400 per week. That compares with the ABS median of slightly less than $1,000 a week. The number of parents who are sole carers is more than double that of the population in general. And 27 per cent of families with an intellectually disabled child have more than one person with a disability within the household. 4296 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 Family care-givers, who are the primary carers, experience a significantly higher rate of health related problems due, of course, to stress. Many families experience social isolation and said that their social life and personal energy level could be improved by better quality support services. They need the option of being able to return to the work force and to have some of their personal concerns addressed in order to increase their coping capacity. Families indicate that the biggest unmet need is for behaviour therapy, living skills training, assistance with the care or management of the person with an intellectual disability, and sibling training and support. There are significant waiting lists for host family respite, an interchange where each family is linked to another family that provides opportunities for their son or daughter to stay overnight regularly and participate in family activities and occasions. There are more host family arrangements through self-employed contractors than there are through accredited agencies such as Interchange and CARA. There are issues about the level of training for host carers and checking procedures to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults. The median level of support available to families who do have access to services is four to five hours a week. However, only 47 per cent of families with a son or daughter living at home use family support services provided in the disability sector. The age profile of the population of people with intellectual disability clearly indicates a significant increase in the number of adults continuing to live at home with families over the next decade. Planning for this increase is critical. Along with increasing the availability of respite services, my primary concern is the lack of long-term accommodation options for young people living in the family home or for older adults whose parents are themselves ageing. I would like to share with you some stories from my own electorate. They show the frustration and stress on families resulting from unmet needs for accommodation, respite and support services. The first example is a family with two children, a boy of 13 and a girl of 11. The daughter has a mild intellectual disability involving developmental delay in all areas of her life. She was diagnosed at seven months with eye problems and a delay in her intellectual development. She has worn glasses since she was seven months old and has just completed a three-year course of drugs to help prevent staring seizures. One of her parents' major goals is to develop and drive a program teaching her independent living skills. This is essential if she is to ever be able to live independently. The hardest and largest hurdle her parents have had to conquer is obtaining a negotiated curriculum plan for her. This is a not uncommon problem in South Australia where limited resources mean that many needy children who would benefit greatly from some special education assistance are classified as ineligible. In this case, the child is able to write very simple words and names. This has been the result of seven years of education. Behavioural management is a major problem for her parents. Understandably, she can be very erratic and antisocial. Her parents have a constant problem reinforcing good social behaviour because of her exposure to behavioural problems in the other students in her special class at school. One of the parents' major problems has been the frustration of not having a one-stop shop. On approaching any new service provider, they have had to go through the process of application, as well as another assessment to assess eligibility and the degree of their daughter's disabilities. She has had to sit through many tests to show someone new that she suffers a disability. She cannot explain her feelings and is constantly being subjected to the attention of professionals wanting to assess her abilities and being put through medical tests to determine the cause of her disability. Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4297 The pressures on her brother are equally, if not more, intense when it comes to him coping with a sibling with a disability. There are many times when his life is disrupted because of the fact that his sister has disabilities emotionally, socially and physically. Carers face a life of enforced hardship and battles with bureaucracy. They always have to justify their demands on an overstretched support and respite system. They have to deal with constant changes to legislation and Centrelink staff often not able to keep up with the details. They have to fill out the same application and criteria form for the child disability allowance on a regular basis. It is a complicated and involved document. It is perhaps not as involved as the new adult disability assessment tool, but for most the disability does not get any better; it only deteriorates. I must say that the same frustration is shared by the doctors of the disabled who also have to participate in that process all too frequently. Carers face endless administrative frustrations, such as incorrect correspondence informing them that they have been cut off benefits. They are unable to speak to anyone experienced enough in their particular area. They may be given incorrect answers concerning taxable pensions. Departmental inefficiency means inquiries numbers are interstate. It is frustrating for any beneficiary not to be able to talk directly to their local Centrelink office. No matter what political persuasion the parents of children with a disability are, the changes this present government has initiated in the social security area have made the primary caregiving role harder and more stressful. People get sick of having to fight for so-called benefits for their child. Every step of the way is a fight for things that a normal child receives without question. The incidence of not being able to find emergency care for the person being cared for, when the carer falls ill and needs respite, is very high in most areas. Acronyms separate the professionals from the consumers. . Carers go through not knowing about services or how to access them. They want to see action to make their lives and the lives of the people they care for have the. quality they deserve. Carers sacrifjce their own life opportunities, access to paid work, education, leisure, dignified retirement and meaningful relationships. Most full-time carers are tired, isolated, ill and poor. They have urgent unmet needs for support services. The second example I want to refer to are friends from my own electorate: a single parent with three daughters. Two have left home. The third remains at home to be cared for by her mother. She has a degenerative muscle disease, is confined to a wheelchair and needs assistance with most tasks. She is frail and has medical problems associated with her disability. She needs 20 hours of support per week but only asks for 10. She receives six. This is used to assist with bathing and toileting transfers. Her mother can never go away for the weekend unless the daughter is prepared to be in her wheelchair all night. Besides caring for her own daughter, her mother fostered a child with an intellectual disability and mental health problems for 14 years. Sadly, this year she had to relinquish care of her foster child because she felt she could no longer cope without more support. The competition for support hours is fierce and even assertive parents do not receive adequate care. The government expect the community to care for its own. How can they expect this when inadequate funding means little or no support? The third example from my own electorate is a family with a 4V2-year-old son who suffers from epilepsy, hypotonia and cortical vision impairment. Their son is totally dependent on them to the extent that he requires constant care for all his bodily functions. The father eventually found it necessary to give up his job to help his wife care for their son. They know 4298 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 that they will eventually require a hoist to enable them to lift him and they are concerned that one suitable to their requirements will cost $1,000. He is currently fed Osmolite, a prepared formula, via a gastronomy button overnight through a tube with a pump. He requires various medications that are all administered using the tube. He is not mobile and must be pushed everywhere in a wheelchair, which currently needs replacing as it is becoming too small. He has to wait for a new one to be supplied by the Crippled Children's Association because its funding is stretched to the limit. In addition, he requires special exercise and visits to the physiotherapist, occupational therapist and dietitian on a regular basis. As he is continually having seizures he must be monitored at all times, day and night. This is the reality for carers and they despair of being able to make people understand the cost of disability both economically and otherwise on their families. I have spent a considerable amount of time in the last few months visiting local support services and trying to get an appreciation of the unmet needs just in my local area. It is hard to get an accurate view. People are assessed as eligible for respite services but they cannot find a place. Service providers are constantly shuffling resources and are too busy dealing with crises to get a total picture of the needs they are desperately trying to satisfy. The limited extension to carers' payments provided by this bill will do little to address the real needs for respite services and more accommodation for the adult disabled. Mr SEeKER (Barker) (10.38 a.m.)-I was very interested earlier to hear the contribution of the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, who came up with some very thoughtful and well-researched areas about the number of people who would be affected by this legislation, the Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. She clearly did deal with the bill and not with unrelated matters. I also congratulate the member for Kingston, Mr Cox, on his well-researched speech-although it was a little suspicious that this was just a cheap way to get out of providing nursing home beds in his electorate. He stated that our policy promised a better deal for carers. I think he would know, from his reading of the bill, that an extra 14,000 carers will be catered for, which is obviously a better deal for carers not catered for before. Interestingly, on Monday of this week the director of one of the largest-if not the largestnursing home complexes came to my office and talked about the problems that they were having there. He said that every application that he had put in to the federal government-both Labor and Liberal-had been approved, indicating that he thought the government was fitting in with his plans for nursing homes in that area. He is in control of a very good complex down in Mount Gambier. Also, local government-along with two councils-was involved in the funding that he received for the last lot of 24 beds, each providing about $400,000, thus ensuring that the capital costs were taken care of. One of the greatest crosses people have to bear is when they are forced or choose or feel duty bound to be a carer for another person in our society who is usually, but not always, a relative. If they care for that person at home, it means that there is considerably less cost to the taxpayer than if that same person was institutionalised or hospitalised. It is only fitting that society, through our government, provides some assistance to that carer so that that disabled . person can cope better in familiar surroundings and is not tom away from family and friends. One of the complaints that I have received in Barker is that the parents of children with disabilities seem fairly satisfied with the help and support they receive when the children are of school age, but that upon those disabled children reaching the age of 16 they quite Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4299 dramatically lose most, if not all, of that support. This is often at a time when parents are ageing themselves and have other worries such as sick parents and the worry about what will happen to their disabled children when they themselves are no longer able to care for them. WhatI particularly like and support about this amendment bill is the combination of two existing payments-namely, the child disability allowance for carers of children up to 16 years of age and the domiciliary nursing care benefit-into a new social security payment that is simply called the carer allowance. Not only is this term 'carer allowance' simpler and more easily understood by mere mortals like me; it almost certainly ensures that carers do not get lost in the system when their children reach the age of 16 or more. This is a great relief to the parents of disabled children nearing that age who are concerned about having to go through the system to assess qualifications and about dealing with different bureaucrats and departments. We are informed that this amendment bill willliberalise eligibility criteria for carers of adults so that there will be a net increase of some 14,000 recipients. This recognises the problems out there in the community and shows a caring attitude by our government for those people giving care to their family members. This amendment bill is also to be commended for recognising that disabled dependants come from all types of families and that this new carer allowance will not be subject to any income or assets test and will not be taxable. This is especially important to the families on the land in my electorate of Barker who are often cash poor and asset rich, which often stops them qualifying for social security in its many forms. My electorate is the third most rural seat in Australia, with 22 per cent of the work force in Barker being directly employed in. primary industry, so quite a few of those extra 14,000 recipients will come from Barker. This can be warranted because if a dependant had to be looked after by the government full time, for example in a nursing home, it would cost the taxpayer more than the carer allowance and would not be as satisfactory as care in the home, amongst family and friends in familiar surroundings. Then';fore we are catering for a group of people who volunteer their services for their loved ones. Often it is the case that an aged spouse is looking after a disabled spouse and they have made that choice because of the commitment they made many years ago to wed for life, in sickness and in health. Often in country areas it is also not convenient to use nursing homes or other care facilities because of their distance from the family home. Often the aged carer may have problems with driving long distances to see their disabled spouse or dependent child. And in the bush, of course, public transport is virtually non-existent, so that option is not available. This amendment bill also recognises that employment opportunities are greatly reduced or non-existent for the home carer. The carer allowance gives some recognition for that situation. It will allow the family to manage more easily and it will help pay for some of those extra costs that often occur as a result of care giving. My only concern about care giving at home is that those parents with children afflicted with attention deficit syndrome, or ADD, may still not qualify for this carer allowance. ADD qualifies as a disability under the federal Disability Discrimination Act but not under the Disability Services Act which provides the funding. In a speech I made in an adjournment debate in the House of Representatives on 15 February 1999, I raised this same concern that ADD, because it is not considered permanent, does not qualify for funding. As any parent of 4300 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 an ADD child will tell you, they have the same sorts of problems and needs as any other caregiver. I commend this bill to the House because it does show a willingness· on our behalf to improve the system, the benefits and the outlook for home care-givers. I also commend this bill because it makes best use of our resources and taxpayers' dollars while still giving improved care for our disabled. Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. It introduces the carer allowance and it makes changes to the carer payment. This legislation acknowledges the special people among us who give up their lives, career opportunities, travel and personal goals to stay at home and look after a loved family member or friend who has a disability or a chronic incurable illness. These unselfish people save the government millions of dollars in public health expenditure because they accept the responsibility of care, very often to their own personal detriment. These wonderful people are known to us as carers and we have all met quite a few of them as we travel around our electorates. Since 1983, successive Australian governments have been increasingly mindful of the great contribution made by carers, not only to their own families, but to the wider community. Since its election in 1996, the coalition has continued to provide support for carers including, amongst other things, allowing an increase in the amount of time they may take away from their caring role while still maintaining their eligibility as a carer. This bill gives effect to several improvements in government assistance to carers, including those measures announced by the government in April 1998 in the Staying at Home package and other measures announced.in its 1997-98 budget. The measures in this bill will take effect on 1 July 1999 and by the year 2002 will increase the government's commitment to the support of carers from $6.195 million in 1998-99 to $33.571 million in 2002. These measures in this bill show that this government is fair dinkum about supporting carers. The carer payment is a means tested income support payment made to people who, because they provide full-time care, are unable to undertake full-time employment. By way of history, the necessity for financial support for carers was only recognised at government level in 1983 when the spouse carers pension was provided to husbands of a severely handicapped, aged or invalid pensioner or rehabilitation allowee who needed constant care and attention. The strict conditions that applied were that the care had to be provided by the husband in person and in the matrimonial home and the husband only received the spouse carers pension if he was ineligible for age, invalid or service pension. By 1988, this payment had been renamed the carers pension and it could be paid to a nonrelative of the person in care and, while some strict r-quirements like the constant care and attention were removed, they were replaced by others regarding personal care and constant supervision. The requirement to live in the same home still applied. By 1991, provision had been extended to allow the carers pension to be payable to people caring for a severely handicapped person in receipt of any income support. It also allowed carers who live in neighbouring dwellings to be eligible for payment. It was only relatively recently in 1993 that the rules eased to allow carers to be still eligible for the payment yet cease care for 42 days in a calendar year, which was an improvement from the previous 28 days. Overseas travel, part-time study, employment or training for up to 10 hours a week was also allowed without the carer losing entitlement. The easing of eligibility",157,Representatives Main Committee
227,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (10.46 A.m.),"I am pleased to speak in support of the Assistance forWednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4301 conditions contiilUed. By 1997, when the carers pension was renamed the carers payment, the number of hours the carer could spend in non-caring activities like employment or voluntary work, or their own education or training, was extended to 20 hours a week and the number of days the carer might temporarily cease the caring role was increased to 52. As a special initiative of the coalition government, eligibility for the carers payment was extended to carers of profoundly disabled children under 16 years of age and the number of non-caring days was again increased, to 63 days. By July 1998, there were 33,983 people receiving the carers payment, with total government outlays of $27 million. This legislation also provides for a new social security payment to be known as the carer allowance, which will combine two existing payments. One is the domiciliary nursing care benefit and the other is the child disability allowance. Eligibility for the domiciliary nursing care benefit is determined by the need for continuing nursing home care, without which the care recipient would have to reside in a nursing home. This definition has sometimes exclulled those people who may require constant supervision and have high needs but who do not necessarily ne.ed to enter a home. This bill now recognises the different caring circumstances which may face carers as they look after people with high special needs. This important legislation will also provide for those carers who have been looking after their relatives who may be frail aged or disabled, or suffer from one of the dementias or from a chronic illness. This includes parents who may have intellectually impaired adult children. The bill increases this benefit from $58.30 to $75.60 per fortnight. In the 1997-98 program expenditure, there were 45,675 carers-some 46,124 recipients-at a cost of $72 million. The other payment which will be absorbed into this new carer allowance is ,the child disability allowance, which was created in December 1973 as the handicapped child's allowance. This allowance assists parents of severely handicapped children under the age of 16 who are at home and in need of constant care and attention on a permanent or long-term basis. This allowance is not taxable, nor was it ever subject to an income test. When it was renamed the child disability -allowance in 1987, the distinction between 'handicapped' and 'severely handicapped' was removed. By January 1999, the rate of the child disability allowance had been increased to $75.60 per fortnight. In June 1998, there were over 101,377 children and students receiving the child disability allowance. It seems that the 1990s is the decade of awakening to the problems and personal sacrifices made by carers. Their role and contribution have been increasingly recognised across the wider community, and parliament has reflected this concern and has approved of the new measures to increase assistance to carers. This includes more funding for respite centres for carers, so that carers have a much needed opportunity to have a short break away from their charges, be it a few hours or a few weeks. As we now have some 540,000 people who are carers in our community, it is vital that they have this kind of support from governments. The successful Staying at Home package is seen as a real option in the community, but an option in which the role of the carer is still pivotal. This package provides a real option for older Australians to stay in their own homes and receive community care packages if they choose to do so. This bill will allow an additional 14,000 newly eligible people who care for adults to receive the new payment, at a cost of $92 million over four years. The eligibility of carers for children under 16 years of age, while it remains much the same, will be tightened. This legislation also creates a new assessment method, known as the adult disability assessment 4302 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 tool. However, this new assessment tool is currently being evaluated and submissions from special interest groups may modify its application in the future. There can be no doubt that this amendment bill provides only a minor recompense to the carer for their personal contribution and self-sacrifice in the care of their relative or friend. This is especially so when we consider the high level of care that is provided. I note that this legislation does not address the adequacy of the payments to the carer. As some have said to me, carers are the only pension recipients who have to actually work for their payment. I think that if we were to pay carers on contemporary hourly rates for the work they do, it would still go only a small way towards recompensing them for everything else that they give up. I am very mindful of a wonderful woman in my electorate, Mrs Karen Hair, of Heathcote, who has been the carer for her intellectually and physically handicapped disabled son for some 18 years. Karen and her husband Robert have had the support of Robert's parents in caring for their son Andrew and their three younger children. However, of recent times, Andrew's aggressive violent behaviour has added further stress and worry to this struggling family. The Hair family are really little Aussie battlers in every sense of that expression. Andrew has been known to just snap and physically hurt whoever is in his path. He frequently rages out of control and has knocked his mother to the ground and attacked his siblings; he hurls objects and smashes and pushes furniture around, seemingly determined to do as much damage as he can. While Andrew is almost 18 years old chronologically, his intellectual and adaptive skill has been assessed at around 19 months. The family's problem is that Andrew is becoming too strong and too much to handle, especially for his tiny mother who is around five feet tall. When Mrs Hair reluctantly came to the reality that Andrew and the rest of the children would be better off if Andrew went to a group home, she was stunned to realise that there were no places for Andrew. The group homes that are available were full and the waiting lists seemed interminable. Mrs Hair has reached the end of her tether. I read from the letter she has sent me so that the House may understand the weight under which this little mother is labouring. She says: We would never have been able to give Andrew a loving and caring home life if we hadn't had the support of my husband's parents. But they are now in their 70s and can no longer help us as they have done before. We get other support from Homecare in the mornings to dress, and feed Andrew and put him on the school bus. Andrew has had a lot of respite lately. Although we welcome the break, I feel very sad for Andrew as he gets trundled from one place to another. He gets very upset when he realises he is going into respite and feels very unsettled and insecure. If we could just get Andrew settled in a pennanent group home he would be more content and I know he would adjust well. We would have him at home at weekends and spend quality time with him as a family. At the moment we live in fear of what he will do next I haven't coped over the last few months and this has put an enonnous strain on our marriage and our other three children as well. My husband travels a lot with work and is finding his job is suffering because he can't do it properly and can't leave me with the children unless I have outside help. Andrew often displays socially inappropriate behaviours and so we are restricted as to where we can take him and whether the other children can have friends over. It makes our home life far from nonnal. We love Andrew dearly but the strain of caring for him at home has become too much. This family has been in crisis for many years but, as their child gets older and stronger, he is creating a further stress which is threatening the future of the family. There is a severe lack of accommodation for people such as Andrew. I think it is time that state and federal governments reviewed the policy of allowing only group homes and not accommodation facilities which could take greater numbers of residents. For some decades, Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4303 especially after the Richmond report, the New South Wales government has rejected institutions as a means of looking after people with special disabilities or a mental illness. For the sake of many families like Mrs Hair and families with adult children who have severe disabilities, I respectfully suggest that governments review this policy. No-one wants to return to the strict institutionalisation of the past, but there is another way. Just as many of our senior citizens sell their homes and enter purpose-built retirement centres which they purchase themselves, why could it not be possible for those families who can afford it to purchase a unit for their child in a purpose-built home centre? This home centre could have individual units owned by the families of the resident and, like the senior citizens, could have common dining rooms and activity rooms, and garden areas could also be incorporated. In this scenario the disabled resident would not just be an inmate, as they were in the old institutions, but would be the owner of the unit. The home centre could also have available a certain number of other places for those who could not afford to purchase the unit, but some recognition of the right of occupancy should be accorded to the resident. The units could be sold back to the managing organisation when the resident dies in a similar way that the units of retirees are sold back to their managing organisations for use by another retiree. There are many ageing parents of adult children who are exceptionally well off financially in the community and who would. be grateful for the opportunity to provide secure accommodation and care for their child in their own declining years. Yet the present policy environment makes no provision for such people and these parents have to worry for the rest of their lives as to what will happen to their adult disabled children when they themselves die. If the government allowed these people to provide home centres for their adult disabled children, it would certainly allow the government to better provide for those people who do not have wealthy parents who could provide for them. It seems to me high time the problem of accommodation for these special people in our community was reviewed. The state cannot, and is not, properly supporting these people and their ageing parents. Indeed, it is the ageing parents who are labouring under an unfair burden of unending responsibility and worry right up to the time of their own death. There are many families who desperately need a review of. this situation so that other supportive environments could be properly explored which would care for people like Andrew and help families like Mr and Mrs Hair. Having said that, I would also like very briefly to raise the situation of disabled children after they do leave their school environment. There seem to be very few post-school options for children with severe disabilities. I will be speaking on this subject at a further time because I do think it is something which we as a government have to address. This legislation certainly is an important measure in the government's support for carers and their families. I welcome and commend it to the House. I thank all of those members who have contributed to this quite extensive debate which has, I think, recognised the important role that carers play in our community. I have listened with interest to the reports of members about particular cases, about the particular difficulties that are confronted by families when they need to address the issues of caring for a loved one, a loved one with disabilities, or someone who is reaching the end of their life after being a much loved and integral part of the family. Appropriate care and facilities for carers and appropriate recognition of their needs are important.",164,Representatives Main Committee
228,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Community Services) (10.59 a.m.)-in reply-May4304 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 I would like to thank all of those members who have demonstrated their personal involvement and commitment to this cause through their contribution to this debate today and yesterday. The government is also committed to carers and recognises the important role they play in supporting and caring for children and adults with disabilities and elderly Australians. In each budget since coming to office the government has improved the benefits provided to carers and care recipients in terms of income support, respite and access to information. This includes the $280 million Staying at Home package announced in April 1998. An additional $98.5 million in financial assistance has been allocated to carers over the next four years. The government has provided additional resources for carer respite centres as well as more assistance for ageing carers. The government is committed to maintaining the single rate of all pensions including the carer payment at no less than 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. The partnered rate will also be maintained similarly. This bill contains six major measures aimed at improving assistance to carers, including the measures announced in the government's Staying at Home package in April 1998. The measures represent the final stage of a three-year program of reform which commenced in the 1996-97 budget. As part of this package of measures, a new social security payment known as carer allowance will be introduced from 1 July 1999. Carer allowance will combine two existing payments-the child disability allowance for carers of children up to 16 years, and the domiciliary nursing care benefit for carers of adults, 16 years of age or more. Carer allowance will be paid to people caring at home for a child with a disability, or an adult who has a disability or is frail aged or chronically ill. It is expected that introducing more liberal eligibility criteria for carer allowance for carers of adults will see a net increase of some 14,000 recipients. Provisions for the two payments that will form the carer allowance are to be broadly aligned, but there will still be separate adult and child components with their own eligibility conditions. Carer allowance will not be subject to any income or assets test and will not be taxable. A new basis for assessment of eligibility for a carer allowance for carers of adults, and for carer payment, will be introduced in the form of an adult disability assessment tool. The adult disability assessment tool will assess the functional ability of the care recipient on a more consistent basis than the previous domiciliary nursing care benefit arrangement. The adult disability assessment tool provides a simpler, more objective and comprehensive way of measuring functional ability. The current test of 'constant care and attention' for carer payment purposes, and 'nursing home level of care' for domiciliary nursing care benefit, are considered too subjective and lead to inconsistent decision making. The adult disability assessment tool will better measure the level of functional disability of a care recipient by considering areas such as cognition, behavioural problems and special care needs as well as issues of physical functioning and need for assistance in activities of daily living. The adult disability assessment tool requires the input of both the carer and the treating health professional to assess the extent of the care recipient's functional disability, therefore providing for a more comprehensive disability assessment. The introduction of the adult disability assessment tool is expected to result in more costeffective medical assessments and less frequent medical interviews. The adult disability assessment tool was developed in consultation with, and is overwhelmingly supported by, a Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4305 range of disability and carer support organisations and treating health professional and customer reference groups. I noted the comments of the member for Lilley that he has not had access to the disallowable instrument. I think the member for Lilley is overlooking the fact that the adult disability assessment tool was developed in consultation with almost 30 peak disability and carer organisations, including the Carers Association of Australia and ACROD. All these bodies have given their endorsement to the tool. The adult disability assessment tool was field tested on more than 5,500 customers. It was positively received and proven to be an effective measure of functional ability. The government will make the adult disability assessment tool available as soon as it is drafted. The government has nothing to hide in this matter and members of the opposition, or other members of the public who have an interest in this matter, will be able to assess it once the drafting is complete. The member for Cowan raised an issue· about a constituent. From the information he provided, I think it was probably a taxation matter and, therefore, not one about which I can respond to, even though he did ask for a specific response in his summing up. If Mr Edwards is able to pass on the information to me, I will naturally be happy to provide it to the Assistant Treasurer or the Treasurer and seek a response to the issues that he has raised. The bill will extend qualification for carer payment to a new category of carers. When a person is caring for a mildly disabled adult who fails to qualify the carer for the carer payment, and that disabled adult has a child under 16 who requires care-being either disabled or under the age of six-the carer may qualify for carer payment for both the adult and the child. This measure addresses an important shortfall in current income support arrangements by allowing full-time carers access to carer payment in a situation where he or she provides care to an adult who has a child and the adult's disability alone does not qualify the carer for carer payment. The bill introduces provisions for carers to claim carer payment for up to 63 days in a calender year when the person being cared for is hospitalised and the carer participates in the hospital care. This measure also applies to the carer allowance. Currently a person cannot make a claim for carer payment or for child disability allowance or the domiciliary nursing care benefit while the care receiver is in hospital. A carer payment or child disability allowance recipient can only continue to receive the payment when the care receiver is hospitalised by using their respite care allowance of 63 days in a calender year. Under the new qualification provisions, a person will be able to claim and receive payment for 63 days of hospitalisation in a calender year, in addition to respite care days. The bill extends qualification for carer payment bereavement payments to carers whose partners were receiving a social security benefit. Under present arrangements, bereavement payments have only been available where the partner had been receiving a social security pension or certain other payments. This amendment will bring carer payment into line with other social security payments. The bill also provides for amendments to ensure that the general qualification conditions for carer payment that currently apply when a care receiver is a profoundly disabled child will also be applied to cases where the care receivers are two or more disabled children. These amendments remove an unintended loophole created by previous amendments and provide for consistent and fair treatment of carers of two or more disabled children and carers of a profoundly disabled child. 4306 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 This legislation advances the arrangements and the care that is available to support carers in the important work that they do in their community.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Cognate bills: Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 March, on motion by Mr Fahey: That the bill be now read a second time. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.10 a.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, when I was last speaking on the appropriation bills I was talking about the Prime Minister and his refusal to acknowledge Gerry Adams. Just as the Prime Minister's refusal to acknowledge and meet with Gerry Adams was an indication of his inward-looking philosophy, his inward-looking politics, and his outlook on life, so too is his attempt to produce a preamble to the Constitution. It really represents his view of life, a view of life that is very backward, inward-looking and based back in the fifties. It is an embarrassment to a number of Australians; as yet I am unable to find anyone who has had anything favourable to say about. this preamble. The preamble is, you could say, the republic you have when you do not have a republic. It is his answer to the republic; it is his substitution for a new Constitution. There is no significance whatsoever in this preamble to our Constitution. It will not change anything. All it does is put forward John Howard's view of Australia and I must say I find it a very disrespectful view of Australia for a number of Australians. I do not see that we, in Australia, can use that to base our future on. WhatI would call a good preamble is the one that has been produced by Gareth Evans, which really sets out a vision for the future: proud of our diversity, loving our unique and ancient land, recognising indigenous Australians as the original occupants and custodians of our land, believing in freedom and equality, embracing democracy and the rule of law, and committing ourselves to our Constitution. That is what a preamble should be about: something with vision that says we are Australians, what Australia is about and where we are going. Mr Deputy Speaker, if this government continues along the track that it has followed to date, it is going to continue to create inequity within our society rather than to work to bring our community together. All the legislation that has been passed by this government since I have been a member of the House has been legislation aimed at creating divisiveness and a two-",167,Representatnes Main Committee
229,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Andrews),"If no member wishes to consider the bill inWednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4307 tiered society. It has been about looking after the mates of the members of the government and those in business at the expense of the workers, average Australians, the pensioners, the unemployed and all those people that are less fortunate. You have only to look at some of its legislation, like legislation that affects unfair dismissal. Who is that looking after? Business. What about the people that work? What about those workers who will lose the protection that that unfair dismissal legislation gave? What about youth wages? Once again the government is attacking the conditions and the wages of those people in a less powerful position within the community. Look at the Private Health Insurance Incentive Scheme: 30 per cent to people that are members of private health insurance; 30 per cent to people that previously were means tested, people that have a higher level of income, people that are able to afford insurance. It is not going to do anything towards making it easier for those people that cannot afford health insurance to access the hospital system. No, it is looking after those people that are in the most affluent position. Look at the changes that have taken place to the youth allowance, at how that has placed so many young people back in a situation where they are dependent on their parents; a situation where, rather than being independent, they are now deemed to be children. It is okay for them to vote. It is okay for them to be responsible for their actions in any crime that they may commit. In that sense they are adults; in that sense they are deemed to be solely responsible for their own acts. But when it comes to the youth allowance they are deemed to be dependent on their parents; when it comes to the youth wage they are not deemed to be an adult. Then we move to the GST, the government's answer to tax reform, tax reform that is going to help Australia, help Australians. Well, I ask which Australians it is going to help. How can it help the pensioners who are going to have to pay more for their food? How is it going to help the pensioners who have to pay GST on funeral expenses? How is it going to help those people that live in relocatable homes in parks and who will now have to pay a GST component in their rent? How is it going to help young families who are going to have to pay GST on their food, GST on their children's haircuts, GST on their children's books? How is it going to help all those average, everyday people? How is it going to help them to survive? How is that going to improve their quality of life? And the small businesses that are operating within the community will now become de facto tax collectors. All you have to do is look to the submissions that have been taken in relation to the GST to see that it is a failed concept. It will create hurt for very many people within the community. I urge the government to rethink their proposal to introduce a GST. I urge them to be repentant about the $19 million that they spent on advertising their GST, to be repentant and to apologise to the Australian people for using their taxation dollars to sell their election promise. And in doing that I might just remind the members of the government that 51 per cent of the people in Australia did not support their GST, and if you look to the Senate vote it was in excess of 60 per cent. SoI hardly think the government can say they have got a mandate to introduce this horrendous, draconian tax on the people of Australia. I mentioned relocatable homes and the people that live in residential parks. In doing so I pointed out to the members of the government the problem and the hardship that their GST tax will cause those residents, who will now be forced to pay GST on their rent-GST to live in their own homes within these residential parks. I would also like to point out the contrast 4308 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 with what has happened in New South Wales, with the reforms that the Carr government has legislated in recognising that these people that have chosen this lifestyle option of living in residential parks deserve to have security, deserve to be able to predict what happens to their rent, deserve to be able to have their mail delivered to their house and deserve to be treated as first-class, not second-class, citizens. Never has there been a greater contrast than between what the Carr government is doing in New South Wales for people that live in residential parks and what this government is doing: one is creating security and one is creating insecurity. WhilstI am talking about the commitment of the Carr government as opposed to the commitment of the Howard government here in Canberra, I will tum to an issue of great importance within the Shortland electorate and that is the remediation and restoration of Lake Macquarie. For many years a succession of governments have refused to take any responsibility for the lake that is right in the centre of Shortland electorate and that divides the electorate of Shortland from the electorate of Charlton. Following a recently completed study and a task force of all the people involved in caring for the lake, a series of recommendations were developed and the Carr government committed $7.7 million to the lake over a three-year period. This is in stark contrast to the commitment that has come from the federal government. Lake Macquarie City Council has applied for a $194,000 grant for immediate work. In the recommendations of the task force, it was stated that there should be an ongoing commitment from the federal government to work together with both local and state government to ensure that this wonderful lake is healthy into the future and is restored to its past glories. Guess what? This federal government has not even been prepared to give that $194,000. To date, there has been no commitment of that $194,000: the Carr government, $7.7 million; the federal government, nothing. I would like to place on record my disgust and, whilst doing that, I ask the Howard government to respond to Lake Macquarie City Council's application, to give that $194,000 and to move away from its partisan politics. I might add that there were some very good applications to the Federation Fund by Lake Macquarie City Council looking at improving the environment in the lake area. But, once again, they were unsuccessful. I am sure that Lake Macquarie City Council's lack of success in those applications, once again, went to the core of the partisan politics that is played by the government here in this place. The one thing that the government did not acknowledge, though, is that Lake Macquarie Council is not under the control of the Labor Party. The government's friends are the majority party on the council and the government disappointed them as well as all the other people within the Lake Macquarie area. I will touch on Centrelink and some of the problems that the people of Shortland and the office in the Shortland electorate have been experiencing. The thing that concerns me more than anything is the undue pressure that is being placed on staff. The staff at Centrelink have been told that they are not allowed to talk to our office. The staff at Centrelink have been told very definitely that they are only allowed to release very specific information to my electorate office in Shortland. We rang and made a constituent inquiry of a family allowance department and were told that they were not allowed to release that information. A staff member at that office was threatened with dismissal if they attended a meeting that was held at my office last Saturday. This is disgusting. This is really intimidation of staff. Not only is it working against the interests of the constituents, the people that live in Shortland electorate; it is creating undue stress for those people that are working within that office. My Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4309 understanding is that stress claims are up considerably and that a major occupational health and safety issue has been created by this government. This government needs to concentrate on delivering services. This government needs to think about the people in the community. This government needs to stop practising partisan politics and looking after its mates in big business. This government needs to deliver some outward looking policies rather than trying to take Australia back to the 1950s, back to a world that no longer exists. It needs to develop inclusive politics and move away from the politics of division and attack. bills. As members would be aware, but those who are listening may not be, appropriation bills are an aspect of debate within the parliament which does not have any strict rules about relevance. This means that we can go across a wide range of topics while still being in tune with the debate, so I intend to go across a wide range of topics. I note the presence, on the other side of the chamber, of my friend the member for Sturt. The member for Sturt is a fine member of this House. But he has a problem. He is from South Australia. That is not generally a problem in itself, but he is also a member of the South Australian Liberal Party and, further, a member of, I think, the wet faction. I often think of the member for Sturt when I see the movie The Power of One, because he is there alone against many others. I note that he is nodding with some chagrin. I wish him all the best because I know he stands for a range of things and, although I may not always agree with him on them, I commend his dedication to his beliefs. Nonetheless, I do not wish his circumstances upon me. Being from Victoria, I have my own problems-and that is another story. In this debate on the appropriation bills I would like to go over a couple of issues. One is something that I have raised in the Main Committee previously in this term: the way the government has been running the main chamber of the House of Representatives since the election. A number of bills of significant national importance have been gagged. Several bills in relation to health and to employee relations have been gagged. We have also had a situation where the address-in-reply was gagged, which is another precedent but is not something we would like to see continued through parliaments into the future, because it does say something about what this chamber is supposed to be all about, which is to give members an opportunity to raise issues and to debate issues of national importance through to a conclusion and to ensure that all the various issues in the conduct of legislation get on the record. But that has not been the experience since the election. One of the other things that I would like to raise is the arguments that have occurred since the election. It happens on an ongoing basis that, once an election has occurred, we have an argument about winners and losers. The media reports of a party's win are very much like the reports of a tennis match or a football match where one side has won by a goal or a point. Reading the media reports, we might think a party had won by 1,000 points or 10 goals, because the whole nature of the way reports are written post the event is emphasising the winner versus the loser. We have the same situation in politics in this country, particularly in the context of the last election. A point made by speakers on this side on a number of occasions recently is that the Labor Party, on a two-party preferred basis, received in excess of 51 per cent of the vote and so the support of a majority of the Australian people of voting age who cast votes at that election. This is not the first time it has happened that a party has, in fact, gained a majority of the vote",170,Representatives Main Committee
230,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (11.26 A.m.),"We are here today to debate a number of appropriation4310 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 but not a majority of the seats. It has happened on several occasions. It happened once to the coalition in 1990 and it happened to the Labor Party on several occasions prior to that. But the interesting thing is that it has been something like 50.2 per cent, 50.1 per cent and 50.3 per cent of the vote. This is the first time a party has gained 51 per cent of a two-party preferred vote and not been elected to the treasury bench. excess of 51 per cent. That happens, but we have got to make a point about that. It relates to electoral boundaries which are drawn with the intention of fair play-no doubt about that from the independent Electoral Commissioner's point of view-but in that context it, in fact, produces a result where there is at least a reasonable argument that it is not going to accord with the majority view of the Australian people. If we take the point of the taxation legislation that this government are bringing forward in terms of the goods and services tax, they say and quite proudly claim-and I do not blame them; I guess if I were in their situation I would proudly claim it too-that they won the election; they received a majority of support in a majority of seats and on that basis they have a mandate. But I think we have got to be very clear on this. If the taxation legislation had been put to a referendum, it would have been defeated because very clearly a majority of people voted against it, particularly in the way they voted in terms of the upper house, the Senate, but also in terms of the lower house. So, if there had been a vote of the Australian people on the issue of this set of taxation legislation in the context of a referendum to measure national support, it would have been defeated. So to argue that it has majority public support is just foolish because in the context of the recent election some six months ago an actual position was taken. It was a vote taken and the position was clearly put and the Australian people clearly rejected it. That is an issue that this government has got to take into account. I think it is also something that they have to take into account in a range of other legislation that they are pursuing or have proposed since the election. On a range of those issues the claiming of a mandate is tenuous at best and, in some respects, quite disingenuous. But beyond that I would like to talk a little bit about my electorate, the electorate of Bruce in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and some of the issues that have been before us in that area in recent times. I am proud to have in the middle of my electorate AFL Park, Waverley. It is just across the road from my office, with the freeway between us. It is a fine football ground and the home of the St Kilda Saints and the Hawthorn Hawks. I have been known on occasions on Sundays to go in there and on Saturdays and SundaysI sometimes take my children and watch the Saints and the Hawks gloriously flog teams from Adelaide on occasions. I think that is something that even the member for Wannon and I can unite upon. for anybody from Victoria. But the issue of AFL Park, Waverley, raises a range of concerns about the operation of the AFL and the question of planning for the future in relation to the sporting public of Melbourne. I think that the Docklands is a fine site but the arguments about the Docklands versus AFL Park miss a key point about the organisation of the demographics of Melbourne, and that is that the demographic centre of Melbourne is actually approaching the south-eastern suburbs. It is getting out now past Hawthorn towards Waverley itself. The fact is, if you are looking at distances, at times for travelling and so on, and if you are looking",173,Representatives Main Committee

There needs to be a ground at Waverley. To have a situation where that opportunity that exists is removed is a very unfortunate thing for football in Victoria. I hope that the issue of money, a key issue in the considerations of the AFL, will be thought through again although I have got grave doubts that that will be the case. The previous speaker, the member for Shortland, mentioned the Federation Fund. I am on record as having some problems with the Federation Fund in terms of its actual program and set-up. We recently had a number of applications to the Federation Fund from the local area for a number of projects that I think are quite worthwhile. The local committee has considered those issues and a range of applications have gone to the minister's office for consideration. I am hopeful that we will hear in the next few weeks as to the success of those applications. I think they will produce some well needed activities in the local area around projects that are worthy, although I would state that, as a project, I think it is very unfortunately organised in the spread of funding, it is quite arbitrary and it also misses the point about the question in local areas of really getting joint funding applications going that produce real infrastructure and development possibilities in communities. It would have made more sense for the government to look back to some of the programs followed by the Labor government previously-for example, the local capital works program, which the member for Port Adelaide would be well aware of. metropolitan Australia and provided local communities with very important and needed infrastructure and assets. I wi11leave it there today. I note the member for Batman is here to entertain us with some very important information regarding his portfolio area, and I look forward to listening to that. I commend the bills to the House. member for Bruce that if he wants to see some real football he need only go to Olympic Park this Friday night to see Melbourne Storm, the leading Melbourne Rugby League team, actually perform. They are a credit to Melbourne and a credit to Rugby League. I suppose we could all learn, and I urge the member for Bruce to actually go and watch a decent game of football this Friday evening. In that context, we should also acknowledge that the entertainment and recreation industry is an area of growing employment. I am pleased to say that, when Labor was in government, in an endeavour to actually create training opportunities for young people we established a decent traineeship program that supported young people in the sporting and recreation industry. It is on that note today that I want to raise and place before the Main Committee what I regard as the failure of the government to develop meaningful training programs for people needing skill upgrades to re-enter the work force and the failure of-the government to recognise the lack of training goals. I refer to the high level of unemployment in this country and the lack of proper courses and facilities to provide adequate training and job skills which I believe are essential to enable people to rejoin the work force. In this context, it is of overriding concern to the community.",174,Representatives Main Committee

237,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (11.36 A.m.),"In opening, I would suggest to the4312 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 I therefore think it is appropriate that I also deal this morning with the failure of the Howard government to create jobs after three long years in government. I want to do some comparisons of Labor's last three years in government with the Howard government's first three years in government. Firstly, I go to the issue of total jobs growth. The Howard government has created 382,800 jobs as against 729,900 jobs created by Labor in its last three years. In essence, the Prime Minister's government has created only 52.4 per cent of the number of full-time jobs that we created in our last three years in government. I go to the question of full-time jobs. The Howard government's record is 169,700, or only 38.9 per cent of the total jobs that we created of 436,200 in our last three years in government. As far as I am concerned, a permanent part-time job is as good as a permanent full-time job, and the Howard government has created 213,100 jobs as against 293,700 jobs created by Labor, or only 72.6 per cent. Dealing with the question of unemployed people, after three years, February 1996 to February 1999, the government has reduced unemployment by only 67,600. It has reduced unemployment amongst males by 45,500 and amongst females by 22,100. We should also acknowledge that, during this period, a very significant number of Australians-both men and women, young, old and middle aged-have given up any hope of finding a job. That is largely reflected in the participation rate, which has dropped by 0.7 per cent since the Howard government was elected in March 1996. That is a very telling point-the fact that the participation rate has fallen by over one half of one per cent-and it represents avery significant statement that, out there in the labour market, a lot of people have given up any hope of finding a job. I raise those issues because we on this side of the House, like most Australians, welcome the recent reduction in the overall unemployment figures. But they have to be placed in the context of what progress has been made, and the truth of the matter is that we have made very little progress, despite the suggestion in the ABS figures that we are now under eight per cent. Well, there is a huge drop in the participation rate of over half of one per cent-actually, 0.7 per cent-which, in no small way, has contributed to a seeming improvement in the figures. I suggest that the problem, unfortunately, is that we have made very little impact on reducing unemployment. I refer to the fact that, after three years, this government has been able to reduce unemployment by only 67,600. Frankly, the Australian community expects more-the employment situation should have improved by more than a reduction of just on 65,000 in three years. I also have major concerns about the plight of the long-term unemployed. They are the forgotten masses out in the suburbs and the regions of rural Australia who are really doing it tough at the moment; they are the ones who are not being assisted by the Job Network. One of my major outstanding criticisms of the Job Network is that, despite the very significant payments that are made available by the government to the Job Network providers for the most disadvantaged in the community, there is no accountability on the part of network providers and no obligation on them to invest some of that money-for example, by giving job subsidies to employers to assist in getting the long-term unemployed back to work, by paying for them to get a licence to be able to operate mechanical equipment or by providing a training program to assist them with improving their literacy or numeracy. A big issue after you have been unemployed for a very significant period and you do not have a lot of money in your pocket is the cost of going to and from a job interview and Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4313 meeting the government's requirements for the work test. It imposes a significant financial burden on the long-term unemployed and their household. I believe that, in the review of the next tender round, this government has to put pressure on the network providers to spend some of that money in order to be accountable with respect to thy needs of the long-term unemployed. Until the problems of this group are adequately addressed, and until the proper training programs are devised to meet their needs, we cannot feel confident in any way that we are finally coming to grips with a major problem in our unemployment mix. While there is concern in the community for all long-term unemployed, you also must understand that the largest groupings are amongst the young and the over-45s, especially bluecollar males. They are the ones, as we have opened the Australian economy up-and there is no turning back-who have suffered most, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, would know from your own state of Tasmania, when it comes to being dislocated from jobs that they performed well. They were dedicated workers but, for a variety of reasons--changes in tariffs and technology-they have been made redundant. We owe those very decent Australians assistance through the Job Network and targeted programs to give them and their families a better chance in life. ' The government have spelt out their policies on denying young unemployed .the rights of benefits unless they sign up for literacy and numeracy tests and training. But they do not tell us-and this is a very serious question-how or where this training will take place, and I think the Australian community is entitled to an answer to that question. Who is going to provide all the training? What has happened to the $143 million in contracts the government awarded to private sector organisations for the provision of 36,000 places in literacy and numeracy courses for the unemployed-where is it? They have not been filled. The work test alone, the question of the reciprocal obligation--or the mutual obligation as this government calls it-is not enough. In essence, what policies is the government putting in place to deal with this issue? It goes to accountability-accountability in the Job Network and accountability with respect to the provision of and access to literacy and numeracy places. From what we understand on this side of the House, there has been a drastic dearth of takers for the courses offered through these private agencies. Yet there are tens of thousands of young people out of work and we know that many of them desperately need this sort of training before they can get a chance to participate in the work force. It is a basic requirement to get back into the work force. Why can't the government get young people into these programs? That question has to be answered. Is it because the programs do not actually achieve their goals? Is it because the training offered is inadequate and provides no real skills? Is it simply a coordination problem and a failure to get the information into the right hands? IUs not about playing politics on the issue today; it is a question of trying to get answers to this very serious issue. The places were supposedly provided and yet we are not filling them. You know that, Mr Deputy Speaker, from what is happening in your own state. Under the terms of its contracts with thy 69 private sector providers the government guaranteed payment for 6,000 places, but as reported in the newspapers recently they only had 108 applicants. In essence, this means that the government is obliged to payout $14 million as a result of its guarantee. Unless the government can fill these places by the end of the financial year we will be put in the ridiculous position of each of the 108 applicants costing 4314 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 the taxpayers about $130,000 per place for the training that is so vital to getting them back to work. Perhaps this is the reason why the government has come up with its literacy and numeracy scheme for young people, a scheme that we now know will be expanded to take in all unemployment benefit recipients. While many of us are aware of the problems of young job seekers and the problems that are put in their paths by an uncaring government, we also have an equally soul destroying situation with workers aged over 45. As the House knows, these people are extremely vulnerable and many of them are stuck in a rut in rural and regional Australia. The end result of long-term unemployment is a loss of pride, position, status and a lifetime of loyalty and commitment, and they are a real problem in the family household. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics there are also more than 1.2 million Australians wanting to workand yet they are not counted among the unemployed. That goes in tandem with the fact that I raised at the outset. The actual reduction in unemployment, when it comes to the overall percentage, not only has been assisted by the fact that there are 1.2 million Australians who want to work; it also largely reflects a drop in the participation rate over the last three years of 0.7 per cent. The ABS found that many people have just given up. They are discouraged because of the lack of suitable jobs or because they lack the skills needed or were considered too old by employers. I would argue that the Australian community has to rethink its attitude to middle-aged people. Those people want to work. Our commitment as a community must be to provide training opportunities for those people and reskill them. It also means that employers, and especially personnel officers when they do job interviews, need to change what has become the Australian belief that people are too old, that they are really past it, and that they are not entitled to a second go in life despite a long history in the work force. It could have been with the railways, a clothing factory, a steel factory, an automotive factory, or it could have been on the local council. A lot of those jobs have gone. Those people want to work. We, as a community, have to equip them for work through government programs. That can be done by using a combination of programs provided by government, the community sector and the private sector. It also means that, if we do it as a community, if we invest in getting those people equipped to come back to work, then the whole community will have to rethink its attitude. Unfortunately, that attitude in respect of giving middle-aged people another chance to get back into the job market is a negative attitude at the moment. I believe that the plight of this growing group is largely overlooked by the government, unfortunately. It is referred to in the letters of December last year of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business to the Prime Minister, which we made available to the community. He basically says, 'Look, if people think there is a middle-aged unemployment problem if we are pressured, then we will rebadge a couple of programs to make it look as if we are doing something.' That is not a real commitment. It is a major problem. You know it, Mr Deputy Speaker, and people on the other side of the House from regional Australia know it. Go to places such as Wide Bay in Queensland. Just walk around there and you will see a huge regional unemployment problem and a lot of middle-aged people crying out for help. I simply urge the government today, in thinking about the Job Network, to think about the most disadvantaged, rejig the tender round and make sure that we go out of our way to assist Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4315 the middle-aged unemployed. They all have contributions to make to the nation as a whole and to their local communities. More importantly, none will be able to make a contribution equal to those of us who are fortunate enough to have a job to the well-being and future of their families, to the next generation and their children. Unfortunately, they are denied decent training opportunities. A negative attitude in a lot of employers' minds is not only denying these people a second chance in life but also condemning their families more often than not to no real opportunity in life, pulling down regional Australia, both suburban and rural Australia. It is basically pulling down Australia because we are losing wonderful economic capacity to take Australia forward. I think we have to front up to this problem. Let us try and crank up job growth in Australia but also make sure that the jobs that do come through do not just go to the households fortunate enough to have a job at the moment. Let us try and spread those jobs to the households that just have not been able to access the job market. The problem is that, the way the labour market performs, it tends to reinforce itself. All the evidence suggests that, as we crank up job growth, unfortunately the jobs tend to go to the households with a job in them already because they are attached to and participating in the labour market. We have to bring into the labour market in future those households and suburbs and areas of rural Australia that are missing out on the benefits of job growth to date and require some government ·assistance. I, therefore, indicate that the despair felt by those young and old alike is compounded by their knowledge that there are very few programs to assist them. There are no; or very few, structured training programs and they have a government that continues to cut back on services and resources while attempting to bludgeon people into ill-conceived literacy and numeracy programs that have yet to see the light of day. I do not raise these issues as a person who is opposed to literacy and numeracy programs. I have campaigned in· support of them not just for the unemployed but also in workplaces where people are fortunate enough to have a job, because improving literacy and numeracy is a benefit not only in getting back to work, but also in seeking to develop a career opportunity. When you come in on the ground floor, those skills then help you to assume tasks and skills of greater benefit to the employer and of greater benefit to yourself, so people develop a long-term career opportunity in a given workplace or a given industry. I then indicate in that context that there are also some weaknesses with the New Apprenticeships scheme. Yes, they have lifted the number of what I still describe as traineeships, and what the government calls apprenticeships, in the non-traditional areas of training. I welcome the special benefits in that context amongst the 20to 24-year-olds. I would also point out that in the traditional apprenticeship areas-the building, metal and electrical trades-around Australia where the department of employment has now established that we have major skill shortages, we are actually going backwards when it comes to training and encouraging people to pursue apprenticeships. There is nothing wrong with being a bricklayer, an electrician, a welder or a boilermaker. I would also suggest that, on that basis, we have to try and change the attitudes of parents, vocational education teachers and the community· at large. There is nothing wrong, for example, with working in the manufacturing industry. We should be doing everything possible to encourage not just the new traineeships and apprenticeships but also traditional apprenticeships in what we regard as the traditional trades. 4316 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 Mr Deputy Speaker, I then go to the issue of work for the dole. I want to clearly say that, from the Labor Party's point of view, reciprocal obligation is labour at work. The Labor Party does not believe in handouts. It believes in people fronting up to their responsibilities. I urge the government to think more about training that is relevant to a job. All too often some of these programs are light on training but heavy on discipline. I accept the issue of disciplinefronting up to your responsibilities-but I also regard it as being a responsibility of government to participate in a two-way street, with discipline and responsibility but also decent training relevant to a job in a local community. I think the area consultative committees in regional Australia have got to have greater involvement in trying to point these programs into areas that are relevant to the growing job market in that community. We still have a major problem on the employment front. We have made some progress. The figures are assisted by a reduction in the participation rate. But if we want to get to the heart of it, which is the long-term unemployed and the fall-off in the traditional trades, the budget is coming up and the second tender round for the Job Network is coming up. Here is a chance to pick up where the weaknesses are and to actually build on our success to date. It has been a success by successive governments, Labor and Liberal, with respect to some of these issues. Learn from the mistakes on both sides. Fix the weaknesses that are emerging and clearly evident to the community. Thank you. the appropriation bills. Owing to my job as Deputy Speaker1 very rarely get to speak on anything and so it is very pleasingMr Martin Ferguson-With good reason. for Batman that I was very interested to hear what he was saying in the conclusion to his contribution. I do applaud him for making the points that we should be avoiding handouts and that the training should be relevant to actually getting jobs. I think he is talking great good sense there. I do not always agree with him but I always take the opportunity, if I believe anybody-government or opposition-is doing the right thing, to be fair enough and fair dinkum enough to acknowledge that. That leads me into something else. We have a large number of new members in the parliament at the moment, most of them of course on the opposition side. Mr Martin Ferguson-Not enough. time in the Speaker's chair, I have the opportunity of listening to a great many contributions from both sides. One thing that has struck me-and I want to do this in a spirit of goodwill; I am not going to name any particular member; I do not seek to embarrass any-is that a significant number of the new members, most of them on the opposition side, tend not to have a spirit of goodwill about them. I think the essential thing about this parliament is that everybody who has a seat here, either in the Senate or in the House of Representatives, is concerned for the good of Australia. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a large number of school groups who come from my electorate to visit Parliament House. I go out of my way to give them the special Garry Nehl tour. I bash their ears about democracy. In fact, if they are coming down when the House is not sitting, if I possibly can I journey down so I can be with them.",175,Representatives Main Committee

239,Mr Nehl,You may think so. Before he leaves I would just like to say to the member,180,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Nehl,"You may think so. I think you have far too many. But, as I do spend so muchWednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4317 One of the things I make a point of saying to every school group that comes is that while we may disagree and have different policies and beliefs from those on the other side of politics, what must be acknowledged is that every member of this place is here for the good of Australia. While I may think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you are misguided and you may think I am wrong, you and I both will acknowledge that everybody here is here to do their best for Australia and that is the way it should be. But I detect in the contributions of some of the newer members and-God help me, I will probably be in great trouble for this-particularly the new women members on the other side that there is a lack of goodwill, a lack of understanding that everybody is here to try and help Australia. There is even a degree of nastiness, viciousness even. I want to say to them, and to anybody on either side of the House who does not understand that we are all here to help Australia, that there is good and bad in all things. I just praised the member for Batman for his contribution. Over the years that I have been here I have always taken the opportunity, where appropriate, to praise members on the other side. One that comes immediately to mind is the honourable member for Bowman, who was Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the last Labor government. While he was minister I praised him in this House and in my electorate, and in fact since he left the House and before he came back at the last election. I have done that in this place and I have done it in my electorate in the presence of the present minister, Bruce Scott. I say to everybody that you should be prepared to acknowledge people doing a good job. Con Sciacca did a fantastic job as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Bruce Scott is doing a fantastic job, with the same feeling and the same application of goodwill. This is what we are here for. While it is okay to attack each other's policies, I think it is very important that all members should be aware that we are here to play the ball, not the man,' and we should always be prepared to try and be positive. . I would like to mention a few things. As I said, I will name nobody; I seek not to embarrass any particular member. But we have had instances where, time and time again, particularly the new members-aided and abetted, I think, by the members for Hotham and Batman-make the most outrageous statements about the government policy and the government activities. One of the most constant ones is that we are seeking, so they say, to cut wages. If you stop and think about that with the slightest degree of logic, what government in its right mind would seek to cut wages? You would be out on your ear at the first opportunity. Yet it is that very negative approach that comes across again and again. One member claimed that the government had systematically chopped, hacked and slashed Centrelink staff levels. But I would like to say to the committee and to the community that we announced only in January another 100 Centrelink outreach agencies and services being established right around Australia. In my electorate I am very fortunate: we have Centrelink services at the Dorrigo Multipurpose Service; we have a Woolgoolga agency, which the Minister for Community Services, Warren Truss, will be opening early next month; and we have one at Bellingen. These are of tremendous penefit to the electors of Australia. I am lucky, I have got three. I would like more because it provides the service on the· doorstep of the people that need it. That is a good step, a great development. I will use my own electorate to give an example-and I am sure it is the same in every other electorate-of somebody living in, say, Bellingen or Dorrigo and having to go to the Centrelink office at Coffs Harbour. Very often, people who are in this situation have very few 4318 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 assets, very little money-they are on a very low income-and there is no public transport and many do not have cars. How on earth do they effectively travel that distance to do a basic part of their living if they are on benefits of any kind? SoI applaud the government because what we are doing is providing service on the spot for the voters and the constituents of Australia. I think that is very important. We are spending over $5 million on that over three years and there has been a very positive response to it. Another thing we have been charged with, as I said, is cutting wages. And there is the continuing onslaught about the new tax system. It is a fair target. But if we are going to attack a major initiative which is designed to benefit all Australians, I think we should do it on the basis of logic and on the basis of a fair go. There are constant calls to say that we are going to make the pensioners worse off. People should realise that Treasury has estimated a 1.9 per cent increase in costs across the board. Everybody, even blind Freddy, knows that Treasury estimates can be wrong. They can be wrong if you have a Labor government; they can be wrong if you have a coalition government. But, at this point, that is the basic data on which we have to work. So we expect in total sincerity that that increase across the board will be 1.9 per cent. To more than compensate for that, we are increasing welfare payments, unemployment benefits and pensions by four per cent right at the start on 1 July 2000. That is a four per cent increase in advance. This is the very first time that pensions of any kind or payments of any kind have been increased in advance of any price rises and anybody of goodwill would agree that is a good thing to do. On the other side of it, people say that it will be higher than the 1.9 and they will be disadvantaged and will miss out. Again, this is wrong because we have had pensions on the CPI, as they have been traditionally. Of course, in many cases, this has meant that the pensions have not kept up with the reality of costs. We have changed the CPI basket to benefit pensioners and others. We have removed mortgages from the CPI basket because, let us face it, if you are on the age pension, the likelihood of your having a mortgage is most remote and the reality is that you either own your own home or you are renting and presumably receiving rent assistance as well. It was wrong to have that there, so we have changed the basket. More importantly, we have made it law that pensions will be increased on the basis of equalling 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings or the CPI, whichever is the higher. As far as the introduction of the new system is concerned, we have a safety net there and the Prime Minister and Mr Costello, the Treasurer, both spoke about this on Tuesday. I am very pleased that they did because it has been concerning me that you have these untruths about what is going to happen. We already have that safety net where, whatever the increase in the CPI or the costs, there will be a 1.5 per cent buffer above that every time. This happens twice a year in March and September. So, the reality is that the safety net is already there and people on welfare payments or support payments are well and truly covered. Even if it were to blowout beyond the wildest expectations, it would still rise and still be a buffer beyond that. I appeal to those on all sides to exercise moderation and to be fair. The opposition's focus on the GST is rather like Britain with its mad cow disease. They have got mad tax disease and it is affecting their judgment because they are consumed with a passionate aim to attack the government. That is the prerogative of the opposition, but I think Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4319 this parliament and this wonderful nation of ours would be better off if every member of this place exercised a little more moderation and a little more fairness. I raise a couple of items of significance to my electorate. One in particular is the closure of the Midco Abattoir in Macksville last year. Estimates vary, but there have probably been about 300 jobs lost. For a small community like the Nambucca Valley, which includes the towns of Nambucca Heads, Macksville and Bowraville, it is a very major blow to the local economy. The mid-North Coast, of which Cowper is part, has an unemployment rate of around 13 per cent, much higher than the national average. It is coming down. It has come down progressively since we have had a change of government. But it is still far too high and most people do not realise that, in Cowper and the whole of the North Coast of New South Wales, unemployment is a growth industry. Some people find that concept difficult to comprehend, but the reality is that we import unemployment. If you have to be unemployed, would you not rather be in Coffs Harbour with the beaches and the equable climate? After all, CSIRO describes my electorate as having the optimum climate for the human animal. So you have cheap fruit and vegetables, and a marvellous fish co-op where seafoods are quite inexpensive. The reality is that if you have to be on the dole you would rather be on the mid-North Coast than in Broken Hill or Griffith or Geelong. Anybody of a fair mind will agree with that. So we import a lot of unemployment. And that unemployment brings an enormous amount of money into the local economy and creates jobs-it really does-but people dotnot tend to associate with that. The other thing is that we focus on unemployment. If nationally we have got a seven per cent unemployment rate, that means we have a 93 per cent employment rate. While we always concentrate on unemployment figures, there is no announcement, no real consideration of the number of jobs that have been created. In my electorate, and indeed up and down the whole of the North Coast-even, I will say, as I practise what I preach, in the period of the Labor government-the growth in jobs in that area has been quite significant. We should be aware that unemployment is still an enormous problem. As far as the Nambucca Valley is concerned, following the closure of Midco, we desperately need some new industries, a new incentive, a shot in the arm which will enable that unemployment to be relieved. Such a loss of jobs can be disastrous for any community. I want to talk also about some constituents. I would be the first to agree that the HowardFischer government is doing an excellent job. We have got shortcomings; there are areas where we still need to do more. I would just like to highlight one of those, which is to do with somebody in an old persons home. I will read a little bit of a letter from Mrs Margaret Thain regarding her mother: My mother had lived on her own for twelve years after my father died only receiving the aged pension. She developed dementia and gradually got worse to the stage where we were advised she could no further live on her own. We arranged for support systems through welfare, which she refusedand that happens more often than people realise, that you get an older person, particularly with dementia, who does not want to accept helpso we had no other option but to bring her to live with us. After fifteen months we could not manage 4320 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 Those of us who have been listening to the earlier debate about carers are very much aware of the difficulties 'created, particularly for elderly carers of much more elderly parents. It is very difficult for them. Mrs Thain's letter continues: ... so arrangements were made to get her into the local aged hostel. Her house had deteriorated over the period since my father died and would have cost too much to fix it up to enable us to rent it so we had no option but to sell. Soon as her assets were declared her pension was stopped. After ten weeks of negotiating with Centrelink where we spoke with people in Tasmania, Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney and finally Coffs Harbour ... This is another of the things people do not realise: the service that is provided is the important thing, not where it is provided from, and this is spreading the employment around. Certainly in Coffs Harbour we have a very useful telecall centre for Centrelink, and I understand we are getting some more places there. The letter goes on: ... she was given a concession card and a thirty five dollar pension. My mother entered the hostel in October 1998 and because of her assets she was assessed to pay fifty thousand dollars bond and a fortnightly rent of four hundred & five dollars seventy three cents. What concerns us is the fact that the bond is assessed as assets and she is being deemed as earning 4.5% per year on the bond where in fact she is earning nothing. This effects the level of pension she is paid. The Thains believe that if that were not the case, she would receive a pension of $174.05, not $35. SoI just want to highlight, for the benefit of the government, that this is an area of anomaly that I believe we should do something about. I am concerned too about the reports of union disruption of the Work for the Dole program. This has been one of the most successful and popular initiatives of the Howard-Fischer government, and it has certainly been very effective in my electorate of Cowper. There was a report in the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday, 10 March that planning by training companies for a further four schemes had been abandoned because union objections were likely. Just in Cowper, projects threatened included a 12-month program for 240 people in the Coffs Harbour-Dorrigo area. I know everybody is not enthusiastic about work for the dole-that is fine-but in my area it is working very well. The young people who are involved in it are receiving very many benefits. I would also like to talk about the rural transaction centres, because, again, this is another significant initiative. I would like to have them in places like South West Rocks, Crescent Head, Bowraville and other areas of the Cowper electorate. We need to bring the services of government in a convenient, easy way to the people. The old word used to be 'decentralisation', and that is effectively what we are doing. I believe our government deserves a great deal of praise for this and I. am delighted. that we are getting Centrelink agencies and rural transaction centres so that the services of government are freely and equally available to all-not just for those with a public transport system as in the cities and not just to those with cars. Everybody in Australia has the right to be treated equally, and everybody has the right to expect equal access to the services of government. That way we can bring government closer to the people. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (12.16 p.m.)-I thank the honourable member for his advice to new members. I certainly hope that I am never able to be accused of viciousness iIi my criticism of government policies. One of the things that is frequently asked of new members is, 'How are you settling in?' One of the frustrations that I often describe to people is the fact that we sit on the opposition benches when decisions are made that we have heartfelt and Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4321 sincere objections to, and the strength and logic of our arguments and our convictions are not taken into account and, of course, we lose on the basis of the numbers. That is the nature of Australian democracy and it is something to be treasured and valuedhad some of them already. They are not frequently on the actual voting in the House though. I wanted to address my comments today to the issue of public accountability and government contracting. Outsourcing, or contracting out, is a growing trend in the provision of services in Australia, and I think that it raises a number of problems in terms of the efficient delivery of services and the contracted agencies' accountability to the people who are paying the billswho are, of course, the taxpayers of Australia. . I think that one of the dichotomies that is occasionally set up is. that increased efficiency will inevitably lead to decreased accountability. In fact, that is often welcomed because the argument is that with less accountability comes less red tape. It means that services can be delivered more quickly without the interference of the public servants who delivered. those services in the past. Unfortunately, I do not believe that there is, inevitably, increased efficiency with decreased accountability and I think that in many cases recently we have seen both the decrease in accountability and a decrease in efficiency. And, of course, the public are the big losers in such a scenario. The trend towards contracting out is driven by an underlying ideological belief that the private sector does everything better. According to this theory, markets are the best mechanism for allocating resources-the market will discipline the use of resources generating a leaner and usually meaner delivery of services. This is contrasted with public sector delivery which, as the theory goes, is subject to pressure from its work force-public servants. Public servants are thought to have more influence on the delivery of services than the clients of the agencies that they work for-according to this theory. What this theory misses out on are the benefits of coordination and the corporate knowledge that the public sector has. This model ignores the benefits of economies of scale. This theory ignores also all the evidence that we have seen of inefficiency in this method of service provision. We have got numerous examples from other states and from overseas that I will allude to later. Contracting out, rather than decreasing the need for accountability, actually.increases the need for accountability. In his 1990 article, 'The limits of privatisation,'Starr noted: the most common privatisation proposals, such as contracting out ... would hardly diminish the domain of special interests. He went on to say: ... preference for private provision actually reflects a deep underestimate of the skills that private firms can deploy. They underestimate the capacity of contractors to manipulate to their own advantage the incentives that are held out to them for better performance. And they underestimate the contractors' capacity to influence political decisions, either illegitimately through bribery or legally through campaign contributions and lobbying. Missing from the case for privatisation is a clear sense of the feedback effects-the influence on government of the enlarged class of private contractors and other providers dependent on public money.",180,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Nehl,But you will have wins,185,Representatives Main Committee
242,Ms Plibersek,"Let us hope so. I look forward to those wins and I believe that we have4322 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 With this ideological push for contracting out and privatisation across the board, it is fair for us to ask: who benefits? Is this just an opportunity to open up all sectors of the economy to the potential for profit making? I ask that because the people who are interested in making the profits are the natural constituency of the government that is driving the process. It is certainly true that contracting out weakens day-to-day accountability, a characteristic of the Public Service. While the minister retains overall responsibility for the provision of services, the process of contracting out places a definite break in the chain of command. You quite often have the contracting department pointing the finger at the service provider and the service provider saying, 'It's not our fault, the conttactor wasn't specific enough.' Richard Mulgan, in an article called 'Contracting out and accountability,' says: Responsibility for service provision is placed in the hands of people who are not under the day-to-day control of department managers and are not subject to open-ended direction from ministers or their officials. Contractors are accountable to public officials for the performance of the terms of the contract but not for many of the acts of discretion which are not covered by the contract. Accountability is therefore limited in terms of the contract. The issue of the writing of the contracts is very important because there are some services for which it is impossible to write detailed contracts. It may well· be possible to write detailed specifications for the type of road a government wants built, or some major infrastructure project, although there are some arguments that it is not particularly easy to do that either. However, that is much easier to write detailed specifications for than, for example, the delivery of Meals on··Wheelsservices, as has happened in Victoria. The Meals on Wheels deliverers in Victoria used to take it upon themselves to check that people were well, to make sure that they had some social contact, to run occasional errands, to act as a point of contact with the broader community, and to be a friend. When these services were contracted out the evidence has been that the contracting agency deliverer has turned up, dumped the meal on the doorstep and left. If there was a week of meals piled up on the doorstep then they have not taken it upon themselves to knock on the door and make sure someone is not lying with a broken hip in the bathroom. That is because it is not written into the contract that they should actually care for the people to whom they are delivering as e r v i c e . "" There are many implications for the contracting out of government services. There has been quite a dramatic increase in the level of public concern because of a number of problems that have been highlighted recently. There have been problems to do with efficiency. I think the recent news report of the person contracted to the Department of Finance and Administration who ended up siphoning $8.75 million into his private bank account is a very good example of where government is making a small saving in contracting out services but, if the people who are employed to undertake the service do not perform that service properly and engage in criminal activity-and there is certainly no guarantee that they will not-there is a dramatic cost to taxpayers. Someone who is contracted to provide a service over a short period of time has no investment in not behaving in this way. They do not have a 40-year career to think about; they have no corporate loyalty to prevent them behaving in this way. Just briefly, I will speak about decreased efficiency and decreased services in more d-tail in a minute. There is also a real potential for contracting of government services to have a role in the development of Australian industry, in the development of small and medium . REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4323 enterprises, or to ignore that role because the companies that most easily undertake this sort of work are quite often large companies and in many cases they are overseas companies. Contracting out also has the potential to dramatically decrease the work conditions of people undertaking particular work. It is imperative for government to say that, even though these people are subcontractors of the government and not directly employed by the government, they have minimum standards of employment. These people should be employed under award conditions and under award wages. We have heard many examples where cleaning services, for example, have been contracted out to subcontractors who do not pay award wages and who do not have employees operating under award conditions. It is vital for us to make sure that does not happen. The community is legitimately entitled to properly scrutinise the way that public money is spent. It is a fundamental tenet of our democracy. We have had numerous examples recently where the protection of commercial-in-confidence has been used to protect proper scrutiny of the way services paid for by taxpayers have been delivered. I wanted to briefly go through some examples of where that commercial-in-confidence provision has been used to prevent the release of information that would perhaps be detrimental to the government but which Australians should expect to be able to access. The Victorian government is certainly guilty of using commercial-in-confidence provisions in a number of very serious cases, including the death of 11 people in privately run prisons in 1997, where government was saying that the day-to-day running of the prisons, including security arrangements, was commercial-in-confidence and could not be released to the pUblic. In a very serious instance like that where lives have been lost, for the government to say, 'We are not responsible because we have contracted out the delivery of these services,' is a shocking abrogation of responsibility. The other more recent example that we have heard a lot about federally is the tendering process conducted with the establishment of the Job Network. Example after example of decisions appeared, on the surface, to be questionable at best and irresponsible under some interpretations. I will just go through some of those. One of them received a lot of coverage at the time. Mr Khader Roude, a man without an office, without a telephone, without staff and without experience in working with the long-term unemployed, was awarded a $1 million contract in south-west Sydney, the region with the highest unemployment in the greater Sydney metropolitan area. This gentleman won that contract, despite having no previous experience, on the basis that he put in the lowest tender price for the delivery of these services. It is very questionable that the people whom he was supposed to help and who should have been able to expect help from him would indeed receive any of the services that he was contracted to provide. The other example is W orkSkill Inc. in Adelaide. The organisation won a $10 million contract even though, at the time tenders closed, it was in deep financial trouble. Unable to pay its employees' wages or other entitlements such as superannuation, they Were running a controversial fundraising lottery with a BMW as a first prize in an attempt to stave off their financial problems. The lottery was eventually cancelled and the ticket purchasers were reimbursed because the company could not afford to buy its BMW. This company won a $10 million contract. There was a $15 million Jobsearch contract to a Sydney company called Hospitality Horizons. This company had previously been banned by the department from working in this 4324 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 area for two years because it was found to be repeatedly offering inadequate training on the New South Wales North Coast area. The company owns a 51-site contract but has now offloaded its work to other contractors. These cases are indicative of problems that can arise in a process where services are delivered at arm's length from government. There is another example that I wanted to discuss briefly which is the Glenorchy SkillShare which further illustrates the problems of scrutiny in relation to the awarding of these contracts. Glenorchy SkillShare was actually an organisation which had a great deal of experience with the long-term unemployed. It was chosen to pioneer case management for the long-term unemployed in 1994. It failed in its bid to get Job Network tender Flex3 contracts which were for intensive assistance for the long term unemployed. Those contracts were price fixed. Price was not the reason that the bid was rejected. Unfortunately, Glenorchy SkillShare cannot find out the reason that their bid was rejected. Freedom of information applications were filed. They were told that the information was commercial-in-confidence. At the initial debriefing session after they found out that they had not won the contract, the only information they were given was that the decision making was commercial-in-confidence and they would not be told why they were unsuccessful. They were refused access to the assessment instruments. They were refused access to assessment details even for their own bid. Although· there were a number of contracts given to organisations that were, on the face of it, perhaps not incredibly well suited to the delivery of these services, organisations that on the surface appeared to be extremely well suited, when they were unsuccessful in their tenders, were not given information about why. The other aspect of contracting out that I briefly wanted to mention was the development of local industries and competitiveness. The government's role as a purchaser of goods and services cannot be underestimated. Indeed, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is at the moment undertaking an inquiry into this matter. One of the issues that has been raised in the past in relation to government contracting is the expense of putting in a bid in this competitive environment. The cost of putting in a bid can quite often be $5,000 or more depending on how much technical work has to be done on the bid. This, of course, discriminates against small and medium enterprises and it advantages large companies which are used to putting in bids for the delivery of government services. One of the big concerns about this is that there are a number of companies that operate internationally in this area, most of them got their start in the United States, which for some time has been contracting out the provision of welfare services, and in some states this has had very dramatic effects on people accessing those services. Because global budgets are given to companies to deliver a particular benefit-for example, pensions-as well as the money they are paid to administer the service, if they manage to return a surplus then they get to keep the extra money. That is quite often written into the contracts in this area. And the only way, of course, to t4rn a profit in the delivery of welfare services is to make sure that the people who should be getting the services are not getting them. Access to information in this area is unfortunately not covered by freedom of information legislation. There is some suggestion that documents that are held by subcontractors should be treated as documents held by the government department where they relate to the direct provision of that service. I think that we very much need to examine how the public can continue to scrutinise the delivery of these services, which taxpayers continue to pay for, in the spirit of representative democracy and openness. (Time expired) Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4325 a couple of matters in debate on the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1998-99, a bill on which a wide ranging debate can occur where members can usually talk about things that concern them. One of the things that I have had considerable concern about in recent months is the way the government is winding back the facilities for and entitlements of new migrants to Australia. As we see a tightening up of the whole of the social security system, a tightening up of the whole of the employment provision system and a tightening up of all the government service delivery, I find the group of people in my electorate who are missing out all the time are new migrants. With people who come to Australia, many now, because of the government's crackdown on family migration, find that they have good qualifications in their own homeland but take time to get a job here. They find that they do not get access to any of the social security benefits that they might have had in the past. They find that they do not get access to any of the employment benefits that they might have in the past. They are also finding that what is happening across the board is a lot of interrelationship between Commonwealth benefits and state benefits, the Commonwealth benefits being the gateway to other benefits provided by state governments. So someone who does not have a health care card, for instance, does not get the transport concessions that state governments provide and does not get the electricity rebates that state governments provide to people who have been here a bit longer and are in the same circumstance. While there are good and cogent reasons for saying that people should not come to Australia to become dependent on benefits, and while there are good reasons for wanting people to stand on their own two feet, if we have a selection system that says we will select people who we believe will be able to get a job here, then if they cannot get a job here I do not see why they should be treated any differently from other Australians who cannot get a job. I have had the experience of people coming into my office who have good engineering degrees from universities outside Australia, but because there are surplus engineers in Australia at present they are finding themselves on the end of the list. They ,will keep getting an interview because their CV is good. But they find-and it might be because their command of English is not as good as some other candidates' and the employer thinks that they might not be able to impart instructions as well, or for various reasons-they are not getting up to the stage of getting a job. When they do not get the government assistance that someone else does, it creates a very bad feeling among people. I think it creates a very bad record for Australia if we are saying to people, 'We think we have got a system that fairly assesses immigrants, but, once you get here, we are not going to consider you to be the same as others.' The thing that disturbs me about the Prime Minister's suggested preamble to the Constitution is that it does that. The Prime Minister might not be aware-he should be, but he might not be aware-that a great number of people in this country are permanent residents and are not citizens. His preamble talks about 'sovereignty of all its citizens'. If people have come to Australia and have not taken out citizenship, I do not know whether it makes them second-rate people in this country. The Prime Minister is one of the great empire royalists. We all know that the largest number of people who have come here and remained permanent residents and have not taken out citizenship are not Greeks, Italians or Lebanese. They are not people from Africa or from the North Pole. They are people from Britain. The English are the ones who do not become Australian citizens. Far be it from me to ever come to the assistance of the English with all",185,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson) (12.36 P.m.),"I would like to take the opportunity to address4326 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 of my family's history of being from Ireland. But these people have got a vote. There are a large number of people on the electoral roll from Britain and Ireland, who came here before the Electoral Act was changed. They get a vote but, according to the Prime Minister, they are not part of the deal. I suppose there are a whole lot of problems with the Prime Minister's proposed preamble. A person said to me this morning that, if you went through the Prime Minister's preamble and looked at what it really said, it could be paraphrased to say, 'I love a sunburnt country, a place that is really great, where migrants, Aboriginals and sheilas are your mate,' because that is about all it says. \ people who stood up in the party room and applauded him when he came in and brought you this poem of stupidity. The poet whom he paid to be in it with him has been madly saying, over the airwaves in Sydney today, 'No, no; to all those things, I said, ""Don't be in it; don't do it, lohn; don't do it'''. But the coalition party room, because they are being led like sheep to the slaughter, all agreed with this. Ms Plibersek-It's not grammatical. Ms Plibersek-It doesn't rhyme. they ought to understand is that this is not about a song and it is not about a melody. He said: This is a Constitution, not a song or a poem. Does the Cabinet know the difference? Apparently not. A preamble must deliver constitutional direction. And he want on to say: Mateship is not relevant any more than our deep attachments to fatherhood, motherhood, Aussie Rules or sun-worshipping. Its male bias is manifest. Some of my colleagues in the Labor Party would say, of course, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you and I from New South Wales and the group of people that we are associated with have a copyright on this phrase. I have to say that the Prime Minister did not ask us whether he could use the phrase. If he had asked us, we would have told him certainly no, because we would not want to have anything to do with him. But the important thing is that I do not think the Prime Minister even read the dictionary when he thought this up. I am sure that, if the Prime Minister was looking up the dictionary, he would look up the Concise Oxford Dictionary but, maybe, now that he is disenfranchising the English, he might not even read the Concise O;iford Dictionary. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines a mate as 'a companion', 'a fellow worker', 'one of a pair', 'a partner in marriage', 'an officer on a ship', 'an assistant to a worker'. On the radio the Prime Minister said he thought the spirit of mateship was something to do with the ANZAC spirit. There are certainly a whole lot more inclusive, uplifting ways we can talk about that than by this rather poor proposal that we had floated yesterday. It is a sad day for Australia when the Prime Minister says that he is going to sit down and pen a preamble to the Constitution but the majority of the country then think that that preamble is a joke. All we have had on the radio now is people making jokes about this. I just do not think that sets a good tone for our country. It certainly makes us look a bit silly.",189,Representatives Main Committee

247,Mr Leo Mcleay,"And it does not rhyme. Paul Kelly, in the Australian, said that whatWednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4327 I was the alternate for the Leader of the Opposition at the Constitutional Convention and I sat through most of the convention. I will not go into all the eUlogies that the former member for New England went on with at the Constitutional Convention but I did think that more members of this parliament should have had the opportunity to go there and see it. Most Australians watched it on the television. I found it amazing that there were so many people watching the convention when it was broadcast on the ABC. The people who went to that convention went there with good hearts. There was only one person who went there as a spoiler and a disrupter, and unfortunately he was a former leader of my party. But the rest of them, even the monarchists and the 'elect the president' people, actually all went there with a good heart to try to get something done, to try to get some change. But there was disagreement and disputation. The only issue there that I recall as actually passing on acclamation, the only issue about which everyone agreed-or, even to put it as a negative, no-one disagreed-was the call by the Constitutional Convention to include in the preamble some elements about the concept of the custodianship of this country by the Aboriginal people. Instead, what do we get in this mean-spirited document? We get some wishy-washy statement that the Aboriginal people have been here from time immemorial. They tell you that is a joke. They have been here for a lot longer than the rest of us, but from 'time immemorial'? That is a ludicrous proposition, as even they will say to you. We hear from the Prime Minister's apologists-round the back door'Really, I wanted to put in something about stewardship but the cabinet would not let me.' If this really low-life proposal that we have got before us about what a preamble ought to be has started out as a second-rate piece of prose written by the Prime Minister and then been emasculated completely by the cabinet, it really makes us look silly in our own country. Further, I am sure that this sort of thing is going to get picked up by the international press and we are going to look like a bunch of hicks. That did not have to happen. If the Prime Minister had not had this attack of hubris himself, in that he was going to be the only person who could write a preamble to the Constitution, and if he had been inclusive and listened to other points of view, then we might have had something that we could all be proud of. But what we have here is something which will cause, in the end, even those spineless people who applauded it in the government party room to go back to their electorates this weekend and just be made a joke of. It makes a joke of all of us that someone is able to say to you that: 'I love a sunburnt country, a place that's really great, where migrants, Aboriginals and sheilas are your mate,' paraphrases what is proposed to be in the preamble to our Constitution. And you think, 'No, that is not really right. It is pretty bad but it is not really right.' Then when you go and read it, the reality is that that paraphrasing is what he said. That is just not good enough. It is a wonder he did not come up with the idea of kangaroos, meat pies, football and Holden cars. It is in about the same vein. I think it is a shame that we do not have something better to talk about than this preamble. The Constitutional Convention talked about a new preamble for what they believed was going to be a new Constitution, the republican constitution. What we have got here is the Prime Minister coming up with a second-rate preamble for our current Constitution. Why do we need to redefine what our current Constitution is, particularly if are going to redefine it and put small print along the bottom-which this does-which says, 'By the way, this means nothing'? No court in the land can take it into account when interpreting this 4328 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 Constitution. No international body can take it into account when interpreting this Constitution. This is nothing because that is what it is doing. It is going to have no force in law anywhere and it is just a bit of bad prose. The people who actually framed the original Constitution would have come up with something better. It would certainly not be hard to come up with something better than this. It really is hypocrisy, I think, for the Prime Minister to say, 'We are going to have a referendum in November that the government is going to spend a lot of money on.' He is going to support the anti-republican cause which would trigger a new Constitution. He is going to go out there to campaign to vote down the new Constitution, but at the same time ask people to vote for his new preamble. We are going to have the greatest piece of nonconstitutional reform of all time. We are going to have no significant reform about whether we change the way our country is, but we are going to have a preamble that the co-author was busy running away from this morning. The co-author does not want to have anything to do with this. He said he told him that mates hip was a bad idea. He said that he told him putting in 'island nation' would make the Tasmanians upset-but it could be said that the continental shelf really covers Tasmania. As for Aboriginal custodians, there was something about stewardship in there, but the cabinet took that out, he said. Basically, I reckon that if the poet had been paid for it, he should have sent the money back because you would not actually want to have your name in any way, shape or form attached to this tawdry piece of prose that is not even good English. A lot of women see 'mate' as a male word. You do not find many women calling each other mate. The Oxford dictionary talks about it as a work related term that grew out of the days when most of the people who were in employment in the work force were men. There is the plumber's mate, for example. As you would know as a former tradesman, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, the plumber's mate term came up at a time when neither of us would have ever have seen a woman plumber out there. Plumber's mates were always blokes. This is a very blokey term. I do not know why he did not say 'cobbers', or something like that. Cobbers at least has a bit of an old-fashioned ring which he might have liked. I think the money that the government spent on having this little document produced has been wasted. It has been a waste of effort. For our country to have put forward a shambling preamble like this is really something. After all the hype from the Prime Minister telling us about how he was going to sit down at the desk and write something good, he just has not. One of the things that we all should be big enough to do if we have made a mistake, or if we have not quite got it the way we think we should, is admit that it might be time to start again. It might be time to do what the Constitutional Convention did, which was to get people of goodwill together, to see if they can come up with a preamble to the Constitution for the year 2000. Some of the people doing that should be the people who will be the leaders of our country in the next millennium. To have the preamble to the Constitution written by an older man-I am 53-years-old and I feel old, sometimes-is not good enough. Why don't we involve some of the young people of Australia? One of the things that was most terrific about the Constitutional Convention was the performance of the young delegates. They did not have any of the cynicism that there is in this building and they demonstrated that they genuinely wanted to do something for their country. Why, for goodness sake, can't we have them involved? Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4329 I hope the Prime Minister might think again and decide to do something like that. The preamble is one of the big issues for us as a nation. That the Prime Minister should come up with something third rate is a shame. (Time expired) Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (12.56 p.m.)-I rise in this wide ranging cognate debate on the Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1998-99, the Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1998-99, and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1998-99, to pay tribute to a Labor hero, John Brumby, who from June 1993 until Monday last served as leader of the Victorian state Labor opposition. Let me make it clear at the outset that this is not an ode to a fallen political soldier because I am confident that John Brumby is at no more than the midpoint in what will continue to be a long and distinguished political career. However, at this midpoint it seems fitting to note on the record John Brumby's achievements as Victorian opposition leader and to place those achievements in their proper context. Let me paint this context first. Recent newspaper reports, which have been almost exclusively and somewhat breathlessly devoted to matters properly internal to the Victorian branch of the Labor Party, have ignored the wider context of the shabby state of democracy in Victoria under the Kennett government. In Victoria we have a government that has systematically and ruthlessly swept away democratic norms in its quest to exercise power. A quick look at the functioning of the Victorian parliament demonstrates starkly the truth of this claim. The Victorian parliament sat yesterday for the first time in 130 days. Parliamentary sittings have been cancelled because of the federal election campaign, and more recently for the unbelievably spurious reason that the royal commission into the Longford gas disaster was in progress. In 1998 the Victorian parliament sat for a mere 42 days in the course of the calendar year, the lowest number ever in the history of the Victorian parliament in a nonelection year. it was an election year, sat 54 days. In 1997 the Victorian parliament managed to sit 43 days, just one more than the record low. Compare this with the fact that this House sat 76 days in that year. By the end of June this year this House will have sat 37 days. The Victorian parliament, provided that the Premier does not take it into his head to cancel any further parliamentary sittings, will sit a mere 18 days in the same period. In these circumstances it is no wonder that an opposition that is striving to put under scrutiny government actions and government arrogance, as it is in Victoria, can struggle to find a parliamentary opportunity to do so. Indeed, the failure to sit by the Victorian parliament can only be explained as a deliberate strategy by the government to avoid opposition questioning and the media focus that necessarily comes when parliament is in session. Even when parliament is sitting the Kennett government does all that it can to avoid any opposition questioning. The Victorian parliament sits for three-day weeks with question time limited to 45 minutes on Tuesdays and a half an hour on the other two days. There is no requirement for a minimum number of questions, which thereby invites ministers to talk question time out with long and irrelevant answers. In 1997, this House dealt with 1,482 questions without notice. The Tasmanian House of Assembly dealt with 1,017, the South Australian House of Assembly with 935, the Western",190,Representatives Main Committee

In comparison, this House, even though4330 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 Australian Legislative Assembly with 875, the Queensland Legislative Assembly with 561, and the New South Wales Legislative Assembly with 420. In contrast, the Victorian Legislative Assembly dealt with 331 questions, less than a quarter of the number processed in this place. The problem with allowing democratic debate does not stop there. While in this House in 1997, 10 private members bills were debated over 84V:z hours, in Victoria not one such bill was debated. The opposition in Victoria is limited to one matter of public importance debate per week and occasional grievance debates, compared with the weekly grievance debate and three MPIs per week in this place. These grave problems are compounded by the fact that the Victorian upper house is not elected under a proportional representation system, and has been relegated to no more than a rubber stamp for government. Indeed, Victoria is the only state which functions without the checks of either a PR elected upper house or a criminal justice commission. Simple mathematics tells you that the method of election for the Victorian upper house is a travesty. Despite polling 46.04 per cent of the two-party preferred vote in the upper house at the last election, the Labor Party holds only 10 of the 44 seats available in that house. There seems little doubt that, if Victoria had a history of proportional representation in its upper house, rather than an arrogant government unchecked by parliament, we would have an upper house in which Labor, Democrats, Greens and Independents could wield sufficient power to force real review and scrutiny. To the extent that parliamentary processes offered a potential for scrutiny of Kennett government excesses, lapses of standards, waste and mismanagement, the Premier has set about systematically destroying that potential. Witness, for example, the gutting of the Office of the Auditor-General in Victoria, where we now have the only Auditor-General in Australia who does not have the power to undertake audits. The then Auditor-General, Mr Ches Baragwanath, described the government's plans, which were subsequently implemented, in the following terms: In my eight years of reporting in the public interests without fear or favour, I view this government action as representing the greatest threat to the independence and even the very existence of my role, and to the Parliament's and the community's right to know. In Victoria, it is clear that the parliament and the community have no such right to know. The list of vital statutory office bearers and the like sacked or attacked by the Kennett government does not begin and end with the Auditor-General. Remember these Kennett government democracy wrecking highlights: the Equal Opportunity Commissioner sacked; the Equal Opportunity Commission threatened, after a decision the government viewed as unfavourable, and then subjected to a punitive round of legislative amendments; the Director of Public Prosecutions, Bernie Bongiorno, hounded from office; the Children's Court magistrate hounded from office; the Victorian Law Reform Commission destroyed; the Accident Compensation Tribunal judges sacked; tenancy groups terminated; and the Land Conservation Council abolished. This is in a setting where we have experienced the decimation of the Freedom of Information Act, now better known as the freedom from information act, which has been amended time and time again by the Kennett government to make it almost impossible to get government information in the public domain. We have also seen the legal right to appeal to the Supreme Court removed in almost 200 pieces of legislation, and the judiciary subjected to constant attack. Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4331 As devastating as this list is, it shows only the highlights and only part of the story. As we all know, parliament, the judiciary and statutory office bearers are not the sole custodians of democracy, the sole sources of scrutiny or accountability of government. The media and community groups also playa vital role in the working of our democracy but, once again, even the most casual appraisal of the situation in Victoria shows that the Kennett government has systematically silenced and stifled these potential critics. With the media, Jeff Kennett has blatantly played favourites, barring access to those from the media who asked questions he found too hard. Jeff Kennett's personal hatred of the ABC state based 7.30 Report meant neither he nor his ministers would appear on it. The Premier accused the national broadcaster of 'slime and bias'. In March 1996 the Premier said of the ABC, 'IfI had my way I would close it down.' It is no secret in Victoria that Jeff Kennett campaigned for the removal of Bruce Guthrie as editor of the Age. From these actions, from his frequent defamation claims-which, of course, have turned up substantial dollars for the Premier until his recent misadventure-the message to the media was clear: stay in the information loop and play his game or perish on the outside. Even with the most robust media, how are difficult issues to get proper exposure when the government has gone on a deliberate campaign to silence knowledgeable information sources? Teachers in Victoria are banned by law from speaking out, community organisations which receive government funding have to sign contracts requiring public silence, and church and other community critics have been abusedin the most savage and public ways. Against the community silence enforced by the Premier through abuse and punitive measures, Victorians are subject to a barrage of government funded, taxpayer funded propaganda designed to feed the Premier's cult of personality and push his simple sloganeering answers to the real problems facing Victoria. In a state like this, in a state in which long cherished democratic norms have been swept aside and community participation and debate has been silenced, it is the toughest job of all to be leader of the opposition. Whilst my greatest goodwill and sincere best wishes go to Steve Bracks and to his wife, Terry, and their children-and I am confident that he will ably hold and fill the office of leader of the opposition-as I said at the outset, I intend today to note the achievements of John Brumby in that position. Let me say that I am not a disinterested observer. From May 1996 until the commencement of the 1998 federal election campaign, I was proud to work as John Brumby's chief of staff. I did not know John Brumby well when I commenced that position but would now count him as a very dear friend. There were three very significant things about my appointment by John Brumby as his chief of staff. First, it gave me the opportunity of a lifetime to work in a political office in a senior role, and I will always be grateful for that. Second, despite the fact that much has been made in recent days in the media of the factionalism of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party, the decision to appoint me as his chief of staff proves John Brumby was not one who looked to factional considerations in making decisions. Third, my appointment at a time when female chiefs of staff were most certainly not the norm in Australian politics shows that John Brumby had then, as he has demonstrated clearly since, a passionate personal commitment to merit and to gender equality. In working with John, I found him to be the most tenacious and focused of politicians, with an unbelievable capacity for hard and consistent work. He has a quick mind, an amazing ability to master a brief and recall facts and figures, and an intuitive grasp of complex questions of 4332 MAIN COMMI1TEE Wednesday, 24 March 1999 strategy and policy. His commitment to Labor ideals and his captivating enthusiasm for education policy, in particular, inspired those around him. In hearing him speak, you always knew that from his days as a teacher at Eaglehawk High School he was driven by the need to ensure every kid had the benefit of the best possible education and the best possible start in life. It is therefore no surprise that during his seven years as the federal member for Bendigo he served as chairman of the parliamentary employment, education and training committee. With hard work and determination, John Brumby achieved some important milestones in his time as state opposition leader. These included pushing through tough new policies on financial management so Victorians can rest assured that a future Labor government will not spend money it has not got; leading the affirmative action debate in the Australian Labor Party and ensuring that Victoria was the first state to get an affirmative action rule and has now conducted its preselections s.o that a record breaking number of women are candidates in winnable seats for the imminent state election; restoring the ALP's finances, with a $2 million deficit at the commencement of his leadership being turned around so that the party now has available to it a substantial war chest to fight the imminent election campaign; managing a complete overhaul of the party's policies, with a new platform as the product of that overhaul adopted at the recent Victorian state conference; and achieving a degree of change and renewal in the shadow cabinet team which outstrips that achieved by any other parliamentary party in Australia. He achieved further milestones in winning each by-election contested by the Labor Party under his leadership and ushering into parliament important new political players, including Steve Bracks, the now leader; Rob Hulls, the man who is systematically exposing the Kennett government's appalling lack of probity; Monica Gould, the first woman ever to be elected to a leadership post in Victoria's upper house; Mary Delahunty, Labor's education spokesperson; Tony Robinson; and Carlo Carli. These by-election victories included the victory in Mitcham-a by-election occasioned when a Kennett government member resigned in disgust over the proposed changes to the Auditor General situation, which I referred to earlier-when a swing of 15.8 per cent came to. the Labor Party. That was, of course, the largest ever by-election swing in Victorian political history, certainly a major achievement for John Brumby as Labor leader-and I well remember his able leadership of that by-election campaign. Also among his list of achievements is the development of a comprehensive reform agenda to rehabilitate Victoria's democracy, as detailed in his booklet Restoring democracy: proposals for a new Victorian constitution. In valuing the worth of these achievements, we must be clear about the circumstances that confronted John Brumby when he took the Labor leadership in 1993. John Brumby had the courage to take the Labor leadership just four months after being elected to the Victorian upper house. Indeed, for several months he served as Labor leader even though he did not hold a lower house seat. This occurred because of a spiteful by-election delay engineered by Jeff Kennett to make it as difficult as possible for him to make the transition from the upper house to the lower house and be able to act fully as Labor leader. John Brumby was forced to take the leadership at such an early time and in such difficult circumstances because Jim Kennan, having agitated for the Labor leadership, found the job too tough and resigned. At this point, the Labor Party's stocks and morale were at an all-time low, it having sustained a very large swing against it and a very difficult defeat in 1992, and with the last leader having just given up the challenge of leading the Labor Party. Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4333 In such difficult circumstances a lesser man may well have shirked the challenge, but not John Brumby. And for that courage, for having the guts, for the hard work that followed, for achieving so much in such difficult circumstances, the Labor Party owes John Brumby an enormous debt and the recognition properly accorded to true Labor heroes. At every stage, from his election as Labor leader to his recent resignation, John Brumby put the Labor Party first, rather than his own self-interest. In doing so, he has set a fine example for us all. In particular, he has set a fine example for members of the Victorian branch of the ALP who now face the task of supporting Steve Bracks and the Victorian parliamentary Labor team in the forthcoming state election. Let me say that, having been with John Brumby for more than two years-he was there as Labor leader for six years; I shared in only 2Y2 of those-in the most difficult of circumstances, it was always a pleasure to work with him; He is a man of almost unbelievable good humour and complete unflappability in times of great stresses and strains. For all the moments of difficulty, there were some moments of great laughter and great enjoyment, and I was certainly very pleased and proud to work with him throughout that period. As is always the case in politics, perhaps the largest burden is not borne by the participants themselves but by their families. John has a wonderful wife in Rosemary, who has supported him fully throughout his political career, including moving from Bendigo to Melbourne as he made the transition from federal to state politics, and including being the primary care-giver for their three children who were very young when John accepted the challenge to lead the Victorian branch of the Labor Party and the Victorian parliamentary party in such difficult circumstances. I wish to conclude by wishing not only John but Rosemary and their children, Georgia, Lizzie and Nick, the best for the future. I am sure that the kids are going to be very glad to have their dad back home for longer hours than he has probably been able to be home for the last six years. I look forward over the course of the coming months and years to sharing our continued friendship. I am very confident, too, of some very good times to come. am pleased to bring the debate on the additional estimates, the appropriation bills, to a conclusion. I note that there have been a number of contributions on these bills; in fact, I understand some 57 speakers have participated in this debate which indicates quite dearly that the parliament, broadly speaking, pays considerable attention to matters of management by government; particularly of the economy. The debate itself was wide ranging and I think that was probably exemplified by the most recent contribution from members opposite, that of the honourable member for Lalor, Ms Gillard. has played in her former life and events which have taken place in Victoria. I think perhaps one could say that there is a degree of lament in that process. That tends to happen from time to time in politics, as all of us who have been there for some time would acknowledge. Contributions have ranged over what the government has failed to do and what the government has failed to provide for in the additional estimates. I think it is fair to say that all members would like to see many problems in the Australian community addressed by virtue of the appropriation of funds.

That, of course, has been spoken of on numerous occasions by the Treasurer, who deserves great credit for the manner in which this economy has turned around. It has occurred simply because the government, to a man and a woman, have recognised the need for fiscal responsibility. It is not a case of simply saying, 'Let's spend money here, there or anywhere,' but a case of ensuring that it is prioritised correctly, that where the spending does occur that happens within the capacity of government to spend and that constantly the bottom line is the objective that government sets out to achieve. The bottom line that this government has achieved has brought about this recovery in no uncertain terms. We set out to achieve a balanced budget within that first term. We achieved that objective one year ahead of schedule. In the course of doing that, we have in fact started down that road of reducing the debt, the Commonwealth general government debt, that has accumulated over a series of deficit budgets, particularly in the last five years of Labor. We also set about to get other factors in the economy that benefit the men and women of Australia into line. Throughout that process we have seen a number of factors which have flowed through and which have done much to stimulate the growth that we have experienced. We have seen some six official reductions in interest rates in that first period of the Howard government-a vote of confidence from the Australian financial markets which benefits every Australian family. We have seen inflation reduce significantly, which gives some degree of certainty to all men and women in Australia-knowing that it is not a case of wages chasing prices as we saw under Labor in those peaks and troughs that were so predominant throughout their 13 years in government. The bottom line that I think is most pleasing to all on the government side is that growth has continued to occur. The national accounts showed a 4.7 per cent growth in the economy through the year to December-an outstanding result that again is the envy of all other OECD nations and, in fact, every nation in the world. It is not just a case of those national accounts, though. There are other indicators that come through from outside government. The February· Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment showed that consumer sentiment was at its highest level since September 1994, with an expectation among consumers that economic conditions will improve over the coming year. Is it any wonder that commentators who are recognised and respected throughout the world continue to look at Australia and speak of it in glowing terms, such as 'the miracle economy', based on its geographical location and what can only be described as an expected fallout from the events of Asia. We have certainly not escaped the impact of that fallout in Asia, but at the same time we have been able to go through this period in the best possible way simply because the government that came into power in 1996 in this country were prepared to take the hard decisions and live within their means. Another indicator, the Yellow Pages Small Business Index for the quarter ended February, indicated a significant degree of optimism in the small business sector. That is something which we are extremely proud of as a government as well. That is the area which is the future for Australia; it is the area that Australians have always looked to to provide the employment opportunities and the growth that benefits every community. Big business may benefit certain communities in the jobs that it provides; the small businesses that back it up spread Wednesday, 24 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4335 throughout the towns and suburbs of all the states and territories of this country and are so important for those communities. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading and coincident indexes both suggested that the economy is likely to stay strong for the short term. And, perhaps the most important of all, the Reserve Bank noted in their most recent quarterly report on the Australian economy that: ... the economy has been stronger than expected ... and appears to have entered 1999 with considerable momentum. Another quote: Recent employment growth has been consistent with general economic developments ... forward looking indicators ... suggest that labour demand remains robust. Finally: Inflation remains lower than forecast ... Those factors indicate that the economy is sound. It is moving along in a way which, in the current circumstances of the world economy, Australia should be rightly proud of. That does not mean, of course, that we can rest on our laurels. It does mean that we must continue to ensure, as the forward estimate shows, that we remain in balance, that we remain in surplus. That is what is forecast in the additional estimates and that is what this government will continue to work towards. It means that we must continue to ensure that we spend within our means and that we prioritise in a way which benefits the Australian community in the best possible way. I think it is fair to say that the documents that are being debated, the additional estimates appropriation bills, are testimony once again to the fiscal management and the strategy of this government in bringing about that outcome. I again thank all honourable members for their contribution. I am pleased to say that there is a confidence in the Australian community that I have never seen or experienced in my adult life. I am proud to be part of a government that has made such a significant contribution to that outcome and I commend the bills to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.
