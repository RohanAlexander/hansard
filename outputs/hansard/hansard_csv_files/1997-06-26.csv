It is interesting to note the Fraser government. I remind people, for that we do not have a uniform situation across example, of what it is like to work on a all jurisdictions on this issue. It leads to a counter in Social Security, particularly during number of broader points, which I will make the time when I had a bit of experience of it in a minute, about the problem that Australia under the Fraser government in the late has with respect to its overall workers com1970s.

Amendment Legislation Bill 1997. In my closing remarks yesterday, before the adjournment of the Main Committee, I spoke of the fine work of the Forum Fisheries Agency based in Honiara. In discussions with my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Andrew Thomson), it was interesting to hear him talk about an excursion in the second week of June, when he attended the Multilateral Conference on Highly Migratory Species held at Majura in the Marshall Islands. What was impressive with this-as we start to look at the security and long-term viability of our fish stocks and avoiding their over-exploitation--is that the conference was able to negotiate an arrangement for the management of the stocks of tuna over the next three years by means of a declaration for the preservation of the species. Included in that declaration was the preservation and stock assessment of billfish. The species of tuna which they are addressing are the albacore, big-eye and yellowfin tuna, and it is important that all people work together on this resource security. The unfortunate thing about fish stocks is that they cannot be measured like the cattle in a yard or the sheep in a paddock can be, because it is not known where the fish are at any particular time or how many there are in any specified area. We seem to know the levels only after the fact, once fish stocks are down. Australia has a great opportunity at the moment, and that opportunity is the continuing exportation of fish to offshore markets. In my electorate, a new company is developing markets for the exportation of fish, particularly the finer fishes, to overseas markets. Black Funnel Fisheries at Salamander Bay has been set up by a young chap, Mr Morgan, who is investing all that he has. One of his problems, as I discovered when we sat down and discussed exports, is that he is concerned about the long-term security of being able to obtain fish stocks. Setting up an export facility is not something that is cheap to do, and breaking into offshore markets is not something that is easily managed. But the one thing that can destroy the credibility and long-term viability of any exporter is a lack of fish resources. I urge all parties to come to the front and look to the long-term future of fisheries in Australia, and to consider the report that was tabled last week and map out and plan for the sustainable development and harvesting of our stocks. Let us not revisit any of the past excesses of overfishing, such as we saw with the southern bluefin and the orange roughy, but let us conserve our species of all fish.

314,Mr Adams (Lyons) (10.04 A.m.),"I have only heard the last three minutes of the speechThursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 6495 best, because it is one of the things that Australia can do more of, and it is probably given to more exporting of its fish. Of course, in my area, we do that quite well with salmon-as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is not opposed by the opposition and will be supported. Australian fisheries under the Commonwealth jurisdiction are managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, and a number of acts cover their responsibility. There are a number of minor issues needing correction, and they have been identified over the past four years, I understand; and these amendments rectify those issues that have been identified. The bill tidies up interpretations and definitions in some of the more complex areas, and will get over those issues with these amendments. Certainly the management of fisheries in Australia has been the subject of much discussion recently, particularly in the committee of which I am deputy chair-the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industry, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs. We brought down a report entitled Managing Commonwealth fisheries: the last frontier. The phrase 'the last frontier' gives the impression that there is a frontier and that there are still a lot of issues out there where things do not always fit together that well. When the recommendations from this report come in, I am sure there will be other amendments to the acts that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority will need to make, after consideration by government and by the minister, of course. There are many problems that surface in this industry. They are not easily dealt with because of the lack of information between governments-state and federal. The old act that was basically put in place by John Kerin when he was the minister for primary industries endeavoured to break some of the old links of ministerial influence, with people coming straight to the minister when there was a problem. I think this is the issue that we confront in the state legislation: there is still not enough room between the minister and the actual decision making process. The setting up of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority by John Kerin under the Labor government endeavoured to set a distance between ministerial decision making and the actual management of the fisheries, therefore taking some of the politics out of it. That has worked reasonably well, but there are issues there that need to be addressed. There are many issues that have come through in the new report which will help tidy those things up and build on the strengths and the pluses that came out of that original model. I would recommend that the state fisheries and the state fisheries ministers, of whatever persuasion, have a look at trying to distance themselves a bit from the politics of the fishing industry. Then we may well get more, and better, direction and more sustainability in the long term. There are many problems that have surfaced for this industry and, as I said, they are not easily dealt with. One of them is the swapping of information so that people have a good basis on which to make decisions. Some of these amendments make the management acts a bit clearer and more precise so that they enhance people's ability to understand what their responsibilities are, which is always a positive thing. We will have to go a little further in administering our fisheries and I think our report will certainly assist that. Fishing is one of Australia's major resource industries. Certainly in Tasmania it makes up a goodly proportion of our income and provides thousands of jobs throughout our island. Yet there are arms within the industry that do not even talk to each other, let alone discuss the overall planning or the overall industry, and that means it lacks an ability to look into the 6496 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 June 1997 future. There are recommendations in our report, The last frontier, which we would say would help us to get some more direction in that area, and I wiII touch on those in a little while. The report recognises, as these amendments do, that when it comes to management, fish do not respect lines drawn in the water. They cross over between state and Commonwealth waters and there have to be specific management regimes to sort that out. Under the present regime, the Commonwealth has responsibility for certain fisheries and the states have responsibility for others. As I said earlier, some of the decision making process really has political overtones, from the state perspective, and we should try and keep away from that. I would urge the states to move away from that sort of environment. One issue that needs to be addressed is by-catch. This report-and I am sure amendments wiII come to the parliament some time in the future-deals with the by-catch situations, where a certain amount of dumping takes place at sea when a catch is made of a species which is not targeted by the fisher. It may be quite a legitimate catch, but it might not have economic value to the fisher. The fisher who knows the price of that particular fish may wish to dump it and to shoot again for another species which wiII give him a bigger economic return. The fisher may shoot his nets and catch a species which is prohibited, so he wiII dump those fish at sea. These catches never go into the logbooks, never come back to management and therefore are not part of the management of fisheries. This is an ongoing problem that has been with us since the year dot when we first started to have some sort of management regimes over fisheries. Some of the recommendations in the House committee's report go to trying to get on top of these issues so that logbooks give a much truer picture and can be used as a management tool. We should encourage that. Those recommendations say that the authority should meet some of the costs of fishers landing those fish that they caught instead of dumping them, so that there would be some worthwhile economic return to them-pay them to bring those fish ashore. The recommendation is that any surplus from that should go to fishing research. The fishers would at least be compensated for the cost of bringing those fish ashore, but it would not be a big enough incentive to make them target the fish that we may not want fished at that time. That would certainly give a bit more credibility to logbooks. It is also a part of getting the fishers to have faith in fishing management. The feeling I have is that there is a stand-off between the management authorities of the fisheries-whether they be state based or Commonwealth-and the fishers. The fishers stand off, not quite trusting the management authorities. On the other side, managers do not quite trust the information they get from all the fishers. Some of that has broken down at the Commonwealth level and possibly in some of the state areas, and that is excellent. If we can get the fishers to have faith in the management and the management to have faith in the fishers, a lot more information will be obtained which will be of great assistance to managing fisheries in the future. I hope that the very good recommendation in this report on the by-catch will be taken up by the government in the future---especially looking at and utilising logbooks. The recommendation really goes to the surrender provisions and getting people to declare their bycatch. This has been utilised in New Zealand, where it has been very successful, I understand, in getting them to get more credibility from their logbooks . .REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 6497 Some of the recommendations in the report also go to recreational fishing; in particular, game fishing, charter boat operators and the general revenue that they generate, which is a considerable amount according to evidence from those fisheries. Also, of course, there are the common recreational fishermen who fish off the rocks around the coastlines or go out in boats in the estuaries or wherever. They take a considerable amount of fish which we do not have a lot of knowledge about. They certainly spend a lot of money on recreational fishing, whether it is on lures or fishing rods, fishing boats, fuel, caravans or accommodation or whatever. It has always been difficult to get an exact figure which has total credibility, but it is certainly a considerable amount. One of the recommendations in the report suggests that there needs to be a change in the Fisheries Management Act to allow the management authority to take recreational fishing into consideration when managing the fisheries of the Commonwealth. It does that because you cannot have the amount of fish caught by recreational fishing not being given consideration in the overall management of the fishing stocks. I think that will be a generally accepted recommendation. The position of this industry is a reflection of the name of this report, The last frontier. Within this industry, a considerable number of cowboys still exist, if I can call them that. There are people at the frontier who still sometimes make their own rules and make decisions without giving consideration to the fisheries they are in. They do not always consider the future-the long-term position-and they act a bit in a cowboy way in exploiting whatever they can, whenever they can, without really giving consideration to the long-term management situation of the fishery in which they are fishing. That needs to be addressed. We really need to try to bring those people in, as I said earlier, so they will have some faith in management of fisheries, and then the management authorities may have some faith in them and in what they do in the fisheries in which they work. The cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth and bringing together the constitutional issues with the swapping of information need to be addressed. The management of the fishery, whether it is a Commonwealth fishery or a state fishery, also needs to be decided, perhaps by considering one fishery at a time and not by packing them up together to make agreements to make them work. There are some other recommendations in our report in relation to CSIRO. The research vessel, the Southern Surveyor, which works out of the CSIRO fishing laboratories in Hobartat the end of Salamanca Place-I believe is certainly underutilised in the management of Australian fisheries. There are some recommendations that we should endeavour to make sure that we utilise this vessel, with the right priorities, in looking at the research needs and the knowledge that we need for the management of our fisheries. At the moment, sometimes this boat has to go to other countries to earn money so that it has enough money to continue its existence. I think there is enough work to be done in Australian fisheries to provide a bit more work for this vessel. There is a recommendation in the report that we should do so. I have dealt with the by-catch and recreational issues. The main issue I want to deal with is that, because of the lack of knowledge and leadership within the national perspective of the fishing industry, there is a great need for the Australian Seafood Industry Council to be strengthened and able to build on a national basis. We are talking about having a national body which can deal with government at a national level because there are a lot of issues now from a national perspective in fishing that are becoming international as well. 6498 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 June 1997 The honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey), who is sitting opposite me and who sits on the treaties committee with me, realises this because we have been through the tuna treaty and the issues that are involved in tuna fishing in the Southern Ocean and in Australian waters. There is a need for a national body that will give a proper perspective. The fishing industry is not always perceived to be a good industry and it has some relatively bad press from time to time and so a national body would help counter some of that. Sometimes that press is not truthful and sometimes it is used to attack fishing and the fishing industry. There are a lot of people in the fishing industry who are fishing quite legitimately and who are very supportive of their fisheries and of the management of the fisheries. They will work closely with the authorities to protect their industry and work for its long-term future, and they endeavour to build new products. More of that probably needs to be done in the future. At present there is very little that is done in this industry which looks into long-term marketing situations for fish in our country and also overseas. The industry does have potential. There is potential in the Southern Ocean, but there is going to be a response to fishing in the Southern Ocean from people who believe that that area is going to be exploited by the world fishing nations as they try to reap in some of the catches that they cannot catch in other parts of the world. There are a lot of problems in the Northern Hemisphere fisheries at the moment. Evidence that we received in our inquiry indicated that there is about 50 per cent overcapitalisation in the world's fishing fleets. There has been a lot of new technology introduced over the years and the efforts used to take fish out of the seas has increased enormously. Each country has added value to their boats to enable them to exploit the seas as much as they can, and that is coming to a head and needs to be dealt with. The opposition will certainly be supporting these amendments and I look forward to the government acting on our report in the future and bringing our management of fisheries to a better state. (Time expired) responsibility in assisting in the management of Australia's fishing is of extreme importance. Australian fishing resources, considering the length of our coastline and the sea surrounding us, are not very great. They certainly do not compare with some of the Gulf Stream fisheries and areas like that which are, by comparison, huge. However, the north Atlantic is under great threat because of overfishing. Consequently, conservation of our fish stocks and careful management and sustainable management is of the greatest importance. The Commonwealth has responsibilities well outside those that once applied to state governments, particularly as the fishing effort goes further away from our shores. Also, the Commonwealth has responsibility particularly in the area off the Northern Territory, such as the Gulf of Carpentaria, and has had input there. The Western Australian legislature has probably led Australia in fisheries management over the decades. There was a period, under the management of Mr Bernard Bowen-who now, amongst doing other things in his retirement, advises the Commonwealth in his role as a consultant-that probably was one of the most innovative periods. The concept of limited entry fishery goes back as far as I can remember-very early in the development of what we knew as the crayfish industry, which is now referred to as the rock lobster industry. It was recognised that this valuable resource-a very highly priced product-had to be managed. Whilst originally that was resisted by free traders in the fishing industry, today it is clearly understood and has put a floor in the industry that has made its participants some of the most",130,Representatives Main Committee
315,Mr Tuckey (O'connor) (10.24 A.m.),"The circumstances relating to the Commonwealth'sThursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 6499 prosperous people in the country. The ownership of each individual lobster pot licence-the industry is controlled by the issuing of licences for a certain number of pots on each boatwhich was once given out by the state, now trades at $30,000 each. A typical cray fisherman in my electorate would probably have about 100. So he is a pretty wealthy fellow. He has a $3 million asset which he can trade in $30,000 units, which also makes it a very attractive means of asset building. Quite a lot of people today see them as an asset. I wish I had followed in some of my constituents' footsteps and bought pot licences when they were about $3,000 or $4,000-and I thought they were grossly overpriced then. However, it has built an asset into the industry whilst applying conservation measures. A matter of considerable controversy and debate occurred in my electorate just a few years ago. In his closing statement, the member for Lyons( Mr Adams) referred to the substantial increase in technology that has been applied to the fishing industry. I wish to talk about that for a moment. Because of that, fishing effort increased dramatically. In fact, on the recommendation of the representative bodies of the industry itself, the government was asked to reduce the number of pots available to the fishing industry by 25 per cent. This became a controversial issue, but the state government eventually had the courage to reduce the quantity by 18 per cent. Some people suggested that that would mean a massive loss to the industry, but there was none whatsoever. The fish catch continued at relatively the same level but, furthermore, the value of these pot licences that I have just referred to increased automatically, and the gross asset value of each fishing enterprise was unchanged. However, it has made a difference because it is creating the opportunity for sufficient of these animals to survive each year and go on with the breeding process which guarantees the longevity of this industry. The industry has also expanded in many ways. What was once a process of catching, cooking, freezing and selling to the United States is now an industry which is much more highly technological and which has processes to keep the animals alive. They have discovered that they can put them into suspended animation by chilling to a certain degree. They are shipped overseas live at great financial premiums into markets in Asia, in particular. This has added significantly to the revenues of the industry. With the sorts of procedures that are now being used, they can keep the animals alive onshore well past the fishing season, which is very important in evening out supply and, consequently, in maintaining price. I did make a few points about modem technology. Within my term of office as a member of parliament, for the majority of the areas where rock lobster in particular are caught-and most of the fishing is done in Western Australia-the reality is that the process has changed dramatically in that time. A lot of the technology associated with fishing resided in the minds of the fishermen. They had to do the best they could to relocate the reliable spots. Over time, there was some depth-sounding equipment available which allowed them to identify the particular depth and shape of the bottom which they were looking for in order to catch their fish. But, of course, that has progressed to a point where not only do they now know where the fish are, to within a matter of metres, through the GPS technology, but their ability to service that catch has speeded up. The reality is that not only do they know where they want to go to put out the pots and can get there within a metre or two, but, having dropped them there, the following morning they can put the boat on automatic pilot, dial up where the first pot is and go to sleep, if they choose to, and their boat will take them to within a couple of metres of that pot. They do not 6500 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 June 1997 have to spend considerable time searching for them, and they do not have to layout five or six pots where one will do. They needed five or six pots in the past, simply to be somewhere near the target and, of course, to make them easier to find. Rolling around in a boat and looking for a float that in old-fashioned terms is about eight inches in diameter was a very difficult task. The ability to catch fish improved with the quality of the boats, the speed of the boats and all the technology that is now available, and so that did require there to be a reduction in pot size. Similarly, within the direct responsibility of AFMA was the Gulf of Carpentaria-where successive governments, believing in free enterprise and all those sorts of things, granted excessive licence entitlements to trawl for prawns, which appeared to be a limitless resource. In the early days, we even had the Russians coming down with very large deep-sea trawlers and making huge catches, particularly of banana prawn, which is a schooling type of prawn. In the early days, there would have been enough of these animals in the net to stop a trawler. But that resource was very quickly used up. The prawn resource is very much reactive to land weather conditions. In other words, the spawning occurs in creeks and, if you do not get the rainfall necessary to flush them out into the open sea, you get very limited catches. All this was very obvious, and AFMA and the other controlling federal bodies have had to go through a continuing process of buying back licence entitlements. The process they chose was not all that efficient, and it took a long time to get to a situation where we could see a reversal of the continuing decline of catches and the lack of economics in that area. Quite a number of the boats that operate in the Gulf of Carpentaria are actually based in my electorate, particularly out of Geraldton, and it is very interesting to talk to the fishermen, who are very conservation minded and do understand that their welfare resides in proper conservation measures but who frequently criticise the processes that are used. There were a thousand propositions put forward for conservation, from restricting the period of catch to putting quotas on individual fishermen, which is quite a silly proposition. All that does is maintain a situation where the bad fishermen get as much quota as the good fishermen, which does not encourage the sorts of efficiencies we need in the industry. There were many different propositions, but the authorities in Western Australia eventually said, 'The thing that catches the crayfish is the pot; so, if we restrict the number of pots in the water, clearly we are reducing the fishing effort.' This proposition was not put in the Gulf of Carpentaria by the federal authorities, who wanted to issue licences based on the horsepower of the boat, the length of the boat and all sorts of peculiar things-when the fishing effort is, in fact, all in the trawl net. Constituents of mine have never been able to convince the authorities that the control ought to be purely on the net capacity of individual boats. They should be able to tow as much as their power and other things will allow; but, consequently, the restrictions should be on net capacity, because that is clearly what is catching the fish, and not necessarily the horsepower of the boat towing the net. Those are the matters that still need to be addressed, to my mind. We do welcome these measures, in particular, the increasing of fines, and particularly as they apply to the pirates of the sea-the people who come into our areas of fishing resource to catch fish. Of course, if you are there illegally in the first place, you are not going to pay much attention to the conservation measures that we apply to our licensed fishermen, and that is the greatest threat to the future of the industry. So it is incumbent upon Australia fo make Thursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 6501 sure that we prevent people entering our fisheries who are not licensed, because they add to the fishing catch but they will just catch as much as they can before they escape. The member for Lyons mentioned our involvement, in the treaties committee, in looking at the southern bluefin tuna industry and the fact that that was brought almost to the brink of extinction by gross overfishing by foreign countries within what might be measured as Australia's nature resource. It is still a problem because tuna are such migratory species. They breed in northern waters, and at that stage are subject to control by the Indonesian authorities, then take themselves over nearly to South Africa and then back to Australia. At each stage, they are either within or out of the control of varying nations and are extremely vulnerable to overfishing, which is heart breaking when one considers their value, particularly in the Japanese sashimi market. We made very strong recommendations that Australia maintain a very tough line in negotiations with Japan on catching these fish in this area, simply because we would love to see the resource substantially increased. We now see the South Australians farming these fish-and there is a lot of sense in that. Nevertheless, the fishing technology that abounds on the high seas today is a major threat to the future of many fish stocks. I have criticised purse seining in the case of tuna fishing. The old system of poling the fish, whilst highly inefficient, was a great contributor to conservation, because it guaranteed that some of the fish got away. That is pretty important-they have got to get away to breed. When you are able to identify a schooling variety of fish, such as tuna, by using an aeroplane and then sailing around it, putting a net around the entire school and zipping up the bottom to make sure none gets away, it is not very smart in terms of the longevity of the industry in which you are involved. But that is what purse seiners do, and that is to be condemned. We still have some in Australia, although they are primarily being used in fish farming, which is at least subject to catch limitations so that you just cannot keep going back to get the last school, but we have to be a bit sensible. Drift netting is another method of fish catching to be condemned. It is too indiscriminate and it takes a lot of animals that have no commercial value but are drowned or finished when the net is rolled in. Long-lining, whilst a little more selective and seen as a fairly efficient method of catching tuna and those types of fish, is another method that can give too much capacity to the fishing fleet. We do not see here some of the North Sea issues, where ships that we would probably consider cruise liners have a continuous trawling and processing effort and literally suck the bottom dry. We saw the collapse of the cod industry in the north Atlantic, something which nobody ever dreamed would happen. The Canadians fight a continuing battle to protect their salmon stocks, which are fish that all of us have been raised to believe were there forever. They are not, if people are foolish. When people are fishing, for instance, in Antarctic waters, and the mere cost of getting there would be in the tens of thousands of dollars, I am not sure that, if there is a very substantial reward in terms of fish catch available to them, a $50,000 fine is going to worry them very much. Furthermore, it is going to cost us hundreds of thousands to send a ship down there to catch them. I think anything less than the confiscation of all the fishing equipment, including the boat, is insufficient. They know they are not allowed there. They know that they are doing damage. They do not care, because they do not even know if they are coming back. It is not their resource. I think we have to be prepared to attack that very seriously. 6502 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 June 1997 Research-and the member for Lyons mentioned some of that-is absolutely essential. Wi; just simply do not know in many cases how long it takes certain fish varieties to achieve maturity and become breeding stock. That is of grave concern because you go on catching fish and you catch fewer every year but there seems to be plenty there. Then, as they found in the north Atlantic, you go back one year and there are none. In the north Atlantic, they had gone because, in the previous years, they had removed all the breeding stock and gone on catching the immature stock, leaving nothing to breed on. Fortunately, somewhere, there must have been a few of them because there is some recovery. Now they are fighting and scratching to get in there before there is substantial recovery. We have had the same problem with southern bluefin tuna. There has been some improvement in their numbers and immediately, in this case, the Japanese are demanding increased quotas when we are far from having anything like satisfactory recovery of fish stocks. It is right to welcome this legislation which improves the ability of AFMA, the federal management authority, to do its job. It gives it a better opportunity to enter premises and other places to inspect what is going on and to catch people who are not dealing within the law. Anecdotally, it is very interesting. There is a limit on the size of a crayfish or rock lobster that can be caught in my electorate. As a hotel keeper many years ago, I had a visit from a fisheries inspector. He walked into my coolroom and started shaking the barrels of beer. I wondered what he was up to until he told me that the latest means of hiding them had been to screw the bung off the barrel of beer and pack it full of crayfish. The inspector came in and had a look around and could not see any shells around the place and thought it was right. But they eventually woke up. These are the dreadful things that people do to break the law. are that this is the sort of silly thing that people do to destroy their own industry. I do think, particularly in the rock lobster industry in my electorate today, there is a clear understanding. In previous years when I lived in Carnarvon, where there was a substantial prawning industry, there was a case where one fisherman rammed another because he had moved into forbidden waters. Whilst that is almost piracy on the high seas, I understood their thoughts. They realised that when people broke the rules, everybody was a loser and that the rules are there to protect the industry more than to protect anything else. We need this sort of regulation. I am not sure that the federal authority has achieved maximum efficiency in doing that. I have corresponded with them over the years with criticism, but in fact I support the moves that have been made in this legislation. to vote against it because it would not serve much purpose. But I think the key was in the minister's second reading speech. The philosophy of the management act is to divorce the Commonwealth minister from the day-to-day management decisions. To this end, the primary function of the minister in relation to the Commonwealth fisheries is to accept plans of management determined by AFMA. This is not the case with joint authority fisheries. After due consultation with the states, the amendment seeks to refine this anomaly. What the minister is doing is divorcing himself from the industry itself and leaving the running of the industry to bureaucrats. In my experience, the bureaucrats will always abuse their power. I am becoming increasingly concerned that decisions made in the fishing industry are made on a quasi-scientific basis, not on real science. There are many instances where the bureaucrats who control the industry make emotional decisions not based on science at all.",134,Representatives Main Committee

318,Mr Campbell (Kalgoorlie) (10.44 A.m.),"I do not support this legislation. I am not goingThursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 6503 I will give you an example of that. A few years ago, the scallop fishery based in Shark Bay in Western Australia occasionally would suffer a catastrophic season and there would be great calls to stop the industry altogether. This went on for several years and the fishing effort was reduced but then they found that it depended entirely on the spat set. Because of the fecundity of the scallop, if you fished all but a handful of scallops, if the set was right you would get a very good season again next year. By going into water and taking tests, they could tell you well before the season opened what the scallop season was going to be. Recently, we had an example of this in the Abrolhos area of the scallop fishery where they determined that, for some reason or other, spat had not set and there would be no scallopsand that proved to be the case. I tried to get the fisheries minister to immediately open the Shark Bay scallop fishery, where the season starts a few weeks later-the spat set there had indicated that it would be good. I support limited entry fisheries. I think Western Australia has been the Australian leader in this sort of fishery management, but it is not the only strategy. For centuries, the Japanese have used the method of fishing to economic extermination. They then leave it, and 50 to 100 years later the industry comes back. One cannot but deny that it has worked in the past for the Japanese. It is not a method I advocate, but certainly, no-one can deny that that is what has happened. I am concerned about this legislation. Fishermen in New South Wales told me recently that the fisheries department there has said categorically that its idea is to make fishing so difficult that it will reduce the catch-in other words, it is looking to reduce the catch by simply impeding the fishermen. Where a fisherman has a multiple licence, he has to nominate on the day whether he is going out to trawl, and if he is, he must take all his line fishing equipment off his boat. If he is going out to trawl for deep-sea fish, like ling, he cannot go for prawns or something else. If a fisherman gets out there and finds a southerly blowing so he cannot trawl, he has to steam all the way back to port, change his gear and go out again. That means, of course, that the day is wasted. That is a nonsense. The Commonwealth has recently signed a treaty with Japan to allow the Japanese entry to the 200-mile zone for $3.5 million annual payment-and the Commonwealth thinks it has done a good deal. Firstly, there is no real control of what the Japanese catch. While it is true that we put observers on some of the boats, the observers have said to me that they have been ordered below by the captain when the catch is coming up. On the occasion when we did apprehend some illegal trawlers, they had catches far greater than those registered by the legal trawlers. I suspect that we do not have any real grasp of the quantity of product that they are taking. This is in contrast to the laws that apply in the south-east trawl. Fishermen have told me that up to $20 million worth of overquota product is dumped back in the sea. This occurs because fisheries have said they have a quota of so much fish. When they are fishing for another species, quite often they catch the fish which they have already exceeded their quota on. They have no alternative but to dump it back in the sea, where 100 per cent of these fish die. If the fishermen are caught with these fish on their boats, they are subject to heavy fines. This is an absolute nonsense. People involved in that industry have told me that they reckon the loss is about $20 million a year. Of course, there is no record of it, and it is simply a waste all around-a waste of fish, a waste of resources, a waste of time and a waste of money. 6504 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 June 1997 The problem with this act is the draconian nature of it. In this act we are increasing the power of fishery inspectors to inspect premises without warrant. This is a dangerous situation. The erosion of civil liberties is happening across the board. While it seems to be applauded by members of the government and the opposition, I believe it is a dangerous trend in Australia. What we ought to be doing is seeking the cooperation of the industry, and the bureaucrats and the scientists ought to be involved. They ought to be getting out there much more regularly with fishermen and seeing the real problems and understanding the difficulties that fishermen operate under. We also ought to be putting more effort into seeing how we can increase fish stocks. I have no doubt that we will seek to limit recreational fishermen. We will say, 'You cannot fish with your rod and line or your small net.' In the land of the free, that is an outrageous situation, when we know that if we were to create artificial reefs or floating platforms in many of our areas that would clearly increase the proportion of pelagic fish available. That sort of thing should be the endeavour, rather than clamping down on the rights of individuals. There are many species of fish which can easily be bred in captivity and returned to the sea. With small fish you are going to get a much higher survival rate than you get in nature, where they are developed from eggs and go through various stages. That, too, could be looked at to increase our resources. I have had a case recently, again in Shark Bay, where the department arbitrarily banned the recreational fishermen from taking snapper from one side of the bay. That was done without any real scientific basis, and I am pleased to see that that total ban has now been relaxed. Here is a fish which we know we can breed in captivity and could be returned to the sea. I believe that if we used fish licence money, or even just government resources, to do that sort of thing, we would be serving a much better purpose than the draconian stance that we often adopt at the moment. Some expertise in marketing fish is another thing that is needed. There is a lot of by-catch which does not have a lot of value. I believe everything caught should be landed on the shore and should be processed. Even if it is only processed for fish meal, it is better than throwing it back into the sea where it is invariably going to die. I was recently in Batemans Bay and I got a box of ling fillet. A few years ago, the only purpose fishermen used ling for was as bait in craypots. It is an absolutely exquisite fish and a good eating fish, one that I think rivals the famous barramundi from my electorate. Now it is a very useful commercial fish. When I first started shark fishing-I was involved with Harvey Gurney in pioneering shark fishing at Eucla, which is quite difficult waters-we used to catch a lot of what we called dog sharks, which were discarded. They now find that there is a commercial application for them. I believe that sort of research is very useful. Most of this research is in fact done by fishermen, not by AFMA, not by the authorities, not by the bureaucrats. Recently in Esperance, where there was pressure on the southern cray, as distinct from the western cray that occurs in Geraldton and on the western side of my electorate-the southern cray being the much bigger animal-local fishermen decided they would try the continental shelf. There they found very large stocks of cray and the giant crab which has also found a very good market in Asian countries. Here there is a type of giant crab with a horn which does not enjoy any market there, I guess because of its ugliness. It seems to me that we should be seeking ways to process that meat, because I am sure that once it was processed the buyer would not know from which particular crab it came. Thursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 6505 This legislation is what one would call good socialist legislation. It seeks to impose controls from the top down. In my view it does not deal with the issue, because the nature of fishermen, and of their industry, is that they are going to seek to avoid where they can, and not work in conjunction with, the authorities. I believe the legislation clearly fails in that it does not seek to set up that cooperation between the fishermen and the management authority. There is no doubt that if you were to seek cooperation you would get it because a lot of these fishermen are very conservation minded. I talk to them all the time in my own electorate and many of them are concerned. But they also know when they are being subjected to bureaucratic nonsense and they resent it very strongly. I believe that, as the demand for aquaculture grows and we see species farmed, we must look also to expanding the resources that are available to fishermen because there will always be a demand in some areas for that ocean-caught fish. There is a view in some circles that it does deserve a premium. The job of the government and of the scientist should be looking to do whatever is possible to expand the numbers and not simply to curtail the effort. Having said that, it is quite clear to me that limited entry is the way to go. The honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) was quite right when he said the controls, if any, should be on the fishing effort-in the case of crays on pots, in the case of prawns on net size. That is so logical one cannot see how anyone can really argue with it. Limited entry does give value to the industry. And while it flies right in the face of Hilmer-and this is going to be a dilemma for the government-it is quite clear that if you apply Hilmer to the fishing industry you cannot have limited entry. But limited entry does give an asset; it does ensure viability. It reduces the pressure that fishermen feel that they need to make a living and I urge the government, both at the state and federal level, to look at limited entry fisheries and control in that way. I also urge much more cooperation with the industry from the bureaucrats. As I said earlier, given unlimited power with no controls and no oversight by the minister, that power will be abused, just as it has been abused in the ATSIC Act where the minister has no real authority. In my view, if the government had the nerve to amend the ATSIC Act to give the minister the overriding authority, you would see a great improvement in that very inefficient and retrograde piece of legislation. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (10.58 a.m.)-Thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. This is a bill which continues the government's strong commitment to the fishing industry and allows for further commitments to be brought into force. The government understands the importance of maintaining our very valuable fisheries resource, and our commercial harvest alone is valued at approximately $1.7 billion a year, which brings many social and economic benefits across the whole country. It is important that we manage our fisheries in an ecologically sustainable way and to ensure that future generations will be able to have the same access and enjoyment that we all have. It is without doubt that Queensland is renowned for some of the best seafood in Australia. The waters of Moreton Bay, which border the Petrie electorate which I am very pleased to represent, and particularly the Redcliffe Peninsula, have a most plentiful supply of fish, crabs and prawns. Some of the wonderful delicacies that come from those waters are Moreton Bay bugs, mud crabs of course, brown tiger and banana prawns and whiting. They are just a few to name the abundance of catch that is in Moreton Bay. The waters are very rich and they have been providing economic sustainability and livelihood for the trawling and associated 6506 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 June 1997 processing and export industries. Fishing is a very large recreational activity in Petrie and it is also enjoyed by the many thousands of residents and visitors who visit there every year. Recently, in the Moreton Bay area, a meeting was held by the Queensland Fish Management Authority. A number of issues were discussed at that meeting, including pollution and denigration of the bay habitat. We need to develop a really responsible attitude towards all of the issues needing to be addressed, particularly things like fish sizes, the need for bag limits, and the review of patrol enforcement and regulations regarding bait and cast nets. It is important that we keep looking at that. I know that the Queensland Fish Management Authority has played a very responsible role, particularly in managing activities in the bay. The amazing thing about my electorate is the number of people who participate in fishing as a recreational activity as well. A most pleasing thing for me is to drive over the Hornibrook Bridge-or as many call it, the Horton Highway: Hays Inlet, Redcliffe and the Woody Point jetties are a source of constant relaxation and joy to many people. Fishing is indeed a very valuable recreational activity in the community, and many of us will always remember with great delight the first fish that we caught. The demand for seafood is ever increasing, and will continue to increase in years to come. Consumers rate quality as extremely important, and they will pay a premium price for a top quality product. I note from the Queensland Fish Management Authority that Moreton Bay represents some three per cent of Queensland's coastline but that it covers 13 per cent of the commercial catch and 30 per cent of Queensland's recreational anglers. As honourable members will know, I have had a close affiliation to the fishing industry throughout my life, and I acknowledge the needs in industries that have been involved. My family has been involved in the industry for over 45 years, and there have been some great changes in the industry over that time. Consumer demands and changes have been worth noting, particularly in restaurants. I can remember days not so long ago when to eat Moreton Bay bugs was simply out of the question. Consumers are also developing a taste for such items as calamari, and the consumption of oysters and mussels has increased markedly in recent years. As in any industry, the issues can be many and varied, and there needs to be great consultation between the government, processors and industry managers in the local community if we are to develop really good seafood policy. There have been a number of recent health scares in Victoria and New South Wales which have highlighted the great need for food quality and safety in this particular industry. Those experiences also outlined what can happen when consumer confidence is undermined: areas of New South Wales are certainly feeling that to this day, particularly in light of their recent scares. The challenge, therefore, is to produce, export and market a product that not only reaches the high standards of industry regulations but also meets the high demands of consumers. There is much emphasis on safe quality products, and one only has to look at such incidents as those in New South Wales and Victoria that I have just mentioned to see the damaging side effects that they can have for the whole seafood industry. I understand that there is presently some debate about the shortening time line on our fisheries. How much more we can expand our seafood catch is arguable, but we can increase our return for underutilised species. We can develop adequate and expanding aquaculture industries and we can add value to current catches through quality assurance programs. The aquaculture industry, in particular, has much potential. I know that there is much money being Thursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 6507 spent on research and development in Queensland to ensure the success of this particular industry. I recently had the opportunity to open the Seafood Quality Assurance Summit in Brisbane and to represent the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) there. The summit provided an excellent opportunity to assist progress in the development of best practice manuals for the catching, processing and marketing of products in the wild-caught prawn, spanner crab, mullet and reef fish sectors. It identified the impediments to maintaining quality for these products and also how to remove those impediments: interface with industry, airlines, supermarket, food service and other sectors is to the betterment of all, and we must ensure that that continues. The summit also determined future research and development and training priorities for the industry. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Resources and Energy for his interest and work in his portfolio, which deals with this particular area. I also thank him for the concern that he has shown recently for the fishing industry in Petrie by his taking time to visit processors in an area of significant industry interest. The bill that is being debated today relates to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991, the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1991. A development from the Fisheries Management Act was the establishment of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. This authority was designed to develop efficient management systems for fisheries which come under the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. In essence, there are four objectives in the authority's charter. The first is to manage Commonwealth fisheries at an ecologically sustainable fishing level and conserve stock levels, and to appreciate the marine biology and habitat in order to ensure future viability. Secondly, the authority must maximise economic returns to the industry and broaden the community needs while meeting sustainability objectives. The third objective is to communicate effectively and consult with government, the fishing industry and other marine resource users and the broader community. The fourth is to achieve efficient and cost-effective fisheries management and administration. This legislation amends and attempts to further define the role and activities of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, which was established in 1992, and provide greater security of long-term access to fisheries. Recently the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs brought down a report titled Managing Commonwealth fisheries: the last frontier. There are some important aspects that need to be mentioned. One of them is the management of the particular authority. One of the important things about the industry is that we need to have proper assessment and we have to have proper, ongoing logbooks. The report quotes Mr John Tanzer, of the Queensland Fish Management Authority, who stated: ... the ideal situation is where you have reliable logbook data coming in-in addition. He said that we need what is called fishery independent assessment, receipts from marketing and stock assessments on the ground, so to speak, and that AFMA is starting to lead the way in fisheries management. It has stock assessment subcommittees set up for most of its management advisory committees, and commissions those to do the on-ground assessment. We need to continue this constant monitoring. AFMA is responsible also for vessel monitoring systems. A number of positive aspects of the use of these vessel monitoring systems include improved compliance with the quota 6508 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 June 1997 system, the ability to confirm correct behaviour, the ability to identify suspicious behaviour and, when it occurs, greater efficiency in port inspections, the enabling of AFMA to communicate with vessels, the reliability and low-cost nature of the system, its use as a preventative, and improved safety and communication for fishing vessels. These amendments will allow those with fishing rights far more assurance in their planning if there are changes to the management plans of the fishery. Fishing operators and investors will now have far more security of their investment and will be provided with protection when changes to government industry policy occur. An avenue is provided in this legislation to establish and abolish subcommittees under the management advisory committees. Amendments to the act, through section 95, go towards removing penalties. In some cases, the level of penalties are raised, and in others dollar amounts are converted to penalty units. Australian fisheries have for decades provided the country with a constant and consistent base for income dollars. The challenge now is to strive and to continue this strong focus, and to allow the industry to continue and develop in a way which will provide sustainable benefits to the economy.

They may well have expected members of the opposition to use this issue regarding the minister involved but, quite frankly, the report is too important for that. This report is much more important than the minister because it is a report of a committee which has bipartisan support. It goes to the key issues affecting small business in this country, and small business is watching all of us very closely to see how we deal with this. I am sure that there will be government speakers coming forward who are part of the committee. A number of people on that committee worked very hard to try to bring forward a report which we could all agree with. There was one minor variation, and I will go to that later on in my speech, but the important part was that it is a second report by this comrnitteethe first one was in 1989 and was a landmark report. This one is equally important. It takes things a stage further. IfI just start to work through the recommendations, it will give some indication how vital this inquiry is. The first recommendation deals with the role of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. There was a genuine concern among committee members and witnesses during the inquiry that the ACCC was not playing the role it could be playing. Therefore, the first recommendation in the report is an attempt to guide the government in encouraging the ACCC to be more proactive, to take up cases, particularly under the new section of the act where it recommends getting case precedents, so that there are examples available to the business community showing how the act could be applied in terms of unfair trading. Our concern was that unless the ACCC set that standard, all else would be in vain.",144,Representatives Main Committee
321,Mr Allan Morris (Newcastle) (11.16 A.m.),"I can understand the government beingThursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 6511 We are aware that the ACCC has taken large companies to court and that there have been court cases and settlements. But because those settlements have been by agreement and have been out of court settlements, they have never been made public. They are, therefore, not available as case law for other people with, perhaps, similar problems. So, the very first recommendation is a request to make the ACCC more proactive. The report deals in a very major way with retail tenancy, and, again, as in 1989, that was a major part of the submissions. We had submissions from all over the country, in the main from small business people, and we are still getting submissions. In fact, one arrived this last week. The people involved had not realised that the inquiry had concluded, and their submission was heartrending. A young couple have lost a business and an awful lot of money because of the way they were treated. If this report had been adopted and in place, then their circumstances would have been different. I was talking to a person in North Queensland this week who told me how at the end of his lease in a previous shopping centre he was told to go: end of story. The tenant had offered to pay more rent. He had built up a good business there, had paid his way and contributed to the set-up in terms of contributions. At the end of the lease he was told to go. No ifs and buts: make way for somebody else. That kind of treatment is not conducive to confidence or to investment. Most of all, it affects people who are very powerless. When we were putting together the report there was very good cooperation-and I certainly offer my support to the Chairman, Mr Bruce Reid, and to Mr Richard Evans, who chaired it while Mr Reid was away. In many cases we do not agree on these issues. In politics we have our divisions and our arguments but within that committee there was a very genuine attempt made to try to find forms of words that we could agree on because we all understood that behind it all we agreed with the general thrust. That was an important part of the process. I know people in the community imagine that we, as parliamentarians, spend all our lives fighting each other and arguing on often minor issues, but the fact is that much of our work goes into trying to find constructive and positive answers to the problems of the country. We recommended a uniform retail tenancy code while at the same time recognising that tenancy is actually a state matter. All states have particular laws regarding tenancies, leases and so on, and those laws vary greatly from state to state. The machinery available to tenants and to landlords varies from state to state. It is those variations which often cause problems because you will find that a particular franchisor, for example, will often negotiate leases in shopping centres in different states with different instruments and with different laws in place. What we have argued for is a uniform national tenancy code but, more importantly, that it be underpinned by the Trade Practices Act and by the ACCC so that it has someMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Sullivan)-Order!

When the report was tabled, we had only a quarter of an hour for 14 committee members to speak. We were promised then that it would come to the Main Committee and that we would have adequate time to make our comment on the record. We have an obligation to our constituencies but, more importantly, to the committee and to the report, to ensure that understanding of the report is widespread and as comprehensive as possible because, quite frankly, we found during the hearings-as in so many of the other committees-that most people we spoke to had no idea about processes and how effective these processes could be. I understand that my comments will now have to do not just for myself but for many others who cannot speak. It is disappointing that the government has chosen not to allow us to talk on what is one of the seminal issues facing small business and the best chance small business and the government have in this current parliament to actually change things. I was talking before the interruption and the loss of a quorum forced by the government about the fact that the uniform tenancy code that we proposedMr Leo McLeay-Before the government closed the debate down. heard of such a circumstance before. WhatI was talking about was the need for the tenancy code to be underpinned by the Trade Practices Act and the ACCC. We have had the best tenancy codes in the world but most tenants are not big enough to take on the landlord. If the landlord wants to ignore the rules and ignore the codes, it is very difficult for tenants. During the inquiry we have heard evidence in Victoria about mediation, and we heard from the tribunal in New South Wales about some of the other processes. When we talked to people who had been engaged in those processes, we found the stories were not as good as had been reported. In many cases, the cost of mediation was as great, if not greater, than going to court. So the concept of mediation, whilst fine in theory, in actual practice may not be as effective or within the reach of a small business person. In many cases, the small business person gets to that process only when he or she has lost a lot of money. We are talking about people whose bank accounts may be frozen and who may be under enormous economic duress. The idea that somehow they can then access these processes is, in many cases, not viable. It is important that the ACCC be in there with them, taking on unscrupulous landlords and people who are not obeying the code. Within that tenancy code, we had a number of key ingredients and one of the prime ones concerned the rights of sitting tenants. We have been told by commercial interests that when a lease finishes that is the end of the story. Yet we discovered that in England sitting tenants have rights, in other words, they have something to sell. So the question of goodwill is pretty fundamental to the whole issue of small business. People invest their lives, their money and their labour on the basis that at the end of all they will be able to sell what they have built up. But what has happened with shopping centres is that they have not been able to, and the landlords have been saying, 'At the end of the lease, you can say goodbye.' I mentioned earlier a case in north Queensland. We are suggesting in the report that sitting tenants should have a right of renewal so they have some confidence that if they build the business they will in fact be able to capitalise on that investment of effort and, in many cases, of money. On the other hand, if they cannot capitalise on their investment and effort there is",147,Representatives Main Committee

During its discussions the committee spoke with the Property Council of Australia, with various landlords and, at a personal level, most of the members-and I am sure that I speak for the member for Scullin and others-spoke to organisations privately. Let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is recognition amongst the property owners that things are not good, that the growth in rents is not being matched by an adequate growth in turnover, and there is no doubt that margins are being squeezed. The property owners have a responsibility to their investors to make sure that they do not lose all of their investments. It would appear they have a difficulty in assessing the mixed responsibility between their investors and their tenants, but if they do not look after their tenants, eventually they hurt their investors. What we are looking for from the government is some leadership on trying to find ways to encourage property owners to negotiate a consolidation, for want of a better word, of property values and rental values. We cannot have these seven, eight and 10 per cent increases per year that we have had for the last seven, eight or 10 years. The economy is flat, small business is suffering, and retail space is now greater than we can carry. We are seeing more and more centres, and not just where I come from, but virtually everywhere in the country. We are seeing centres either expanding or new centres going in. Even in Bunbury, I gather, there looks like some expansions or new centres going in. All over Australia we are seeing new centres and the expansion of centres, but the economy is not growing at the same pace as the floor space is growing. We are getting more space, more people going into these businesses and no more turnover, so the same money is being shared amongst more and more people. We have got to find a way to negotiate so that the investor and the tenant share some of the responsibility equally or mutually through some understanding. What has been happening to date has been that it has all been carried by the tenant. There is not a parliamentarian in this building, in either House, that does not have a case of someone losing their house or more and still owing. I have got cases right now and I am sure we all have. Almost on a weekly or monthly basis, people come to us looking to us as a person of last resort as to what they can do. There is not time for me to go through all the matters of the report, but the report touches on tenancy codes and it touches on franchisors, which is an enormous growth area but an area of danger. We have tried a voluntary code in this country and it has collapsed. It does not work. The good franchisors do not need it; the bad franchisors will not join it. What we are saying in the report, and we are saying very strongly, is that without legislation, franchising in this country is a great risk and it will not be viable. What we would be saying is to the bad franchisors, 'You go for it', and to the good ones, 'Do not bother'. The fact is, unless we put weight behind the franchising code, the franchising code will be of no value and is of no value right now. The message to franchisees and the community, if the government does not adopt that particular recommendation, is, 'It is open slather'. This report was unanimous. The government has three months to respond. There is two months to. go. I encourage small business across the country to do what we cannot do: talk about it-amongst themselves, with their landlords, with their friends, and particularly with their parliamentarians. 6514 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 June 1997 This report is a good report. I do not agree with all of it. In fact, none of the committee does, but we have worked our way through its recommendations to try and get agreement that we thought both sides of politics could live with. The opposition has announced its support for it. The Democrats have announced their support for it. We wait very much with bated breath for the government to come up strongly and say they endorse it all. We do not want some weasel words about bits and pieces here and there or about the thrust of it, we want the report adopted in its totality. Unless you adopt all of it, it all falls apart.

339,Mrs Sulliv An,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I do this with great regret. What is happening infhursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 6515 The situation is that there is a very clearly established procedure, which the member for Scullin( Mr Jenkins) is well aware of as a Deputy Speaker, that, in the name of order and fairness, where more than one member is seeking the call, whilst the standing orders say that the Speaker has the right to decide, the procedures have been such that that right is modified, as all standing orders are modified by their implementation over decades in the House. The situation is that the member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew) very clearly was seeking the call-he stood and said, ' Mr Speaker.' It may be that you did not hear him and that the member for Scullin was in your line of view. I have seen situations in the House, nevertheless. where the person occupying the chair has made an error and, where that error has been pointeu out, there has been an acceptance within the chamber that it was a simple, well-intentioned error. I would like to believe that in your case it was a simple, well-intentioned error. On those occasions that I refer to, when the occupant of the chair has had it pointed out to him or her that an error was made in the call and that the procedures of the House were not complied with, the person who should have been called-in this case, the member for Wakefield-has then received the call. The person who had originally been given the call-in this case, it would have been the member for Scullin-has deferred and never raised any objection to that procedure being followed by the Speaker. I think in the matter of a debate such as this that that would have been the procedure to be followed. It is a great pity, for a number of reasons. I feel a great deal of regret about moving this motion of dissent, the first motion of dissent I have ever moved in 23 years as a member of parliament. I feel a lot of regret about a number of the things that led to this situation arising. There was, I would remind you because you were not here, a debate earlier on some fisheries legislation. Members were here ready to speak when the opposition whip moved in and decided to torpedo the debate. This debate was due to come on; it was listed to come on; it was going to come on. Mr Leo McLeay-You were never going to get to it. Speaker, interjects and says we were never going to get to it. We would have got to it. The only way that he could say that is if he knew how long everybody was going to be speaking on these other subjects. The government has no problem with the fisheries legislation being adjourned. It will now just be resumed in the House of Representatives. That is fine. One of the effects of this is to really negate what has been one of the points of progress in the Main Committee. The progress had brought about the very situation that has happened here today, and that is to give members the opportunity to debate committee reportsMr Leo McLeay-And you are trying to stop it. You left the chair to stop it. to leave the chair, as there was a lack of a quorum. Nobody was more instrumental in drawing up the conditions for the quorum than the member who now objects. I point out that the member for Watson( Mr Leo McLeay) adjourned debate on five other items set down for debate, in which there were speakers listed. The people who were listed to speak lost their opportunity to speak. It was all done because apparently the opposition whip is incapable of negotiating a proper position. It is a great pity, and I feel for you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a relatively new occupant of the chair, to have this motion moved on you.

I point out that the particular debate that was truncated was the debate on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, which is a bill of great importance to a very large number of people in small business. The situation, as you mayor may not be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that agreements are entered into between government and opposition for matters to be debated in this chamber and an order of speaking is laid down.

As I was saying before even more of my time was used up by an opposition member, there has to be an order about these things. There was an order of business set down. There were people here ready to speak. The member for Bowman( Mrs West) had been here ready to speak after the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro). The member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith) and the member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Nairn) are here now as people listed to speak on that bill. We simply cannot run this chamber in any other way. To come in and ambush the government-and it was an ambush-and also ambush the then occupant of the chair, who was me, brings the entire operation of this committee into disrepute. When I moved this motion of dissent, somebody raised a question about whether those standing orders applied in this committee. The simple answer is that except where there are particular points of order specific to this chamber then the standing orders and the procedures of the House of Representatives apply in this chamber. The standing orders have lots and lots of gaps in them. They do not cover every little eventuality that can arise, but over time the collective wisdom of a variety of speakers has set down a procedure. That procedure is as I outlined it at the beginning and is the reason why I moved this motion of dissent from your ruling. The procedure is that if the person in the chair makes an error, they can choose to change the call. They can also choose to not change the call, and I have seen that happen too. You made a deliberate decision not to change the call and call the member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew). I had been in a not dissimilar situation in the chair some time earlier.

I understand that the member for Wakefield is seconding my motion. that I have the speakers list in front of me and the only two speakers who had not spoken were the member for Scullin and the member for Moore. The member for Moore was not in the chamber so I called the member for Scullin. There were no other speakers on the list that I have.

Mr Leo McLeay-That is the trap that you have all fallen into. You cannot put an unresolved question because the rules for this placeMrs Sullivan-Point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Watson is attempting to claim that by virtue of a matter being an unresolved question he can continue in whatever vein he likes. CanI point out to you that there is a precedent on this. The precedent was the member for Werriwa, as I recall, who said to the then occupant of the chair, 'I can do whatever I damn well please up here.' For his trouble he got named, he contested, and went on doing whatever he damn well pleased because the naming motion-",155,Representatives Main Commiitee

382,Honourable Members Interjecting,"Thursday, 26 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 6521 in the committee. I am relying on advices, but I would appreciate it if some time would be allowed for this to take place. Mrs SullivanMr Deputy Speaker, I just point out for your sake that on that previous occasion the question was not capable of being resolved here and, therefore, it was impossible for the Deputy Speaker to establish what his rights were. That is the position you are in at the moment about whether you have the right to call the member for Scullin( Mr Jenkins). What happened on that occasion was that the Deputy Speaker suspended the sitting of the committee to allow the question of moment, that is, who speaks next in this place, to be determined by the House. I advise you to follow that precedent set on that occasion by the Deputy Speaker, the member for Cowper. I suggest that you take it on yourself to suspend the sitting of the chamber to enable the issue to be resolved in the House. Mr Kelvin Thomson-Point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The item before this House is the report on small business and fair trading issues, a most important report. It is outrageous that the government is seeking to gag debate on this most important question by a variety of parliamentary devices, which have no place in the Main Committee. This is a proper forum for the debate of reports which we, as opposition members and, indeed, which government members are entitled to debate. unresolved and will be referred to the House as an unresolved question. There being no quorum, I suspend the sitting. Sitting suspended from 12.18 p.m. to 12.30 p.m. Committee stands adjourned until a time to be determined by Mr Deputy Speaker. Main Committee adjourned at 12.30 p.m.",156,Representatives Main Committee
