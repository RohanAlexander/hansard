Tuesday, 17 March, 1958. Mr SrJSAxEK (Eon. Archie Cameron) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. MR. D. J. ODKTIN, M.P. honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) was ordered to: withdraw from the House under the provisions of Standing Order 303, and was ordered to leave the premises. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) moved a motion of dissent. A vote of the House negatived the motion of dissent thus endorsing the Speaker's action. As previously reported to this HouseI saw thc honourable member in King's Hall during luncheon time on Friday. His presence there was during the period of withdrawal that is mentioned in the standing order, namely, the remainder of tlio day's sitting. By pntering King's Hall, the honourable member disobeyed an order of. the House. Disobedience of ah order of the House is contempt of the House. The fifteenth edition of May's Parliamentary Practice, at page 111, states as follows:Disobedience of the orders nf eitlier House whetber sneh orders are of general application",9,Setup
1,Mr Speaker,"On Friday last theor require a particular individual to do, or abstain from doing, a particular act, or contravention of any rules of either House, is a contempt of that House. At this point I might mention that the control of the whole area of the King's Hal l is administered by Mr Speaker with the President of the Senate. The honor-* able member for Watson did not seek the permission of Mr Speaker to re-enter the building. Contempt of the House is a serious matter. For the preservation of the dignity of this House matters of alleged affront must be given serious consideration. Further, the House makes its own rules and orders and it follows that it should seo that those rules and orders are obeyed. The power of the House to punish its members for' contempt is beyond dispute. It may accept his apology, or the offender may be reprimanded or admonished, committed, suspended or expelled. I have given the House the facts of this matter. I have alleged that contempt of the House has been committed, and the matter is uow in the hands of the House itself. instance an opportunity should have been given to the honourable member for Watson to be heard. I should l i i e to formally record my protest against a statement affecting an honourable member before there has been any investigation of the facts of the matter. honourable gentleman, moving a motion, because otherwise his discourse is not in order ? mitted a report to the House and I submit that the honorablo member for Watson should be given an opportunity to speak in the first instance. Mr OuitTiK' I desire to make a personal explanation on this matter. desire to refer to the proceedings in the House on Friday last when you, Mr Speaker, directed me to withdraw from the House during the remainder of the day's sitting. I voluntarily withdrew from the House on your instruction to me to do so. I have always believed that yon had no power to'exclude any honourable member from the parliamentary building. I was informed that an objection to your ruling had been raised by the Leader of the Opposition by way of a motion of dissent. Before the question was decided i h the HouseI entered the Senate side of the parliamentary building believing, as I still believe, that 1 your power under Standing Order 303 does not extend there. I saw you at the Senate side of the King's Hall while you were proceeding to luncheon after the sitting of the House had been suspended. You did not inform me then of the decision of thc House, and no message was sent to me from you or f r om any official. Shortly after I saw you t received, through the Opposition Whip, a message from the Leader of the Opposition that the House had not upheld the submissions of the ' Opposition, and that, therefore, it was proper that i . should withdraw from the parliamentary buildings altogether, and raise thc question, if necessary, at a later time. I wish that to be noted by all honourable members. I immediately acted on that advice, left the building, and returned to Sydney. I certainly did not intend any contempt of thc House or of your authority as Speaker, and in the circumstances I ask the House to accept my explanation. I acted throughout in good faith and in accordance with what I believe to be my rights as a member and my duty to this House. Hr. EBIC J. HARRISON (Wentworth -Vice-President of thc Executive Council) [2.36] I move' That thc Houso is of opinion that contempt of its ruling and authority has token place by thc honourable meniber for Watson. In view of the honourable member's explanation and in view of the motion that I have just submitted, the Government would like certain action to be taken I by thc House in order to place on record the fact that the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) has been guilty of contempt of the House and its rules. read the motion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J.

The motion as I now have it written down readsThat the House is of opinion that contempt of its ruling ancl authority has taken place by the honourable member for Watson. Opposition) [2.39] I submit that the House should reject this motion. In a case of contempt, whether contempt of court or of the Parliament, it is usual that the contempt should be specified. ""What is the contempt in this case, and was the lionorable member guiltv of any contempt? I am not speaking now of the ruling of Mr Speaker, because his ruling is not an order of the House. The authorities that Mr Speaker has given to honourable members to-day are not concerned with a direct order of the House. It is only if the House of Bepresentatives, as such, gives some order, that there can be contempt of its authority. Eor the support of actions taken by Mr Speaker, all we have is the authority of the Standing Orders. By what standing order is this matter governed? order covers it. The honourable member for ""Watson( Mr Curtin) has stated the position quite frankly. He was directed by Mr Speaker to withdraw from the House on Friday. In giving that direcStanding Order 303. The debate that subsequently took place, which lasted almost until the suspension of the sitting for lunch, related to whether Mr Speaker's authority extended sufficiently far to enable him to exclude the honourable member for ""Watson from the parliamentary building. The House in the end upheld the ruling of Mr Speaker and refused to agree to the motion of dissent therefrom. I should like to remind the House that it is well known, because of an incident that took place in the House a week before, that had the ruling been disaffirmed, the action against the honourable inember for Watson would have been beyond the power of Mr Speaker. When the decision was given by the House on the motion for dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling, if, as Mr Speaker has said, it was an order of the House, it should have been communicated With all respect to you, Mr Speaker, the honourable member should have been directed to be present during the debate on the motion for dissent, as I suggested to the House during the debate on Friday, because the question then before the House was whether Mr Speaker had authority to do what he did. Had the House refused to endorse the orcier of Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Watson would have been improperly removed from the House by order of Mr Speaker. How was contempt of the House committed? As the honorahle nnemiber for Watson has frankly stated, it is perfectly true that he came into the parliamentary building in the belief that he was not disentitled to the use of the Senate side of the building. I shall not enter upon a detailed argument of that matter. I understand that the view taken by the Senate is very strongly against honourable gentleman may not refer to the procedure of the Senate. the procedure of the Senate.

Sir PHIL IP McBKIDE -They have no authority over the members of the House of Representatives. over that part of the building which they control. They take a view which is contrary to the view taken by Mr House of the action that has been taken. Speaker. We know of instances in which the order of Mr Speaker and the actions of the officers of the House under it have not been supported. I come back to the question of contempt. Before contempt can be committed an lionorable member must be judged guilty of wilful contempt. No mention is made in the motion of when or where the alleged contempt of the honourable member for Watson took place, how it took place or what it amounted to. Never has such a motion previously been moved in any parliament in the Britisih Commonwealth. Yet on such a motion we are asked to make a general direction. It is elementary that before an honourable inember can be guilty of contempt there must be wilful disobedience of an order. That could not have taken place until the decision of the House relating to your ruling had been communicated to and was known by the honourable member for Watson. You, Mr Speaker,. saw the honourable member in King's Hall, as you reported to the House, but you did not inform him of the ruling of the House. That is the important point in relation to what had happened only a couple of hours before. The honourable member should have been told that, because of the ruling of the House, it was required that he should withdraw. As he was not informed of tlie decision, he has not been guilty of wilful contempt. As no prima facie case has been established against him, the Opposition cannot support this motion which has been couched in such a vague way, and which involves such an important matter, and therefore we shall vote against it. Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [2.45] The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has not done the cause of his colleague any good by telling tke kind of story that he has just put to this House. He has indulged in a set of legal quibbles which, if anything, would be calculated to stir resentment against the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) rather than to provide an objective appreciation by honourable members on both sides of the If any confirmation of the propriety of the terms of the motion moved by the Vice President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) was required, it was provided by the statement of the honourable inember for Watson himself. What has been alleged in the terms of the motion is not a wilful contempt, and the Leader of the Opposition is much too good a lawyer not to appreciate the difference between the fact of contempt and the fact of wilful contempt. The legal decisions of this country bristle with instances in whicli people without any guilty mind in the legal sense have been adjudged guilty of contempt of a court of law, or even of this Parliament. The motion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council refers to contempt. There can be no doubt whatever on the fact of contempt, which has been not only admitted by the honorablo member for Watson but also accepted in substance by the Leader of the Opposition. Upon learning that the honourable member for Watson was in the precincts after tbe House had decided that he should be excluded from the precincts, the Leader of the Opposition made' arrangements for the Opposition Whip to go to the honourable member ancl point out to him that his action was, in effect, in contempt of a decision of the House. gentleman told him of the decision. that, if the honourable member knew the decision of the House and acted contrary to that decision, he was in fact in contempt of the House. The Leader of the Opposition knows sufficient of the discussion that has taken place on this matter between the Vice President of the Executive Council and his own representative to be aware that honourable members on this side of the",14,Tuesday 17 March 1953

17,Mr Holt,"Yes, and he knows wellHouse were prepared to accept an apology from the honourable member for Watson. They were prepared to accept his word that he had acted without any wilful desire to be in contempt of this House, and this fact was made known to the honourable member himself and to the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr The honourable member was outside the Calwell). 'Consequently, in proposing the Emotion which is now before the House, what the Vice-President of the Executive Council has in mind is that the authority of the House and the authority of the Chair shall be maintained. Undoubtedly tliere has been action in contempt of the House That fact should be frankly .recognized ajid the records should be put straight. I am sure that the House, having accepted the view that contempt has occurred, would be prepared to accept also the statement of the honourable member for Watson that he did not commit such contempt wilfully, together with an expression of his regret. I am certain that every fair-minded member of the House would be happy to accept his assurance and let the matter rest there. However, instead of handling the matter in that clear and straightforward manner, the Leader of the Opposition has engaged in a series of legal quibbles which merely eonfuse the issue. What we on this side of the House want to do is assert the authority of the Parliament and the a-uthority of the Chair. If a contempt has occurred, either wittingly or unwittingly, the authority of the House and the authority of the Chair must he supported on that point. If , however, we receive from the honourable member for Watson his assurance that, if contempt has occurred, it has occurred unwittingly and from no wilful design on his part, I , for one, and other honourable members on this side of the HouseI am sure, would be happy to let the matter drop at that point. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that this is sound counsel which he and his colleagues should adopt. The trouble is that there are too many sanctuary where he could find it. lawyers in the Cabinet. If the position The President of the Senate, like some had been left where it was originally, I of the venerable archbishops of old, gave think the House wonld have been satisfied -him sanctuary, and neither you, Mr and we should have been able to overSpeaker, -nor anybody else in this chamber come this trouble with very little diffiraised any further questions about culty. Unfortunately, there has been insistence upon the fact that the House must declare the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) guilty of contempt before it hears him and, as the honourable -member has said, without his having been officially advised of its decision. House, waiting for the result. As soon as he had heard the result, he went away.' Fou, Mr Speaker, saw him there. You reported him to the House as having been present, and immediately cited him for contempt. That seems to us to be a reversal of the procedure generally followed in relation to persons charged with offences. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) told us the other night when he was ordered out by you on one famous occasion, you very kindly sent him a note and told him to go home. No such consideration was extended to the honourable member for Watson. It seemed that there was a chase of the honourable gentleman, because not only was Tie expelled from the House but also he was to be dealt with further. It looked like a blood hunt. picturesque language. member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) is not entitled to reflect on the House. He must understand that very clearly. the attitude of members of the Cabinet to this matter. I am not speaking of the action of the House, because no action has been taken by the House on the contempt charge. On one occasion, the honourable member for East Sydney offended against your ruling and was ordered out of fhe House. When he Tiad left the chamber he sought sanctuary immediately in the -Senate portion of the building. He remembered his history of the middle ages, and he sought",15,Tuesday 17 March 1953

22,Mr Calwell,"I am talking aboutalleged contempt by tbe bonorable member. Tbere is no precedent to govern a case of this kind. We are making precedent to-day. The honourable member for Watson has been found guilty in advance and has been brought forward for sentence. Presumably, after he has been sentenced, he will be given an opportunity to apologize. To the members of the Opposition, that is wrong. We say, with due respect, that Standing Order 308 was never intended to be used in the way in which it is being used. I submit that Standing Order 303 is not under discussion. The House is dealing only with the question of contempt. contempt can be involved in a disobedience of an addition by Mr Speaker to Standing Order 303. All that the standing order states is that an honourable member dealt with under its provisions sliall withdraw. The Senate has a standing order on this matter. It is completely lost its effectiveness. The sooner it is disdifTerent from our standing order, and is much more explicit. cannot be discussed now. Orders of the Senate cannot be discussed, we can discuss the authority of the officers of this House in pursuit of a member of the House. I believe that authority in the Parliament is divided between the President of the Senate and the Speaker of this House. Speaker's authority does not extend beyond a. certain point, and the authority of the President does not extend beyond a certain point. If either the President or the Speaker sends his officers beyond that point, those officers are transgressing Therefore, the House should be placed the authority of the other chamber. There has been no decision by the Senate yet that the authority of the Speaker extends beyond a point half way across King's Hall. under discussion. if a man found on the Senate side of the huilding is held by this chamber to be in contempt. In the view of the Opposition, there could be no contempt once the honourable member had passed beyond a certain point. But the honorahle member for Watson says, in effect, "" Well, I did not pass beyond that point because I wanted to be contemptuous of the authority of the House of Bepresentatives; I merely crossed over to the other side of the House, outside what I believed to be the authority of the House of Representatives, to await its verdict. When I found what had been done to me, I immediately withdrew"". I consider that the reasonable course, in all the circumstances, when the honourable member made the explanation, was for the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) to move that it be accepted, or ask for such addition to the explanation as would satisfy the amour propre of this chamber. But to carry on an argument of this sort, when there are so many more important things to be done, is, in my view, no compliment to this chamber, and proves still further that this House has solved, the better. -Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [2.56] -in replyI would not have taken part in this debate if it had not been for the observations of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

That statement moves me to tell the honourable gentleman that the House cannot be aware of the circumstances of which he speaks unless it is made aware of them. in a position to enable it to understand the matter.

So, we decided pursuance that the matter, instead of being covered pursuant to this Standing Order shall not by one motion in which the honourable return during the same sitting except by member's apology would be accepted, permission of the Speaker or Chairman. should be dealt with by two motions, one I say no more than that you conformed of which would relate to the contempt of to that standing order.

Let us examine the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. First, he has said that this motion is not framed in what he considers legal terms. I may have referred to your ruling, Mr Speaker, under Standing Order 303, and to the incidents that happened in the House, but I am not interested in legal jargon. I am. interested only in stating the case as I see it , and as the House sees and underthe honourable stands it . Therefore, I make no apology for the wording of the motion. The Leader of the Opposition challenges your I do autliority as representing this House.

41,Dr. Evatt,"I have been personallyhonorable gentleman may not use the word "" untruth "" in that way. incorrect. The view expressed by the lionorable member for Melbourne to the Vice-President of the Executive Council was that the Opposition would not be a party to a double-barrelled resolution adjudging the honourable member for Watson guilty of contempt and accepting an apology from him, because we take the view that there was no contempt. I submit that the position has heen completely misrepresented by the Vice President of the Executive Council. personal explanation. The position outlined by the Vice-President of the Executive Council is factual to a point, but at a certain point there is a divergence. WhatI agreed to with the right honourable gentleman ultimately, after a number of conversations involving a variety of changes of words and everything else, was that there should be a resolution to be submitted in two parts, one of them criticizing and condemning the honourable member for Watson-and 1 advised him that the Opposition would vote against that contempt resolution. After that, the honourable member for Watson would make an explanation and submit an apology. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said that the Oovernment would accept the apology. He then said to me ""Well, able member is leaving out one point, which referred to the matter of debating this issue. I consider I have been misrepresented because of the failure of the Vice President of the Executive Council to state the whole facts clearly. He said to me, "" The Government will -separate the resolution into two parts, provided that there is no debate on the motion relating to contempt"". I said, "" I shall have to consult my leader on that matter, and 1 -shall report back to you"". I discussed the matter with the Leader of the 'Opposition, who said, "" I must debate that point "". I went to the Vice-President of the Executive Council and said to him, '-' The Leader of the Opposition is going to debate the motion regarding contempt "". The Viee-President of the Executive Council then said to me, "" I will now put the two motions in one "". I said, "" Very well, that will have to be the position "". That is where the matter rests. There was no arrangement under which the honourable member for Watson was to rise. He rose of his own volition, without any prior arrangement on the part of anybody, and to suggest a breach of faith on my part in connection with any dealings with the Leader of the Opposition or any negotiations that I had with the Vice-President of the Executive Council after having consulted with the Leader of the Opposition, is wrong. I wish to get the record straight. I have no feeling in the matter. I have told the House the complete truth of the negotiations, and I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council would have been well advised to omit this question of negotiations and other personal matters from the debate, because they ai'e not helping the House to deal clearly .and fairly with the position. His -misrepresentation of my position, and the position of the Leader of the Opposition, is objected to strongly by my leader and myself. a personal explanation. The honourable member for Melbourne has revealed -a "" certain amount of information, and certainly misrepresented me when he did not give the full facts. He accused me of agreeing to move one motion and then submitting two. The honourable member for Melbourne arranged with me that there should be only one statement made, and that it should ike made in the words that have already been spoken by the honourable member for Watson, and no more than those. Tho bargain was that the honourable .member for Watson should apologize to the House. The hoaiorable member for Melbourne misrepresented me by accusing me of not adhering to the arrangements.

Is it true that untilrecently the Government has been selling large quantities of clothing and equipment used in the last war to disposals stores throughout Australia? Is it also true that during the last three months government agents have visited disposals stores and have re-purchased, at considerably increased prices, uniforms, haversacks, tents and much other material for use in the training of national service trainees? If these are facts, why did not the Government, when it submitted, the National Service Bill to the Parliament, realize that it. would be necessary to use equipment which was subsequently sold but which it was later compelled to re-purchase at higher prices ?. sort in the newspapers some time ago. To the best of my knowledge the assertions are untrue.

Both Governments weve anxious that the industvy should be maintained, but. neither was willing to take any pavt in it as a principal. ThenI approached the Victorian Flax Growers Association and .also the Austvalian flax spinners. I pvoposed on behalf of the Govevnment that these two groups, representatives of producers and processors, should form a company to take over the mills and maintain the industiy. I made it clear that the Govevnment would be prepared to dispose of the mills to such an organization at a reasonable price and to make financial arrangements of a nature which such an organization could be expected to be able to meet. On this pvoposal of mine, the Victorian Flax 'Growers Association and the Australian flax spinners spent a considerable .amount of time in trying, to evolve a proposal fov submission to the Government. The idea was to form a company representative of the two groups and make an offer fov a selected number of mills. Unfortunately, despite long and serious consideration of the matter, they found tliemselves unable to formulate any satisfactory proposal which they were prepared to submit to the Government. It will be seen that :both this Govern: ment and the Chifley Government have made every effort to dispose of the industry, but without success. The industry is far too important in onr defence preparations for us to allow it to disappear so we ave forced to find some way of ensuring its continuance. That is the reason fov this bill. The flax industvy must be retained in Australia because flax fibre is an important raw material in the manufacture of equipment fov the . fighting services. Aeroplane fabric, parachute harness, hangar canvas, gun and boat covers, five hose, tents ancl othev camp equipment, yarns and twines for cordage, ancl all linen sewing thread for boots and uniforms fov the sevvices are made fvom this essential' fibve, fov which no effective substitute has yet been found. During Wovld WarI . , the flax industvy was established in Australia to help meet the wav needs of the British Empire for flax fibre. At the end of that war, the production of flax in Austvalia was practically discontinued in spite of various attempts by private interests to carry on this industvy. In Wovld Wav II . , there was again .an acute shortage of flax fibre, and in June, 1940, the British Government made an urgent appeal for the sowing of as much flax as possible in Australia. By 1942 over 60,000 acres of flax was under cultivation in Austvalia. This vapid expansion to meet pressing -war requirements involved the expendituve of some hundreds of thousands of pounds in the establishment of -mills to process the flax straw. There was no time fov the careful planning which was required to put the industry on a sound commercial basis, and flax was sown in some areas which weve not entirely suitable. Farmers with -little experience in the growing of flax undertook its production as an urgent war measure, and there were no properly trained operatives available for the processing of the straw, with the result that our costs of production weve vevy high during the early war years. This was the price Australia had to pay for its failure to maintain tliis industry after Worid WarI . to meet its defence requirements.",26,Flaxindustrybill 1953 Second Beading

90,Mr Pollard (Lalor) '[3.56],"Thiscontained in section 15of the act. and gives to the Minister some authority over the board with respect to the licensing of agents to export apples and pears. It has come to my notice from time to time that people who are well equipped financially and by experience to engage in the export of apples and pears have been refused permission by the board to act as its agents. The power which is vested in the board in this respect is very great, and it could be abused. Some people who established businesses during the last war, and by virtue of the war-time conditions enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the field, were able to expand their organizations to a considerable degree. They have become firmly established, and resist a newcomer who wishes to enter tlieir preserve. I hope that the House is not in-favour of the establishment of monopolistic organizations, and will not approve the granting to marketing authorities, such as the Australian Apple and Pear Board, of dictatorial powers over business establishments. Parliament should not vest in an outside body the power to create a monopoly which, in its essence, may be called socialistic, unless the Minister of tbe day can exercise control such as has been conferred on him in the Apple and Pear Organization Act 1938. It may be desirable, from the standpoint of the board, to confine export activities to a comparatively small number of agents, but we should ask ourselves whether this Parliament should grant the board the power of life and death over an enterprising individual who desires to enter the field. If the Parliament desires that to be done, I suggest that the only authority that should be vested with that power should be a government department. Either the Government lets everybody in, or it does not let anybody in. If it lets everybody in as an exporter, then the only conditions should be that the exporters shall be finansupport, in some degree, the honourable cially strong enough to conduct their busimember for Lalor( Mr Pollard). The nesses and they should have to give every guarantee to the export authority that tbey are commercially experienced arid are capable of doing a good job and of dealing in a thoroughly honest manner with their clients here and in other parts of the world. I should be Mr PoUard. the last person not to pay a tribute to the Apple and Pear Export Control Board. In both war and peace it has done a magnificent job nnder great difliculty, labouring always under uninformed and ill-informed public criticism. Undoubtedly, however, the danger will exist if that authority is placed in a position when it, and it alone, can decide whether a party or parties may enter into a certain line of business in this so-called free Australia. Until now, the Minister himself has had a veto power. If a business firm complained to him that any authority had refused it a licence the Minister himself, under the existing legislation, had the power to veto the decision of that authority so as to ensure that the business concerned received a licence. When I was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture some years ago it came to my attention on occasions that some people had been refused licences by such authorities, and I dealt with these matters This on their merits. At least in those days the individuals concerned had the right to appeal to the Minister, who could consider the case impartially. On several occasions I vetoed decisions of the authorities concerned. I acted as the representative of the people in the Parliament. I was the autliority to whom people who considered they were the victims, of injustice could appeal for protection. The Minister has not gone so far in this bill as he did in other bills to rob himself, as Minister, of the trust that the public expects him to hold, and therefore the Opposition will not oppose the measure. I point out, however, the clangers inherent in this measure in that it proposes to remove tlie veto control from tbe Minister who is responsible to the Parliament, which is responsible to the people. Apple and Pear Export Control Board with which the bill deals will probably be confused in the minds of some people with the Apple and Pear Marketing Board which existed as an interim authority during the war, the establishment of which, as the honourable member for Lalor",28,Apple And Pear Organization Bill 1953 Second Reading
91,Mr Brown (Mcmillan) [4.3],"I will remember, I supported although it was bitterly opposed by other people engaged in the f r u it industry. The Apple and Pear Export Control Board is in a curious position. Under the legislation that established it , which the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) introduced in 1938 when he was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, the board has no power to buy and sell apples or pears, and no power in relation to any materials used in the preparation of f r u it for the market. The board is not only having a difficult time at present, but is also faced with a difficult time because in the last ten years the acreage under apples has been reduced from 105,000 to 84,000, whilst the nation's population has risen from 6,000,000 to nearly 9,000,000 in the same period. That means that more of our apple crop is consumed in Australia than was previously the case ancl only Tasmania and ""Western Australia export a great quantity of the f r u it now. United Kingdom on three occasions before the war that it was essential to have a rationalized system of delivery of our f r u it to Great Britain, which is our principal market. hope fruit-growers w ill be able to in fluence shipping companies in order to achieve a properly regulated delivery to Britain. In addition to its functions in relation to markets and research and the achievement of a regular shipping programme, the board has important function, that of controlling the issue of licences to export, without which people cannot export apples or pears. In that connection I sound exactly the same note of warning as the honourable member for Lalor has sounded. growers have a majority of representatives on the board, which includes also the representatives would not be unfair of me to suggest that those shippers, who have established a large business over the years, would look carefully at newcomers who applied for licences to export. I think that the honourable member for Lalor and the Minister realize the difficulties that have arisen in that direction. Personally, I consider that the board is immensely valuable as a research body. As I have said, it has no power to engage in marketing itself. I consider that it should ultimately be continued only as a research body and that the granting of licences to ship, if such a system is considered desirable, should be administered by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture itself. In 1931, one gentleman shipped my f r u it on consignment, which meant that he acted as my agent, and I was to receive the whole of the proceeds. I received only l d . in the £1 for the f r u it . I consider that the system of licensing is desirable in the f r u it industry, which has some undesirable fringes both here and at the receiving end in London. The Minister might be wise to consider vesting his department with the control of licensing which is now in the hands of tbe board. The board's value could be quite well maintained if it operated as a research body. SouthA f r i c a has a similar board which controls exports of f r u it from that dominion. It operates differently from the Australian board, I discovered when I visited the however, in that it underwrites the whole of the shipping space overseas and grants its licences in the same way as it grants shipping space-that is, only to those whom it knows to be reputable persons Ultimately I with sufficient financial stability to meet their responsibilities. I commend the bill. Thef r u it industry, of which I have been a leader for more than 25 years, long ago asked that ministerial discretion should be withdrawn. I hope that ultimately the granting of licences w ill another become a function of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. [4.10] -This measure w ill commend itself to the House.

Its work is not sufficiently recognized. My remarks at this stage are directed to ensuring that the",29,Apple And Pear Organization Bill 1953 Second Reading
92,Mr Drtjmmokd ('New England),"Apple and Pear Export Control Boardshall not be dealing with a diminishing product. I am concerned because, owing to the trend of prices, costs and other factors that have entered intothe production of apples and pears in New South Wales, particularly in its relation to war service land settlement in my own electorate, the board may be dealing with a diminishing industry. This community needs increased quantities of fruit. One of the factors which operate against increased production of fruit at the present time is that in the early days of war service land settlement the areas provided were wrongly conceived in that they allowed only a sniall orchard. No provision was made for the fact that young people growing up would require fruit-growing areas for themselves on which they could use the techniques that they had learned from their fathers, who had learned themthe hard way. That factor has militated against the growth of the industry, at least in New South Wales, scru'tiuized. Orchard development by the Commonwealth and State governments in relation to war service land settlement should be investigated, and isprobably being investigated. Another factor which has militated against mcreased production of apples and pears in New South Wales is that, many orchards that were planted after World WarI . are deteriorating. These orchards arefrom 30 to 3-5 years old. People who had ; experience, and have applied it, offset that deterioration by growing amongst the trees green crops which are ploughed in, and by the useof fertilizers. Those measuresmaintain) the life of the tree andi the rate of production,, and, which is infinitely more important,, the quality of the fruit.

I am strongly of the opinion that quite apart from experimental farms where intensive research takes place, in most branches of our administration we need units to show farmers the advantages of proved new methods and to ascertain a,reas where research could be better used than inone or more settlements of ex-servicemen. I have mentioned the Kentucky settlement merely as a case in point because there 13 a large number of people settled. on> the land there. I suggest that it would be unfortunate if new farming methods were not brought before settlers in many other districts'.. State authorities have, to a point,, recognized the necessity for larger areas than they originally contemplated, but when we consider the work of the Australian Apple and Pear Board we must en-su-re that if possible its administrative field shall be continually 1 enlarged. It must expand its activities, not only in therciiterests-of our export and should be ca-refullymarkets, but al'so in the interests of our own people to whom a reasonable supply of fruit at reasonable prices is-an essential for good health.

I also thank the honorahle member for MeMillan( Mr Brown) for his contribution, made out of the wealth of his experience as an acknowledged leader of the fruit industry in Australia over a long period of years. I believe that the honourable member for Lalor( Mr The only policy purpose of this particular Pollard) was labouring under some misapprehension when he suggested that themeasure is designed, amongst other things, to reduce the degree of ministerial authority over tlie board. I correct that misapprehensionand inform him that the bill will not diminish the authority of the Minister one iota because he has a very minimum of authority at present over the board. Mr Po.rx.tnn -Any authority that theMinisteidoes have will be reduced. is a reference in the pri-Ji'cipal act to the Ministerbeing empowered to issue a notice in the Gazette.. That will be limited. not gazette powers or does not make regulations, then any authority mentioned by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture will not operate. of the legal authorities on that matter, and I am sure that the words in the measure to which the honourable member for Lalor has referred are not the result of any policy direction by the Government, but are the outcome of a legal consideration that the provisions enabling the Minister to gazette certain things were necessary in the early stages of the Australian Apple and Pear Board, but have been of no use for some years.. Tbe legal authorities believe that there is nothing for the Minister now to gazette. gazette new regulations, under the principal act, the Minister ean. disapprove. him that power to disapprove. that is not so, but if necessary I shall clarify the matter at the committee stage of the bill. If the honourable member for Lalor will remind me about the matter, I shall make a specific statement on the point. My second-reading speech made it quite clear that this bill was not the outcome of policy recommendations. The parliamentary draf tsmen merely took an opportunity to bring the measure up to date. part of the measure is to avoid a process of circumlocution necessary under the principal act. It has been necessary for years,, not only for the Australian Apple and Pear Board, but for other boards, when dealing, with approval of conditions for the appointment of staff and approval of conditions for the variation of the tennis of appointment of staff,, to consult the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, the Public Service Board, and the Treasury in order to get regulations drafted.. That has been most unsatisfactory, and the principal act will now be amended by this measure so that the terms and conditions of appointment and continuance of the service of staff, will become a matter of agreement between the Australian Apple and Pear Board and the Public Service Board. That has been provided for no reason other than to maintain a standard of uniformity between the staff conditions in statutory bodies and the staff conditions under the Public Service Board. The broad function of the Australian Apple and Pear Board is to engage hi activities in relation to marketing, research and shipping arrangements, and also to recommend the granting of export licences, because noone is permitted ta export witbout a licence.. The board will not own, sell or market fruit at all. It is one of the boards in which the Minister has very little authority on his own motion. That state of affairs was established in 1938, and although the bill was amended at the instance of the honourable meniber for Lalor in 194T and in 1948, he did not elect to take power for the Minister on either of those occasions. The honorThe measure will take from able member for Lalor said that he had been compelled, on several occasions in the past, toveto decisions of the board.

There has never been any authority for the Minister to veto decisions of the board established under the Apple and Pear Organization Act. I have experienced difficulties of judgment in this matter, and I have felt the absence of authority, but tbe history of the export of fresh fruit shows that on occasions our reputation overseas bas been impaired because people inexperienced in the business have shipped fruit to overseas markets and the fruit has arrived at inopportune times, has been badly freighted, or has been unsuitable to the particular trade. The honourable member for McMillan has also illustrated how dishonest people have operated to the detriment of the fruit-growers. Eor instance, he said that on one occasion he had received one penny for every pound's worth of fruit he consigned. On several occasions, agents who were not financially strong enough have undertaken to ship on consignment or to buy fruit and pay for it later, and have left the growers lamenting. If a grower is doing business in a nearby market town he is usually not bitten more than once, but it is a serious thing for a grower to send a whole year's production to an outside market and discover many months later that he will not get anything for his fruit. The experience of responsible merchants, growers, and governments has shown that there should be an authority to ensure that the reputation of our fruit and the interests of tbe growers are not impaired by dishonest, inexperienced or financially weak shippers. Therefore, this board has been chosen as the authority to ensure that persons who want to export fruit must have a licence to do so. That bill was originally drafted to shall consider this week, the problem that give the Minister power to issue a licence was raised last week again emerges. on the recommendation of the Australian What should be the status of the Public Apple and Pear Board. That was done Service Board in relation to agencies of because it has been shown legally that a this kind? I put it to the committee Minister cannot issue a licence unless he that at some stage we shall have to receives a recommendation from, the Ausreconcile existing practice with the desire tralian Apple and Pear Board. When on the part of certain agencies, such as I first assumed oflice I discovered that marketing organizations, to be entirely licences were not being recommended in respect of shippers who, I believed, should have a licence. I mention the Tasmanian Fruit Board as an instance. That is a State statutory authority which handles the produce of hundreds, or even thousands, of growers, but the Australian Apple and Pear Board was not prepared to recommend that a licence be issued to it. I decided to give that State authority a licence, but then found that I did not have the power to do so. I reasoned witli the Australian Apple and Pear Board, and ultimately the board made an appropriate recommendation. The only alternative is for a hard-pressed Minister or his department, rather remote and scarcely equipped to judge whether individual prospective shippers are suitable persons to ship, to issue licences or for the Minister to superimpose his judgment upon that of the board. After a not too smooth experience with the board I say now that the acceptance of the advice of a reasonable board is the better course to take. If tbe board proved to be unreasonable this Government or any other government would take appropriate action in the interests of the people. Another purpose of this measure is to streamline the conditions upon which staff may be appointed by the board itself. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

102,Ture ( Mr Mcewen) Has Explained That,"free of traditional control and supervision by the Public Service Board. I do not contend that the staff of the Australian Apple and Pear Board should he under the supervision of the Public Service Board because I do not know whether that would be desirable. What we expect from Public Service Board control, and what we have been trying to ensure in all the operations of government, is that a government department or activity will be staffed by only a sufficient number of persons to work it efficiently and that the staff will be drawn from the class of persons most capable of performing the duties which confront them. I u this bil] we are robbing ourselves of that protection. The clause provides that staff shall be appointed by the Australian Apple and Pear Board under such terms and conditions as the Public Service Board may prescribe. That power could be used to veto appointments to the staff by the Australian Apple and Pear Board. The clause could also rob us of the protection of ensuring that the wovk is organized in the most efficient possible way. In connection with organizations of the character that we are now discussing I have felt that the Government should adopt the practice it adopts in connection with financial measures. When the pavliament is asked to pass a measure for the provision of finance a certificate must be given by the Treasuver that the amount sought is necessaiy fov the purpose of the measure. When we are dealing with an organization such as this provision should be made for the issue of a certificate by che Public Service Board, a body which the Govevnmpiit recognizes as an authority in organization matters, stating that it is the prescribed ? kind of organization which is most capable of pevfovming the functions which the organization is designed to achieve. The Government relies upon the Public Service Board for control of staffs covering the ordinary functional activities of government, but in respect of organizations of this kind it departs from that practice. At one stage or another, I hope that the Government will consider whether or not an entirely different technique should be adopted in relation to measures of this kind. Before the Parliament is asked to consider organizations such as those provided in measures that will be discussed this week, it should insist that the proposals have been vetted by the Public Service Board, which should issue certificates that the proposed organizations will most effectively discharge the functions which they are called upon to undertake.

I am well aware that similar provision has been included in measures that were placed upon the statute-book during the regime of the Labour Government. In certain circumstances it was necessary to provide that an authority may bank witb a bank other than the Commonwealth Bank. The Australian Apple and Pear Board has managed very well so far by relying almost exclusively on the facilities provided by the Commonwealth Bank. I should like to know why the amendment is necessary unless the Minister has it in mind that the board should use a bank other than the Commonwealth Bank.

Debate resumed from the 12th March (vide page 958), on motion by Mr which, on the face of it at any rate, will Ho.LTThat the bill be now read a second time. bill seeks to amend the Seamen's Compensation Act 191.1-1949. Insofar as it will improve compensation payments to seamen, the Opposition naturally supports it. The adequacy of the proposed scale of payments, however, is another matter. For the purposes of debate, the bill may be divided into two parts. One part consists of proposed amendments of the principal act which will clarify definitions and will re-arrange certain sections in order to remove ambiguity. No objection is raised to these provisions. However, I direct the attention of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) to clause 4, which provides that section 5AA of the principal act shall be replaced by a new section 5AA, which will limit the compensation payable to a seaman who suffers personal injury by accident while travelling to or from a mercantile marine office. The existing section is not so restrictive as the proposed new section. I hope that the Minister will attempt to explain the reason for this alteration. Section 5AA of the act now provides that compensation shall be payable to a seaman who suffers personal injury by accident while he is travelling to or from his place of employment, a mercantile marine office, or a place which it is necessary for him to attend to obtain a medical certificate or to receive medieal, surgical or hospital treatment or compensation in respect of a previous injury. The Government now proposes, apparently, that compensation dentally while travelling to or from a to the office is connected with his employment in the service of his particular employer at the time of the accident. It is conceivable that a man might visit a mercantile marine office as a result of his desire to change his employment and that, if he were injured in such circumstances, he would be deprived of compensation. I stress this point because I believe that the greatest possible protection should be provided for employees in all workers' compensation legislation. I object to the inclusion in any such measure of a provision restrict compensation rights. Apart from this objection, the provisions which will clarify various definitions and re-arrange sections' of the existing act are satisfactory. The principal reason for this bill is the necessity to improve workers' compensation rates as a result of the sharp increases of the cost of living that have taken place since the act was la3t amended. The Seamen's Compensation Act was last amended in 1949, for thc same reason that has been stated by the Minister for Labour and National Service on this occasion. The 1949 measure was designed to bring seamen's compensation rates into line with the rates then provided in the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act, which had been amended in 1948. The basic wage, based upon the figures for the six capital cities in 1948, was £5 19s. a week. During the four years that have passed since the Seamen's Compensation Act was last brought up to date, the cost of living has increased, at an unprecedented rate. This is best indicated by the fact that, on the latest figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician, the basic wage average for the six capital cities is £11 l is . a week. Therefore, we are entitled to ask whether the rates of compensation for which this bill provides are adeauate when related to the losses that will be",35,Mcewen

113,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [4.49],"Thisincurred by seamen if they are injured in the course of their employment. A man who is injured while working for an employer immediately loses wages. Will this measure enable him to be adequately compensated for such injury? I submit, with due respect, that the Government has not taken into consideration the great passing such legislation, proportionately economic loss that is suffered by an employee as a consequence of injury. The act now provides that the weekly payment to an injured employee shall be £4. The proposed new rate is £6. The present rate allowed for a wife is £1 5s, which is to he increased to £1 15s. The rate for a dependent child is now 10s. and it is to be increased to 15s. Thus, under the new scale, the total weekly payment that may be made to a man with a wife and one child will be £S 10s. The basic wage was described by the late Judge Beeby as a sum which, at the best, would not support more than a family of three. Yet, although the present basic wage is £11 lis., a family of three may receive only £8 10s. in compensation. Tbe act now provides that, if a seaman dependant shall receive £1,000. This amount will be increased to £1,500. In addition, each dependent child will be entitled to receive £75 instead of £50. The rate payable to seamen under the age of 21 who are injured in the course of their employment will be raised from £3 to £4 10s. a week. The allowance for hoard and lodging will be increased fvom £1 10s. to £2 5s. a week. This means that, if the employer provides the injured seaman with board and lodging, an amount of £2 5s. will be deducted from the compensation payable. The total liability in respect of medical expenses is to be increased from £100 to £150 fov any one accident. The maximum payment that any employer will be called upon to make in respect of any one accident that a seaman may suffer will be increased fvom £1,250 to £1,750. Some people wbo have not examined tbe present trend of workers' compensation legislation may be inclined to say that this bill is reasonable, but I point out that the payments for whicli it makes provision are hased upon compensation payments to Commonwealth employees that were approved by the Parliament in 1951. Mr Clarey. Two aspects of Commonwealth workers' compensation legislation are open to grave objection. Eirst, the compensation payments are totally inadequate when they are compared with the rates of pay received by workers, and secondly, there is a tendency fov this Parliament, in to reduce payments as compared with the basic wage. To ilustrate my point, I shall give a brief resume of the effect of workers' compensation legislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament since 1912. The 1912 legislation made provision for compensation to be paid at the rate of £2 a week. The basic wage then was £2 13s. a week. So the difference between the compensation payment and the basic wage was 13s. Eighteen years later, in 1930, amending legislation was introduced into the Parliament. It made provision foi workers' compensation to 1 be paid to a man with a wife and child at the rate of £3 17s. 6d. a week. At that time, the basic wage was £4 6s. a week. Therefore, the gap between the basic wage is killed, the principal and the compensation payments, which was 13s. in 1912, was reduced to 8s. 6d. In 1944, further amending legislation was introduced. Under that legislation, the compensation payable to an injured wovkev with a wife and one child was £4 Ss. 6d. a week. The hasic wage at that time was £4 16s. a week. So the gap to which I have referred was reduced to 7s. 6d. It was reduced again in 194S, when legislation was passed by the Parliament under which compensation was paid to an injured worker with a wife and one child at the rate of £5 15s. a week. As the basic wage at that time was £5 19s. a week, the gap was reduced to 4s. I think we can say safely that in 194S a satisfactory stage had been reached in the history of compensation payments to workers during incapacity. But during the last five yeavs theve has been a tendency for the payments to decline considerably when compared with the basic wage. Under the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act 1951, the payment made to an injured worker with a wife and one dependant child was £8 10s. a week. At that time, the basic wage was £10 a week. So the gap between the basic wage and the compensation payments, which had heen reduced to 4s., was increased to £1 10s. Under this legislation, the compensation payable to an injured worker with a wife and one dependant child w ill be £8 10s. a week. The basic wage is £11 l is . a week. Thei-efore, the gap between the compensation payment and the basic wage will reach tbe astonishing figure of £3 l s. That cannot be regarded as satisfactory. I want to refer to the unjustified delay the attention of the Ministerf or Labour iu the introduction of this bill. The Comand National Service to the fact monwealth Employees' Act 1951 received the royal assent nized the inadequacy of workers' com' in November, 1951. about fifteen months elapsed before introduced into the Victorian Parliament legislation in regard to seamen was under which compensation payments introduced. about fifteen months, seamen, who must legislation w ill be increased to such a be covered by Commonwealth workers' degree as to make the payments proposed compensation legislation owing to the by this measure appear ridiculous and interstate and overseas nature of their mean.

So far, no explanation has been given of the long delay in introducing this w ill be 13s. greater than the payment bill. fied. understand why, now that the legislation from 10s. to 16s. a week, and w ill be has been introduced, the Government has slightly higher than payments made by made no attempt to make it operate retrothe Commonwealth in f u t u r e ; a total spectively, and, fro m November, 1951, to payment place seamen upon the same basis as of Commonwealth employees in respect of payment to persons under the age workers' compensation payments. present rate of compensation for an adult £4 a week to £6 8s. a week, compared seaman who is injured can be regarded with a maximum payment of £4 10s. a only as grossly unfair.

Let me refer to another matter that ment made to the dependants of a will indicate very clearly the meagre deceased worker under the Victorian legisnature of the payments proposed to be lation and under this legislation w ill be made under this bill. In 1951, speaking £840. upon the Commonwealth Employees' payable in respect of each dependent Compensation B ill , I said that it would child of a worker who is killed w ill be not give Commonwealth employees reasonable protection against loss of income as the result of accidents suffered during their employment. In 1952, I directed a question to the Treasurer ( Sir Arthu r Eadden), in which I asked whether, in view of large increases of the basic wage, the Government proposed to introduce a bill to increase workers' compensation payable to Commonwealth employees. The right honourable gentleman made it clear that the Government did not propose to do so. Now, I direct Compensation that State governments have recogA period of pensation payments. A bill has been That means that, for made to persons subject to the Victorian increased from £5 10s. to £8 16s., or £2 16s. higher than the proposed payments that we are now considering.

The payment Buti t is more difficult to in respect of a child w ill be increased for a family of three £12 a week.

Under this measure, the maximum payment will be £75. Under the present Victorian legislation, the sum that an employer can be required to pay in respect of medical and surgical expenses is limited to £125. The limit upon such payments will be removed. Under this legislation, which deals with seamen, it will be increased from £100 to £150. A similar anomaly will arise in respect of the maximum payment that can be made in respect of any one accident suffered hy a worker. Under this measure, the maximum sum payable in respect of auy one accident suffered by a seaman will be increased to £1,750, whilst under the Victorian legislation it will be increased from. £1,750 to £2,800. The Victorian Parliament proposes to give protection to an injured worker to the degree of £1,050 more than is proposed under this bill. the maximum sum be payable under the bill, but I hope that the whole matter Victorian legislation? the loss of both eyes, or iu respect of a be given to seamen who are injured in broken back.

Literature is available which analyses the provisions of the workers' compensation legislation of the States and of the Commonwealth. Hitherto, the Commonwealth has led in this field, but now it follows some of the States. The seamen are responsible for the safe transport of passengers and cargo round the Australian coast. Probably, the seamen run a greater risk of injury or death than workers in most other occupations. One State is bringing its workers' compensation law up to date, and, unfortunately, the Commonwealth is trailing behind it. The amounts of compensation proposed in this bill are completely inadequate to support the family of an injured seaman.

Nevertheless, the Opposition will vote for the bill, because the new rates are certainly better than the former scale. However, the Government should overhaul the compensation scales applicable tQ Oommonwealth employees and to seamen. Not by any conceivable standard, can we regard this legislation as satisfactory. The Government alone can remedy the position, and I hope that as the result of the passage of the amending workmen's compensation legislation in Victoria in the neai future, the earliest opportunity will be taken by the Government to introduce amending legislation with a view to providing more humane rates of compensation for Commonwealth employees ancl the men who go down to the sea iu sliips. Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [5.20] I feel that I should rise at this point to deal with a few of the matters raised by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr line with those persons who are covered Clarey), who is speaking on this bill on belialf of the Opposition. He has certainly greeted the legislation with modified rapture, when we consider that, in substance, it grants an overall increase of about 50 per cent, dn the benefits that are to apply. He has painted rather a gloomy picture of the prospects in life of those men who, as he expressed it rather dramatically on one or two occasions. "" go down to the sea in ships."" He created a rather discouraging atmosphere for men who may seek a livelihood on the waterfront. I do not discount his genuine sympathy and concern for members of all sections of the industrial movement, and I am glad to be able to assure him, from my knowledge of the facts of this matter, that the fate which awaits men who go down to the sea in ships is by no means as general, serious, or sombre as some of his remarks may have led us to believe. This Government has assumed full responsibility for this aspect of workmen's compensation, because seamen fall outside the scope of State legislation, yet the average amount paidunder these provisions in recent years has been approximately £3,400 annually. Therefore, the incidence of disability is not great, and a large sum of money is not involved under this legislation. J know that when I make such a statement, I invite the honourable member for Bendigo to ask, "" If it is such a small amount, why not bring the Commonwealth legislation into line with the more liberal provisions to be found elsewhere ?"" the same rate as they would receive if they were working ? has sufficient experience as a member of the Parliament to know that a government when it legislates in this Parliament on matters of this kind, cannot treat any particular group in isolation, but must be prepared to relate the claims of that group to the claims of others who may be said to be in somewhat comparable circumstances. Indeed, the whole purpose of this legislation is to bring those persons who are covered by the provisions of the Seamen's Compensation Act broadly into by the workmen's compensation provisions of other Commonwealth legislation, which covers tens of thousands of Commonwealth employees. Consequently, the Government seeks to ensure that the provisions that relate to seamen are not less favorable than the provisions which apply to the whole field of Commonwealth employees. The honourable member for Bendigo must be the first to realize the difficulties ancl clangers that would arise if one section, which eannot be said to be directly in the employment of the Commonwealth, were placed on much more favorable terms than the employees of the Government. The lionorable member, in logic and justice, should direct his criticism, not merely to this group, but to the whole field of Commonwealth employees, ancl, in doing so, he should realize that be is raising a large financial problem. It is outside my own competence, when I am discussing this measure, to refer to that problem witb any authority. Treasury policy is involved, and I do not feel that this occasion is profitable to develop the full story of workmen's compensation in the Commonwealth. We have had other opportunities to do so.",39,Second Reading

A great volume of legislation has had to be submitted to the Parliament in the intervening period, and that is the only reason for the delay in this instance. In view of the relatively small amount that has been paid in seamen's compensation over a period of years it would appear that there haA'e been no serious hardships caused, and it is not proposed to introduce retrospective provisions at this point. [5.30] I Avas astonished to hear the Ministerf or Labour and National Service( MrH o l t ) suggest that it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to set payments of compensation, such as are provided for in this measure, so as to maintain a common formula that would operate in respect of all compensation payments to be provided legislatively. Surelyi t is the Government's responsibility to set the level of compensation payments to be made under legislation of this description on the basis of the A^alue of the currency at the time. Such a policy has ahvays been accepted by every State, and has been accepted by the Commonwealth until now. As the honourable membei' for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) explained, compensation payments have ahvays been related as nearly as possible to the basic Avage. It is fantastic for the Ministev to say that this bill is merely a "" relating "" bill to the measure that Avas passed in 1951. Tbat is not an explanation that is Avorthy of a government that has an intelligent approach to the need for compensation. Despite the Minister's statement. I should say that the maximum to AA'hich compensation payments are to be extended by this bill can be regarded as no more than meagre. The maximum is to be on the basis of £6 for the breadwinner, £1 15s. for his Avife and 15s. for the first child, making a total of £8 10s. a Aveek at a time Avhen the basic Avage is £11 l is . In most cases the f a m i ly concerned expects to receive some extra payment to offset the value of the time lost by the injured Avorker. I do not propose to trace the history of compensation, as the honourable member for Bendigo has done so most capably, except to say that the close relationship of the leA^el of compensation payments to the basic wage Avas accepted by all governments between 1912 and 194S. All compensation legislation has proAdded for an extension of the maximum payments. This bill Avill become historic because, in the main, all it Avill do is to bring the amounts concerned into line Avith provisions that operated h i New South ""Wales two years ago. It does nothing about extending the coverage on workers to bring it into line Avith the provisions of State compensation legislation. The Mmister has said that we should not pick the eyes out of the compensation acts in the States and compare the results with the provisions of this bill. I submit, however, that it. is proper for me to make appropriate comparisons as I shall noAv do. . This measure Avill increase to £1,500 the maximum payment in respect of a worker who has lost his life, Avhereas the maximum payment under NeAv South ""Wales legislation has beeu £2,000 for a number of years. The. increase of the maximum payment from £1,000 to £1,500 does not represent the increase of the cost of living tliat has occurred since this Parliament last considered such legislation. Surely the minimum that should be prescribed by an act of parliament under present conditions should be a figure nearer the purchase price of a home Avhere the family unit could be kept together after thc breadwinner had gone. ""When the similar legislation was before the Parliament in 1948 the sum of £1,000 had a certain purchasing power. The sum of £1,500 to-day has nothing like that purchasing poAver. The real question at issue is not of relativity between this bill and some other bill that provides for compensation payments. The relativity should be betAveen the principal act and what is now considered to be a reasonable amount to be paid as compensation to an injured Avorker and his dependants. It is just as logical to say that it Avas not right to have amended the CommonAvealth Employees' Compensation Acti n 1951, because it would bave thrown it out of gear Avith the Seamen's Compensation Act, as it is now to say that it would be wrong to amend this legislation in a way that would -throw the Seamen's",41,Second Reading
131,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"Compensation Act out of line with the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act. It was thrown well out of line in 1951, and if the proper thing were done now it would he thrown out of line again in favour of those to he covered by the legislation, because in the intervening period the hasic wage has increased from £10 a week to £11 l is . a week. Surely nobody will rise in this chamber and say that there is no relativity between the compensation paid to an injured worker and the basic wage standard. There has always been a close relationship between them. There was a close relationship in 1948 when the Labour Government last dealt with this matter. It set the maximum payment at £5 15s. a week at a time when the basic wage was £5 9s. a week, and in that respect it did more than had been done during the whole time between 1912 and 1948. amount that is due to an injured worker to the amount considered necessary for the upkeep of the average home, has been followed until now. I think that this is the first occasion on which a new compensation measure has been introduced into any parliament in this country which provides for a wider divergence between the maximum amount of compensation to he received by a worker and his family, and the basic wage. The Government recognized in 1951 that the basis that has been prescribed in the principal act was the desirable basis of the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act. At that time the basic wage was £10 a week. Is it not right to suggest that the same spirit that actuated the Government then should guide it now ? The maximum payment provided by the measure is niggardly. The maximum of £8 10s. set in 1951 was only 30s. below the then basic wage, but this bill provides for the same maximum although the basic wage is now £11 l is . Such a proposal is unheard of iu compensation legislation ih this country. I have dealt with matters over a long period of years in the trade union movement. Compensation cases arise frequently in the transport industry in which I was engaged, and I have always considered that there should not be any maximum payment set Mr JS. James JJ.arrison. in any compensation legislation. I know that the Government would be breaking new ground if it introduced a provision that there should be no maximum payment, but that is a principle that should be applied topayments to the dependants of a deceased worker. I regard even the New S'outh Wales maximum payment of £2,000 as niggardly, having in mind not only the purchase price of a home for the bereaved family, but also other factors that operate. There have been numerous civil cases recently wiiere the dependent families of breadwinners who have been killed have been awarded amounts of up to £6,000. Such amounts are based not only on the need for compensation, but also on the responsibility of the mothers to rear their children. My view has always been that compensation payments to relatives, in cases where the That process of relating the breadwinner has been killed, should be set on a minimum amount, and not on a maximum amount. I kmow that the Minister will agree with me that the maximum amount provided in the compensation legislation is the greatest amount that can be awarded irrespective of the circumstances of any particular case. I hope that this Parliament will take the lead and prescribe a minimum, and not a maximum, amount for compensation of dependants. Will anybody in this chamber claim that where a breadwinner dies as the consequence of an accident an amount of £1,500 is sufficient compensation for the wife and family? It may be argued that a. seaman's dependents may be eligible for a. widow's pension or other social services. Irrespective of that, some authority should be available to ascertain her true financial standing. I have had much to do with workers' compensation, and I believe that the compensation of £1,500 prescribed in this measure for a seaman's widow should be a minimum and not a maximum. In practice, a judge or othertribunal should be able to determine the fair compensation. I suggest that the £1,500 prescribed in the compensation measure will be always prescribed by any authorized tribunal, even though it is a maximum, and that it should be the duty of the tribunal to assess compensation with £1,500 as a minimum. In recent years State legislation has been initiated to provide compensation for tliose who are injured at pick-up centres, or while travelling thereto from their places of abode. In this measure there is no such provision, and 1 suggest that the Government mightgive careful consideration to including one. In that regard I refer honourable members to section 14B of Part1 of the New South Wales Workers' Compensation Acts 19261951 which readsWhere any person is ordinarily engaged in any employment in connection with which ]>crsons customarily attend certain prearranged places (in this Act called "" places oi pick-up"") at whicli employers select and engage persons for employment, any such person shall he deemed, wliile in attendance at any mch place -jf pick-up before being ta> selected, or wbile travelling thereto from his place oi abode, to be a worker employed by the employer who last employed him in his customary employment. That is a section of a general workers' compensation act, but the act itself covers seamen. In 1951, the Queensland Government inserted a similar provision into its workers' compensation legislation, and although it is not as strongly worded as the New South Wales provision it has much the same effect. I suggest that this bill should have been drawn, not only to give effect to the increases of the compensation decided upon two years ago, but also to give greater cover to workers. Sub-section (5.) of section 5 of the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911-1949 readsAnypayment to an injured seaman made under an insurance policy privately effected by the seaman or made by a friendly society, by way of compensation or medical or disablement benefits, shall not be deemed to be compensation or payment in respect of the injury within thc meaning nf sub-section (2.) of this section. Clause3 of the bill is designed to omit sub-section (5.) of section 5. I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service clearly to inform the House of the reason for the proposed omission. The Seamen's Compensation Act also provides, in section 10AExcept as provided by this Act, a seaman shall not be entitled, in respect of personal injury by accident arising out of or in the course of his employment, to -.aceive compensation or any payment by way of compensation from the employer both independently of and also under this Act. [371 NowI suggest that perhaps insurance companies may have some sort of amalgamation with shipping companies. If sub-section (5.) of section 5 is to be omitted, the omission may have far-reaching effects on the compensation payable to widows. I ask honourable members to consider in that connection paragraph (1.) sub-paragraph («) ( i ) of the First Schedule, which readsThe amount of compensation under this Act shall lie(a) where death results from the injury (i) if thc seaman leaves any dependent wholly dependent upon his earnings, the sum of one thousand pounds If a seaman takes out a policy with an insurance company, under which his widow is to receive £5 a week, that amount will he taken into account when considering the amount of compensation to be awarded to her. I bave a New South Wales case of this description in mind at present, where a wife was earning a certain amount, her husband died and she was not able to obtain the full £2,000 of compensation because her degree of dependence was not total. that will not be the effect of this amendment. pleased to liear the Minister say that, but I point out that any assurances given in this House will have no effect upon any legal tribunal that may be interpreting the legislation. It is not sufficient to say that the omission of sub-section (5.) of section 5 of the principal act will merely tidy up the act. I suggest that if there was a need for the Minister to be assured on that point, the safe action would have been to allow the sub-section to remain. It cannot be said that this sub-section, which is to be deleted, has operated to the detriment of any employer or insurance company. I , and I am sure my colleagues, believe that the sub-section should not be omitted. Whereever a doubt exists, let the doubt be on the side of the person who is seeking compensation. If a man has tried to make some sort of provision for his widow, let that not be a ground for withholding part",42,Second Reading

There is no difference between a widow having a business income of £5 a week and having £5 a week from an insurance policy or an investment of the nature of insurance. I agree with the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey"") that the increases proposed in this measure are niggardly. If the amounts payable in 1951 were a proper assessment of the amounts due to dependants of deceased or injured workers, then obviously something more than is envisaged are proper to be paid to-day. I suggest, first, that both acts should have been amended coineidentally if uniformity is necessary. I suggest, secondly, that there should have been a wider coverage for seamen travelling to and from their homes, and, thirdly, that sub-section (5.) of section 5 of the principal act should not be deleted merely for the purpose of tidying up the act. A deletion of that kind will cause legal arguments about degree of dependence that sbould be avoided. If this sub-section is not omitted the Grovernment will be doing something to help those who may be left when a worker has lost his life in industry. Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m. House is considering an amendment of the Seamen's Compensation Act. As honourable members know, there are only two compensation acts on the Commonwealth statute-book; one relates to Commonwealth employees and the other to seamen engaged in interstate trade and commerce. Because the workmen's compensation acts of the States do not cover seamen, the Commonwealth passed the Seamen's Compensation Act in 1911. The act was amended in 1938, 1947 and again in 1949. The amending bill which we are now considering applies to seamen the increased benefits provided in the act relating to Commonwealth employees. There are only one or two main points in the bill that need to be considered. Honourable members generally have accepted the measure because they realize its importance. The first point with which I want to deal relates to the provision of compensation for permanent incapacity. Eor seamen the weekly incapacity payment is to be increased from £4 to £6; for a wife or female dependant the payment is to he increased from £1 5s. to £1 15s. a week; and that for each dependant child under the age of sixteen years the increase will be from 10s. to 15s. a week. That means that the benefit payable for an incapacitated man, his wife and three children will be increased from £6 15s. to £10 a week. The Government is to be commended for having taken a realistic view of this matter. Opposition members have suggested that there should be a relation between the total compensation benefits payable and the basic wage. I do not understand how it would be possible to arrive at such a relation. No Opposition member suggested upon what basis it should be established. Is it suggested that the total compensation benefits payable should be equal to the basic wage? If that is the contention of Opposition members, they have an entirely wrong mental approach to the problem. A similar suggestion has been made by them in regard to age and invalid pensions. It is wrong to adopt the attitude that a person who is not working should receive benefits equal to the earnings of a person wbo is working. The basic wage is determined, not on the needs of a man, his wife and so many children, but upon the capacity of industry to pay. To suggest that there should be a relation between the basic wage and payments for permanent incapacity following injury is totally wrong. Provision for the payment ""of a total benefit of £10 a week is very generous having regard to the existing basic wage. A person who has been totally incapacitated is not subjected to the same personal expenses as is a man who has to go to and from his work. Nobody can com-plainthat the Government has not been generous in this proposal. The maximum lump sum payable to a person who bas suffered certain specified serious but not fatal injuries is to be increased from £1,250 to £1,750. In the case of the death of a seaman tbe amount payable to his dependants is to be increased from £1,000 to £1,500. It has been suggested by Opposition members that in providing benefits similar to",44,Second Reading
134,Mr Hulme (Petrie) [8.0],"Th ethose contained in the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act the Government will pay to seamen compensation less than that paid to workers nnder some State acts. It may be that the Government of Victoria is at present increasing the amount of compensation paid to workers and that the New South Wales Government is providing compensation benefits that are on a more generous scale than are those provided in this bill. But if we take the matter further we find that in Queensland which, because of a certain arrangement of electoral boundaries is at present the most Labour of the Labour States,, the maximum amount payable to a worker in the event of a death is £1,250. If we delve further into the Labour administration of Queensland we find that provision is made in tbe Brisbane City Council Ordinance that the maximum amount payable by the council in the event of the death of a man with a dependent wife, due to the negligence of an employee of the council, is fixed at £1,000. It is ludicrous for the Opposition to suggest that the State governments are more concerned about these matters than is the Australian Government. The maximum amount of £1,500 payable on the death of a seaman is totally inadequate having regard to present circumstances. We must give a great deal more consideration to this matter than has been given to it in the past. The final words of the Vice-President The community expects that the Governof the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. ment as one of its first responsibilities Harrison) in his second-reading speech will look after the relatives of a deceased were that the amounts payable under the or injured seaman. The amounts granted act "" w ill be generally comparable with by the civil courts to injured persons State benefits"". Surely that is an unhave been so high that many insurance wise approach to this matter. We are to companies are now no longer willing to have benefits comparable with those proengage in third party business. That vided in another act of our own Parliafact in itself is a recognition of the ment and we are also to have benefits existence of new standards. I suggest comparable with those provided in State to the Minister that he should ask acts. That cannot surely be the basis Cabinet seriously to consider tbe appointon which these amounts have been determent of a commission, if Ministers are mined. A new value has been placed on unable to undertake the task themselves, life to-day compared with that placed to investigate the whole position so that on it many years ago in tbe compensarealistic provision shall be made for tion laws. We should endeavour to bring Commonwealth employees and for seamen our thinking on this matter up to date. This afternoon some honourable memof their employment. bers referred to decisions of the civil courts in relation to compensation claims. Every honourable member knows that the amounts approved by the courts as compensation for injuries are very considerably in excess of the amounts paid by any government or public administration for similar purposes. It is most desirable that the Commonwealth should establish a commission to inquire into all the facts in relation to this matter so that we shall be able to provide what every honourable member would regard as adequate compensation to injured employees. If the maximum payment of £1,500 on the death of a seaman were invested at the rate of interest applicable to Commonwealth loans it would yield approximately 26s. a week. It would probably be possible to purchase an annuity which would return a slightly larger weekly amount. We must take a more realistic view of these matters. The last review of this matter was made in 1951, when the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act was under consideration, but circumstances have so changed in the last two years that a further review is desirable. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) has told us that the annual expenditure under this legislation is approximately £3,400. That is a very small amount compared with the total expenditure of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, we do not know what expenditure is incurred under the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act, but whatever it is tbere is an obligation to do the right thing by seamen. who are injured or who die in the course Question resolved in the affirmative. .Bill read a second time. In committee: Tiie bill Labour and National: Service and Minister for Immigration) [8.11] -It may be convenient at this point if I try to clear up one or two matters that were raised during the second-reading debate, but which were primarily of a committee character. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) suggested that seamen who were injured on their way to work might be prejudiced by the operation of one of the clauses of this bill which appeal' to have a rather more restrictive character than do the existing, provisions of the act. The honourable member had referred to elause 4, which amends section 5AA of the principal act. The present act provides for compensation in the event of injury sustained by a seaman while travelling to or from his place of employment or to or from a mercantile marine office. The amendment now proposed alters the travel provision to journeys to or from the employment, as distinct from the place of employment. This is necessary because a seaman could be travelling to or from hisplace of employment for reasons quite unconnected with his employment. That may sound a little difficult to follow,, but what these provisions set out to do is to protect tlie position of a man actually at work or in the course of his employment. It could happen, for example, that a man, having been discharged from a particular vessel, forgot to'pick up his discharge cer tihe understood more readily if honourable fteate and decided to go back to collect it, and in the course of so doing sustained some injury. By no reasonable stretch of thp imagination could' it be said that the man concerned had been injured in the course of his employment. There are other illustrations that readily come to mind. As in the other provisions of this bill we have sought to bring the provisions of the principal act into line with those that apply to Commonwealth employees generally. The amendment achieves a. corresponding result as regards travelling to ancl from a mercantile marine office by providing that the reason for such travel must be connected with a seaman's emunder an insurance policy privately effected ployment. The act at present covers a wide field of liability in respect of casual or fortuitous journeys to or from the ship or mercantile marine office which have no real connection with employment. This is one of the few amendments of substance that will be made to section DAA by this bill. The remaining parts of the section will be recast without altering the law iu order to make explicit certain matters which, up to the present, have been implicit. I emphasize the fact that some State compensation acts provide cover for a person who attends at a pick-up place for the purpose of being selected for employment. Nothing in this bill will conflict with any such State law. The honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) was concerned because the Government proposed to omit from the principal act a reference toprivate insurances. Clause3 provides that section 5 of the principal act shall be amended by omitting sub-section (5.)-. Tbat sub-section provides that a seaman shall not be debarred from recovering compensation both under a private insurance policy and under the provisions of the act. Honourable members oppositefear that clause 3, by providing for the omission of the sub-section, will have the effect of disqualifying a seaman from benefit under the act if he happens to have insured himself privately. I assure them emphatically that the clause will not have any such result. The terms of the bill, and of this clause in particular, perhaps, do not makethe intentions of the Government clear. The position may members will examinethe history of this legislation. The Seamen's Compensation Act 1911-1938 contained a provision that a seaman should not be entitled to recover compensation both independently of and also under the terms of the act. This was thought to deprive a seaman who had taken out private insurance of the right to claim compensation, under the terms of the act, up to the amount covered by the private insurance policy. Therefore, the act of 1947 was drafted to amend section 5 of the principal aGt by adding the following sub-section:1 Any payment to au insured seaman made by the seaman or made by a friendly society,",45,Second Reading
135,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister forl y way of compensation ov medical or disablement benefits, shall not be deemed to be compensation or payment in respect of the injury within the meaning of sub-section (2.) of this section. That amendment made it clear that, notwithstanding the provisions of the remainder of the section, a man who had insured himself privately was not to be deprived of the benefit of such insurance. In othev words, private insurance payments were not to be offset against any compensation that would be payable otherwise. Subsequent legislation deleted the original provision, but the amending provision of 1947, which I have quoted, was allowed to remain in the act. That Labouv and National Service and Minisprovision, of course, was then meaningtev for Immigration) [8.22] -Honorabl e less.

I assure the committee that, wealth to provide for the payment of according to the best advice available to compensation to them for injuries susme, there is nothing now in the act, or tained in such circumstances. However, in this amending bill, to debar a seaman the Commonwealth takes the view that, from receiving any payment by way of up to the point of actual engagement fov compensation or medical benefit which wovk, vesponsibility for the payment of results fvom a privately effected insurance compensation to a seaman properly comes policy or from his membership of a within the jurisdiction of the various friendly society.

The wording of section 5AA in the principal act is clear and provides the maximum amount of protection for seamen. It states that compensation shall be payable to a seaman if he is injured while travelling to or from his place of employment. Clause4 proposes that this shall be replaced with a provision that compensation shall be payable if a seaman is injured while travelling to or from his employment. That provision embodies a limitation. There is always some definite point at which a seaman is discharged from his employment, after which, of necessity, he must attend at a mercantile marine office in order to seek re-engagement. The act also provides now for his protection if he suffers from personal injury by accident while travelling to or from a mercantile marine oflice. The clause provides for the variation of that provision so that compensation shall be payable only if the injury is susThat amount has always been near the tained while he is travelling to or from a mercantile marine office "" for a reason connected with his employment"".

Immediately, this gives rise to the question whether, when he goes to the mercantile marine office after having been discharged at the ship's side, he is travelSouth Australia, the compensation is 75 ling in connection with his employment. In fact, it might be argued that his employment had ceased, although his further employment would depend upon his discharge being made effective at the mercantile marine office. I have no doubt that the draftsman endeavoured to make the position as clear as possible, but two important considerations arise from this provision. The' first is that it will diminish the protection afforded to seamen. The second is that it will establish a legal anomaly, or loophole, that may well Jjecome the source of a great deal of legal action in the future. Therefore, I contend that the amendment is faulty and not in the best interests of the seamen. are adjusted in accordance One or two other matters require clarification. Every effort was made by members of the Opposition during the second-reading debate to make it clear Mr Clarey. that there is some relationship between rates of workers' compensation and thc minimum wage fixed inindustry. However, it appears that our efforts were unsuccessful, because the. honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) has said that we have not demonstrated a connection between compensation payments and the basic wage. I point out that, in recent years, there has been a slight change in the method of calculating compensation payments for injured workers. In the early days of workers' compensation, the amount of compensation for injury was calculated invariably according to a percentage of the wage that the injured man had been receiving at the time of his injury. Indeed, in four of the six States, that method of calculation is still employed. However, this Parliament and two State parliaments have recently adopted the method of fixing a. specified amount for compensation. rate of the basic wage at the time. In New South Wales, for example, the weekly payment for a worker who has been incapacitated is 75 per cent, of bis former average weekly earnings, with a maximum payment of £5 15s. a week. There is a definite connection between the rate of compensation and the wage that was received by the worker. In per cent, of the average weekly earnings of the employee. Whatever the weekly sarnings of an injured employee may be, he receives 75 per cent, of those earnings as workers' compensation. of each child. ceives payments in respect of his wife and dependent children. In Western Australia, the figure is 66§ per cent. The honourable member for Petrie queried workers' compensation payments being tied to the basic wage. That is done in Queensland, where payments with increases or decreases of the basic wage. Throughout the history of workers' compensation, there bas been a very close connection between compensation payments and the wage of a worker at the",48,Second Reading

140,Mr Clarey,"In addition, he retime of in j u r y. One honourable member said that in Queensland the payment made in respect of death was £1,250. He has heen misinformed. The payment is £1,500, plus £50 for each dependent child. Let us consider whether workers' compensation is assessed on the ability of iudustry to pay. The Commonwealth has not compelled employers to insure tliemselves against workers' compensation risks, but all of the State legislation makes such provision. It requires every business undertaking to pay premiums to an insurance company, which assumes thc liability of the employer in this connection and, if necessary, makes payments on his behalf. The practice, not only in Australia, but also in GreatB r it a in and otlier countries, is that the liability of employers i i i relation to workers injured while carrying out their duties shall be covered by insurance. I repeat that the payments proposed under this legislation are too small when compared with existing wage rates. It would be wise to support the suggestion that a committee be appointed to determine what, in present circumstances, would be reasonable rates of compensation when a workman is injured or loses his life in the course of his employment. The Commonwealth Parliament should insist that in workers' compensation legislation it w ill lead the States, and set an example to the rest of Australia. Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [8.34] I can deal with the first point raised by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) quite promptly by reminding the committee that normally the discharge of a seaman takes place at a mercantile marine office, where the man receives the balance of his wages and his discharge. As the mercantile marine office is regarded as the point of discharge, a seaman would be covered by workers' compensation legislation while he was travelling to the office and while he was at the office. is travelling from the mercantile marine office to his home, after discharge? Commonwealth legislation. This measure deals with the compensation that must be paid by an employer in respect of injuries sustained by an employee. A f t e r the point of discharge, there is no employer to whom we can look for compensation. If it is considered that the gap should be filled in some way, it is open to the State parliaments to do so, because they are responsible for workers inside their boundaries. The position of seamen is abnormal in that, for the greater part of the periods during which tbey work, they are not within the boundary of u State. As there is a need for some authority to make provision for them, the Commonwealth has stepped in and has assumed that responsibility. But I think most honourable members w ill agre-i that there would be no justification for the Commonwealth to go any further than the needs of the situation demand. I do not think that the State parliamenta would welcome an intrusion by the Commonwealth into one of their provinces. The honourable member for Bendigo referred to the provisions of the workers' compensation legislation of the various State parliaments. I stress that thc Commonwealth has not approached this probem in a cheese-paring spirit. In the earlier legislation, we have not sought to pick the eyes out of each of the relevant State acts, but the general coverage that we have given has been at least as generous as that given by any of the State acts and, in the main, has been more liberal. The honourable member sought to make a comparison between this measure and the bill at present uuder consideration by the Victorian Parliament. I point out that that bill has noc yet been passed and that, by and large, our legislation is still comparable in generosity with that of the States and, in most instances, is more generous. The honourable member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Petrie suggested that the compensation payments be reviewed periodically. I think thatmost members of the Government w ill agree with that suggestion.

But, as I sought to explain earlier, this measure deals only with a relatively minor part of the total field of workers' compensation covered by the Oommonwealth, and it would not be appropriate, in dealing with this bill, to get out of line with the general legislation on the matter. The Government is trying to bring the legislation that affects seamen into line with the legislation that affect3 Commonwealth employees generally. I shall bring to the notice of the Ministev for Shipping ancl Transpovt (Senator McLeay), into whose pvovince this matter falls, the suggestions that have been made. I have no doubt that the appvopriate departments will give full consideration to the need fov a close examination of this mattev. last statement made by the Minister prompts me to refer to the necessity to examine again the provisions of proposed section 5AA. Undev the existing legislation, a seaman discharged at a mercantile marine office is covered until he has reached his home. I consider it to be essential that he should be so coveved from the time he leaves his home to take a job until he arrives at his home when the job has finished. Under the pvoposed new section 5AA, a seaman will not be covered while he is on his way fvom a mevcantile mavine office to his home, after discharge. I point out to the Minister that it would not be easy to transfer to the appropriate State parliament responsibility for the protection of a seaman aftev his discharge, because, after discharge, he is an unemployed worker, and is not entitled to receive workers' compensation for any injury that he sustains while travelling fvom the mercantile marine office to his home. The only legislation that can cover a seaman engaged either in interstate trade or overseas trade is the Seamen's Compensation Act passed by this Parliament. If a seaman is engaged in intrastate tvade, he is coveved by the workers' compensation legislation of the State concerned. I suggest that, when this legislation comes before the Parliament again for consideration, an amendment be made to ensure that when a seaman has been discharged he will be covered by the legislation until he has reached his home.

This legislation-making authority in relation to Heard Island and the McDonald Islands is contained in the words "" temtory . . . otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth "". The arrangements for the taking over by Australia of jurisdiction over Heard Island and the neighbouring McDonald Islands were made in December, 1947, when the Chifley Government was in office. The position then was that the United Kingdom Government transferred its rights in those islands to the Commonwealth, and a research expedition was landed by the Australian Government on Heard Island to establish a research station for weather and general scientific purposes. The Chifley Govevnment realized at that time that those islands could become of great strategic importance. They are in a position having significance not only for Australia but also for South Africa and for important portions of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The islands also possess a scientific importance as an outpost from which valuable information could be derived by Australia for its weather and scientific purposes. But the Chifley Government had an even broader conception of the matter, namely, the relationship of Heard Island and the McDonald Islands to what might broadly be called the Antarctic Continent, and Australia's undoubted rights in it. We had consultations with the United Kingdom Government, which considered that the time had arrived for Australia, in pursuance of a policy adopted long before that time in relation to the Antarctic, to assume jurisdiction over Heard Island and the McDonald Islands. That has been done in fact. There is occupation of a territory in fact, and other nations are likely to recognize it. In addition, valuable research work aud pioneering work have been done on Heard Island.

Australia is continuing the work. Some future development-som e defence development-ma y make Heard Island of great importance. It could be so. South Africa holds that view. I have made those statements only as a background to the attitude taken by the 'Ihifley Government at that time. about the ownership of the islands. Dv. EVATT -There is no dispute about the facts. All this bill does is to say, in effect, "" Here is a territory for which this Parliament can make laws. They should be made."" To date, the position has not been regularized legally. Australia proceeds to say that it has to make a clear-cut point of departure for the future, and that no laws in that territory shall be enforced except the laws passed by this Parliament in accordance with clause 5 of the bill. The Ministev for External Affairs (Mi-. Casey) has explained, in his second-reading speech, that provision is made that the laws in force in the Australian Capital Territory, including the general principles of the common law and such principles, for instance, as are embodied in Magna Oharta, the right of liberty, and the laws of equity, are to be enforced in Heard Island and the McDonald Islands by virtue of an act of this Parliament. The laws of the Australian Capital Territory are to apply, with certain exceptions, to the islands. That means, in fact, that there will be in the forward Antarctic areas to the south and the west of Australia the same authority as we have with respect to the Australian Capital",51,Casey
148,Mr Thompson,"There is no disputeTerritory in which this Parliament meets. It is right and proper that such should be done. The bill will not affect many people, but civil rights may arise in Heard Island or the .McDonald Islands. The Minister has explained that, recently, the necessity arose for a coroner's inquiry to be held because of a death that occurred under circumstances of heroic proportions. That is an incident, but the legal side has to be watched. The Minister is quite right to regularize this position. It to say that at least two vessels which may be that, in future, this will have to be altered in some way, but the provision is flexible so that the Crown-the Commonwealth Government-subjec t to the supervision of the two Houses of the Parliament, can ensure that laws referable to that territory, and peculiarly necessary to it, may be applied by ordinance. That is the position. In my opinion, it is a most important stage in the expansion of Australia-no t expansion in any aggressive or imperialist sense. The proposal is not open to criticism. It is essential for the welfare of the Commonwealth of Australia, ancl the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the interests of all the people concerned. That was the view of the Chifley Government which it was my duty to put before the United Kingdom when this arrangement was made in 1947. The Australian Government ancl the Minister are to be congratulated for having carried that into effect, for starting the system of laws operating in that territory and for clearly telling the world, ""Here is Australian territory governed by Australian law in accordance with the directions of the Australian Parliament"". The law is based on the fundamental rules applicable in every State and every territory of Australia, namely, the common law of England, and also on such principles as the liberty of the subject, freedom of discussion and all those matters whicb we take for granted but which are most important and are declared afresh by the Government in relation to this new territory. The Minister is to be congratulated on having introduced this bill. External Affairs) [8.56] -in reply-I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and his colleagues support this bill. It is a non-controversial measure-on e of those rare and welcome measures into which party politics do not intrude. Australia has a large stake in the Antarctic, being approximately one-third of the whole continent. We have had a claim to it now for at least two generations, and have done a great deal to support the claim by the activities of our Antarctic explorers such as Mawson and many others. Indeed, I think it is correct accompanied Captain Cook, in addition to discovering and surveying the eastern coast of Australia, made a complete encirclement of the Antarctic continent before 1795, thus establishing the interest of the British peoples, and, in particular, the peoples who were to become the British Australian peoples in the great Antarctic continent to the south of this country. This is not the time or the place fov me to develop this wonderful story. In passing this bill and other measures whicli. I have no doubt will be before us in the future, we shall do something not only for the Australia of the present, bnt also for the Australia of the future. We are casting our minds and our efforts forward into the next 100 years. No one can say what the potential value of the Antarctic continent is. We can only speculate on what the scientists and explorers have told us, but we know that there are four, five or six respects in which the Antarctic continent and its nearby islands, such as the ones now under discussion, may havs important potential value for the future. I remind honourable gentlemen that only a few hundred miles from the group of islands we are now discussing lies the Kerguelen group of three or four islands which our friends of the French Republic are developing with considerable ingenuity and keenness. They have established meteorological stations which are co-operating with ouv own meteorological station on Heard Island, and in that way are giving us the means-and there are not many other means-of doing long range weather forecasting which is becoming progressively of more value to the primary producers of Australia.

155,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forduring its tenn of office it boasted that, the authority included a majority of primary producers, which, according to it, demonstrated that the affairs of the industry, insofar as they were connected with export control, had been placed in the hands of the producers. Having made that .claim, the Labour Government insinuated into the act a provision that the chairman, who was to be an appointee of the Government, representing the Government on the board, might dissent from, any decision made by this board, controlled by a majority of producer representatives, and report his dissent to the Minister. The Minister might, within 24 hours, veto the decision of the majority of the board or, worse than that, vary it. I can understand a ministerial veto of a decision, but provision permitting a ministerial variation of a decision, the Government nor anybody else conperhaps along political lines and in such a way that the variation will be regarded thence as the decision of the board itself, placed there only when local needs have is outrageous. The primary producers almost unanimously regard it as such. As I said last week, in reference to the similar provision in another act^ this section of the principal act places in the hands of the Minister a power that is as absolute as any authority taken hy any dictator, whether it be Hitler or Stalin, but it is not as clean and as clear-cut as the authority taken by a dictator, because at least a dictator takes his authority openly, and accepts the responsibility. In this Labour-conceived provinegotiations are to take place we want sion, however, the Minister reserves to himself an absolute dictatorial authority to make a decision and then to publish his decision as the decision of the board, notwithstanding that every producer member of the board may be opposed to the decision that the Minister has taken. Who on earth can say truthfully that that contains any element of democracy ? This Government does not believe, and the primary producers do not believe, that such a provision is fair or democratic. The hill, therefore, is designed to remove that provision from the legislation governing a number of statutory boal'ds^ in which the Labour Government incorporated it. It is the Government's policy to leave tbe anairs of the primary industries to tb*, greatest possible dfegree in their own hands. We have never said, whether we were in Opposition or in office, or oil an election platform, that we would, by statute law, place the affairs of a primary industry completely and unfetteredly in the hands of that industry. We have always held that there are some reserve powers that a government ought to retain to itself. Every speecli ever made from this side of the House has made that point clear. There will still remain in the legislation, after this measure has been passed and the offending section has been removed, adequate provision for the Minister to exercise authority where required. These statutory boards are all called export control boajds, and they have nothing to do with the supply of foodstuffs to the local public. They deal only with surplus food. Neither tracts commodities into the hands of the export control boards. The goods are been fully satisfied. Then the surplus commodity is realized, and nobody but the chosen representatives of the producers decides what is to be done with it. If the chosen representatives of the owners of the commodity say to the representatives of the Government, ""We Would like you to try to arrange to contract along certain lines "", we say, "" It is your property, and if you want us to arrange a contract we shall do so, but we shall do it, in co-operation with you, and if any you to participate in them whether they are negotiations for a contract or whether they are periodic price negotiations "". Not since this Government has been in office have there been any negotiations for the contract disposal of any product in which the representatives of tbe owners of the product have not participated. There have been no periodic price negotiations for the sale of a product sold overseas in which the ""representatives of the producers have not taken part. Now we have a long term meat contract, not because this? Government thought that tbere should be one, but because the chosen representatives of the producers asked us to ltiegotiate and attended at those negotiations. Those representatives studied' the matter for two years during the perffiA of the negotiations, and, finally, on the motion of the Graziers Association of Australia they almost rebuked us for not being quick enough in signing the contract. Now that the contract has been signed, I , following the policy of the Government, have asked the Australian Meat Board, on which a majority of the members are producers, to act as the principal in negotiating prices and arrangements for sale during the period of the contract. I cannot make it a principal, because the contract is one between governments and the Government cannot divest it3elf of final responsibility. I once invoked the ministerial authority under the principal act to prevent the Australian Meat Board from taking a certain action that it had decided upon. This was not to superimpose my judgment on the board in any matter with regard to meat; it was a matter of propriety in public administration. Australian Meat Board had decided for the purpose of the sale of a limited quantity of meat to North where prices were about two and a half times as great as on the local market, that it would give export permits to certain companies and individuals. The board decided to give these permits according to a very fair formula. exporters were to be allowed to export in the same proportion as they had contributed in the last year to the United Kingdom meat contract. That is as fair a method as could be devised, and I did not quibble with the fairness of it. I differed from the Australian Meat Board because a company was given an export permit that enabled it to procure, say, 1,000 tons of meat on the Australian market at a certain price and sell it on the overseas market at two and a half times that possession of the permit gave to the company a very high profit. The method adopted by the board gave other companies an entitlement to export 5 or 6 tons, and as they could not find a market overseas for that quantity they handed over their quotas to, among others, an hotel broker, an insurance broker, a machinery merchant and so on. Consequently, our meat was being hawked around. I considered that that method of allotting permits was wrong. Cabinet agreed with me, and the Australian Meat Board was prevented from continuing that system. The board then became the exporter, and returned the resultant high profits to the producers. Therefore, the Government, by its action, allowed the producers, rather than the large companies, to take the profit. There still remain in the Meat Export Control Bill the same authority that I invoked on that occasion, and I do not imagine that anybody could rationally argue that more authority than that is needed. AllI say is that this Government does not want to invoke any. authority at all. else. into a dispute with the honourable member for Lalor, but the general doctrine of socialism requires a socialist government The to dispose of the property of private individuals in accordance with socialistic doctrines. The difference between the GoAmerica, vernment and the Opposition on this occasion is that the Government wants merely a reserve authority which it hopes it will never have to invoke, whereas a socialist government would desire to be possessed of the maximum authority to enable it to That was, that exercise that authority in accordance with its socialist doctrine. That a socialist government would exercise sucb power is indicated by the classic example of the sale of wheat by the private arrangement of a Minister of the previous Government, to another socialist government in New Zealand at less than half the price that could have been got for it elsewhere. The fact that such a sale had taken place was suppressed for twelve months. export parity for the wheat. months I stood on the Opposition benches in this Parliament and tried to get the then Labour Government to admit that it had made the sale, but no admission was made until after twelve months had passed.

This Government will not interfere with our surplus products, which come voluntarily into the possession of the export control boards. I can contemplate interference only in the circumstances that I have mentioned, where the Government interfered, for administrative reasons, with an arrangement made by the Australian Meat Board. That is an explanation of the different attitude of the Government parties and the Labour party, and I ask that honourable members support the Government's proposal.

At all events, he ascertained that an injustice was contemplated. If the Chairman had noticed it, under the provisions of the legislation he would have been empowered to direct the attention of the Minister to it. The Minister may then have altered or rejected the board's decision as he deemed fit. The Minister proposes to divest himself of that power. He has said that he interfered in the rffafter to which he referred not because it directly affected primary producers but because it affected other persons in the community. That is all the more reason why he should retain power to vary or veto the decisions of the board. He has a responsibility not only to watch <fhe interests of primary producers but also to protect the economic welfare of the people. The Minister seems to have a fantastic idea that if a decision of the board does not affect producers, it does not matter. That is quite wrong. The producers have an absolute majority on the board. Three members of the board represent lamb producers, one represents m-ufton producers, two represent beef producers, one represents pig producers, two represent meat exporting companies, ©-ne represents publicly owned abattoirs and meat treatment works, and one represents the employees in the industry. The chairman represents the Government. The Minister has said that the section which this clause proposes to delete from the act gives him unwarranted power to interfere in the affairs of primary producers. Earlier he said that the board had nothing to do with the supply of meat to the people of Australia. That is an absolute evasion of the truth. The boa'rd.has everything to do with the supply of meat to the Australian people because if, by the unjust exercise of its powers, it permits too much meat to be exported from Australia, insufficient meat is lefi to meet the requirements of the home market. Consequently, the powers exercised by the board must; be very closely watched. The Minister referred to an injustice which the board proposed to inflict on a certain individual who was not a producer. Let me mention another instance in which the Minister might have exercised his authority to prevent an unwise decision from adversely affecting the producers. Some considerable time ago it was believed that valuable markets existed in the United States of America for Australian meat and arrangements were made for the export of token shipments. Either the board or private shippers exported no less than 8,000 tons of meat to the United .States of America. When the exports were contemplated the Minister should have been able to ascertain from his advisers at the Australian Embassy in. New York whether the venture was likely to prove profitable or otherwise. The meat was subsequently sold at a substantial loss which had to be borne either by the board or by the exporters. The loss of a dollar market of that kind constitutes an overall economic loss to the people. Throughout this discussion the Minister has claimed that he has retained what he has described as an adequate degree of ministerial responsibility. We shall vote against this clause because we believe that it will destroy a vital protection given to the people in the principal act. When I was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture I exercised my power of veto on only one occasion, in that instance to reverse a decision of the board to refuse a license to a person who had been convicted of black marketing operations. The Minister talks a lot of nonsense about Labour's opposition to this bill, having a socialist background because during the last two or three days he has been jammed in a corner trying to prove that he has retained whtft he is pleased to call adequate protective powers. There is no justification for this clause. The existing provision of the act should be retained for the protection of the people. There is a great temptation for Opposition members and other persons both inside and outside the Parliament who liave no ""intimate knowledge of the meat",58,Habbison Measure Of Authority Over The Instru

166,Mr Roberton (Riverina) [9.43],"industry to imagine tliat the Australian Government has large quantities of meat at its disposal. That is an entirely f a l lacious assumption. No Australian government has meat for sale either on the export or the domestic market, nor has the Australian Government power to acquire meat for sale except under the strict terms of the Constitution. There is a wide 'difference between the powers of the Australian Goverument and those of the State governments in this regard. A recent H i gh Court decision has laid it down, subject to appeal, that the New South Wales Government has power to acquire property of any kind at any time, and to pay any price for it or no price at all. The New South Wales Government could possess itself of all the meat that is produced in New South Wales and pay any price it decides to pay or not pay for it at all, and dispose of it in any manner to achieve its political ends. But that set of circumstances could never apply to fche Commonwealth Government. This Government has only one way of acquiring meat or any other commodity. It must do so under the terms of placitum (xxxi.) of section 51 of the Constitution, which lays down that, although the Commonwealth has the right to acquire property, it must do so on just terms. TheH i g h Court has declared that "" j u s t terms "" means the value of that which is acquired at the date of acquisition. The Commonwealth Government, at any time, whatever its political character may be, must comply with that provision unless it resorts to subterfuge. I suggest that section 10 ( 5 A . ) of the principal act is a subterfuge which was designed for the purpose of enabling a government to evade the provisions of the Constitution. An unscrupulous government could use it for that purpose. In ovder to refresh the memories of honourable membevs, I shall quote the subsection, which'clause 4 w ill delete from the act(;->A.) If the person presiding at a meeting of the Board dissents from any decision of the Bowd, -signifies at the meeting to 'the otlier memhers present in person hie intention to bring his dissent to the notice of the Minister and, within twenty-four hours after the cios« of thc-meeting, transmits'to'the Minister notice of liis dissent together witli f u l l particulars of the decision, effect shall not be given to the decision unless the Minister approves of the decision (whether with or without variation) and, if the Ministeiapproves of the decision subject to a variation, the decision so approved shall be deemed to be the decision of the Board. To every fair-minded person that is an objectionable feature of the principal act and it should have been deleted long ago. It gives to the Ministev absolute power to suborn the chairman, or any other member of the Board who might preside at any of its meetings, in order to achieve his own political ends and gain control of a commodity which, in normal circumstances, could not pass into the contvol of the Government unless it was paid for in the normal way. Time aftev time. I have known that provision, which is embodied in various acts, to be held over primary industry boards as a damoclean sword which the Minister of the day has used to enforce his w ill upon the accredited representatives of the producers. Another weapon that has been used to compel sueh boards to conform to a minister's wishes has heen the threat to impose an export tax and by that means reduce the representatives of the growers to a condition of ignominious subjection. The Government is to be commended' for its decision to restore to the meat producers, to whom it rightly belongs, the right to dispose of their product to the best advantage. The honourable member for Lalor has* tried to make political capital fvom ths fact that the right of ministerial veto will be retained in some degree. That is true, and, as long as primary industries have an obligation to the community as a whole, it is only right that the Minister should have some sort .of over-riding powev to divect their marketing and export boards in the public interest. No reputable board would ever dispose of a commodity against the best interests of the people to whom that commodity belongs, and simultaneously against the interests of the people as a whole, and no Minister would dare to -exercise his veto except in the interests of the public, which must inevitably be in tbe interests of tbe producers -For 'these reasons, no sensible person can take excejition to the fact that the Minister .will retain that powev. Whether he exercises the power or not will depend entirely on the Minister in the first place, and the circumstances in the second place. I assure the House that the deletion of section 10 (OA) of the principal act, and similar provisions in other acts, has been an object dear to the hearts of the producers, not only of meat, but also of every other commodity that depends to any large degree on the export trade. That is why I welcome clause 4. matter how earnestly one might wish to have a free and open market for meat, as we have for wool, the simple fact remains, as the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton) and otber honourable members on tbe Government side of the House must know, that meat is sold under the terms of contracts negotiated between governments at prices fixed by governments largely determined by governments. That is necessarily so because of the financial circumstances of Australia and the rest of the sterling bloc in relation to other countries. It is sheer nonsense to talk about the Australian Meat Board functioning in the same way as the Australian Wool Board for the disposal of our meat. Meat will continue to be sold under the terms of contracts negotiated by governments, and I do not believe that the honourable member for Riverina or the Minister for Commerce suggest that the system should be discontinued. Obviously, the Government, which must accept responsibility for the contracts, must retain power to control the decisions and activities of the Australian Meat Board. As the honourable member for Riverina has said, no Minister is likely to make decisions that would adversely affect the meat industry, because such decisions naturally would have an adverse effect also upon the Australian economy and the people generally. Government's proposal because it has been made at a time when, notwithstanding all the talk by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture about five year plans for increased primary production, the output of our primary industries continues to head in the wrong direction. It is true that, as a result of favorable seasons which have led to an abundance of feed, it appears as though the Government's activities have helped farmers to increase production. However, if we ignore such temporary factors as good seasons and a few external circumstances, and examine the real base of our primary industries, we see that, despite the Government's plans to increase our primary production in order to increase our ' export income, the Government's policy is causing the situation to become worse. Order! The honourable member will now refer to the clause before the committee, which refers to meetings of the Australian Meat Board. The discussion may include the power of veto by the Minister. that I am developing is that the Minister and in circumstances and the board will be faced with a set of circumstances in whicb ministerial power must be invoked. I am trying to direct attention to the condition into which our primary industries are declining, which points to the necessity for tbe Government to retain control, particularly in relation to exports. This argument is germane to the clause that the committee is considering. For instance, the latest information provided by the Commonwealth Statistician on the subject of the number of cattle in Australia is of great importance. such statistics to be brought into this discussion. lionorable member for Riverina was allowed to discuss the Constitution and the power of the Government over. the meat industry generally, my remarks are very much to the point. wide of the mark. The remarks of the honourable member for Riverina were I am disturbed by the relevant because they referred to the power of the Government under the Constitution and otherwise. The honourable member will return to the clause. whether the decisions of the Minister will be for good or evil if we cannot take into account the circumstances that are likely",59,Habbison Measure Of Authority Over The Instru

174,Mr Keon,"Ho w can we considerto arise in the future when those decisions will have to be made ? It is impossible to argue whether the Minister should or should not retain his powers if we cannot at least offer some information concerning the probable future position of the meat industry. I suggest that honourable members consider the statistics in relation to live-stock. that. when the intervention of the Minister will be required in order to enable the Australian people to be adequately fed. The direction in which this Government's policy is leading us, taking into account our increased population and the continued decrease of our cattle population, sliould give us grave cause for concern. The Minister should retain bis power over the Australian Meat Board because I can readily envisage circumstances in which intervention will be necessary in order to ensure that a sufficient quantity of meat shall be retained in Australia for domestic consumption. This, surely, is a strong argument against the proposal of the Government to allow the Australian Meat Board to proceed without provision for ministerial direction or veto on some occasions. according to the Commonwealth Statistician honourable member will not be permitted to deal with those figures. They have nothing to do with the clause. hope that the committee will refuse to agree to the clause. The disastrous rural policies that are being pursued by the Government will bring about a state of affairs in which ministerial intervention in the activities of marketing and export boards will be required in order to ensure that a reasonable proportion of foodstuffs shall be kept in Australia to meet the needs of our people. Consideration of our increasing population and the decreasing live-stock population leads only to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the Minister's talk of five-year plans to' boost agricultural production, we are heading in the wrong direction at an even faster rate than we were doing so before the Minister announced those plans. As you will not permit me to pursue that argument any further, Mr Chairman, I leave the matter there and urge the committee to reject the clause. Once again, we have heard the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) criticize legislation designed to assist primary producers, and, once again, he has been wide of the mark in his remarks. The section proposed to be deleted was inserted in the act, at the instigation of a Labor Government, to make the primary producers believe that they would have control of their product. The statement that the producers would bave a majority on the board was broadcast far and wide by all possible means, but very little was said about the fact that the chairman would be able to ""lodge with the Minister an objection to a decision of the board and that the decision could be upset by a Minister who did not desire the producers themselves to handle their product. I remember that when this section and similar provisions in other legislation were debated hotly in the Parliament between 1946 and 1949, the Prime Minister of that time would not pay any attention to the views that were expressed The live-stock population, by honourable members who represented primary producers. The Government is to be commended for this action to delete Order! The an obnoxious provision from the act and, at the same time, to retain in the hands of the Minister power to ensure that the board shall function properly. A few minutes ago, we listened to the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who was the Minister responsible for the insertion in the act of the section that the Government proposes shall be deleted. He was very wide of the mark in some of his comments. The figures that he cited showed that he had not much knowledge of the quantity of meat that was exported to the United States of America. He said that 8,000 tons was exported, but only 870 tons was involved. When the attention of the Minister was directed to what was happening, he took appropriate action immediately. there and money was lost on it, before the Government woke up.",61,Habbison Measure Of Authority Over The Instru

I should not be surprised if he knows the figure, and has exaggerated it in order to make the picture look worse. Lf he does not know the figure, then he has not kept himself informed of events in the meat industry, since he was kicked out of office ignominiously in 1949. I hope that the Parliament will delete this kind of provision -from all legislation in which it has been inserted, because it is nothing but a source of annoyance to every section of our primary producers. [10.4] I have listened with great interest to the objections that have Deen raised hy the honourable member fbr Lalor( Mr Pollard) and other members of the Opposition. I shall confine my remarks to the question under consideration, which is whether the authority that controls meat exports should be an independent board, so far as it is reasonable for such a board to be independent. During the last war, I looked at matters of this kind from the viewpoint of a State administration. At the outbreak of the war, I was closely associated with the framing and passing of a resolution that asked the Commonwealth, through the honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), tb establish for the control of primary products boards on which a majority of the members Were primary producers. It is an historical fact that when the Labour party came into power in this Parliament it proceeded to act in a manner which indicated its complete contempt of the principle that primary producers Should exercise control of their products. In many instances, when it established a board for the control of primary products, it. brushed aside the primary producers whose products were to be controlled. I remember the board that was established to control the disposal of hides. When I studied the legislation under which the board Was established, I discovered that tlie producers had not one representative on the board. They were given only an advisory member. Then the Labour party, with a sudden change of heart, doubtless because it saw signs of the coming storm, amended the legislation and permitted each State to nominate a producer as a member of the board. The principle that we are discussing is whether, in the disposal of primary products under the provisions of acts of Parliament, there shall be a real producer control of those products. I know tliat it will be argued that we cannot have legislation that would give to some people an unlimited right to take what they liked from the community, but that argument is not applicable to the export of primary products. I agree that in this matter, as in all other similar matters that affect the interests of the community, the Government must have a certain reserve executive power, but that is entirely different from giving a Minister the right to dictate to a board and to attribute to the board a decision which, in fact, has been made by him. Nothing angers primary producers more than the action of a Minister in overriding the decision of a board that controls a primary product and sending his decision out as the decision of the board. I congratulate the Minister upon this action to eliminate an offensive feature of the legislation. I believe that the chairman of a board of this kind should be a primary producer, and that the secretary, or the executive member, should be a highly trained technical officer, lent to the board by the Government to act in an advisory capacity. I have bitter recollections of bodies sent overseas by the Labour party when it was in office, on which the primary producers were not permitted to have a representative, except, in some instances, one who acted only in an advisory capacity. The owners of the primary products that were being disposed' of could not exercise effective control of the disposal of those products. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) made the point that because many of these products are sold under contract, there is very little for boards to do. There is a great deal for such boards to do. They must keep in touch with conditions, in the industry concerned, keep themselves informed of prices abroad, maintain contact between the Government and the industry, and ensure that the Government shall be kept fully and continuously",62,Habbison Measure Of Authority Over The Instru
181,Mr Hamilton,The quantity in,63,Habbison Measure Of Authority Over The Instru
182,Mr Drummond (New England),"informed of the views of the primary producers, not only of the technical views of the appropriate department. I do not say that the Government should not be kept informed of the views of the department concerned, but the departmental view and that of the primary producers do not always march together. The practical man must come into the picture. Countless thousands of hides were wasted in the interior of Australia because an uneconomic price for hide3 was determined by a government-controlled board. That kind of thing can be avoided by close contact between a boa I'd and the Government. I congratulate the Minister. Not only has he expounded these theories in the past but also he has had the courage to introduce this measure, with, I am certain, the full support of the Government. The honourable membei' for New England( Mr Drummond), made, in effect, a second-reading speecli, but I do not mind that. MrD un M.M ON o I confined myself to the clause. gentleman believed that he did so. He referred to the board that was established to control hides and leather. That was a Commonwealth instrumentality whicli worked in conjunction with the States. He said that primary producers were not represented on that board. I remind him that the board was a war-time instrumentality, established to handle a product for which the primary producer was paid when he sold his stock to the meat works or to the butcher. The bides were, in effect, the property of the butcher or the meat works. correct. member should not quibble. He referred also to the appointment of the chairmen of various export authorities. Let me tell him that the Labour Party was never guilty, as was this Government, of removing from the Australian Wheat Board a fully fledged wheat grower who had done a lot of work for the wheat-growers of this country in an honorary capacity and in other capacities, and of putting in his place a man who had not grown a bag of wbeat for years. We appointed to the Dairy Produce Export Control Board the late Mr Howey, who had given <a lifetime of service to dairy producers. We appointed him as Governnieut representative on the board because he was one of the best practical dairy-farmers in Australia. When the honourable member for New England indulges in propaganda of that kind, he goes very wide of the mark. I could go on ad infinitum. honourable memher for Lalor must not pursue that line of argument any further. Chairman, with due respect, that the honourable member for New England referred to this subject. He said that a Labour government appointed as members of these boards people who were not primary producers. Most of the early war-time boards, established by a non-Labour Government, were controlled by people who were not primary producers. The producers did not have a honourable majority of the members of the boards until the Labor party came into office. The remarks of the bonorable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) are not .worthy of a reply. The honourable member for New England said that primary producers interested in these authorities took exception to decisions being attributed to a board that were, in reality, decisions of the Minister. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture had reversed a decision of the Australian Meat Board to issue an export licence to a certain interest or individual, but, as far as people outside the industry were concerned, it did not matter much whether the decision was that of the Minister or of the Board. To all intents and purposes, it was a decision, not of the Minister but of the board, because at no time until this moment did the Minister announce, either in the press or in this chamber, that he had interfered with the decision of the board upon that matter. Some people might believe that the board made the decision. That sort of nonsense does not cut any ice.",63,Habbison Measure Of Authority Over The Instru

The representatives of the primary producers and the meat exporters on the Australian Meat Board discussed the position quite freely and publicly. Consequently, it is nonsense to say that the matter was not known Minister's interference with that particular export, and not with the total quantity. that the knowledge was not public property until I referred to it a few minutes ago. The position was widely known. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has allowed himself to get out of touch with the primary industries, otherwise he would have been as familiar with the facts as are countless thousands of Australians, including persons who are not primary producers. The more the honourable member speaks of primary industry boards, the more he reveals that he has not a grasp of the situation. He says that it is essential to retain the proprevent the export of additional meat to visions! of sub-section ( 5 A ) , which is to the TJnited States of America. be repealed by clause 4 of this bill, because Minister promptly that certain action an opinion on the matter.

He said that I should have known that there was not a good market for the consignment in North America, and, accordingly, should have forbidden the board to export the meat. The attitude of the socialist was again revealed. The representatives of primary producers and the great meal processing works constitute a majority of members of the board. Those men have a wide experience of . the industry. Yet the honourable member for Lalor asks, "" Why did not the Minister have a better knowledge of the North American market than the members of the board ?

I did not seek to impose my opinion on the board, and neither to-morrow nor at any other time will I , as an ordinary individual, claim that my judgment, even if it is supported by the advice of experienced departmental officers, is superior to that of a board of this kind. The meat is the property of the primary producers, and is not taken compulsorily from them by the statutory board. The meat is offered to the board by tbe primary producers or processors for realization.

This Government follows that line of policy, and the amendment is in accovdance with it.

213,Mr Pollard,"I did it in a veryGlenroy. They were built under direct coin tract to the di vision. In the Fawkner case, before the ex-servicemen could take up occupancy of the homes or make any financial commitment to tbe contractor from whom they were purchasing them, and obtain the financial support of the War Service Homes Division, the homes had to be examined by the division's inspector and had to be approved, I understand, as structurally sound, and as being worth tlie price that the soldiers were asked to pay. There are a number of homes concerned. Apparently in this particular case the War Service Homes Division inspector, who may have heen overridden by the division-althoug h I do not know whether or not he wasdecided that the homes were sound and solid and satisfactory in construction. To-day the ex-servicemen are in occupation. I saw two of the homes. AllI can say is that if they are held to have been constructed according to decent building ethics, I should be ashamed to have had anything to do with them if I were a contractor, a builder, or a carpenter. They are far from what they ought to be. The time has arrived when there should be some inquiry into this sort of thing. I realize fully, and I sympathize with the War Service Homes Division in this respect, that there are cases of ex-servicemaintenance period in regard to these men seeing homes being built by private contractors and deciding that they will see the contractors and endeavour to purchase them on completion. They then seek financial assistance from the division, whicb informs them that it will have to examine the homes when they are completed to ensure that they comply with its building standards and, if they so comply, the division will finance their purchase. It may be that on occasions an ex-serviceman states that although the home may not be up to standard be will take it because he is anxious to have a home, but that does not excuse the division or its inspectors for taking over buildings witb faults that are manifestly the result of bad workmanship. The Minister for War Service Homes has now entered the chamber. I repeat for his benefit that he took exception to my airing of this sort of complaint on a previous occasion. As I have pointed out, this Parliament is the forum which protects the people from abuses. It not only protects the public and the Government, but it also protects instrumentalities like the War Service Homes Division itself, inasmuch as publicity in this Parliament brings contractors to a realization that if they skimp their work and sell inefficiently constructed buildings to ex-servicemen somebody in this Parliament will direct the attention of the people and the responsible government department to what is going on. Future purchasers of such homes are thereby probably given some protection, as is also tbe staff of the War Service Homes Division. I hope that the Minister will not take exception to my remarks to-night. On the 21st February, I asked him personally in this House to visit the Glenroy estate and examine the homes of which I had complained. I told him that I was prepared to substantiate everything I had said about them. I am prepared to do tbe same in regard to all that I have to say to-night about homes being purchased by the division under a slightly different system at Fawkner. I hope that this sort of thing will cease and that the division will be enabled, partly as a result of my remarks, to bring contractors up to the mark. It has been said that there is a homes. Such a period is obviously necessary to enable the contractors to repair any faults that may be due to slight structural defects that were not manifest wben tbe homes were handed over. But to contend that the results of the fitting into houses of doors that were warped before they were fitted, and the installation of window frames that were out of plumb before they were put in, are things that ought to be attended to in a maintenance period, is fantastic. Those are structural defects which should have been noticed during tbe course of construction. A similar state of affairs exists in regard to the laying of floors. When the man laying one floor had got half way across he obviously laid a board that was buckled horizontally, and kept on laying more boards until there was a series of gaps in the floor boards of half the room. That is obviously a defect that should be corrected during the course of construction and in such a case the division's inspector should instruct the contractor to lay no further flooring until the first defect has been remedied. That -obviously should not be regarded as a maintenance fault to be corrected afterwards, because, if it were the ex-service occupant of the home would have to pull up his carpets and the whole floor would 1 have to be taken up, and the skirting boards would have to be removed. I saw one door jamb that had a length of wood 1 inch thick inserted to make it plumb. It will never be a good door jamb. It sliould never have been allowed to remain iu that structure. That is not in the nature of a minor fault that shows up some time after tbe house has been handed over. I take exception to this sort of thing going on. I know tbe Minister is sympathetic. I know that he has his problems, and that the AVar Service Homes Division also has its problems. I have heen told that the ex-servicemen's organizations police this sort of thing for ex-servicemen. I know that they have taken an interest in it, but I have not forgotten an instance in this Parliament when I directed attention to an instance of this sort of thing that had occurred at Sunshine, and the Minister was able to say that an ex-servicemen's organization had said that the house was all right. It was not all right despite the view of that organization, and the fact that it was not all right was proved when the War Service Homes Division ultimately forced the contractor to repair the faults complained of. I omitted to mention that in one of these houses in Shirley-street, Fawkner, tbe plaster in one bedroom can be shaken about able gentleman's time has expired. for Social Services) [10.41] I wish to make some remarks in reply to the statements made by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) in this House on the 24th February, in relation to war service homes at the Glenroy estate in Melbourne. As be said to-night, I took exception to them. It is not that I resent criticism. I took exception to tbe way in which he went about bringing the matter to the notice of the House. I welcome any lionorable member informing me or the department of any problems that are being experienced in relation to war service homes. The point was that I felt it would have been more in order had the honourable member first gone to the War Service Homes Division itself, or possibly, had come to me, about the matter. The honourable member indicates that he does not agree with that contention. We differ on tbe point. The honourable member is of tbe opinion that if he ventilates these matters in this House more good will accrue to ex-servicemen. able member's sincerity in the matter, but in view of the excellent work that the officers and technical staff of the War Service Homes Division do on behalf of ex-servicemen, I should be doing less than my duty if I failed to come to their defence now. I promised tbe honourable member for Lalor that I would have his complaint investigated The honourable member said that many of the items at Glenroy about which he complained were maintenance items. I found that to be correct. Most of the instances he brought forward were maintenance items, which means that, in fact, the War Service Homes Division would not take delivery of the homes, and until such, time as the contractor makes these defects good. Until such time such houses are still under maintenance, and the ex-servicemen are not required to pay for the work required. Technically, I suppose we should wait until a house is complete in every detail before we allow the occupants to take possession of it, but in times like .these that would be a monstrous thing to do. The stoves and the wiring to which the honourable member referred were all passed by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. In spite of that, we have the makers of the stoves remedying any faults that have developed. All I want to say on that point is that the position at Glenroy is well under control. Reverting to the difference of opinion between the honourable member and me on this matter, I shall quote some facts that I have obtained. I refer first to a communication which relates to the ANZAC",67,Shipping Telephone Other Dissatisfied Ex Servicemen And Health And Medical Within The Last Week I Have Received A Com

217,Mr Townley,"I accept the honorHouse section of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in Melbourne. It readsMr Moore, of ANZAC House, telephoned this morning and reported that at a meeting of the Glenroy Sub-Branch last night, the question of recent press statements was brought up for discussion. Members of the "" Progress Committee "" They were the gentlemen who went to the honourable member for Lalorwho were present apparently could not state a good case in support of the approach to Mr have received every co-operation from Mr Pollard, M.P. Mr Hands (President of the Progress Committee) was severely criticized by speakers for bis pavt in having complaints dealt with independently and not through the Ho'usiug Committee at ANZAC House. At the end of the discussion the meeting passed a resolution dissociating itself entirely from the representations made to Mr Pollard and specifying that the State Branch (ANZAC House) be informed accordingly in order that the possibility of the irregular action in this instance being repeated may be avoided. I shall now refer to the"" Legacy adviser's report about a certain widow whose name, was mentioned. name of a war widow. a press statement. viewed this woman, and he considered all complaints frivolous excepting perhaps adjustments to the stove. He considered other items either minor complaints or the applicant's 'own responsibility. suggest that those reports are"" far more effective than anything that I can say in support of my departmental officers. Further. The report statesMessrs. Hands and L-'Huillier said tlie purchasers felt that they liad some grounds for making representations because of the Contractors failure to attend to maintenance items within a reasonable time. when Mr Pollard was spoken to on this matter it was not thought tliat he would make a statement in Parliament but rather that Mr Pollard would either go to the Deputy Director or speak to the Minister. Therefore, I suggest that the honourable member for Lalor adopted the wrong attitude to this matter. wish to read from the annual report of the Glenroy sub-branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. attempting to bring evidence to support my argument that the officers of the War Service Homes Divisioni n Melbourne are doing a particularly good job and are not likely to slum any of these houses, as has been suggested. The branch reportedThe War Service Homes and Housing Committee meets regularly each month . . . . the Deputy Director attends all meetings and gives much valuable help and advice on housing matters to all delegates. The Sub-Branch has been most successful in helping members with their housing problems and 1 am pleased to report that we G. T. Bell and his staff. If you have any housing problem contact your representatives, as they are only too willing to help you. Finally, I throw into the ring the following letter, whicb was written by a resident :We have recently moved into one of your Group Homes at Glenroy, and would like to express our gratitude to you and your staff for making it possible for us to have our own home. We arc very pleased with it and the service which the builder ( Mr Bill Jarvis) has given us since we arrived; he has left no stone unturned as to making our own and neighbors conditions comfortable. I did not mention the We find it our duty to write this letter ot appreciation, as there are always people ready No , it occurred in to abuse assistance offered by your department-bu t few to praise. The adviser interI suggest, in these circumstances, that I was perfectly entitled to take exception to the manner in which the honourable membev fov Lalor brought this matter I before the House. That w ill no doubt always be an issue between us. The officers in the War Service Homes Division have done a magnificent job for ex-servicemen. They are doing everything to assist them to own their own homes, and are also doing everything in their power to get them into their houses as quickly as possible. If the honourable However, member for Lalor will approach them approach them. I shall exercise my rights in this Pavliament, and I challenge the Minister for Social Services( Mr. NowI Townley) to go out and look at these houses. tion about the honourable member exercisI am ing his rights.

221,Mr Townley,"The r e is no quesbefore the House to show that the officers in Victoria are failing in their duty. ter's time has expired. wish to direct the attention of the Grovernment to the shocking increase of shipping freights between Australian and Tasmanian ports. cause of Tasmania's geographic position, it depends entirely on shipping for the carriage of goods from the mainland to its ports and from its ports to the mainland. from Tasmania to the mainland and hack again handle between 80 and 90 per cent, of all goods that leave and enter the island. The remainder of the go.ods are carried by air. The economic stability of Tasmania is involved in adequate shipping and just freight cliarges. To illustrate the volume of our imports ancl exports I shall cite some figures. In 1950-51 our imports were valued at £30,317,000, and they included such items as manufactured goods, machinery, foodstuffs, raw materials, clothing, groceries, gypsum, salt, huilding materials, wheat and so on. Our exports for the same year totalled £26,870,000. Eighty-five per cent, of our manufactured goods are exported, and the other exports include fresh fruit, jam, fruit pulps, potatoes, fish, hops, woollen textiles, zinc, copper, bronze strip, tin ore, sheelite, timber, cement, and paper. From 1939 to 1950 our trade increased by 100 per cent., and that placed a tremendous demand on shipping. However, to-day importers, primary producers and those engaged in the timber trade are receiving sledge-hammer blows because of excessive freight charges. Our economy, in fact, is being slowly strangled by increasing freight charges. The cost of living is being inflated through ridiculously increased freights on all imports and the economic survival of many primary producers and trading sections is being gravely threatened. Excessive freights have already forced large quantities of Tasmanian timber off the mainland markets, and much of our good timber is now being left in tbe bush. Moreover, SOO to 1,000 timber workers have left their union. Tasmania is the only State that is utterly dependent on sea carriage, and because of soaring costs the timber is being priced out of good mainland markets. In spite of a reduction of 10s. a 100 super, feet in January this year, the exporters of Tasmanian timber are still paying freight of 28s a 100 super, feet. In 1939, the freight charge was Beonly 5s. 6d. a 100 super feet. Wharfage charges bring the costs to 35s. a 100 super, feet, or an increase of more than 500 per cent, in freight charges on timber. Victorian millers, by comparison, pay only Ships at present trading 10s. 7d. a 100 super, feet for seasoned timber carried from Orbost to Melbourne. How can Tasmania compete under such one-sided conditions? An increase of freights will gradually price Tasmania out of the markets in respect of primary produce and timber. In connection with rjotatoes there is a still more tragic story. In 1939, it cost 19s. a ton to ship potatoes from Tasmania to Sydney. To-day, it costs £6 19s. 6d. a ton, which is a 650 per cent, increase. Strange to say, Western Australia is paying only a 450 per cent, increase on the 1939 figures. Why there is a difference of 200 per cent, between Tasmania and Western Australia. I have not yet discovered, but I suggest that the anomaly requires close examination by a federal authority. Another scandalous anomaly characterizes the Tasmanian potato industry, and that is that the extraordinary price leakage between the producer in Tasmania and the consumer in Sydney. The difference between the price that the grower receives ancl the cost to the Sydney housewife is over £30 a ton. That £30 goes to various middlemen, retailers, shipping companies and other groups between the growers and the consumers. That is a scandalous state of affairs, and should be remedied. The export of potatoes from Tasmania was a great industry in the war years, but to-day it is languishing. It is being crucified by the lack of stability, ruinous freight charges and uncertain prices. The industry is at the mercy of price fixers and freight fixers on the mainland. The industry has been ruined, as Labour said it would be if the 1947 referendum on",70,Shipping Telephone Other Dissatisfied Ex Servicemen And Health And Medical Within The Last Week I Have Received A Com

223,Mr Dtjthie (Wilmot) [10.51],"1prices were not carried. Because pricefixingis not on a federal basis, Tasmania is at the mercy of mainland price-fixers. The pre-war premium on Tasmanian Brownells was £3 a ton more in Sydney than our other varieties, but that has long been submerged in uniform stacking and selling. In 1939 the freight cost per ton of Tasmanian jams sold to Queensland was 22s. To-day it is £22 a ton. In 193S the freight on jam carried from Launceston to Melbourne was 20s. a ton, but to-day it is 99s. a ton. In 1938 the freight from Launceston to Sydney was 22s. a ton, now it is 126s. a ton. Therefore, freight charges have increased by 500 per cent. The Retailers Association in Tasmania, the Tasmanian fruit farmers, the Chambers of Commerce, the Potato Marketing Board, the State Government, and federal members all speak with one voice and say that Tasmania is getting a shocking deal from shipping companies in connection with freight rates. I raise the matter here because the Australian Government has a Minister for Shipping and Transport, and I suggest that the Government can investigate this matter with a view to ascertaining whether there is any justice in price rises and freight charges such as those to which I have referred. I know that shipping companies have to meet increased costs in ship construction, repairs, labour and so on, but I cannot be convinced that such increases justify 500 per cent, or 600 per cent, increases of shipping freights, within ten years. I point out to honourable members that Huddart Parker Limited, who is listed with 110 other companies in Rydge's journal of March this year at page 223-224, shows a 12 per cent, dividend on ordinary shares ancl 6 per cent, on preference shares. Its ordinary share dividend is exceeded by only ten other companies out of the 110. That is not too bad for a company that states that it has so many extra costs to meet. Other companies, such as the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited, W. Holyman& Sons Proprietary Limited and Howard Smith Limited also handle a large number orable member's time has expired. [11.1] I direct the attention of this House to a serious matter, which is exercising the minds of a considerable number of people in Australia. I refer to the practice, which I understand is going on in the capital cities of the Commonwealth, of permitting members of the security service, and even members of the State police forces, to tap private telephone lines. Accusations of this kind have been made in the House on other occasions, and the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) has invariably denied that any such interference is taking place. I have been informed that the practice is rife in Adelaide at present, and that private telephone lines are being tapped by people who, if the Minister's statement was a truthful one-and we have no reason to regard it as being otherwiseare acting without the authority of the Postmaster-General. This country has reached a sorry state of affairs if members of the security service and State police are able to gain access to telephone exchanges for the purpose of listening to private telephone conversations. We have surely not reached the stage when this country is to be harassed by the operations of a gestapo, an Ogpu or some other form of secret police. Surely people may discuss their business over the telephone without being harassed hy these intrusions into their telephone conversations. ber is inventing his statements as he goes along. honourable member for Eisher( Mr Adermann) would not like to have his private telephone conversations subjected to such control. able member's proof that the practice is being followed? propose to give to the honourable member for Fisher the information that I have at my disposal.

It is all very well for Government supporters to. pretend that everything is all right because the Government which they support is in office. They should remember that in politics the birds of to-day are the feather dusters of tomorrow. They should not seek to justify the tapping of private telephone lines merely because they happen to he in power to-day. They should uphold the democratic rights of a free people. Irrespective of whether a Labour government, or a Liberal government is in office, no government has the right to stand idly by while these practices continue. I have evidence of the practice to which I refer being carried out in Adelaide the House. no need for the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) to become heated about the matter. It is just as important to him as it is to me, and to his friends and my friends. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) can verify the fact that we have good reason to believe between you. that statement. An honourable member of the standing of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden), who has been Mr Deputy Speaker, should know better than to make such a statement. The honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Melbourno ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition, can verify the fact that telephone conversations are being tapped because of the clicking noise no need to joke about this matter probably caused by mice. colleagues has suggested that it may be caused by ratbags. There is evidence that this practice is being resorted to. It is time that we asserted our rights, as a free people, to prevent such occurrences. We should not let a gestapo or an Ogpu interfere with the rights of the people. toria, a section of the people ifl being deplorably and inhumanely neglected. The people concerned were almost completely forgotten until the Hon. William Barry became the Minister for Health recently. I refer to the mentally sick. ber for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) says that this is a State matter. If he will allow me to proceed, I shall quickly convince him that it is a Commonwealth matter. The inmates of the Kew Mental Hospital live in the most squalid conditions. They are guarded and fed, but they are certainly not cared for. No member of this Parliament who has visited the asylum could fail to be impressed by the degrading conditions that exist there. The Commonwealth should assist the Victorian Minister for Health in his endeavours to bring about an amelioration of the conditions under which these unfortunate people live. They have no votes, and thcy exercise no political influence, and consequently, they are forgotten. In 1951-52, the Commonwealth paid to the Victorian Government for the relief of tuberculosis sufferers an amount of £2,700,000. A sufferer from tuberculosis, with a dependant wife, receives an allowance of £9' a week. A sufferer without dependants receives £5 10s. a week. If the sufferer is undergoing hospital treatment, he receives £3 7s. 6d. a week. In addition the Victorian Government receives from the Commonwealth for every patient in a public hospital, an amount of 8s. a day for the bed which he occupies. Considerably more than £1,000,000 was paid to the Victorian Government in 1951-52 by this Government in respect of persons who occupy beds in public hospitals. The position is absolutely different in regard to patients in mental homes and institutions. For every inmate of a mental home, the Commonwealth pays to the States ls. 2d. a day on condition that no payment is",72,Shipping Telephone Other Dissatisfied Ex Servicemen And Health And Medical Within The Last Week I Have Received A Com

Thus, more than 25 per cent, of the *patients in mental hospitals at that date were of pensionable age. arrangement for the contribution of ls. 2d. a day? made in the dim, distant past. It does not reduce the responsibility of this Government, whicli is saving a large sum in age pensions at the expense of the comfort and well-being of people who cannot take cave of themselves and who have no political influence. H a d this Government paid as much for every mental patient as it pays for every patient in a public hospital, it would have contributed an additional amount of over £1,000,000 to Victoriai n 1951-52. H a d it paid the age pension for mental patients of pensionable age, it would have made a contribution of hundreds of thousands of pounds. This problem should be considered independently of party political considerations. It is above the battle of politics.

It is planned to be ready in 1955. (e) Two new open hearth furnaces with a combined capacity of about 850,000 tons of steel a year aire under construction at Port Kembla. (/) Construction of a rolling mill of 50,000 tons a year capacity is about to commence at Kwinana, near Perth. the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) asked mo the following question:I ask thc Prime Minister to state the reasons for Uie decision recently implemented that Commonwealth employees aged 65 years or more must be dismissed. Has the rule been applied impartially? IB the instruction a denial of the right honourable gentleman's previously expressed view that men of pensionable age should be encouraged to remain in employment? Further to my promise to make inquiries about the matter I now advise thc honourable member that it is the policy of the Public Service Board that, under normal circumstances, the services of employees should not be retained after they reach the age of 65 years. This policy is followed wherever practicable, but staffing conditions do not always permit the close pursuit of the poliey. For instance, it may be necessary to employ persons over 65 years of age where there is no suitable person under that age available to perform the work or where a person has special qualifications for a particular job. Public Service inspectors have been instructed to keep lists of Commonwealth employees over the age of 65 and to review these lists periodically in the light of the nature of the positions occupied, the fitness of the occupants for employment and the availability of suitable persons under the age of 65. No instructions on the matters have been issued recently. The fact that some employees over the age of 65 have recently been replaced by younger men is entirely due to a review of the situation, having shown that the younger men were availablo for employment. The implementation of thc instruction is not a denial of the view that men of pensionable age should be encouraged to remain in employment, but it must be borne in mind that the needs at Port of the community require a balanced employment age in order to keep the supply of labour moving forward at a reasonable rate. This, concept applies, not only to the Public Service, but also to industry.",76,Telephone Services
