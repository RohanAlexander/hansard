Thursday Last, The Tellers Had Made An Error In Recording A Division Hy Substi","tuting tbe name of Mr Hay for that of Mr Groom, but that it would be rectified in the Votes and Proceedings. the House ordered that the report of the Royal Commission on the Sugar Industry, together with the minutes of evidence, be printed. dence were presented in print, but when the instruction to print and issue as a Parliamentary Paper was sent to the Government Printing Officei t was found that the type of tlie evidence, which was a document comprising 600 pages, had been broken up, and that the cost of resetting the type and issuing the document as a Parliamentary Paper would amount approximately to £500. of the printed copies of the evidence had been obtained for purposes of reference by honourable members, and, with the concurrence of the House, I do not propose to incur the heavy expense of reprinting it. issued to honourable members, and copies are available in the usual way. the Commission is of great importance, and the type of much bulkier publications has been kept before. In this case the type may have been broken up inadvertently. WhatI should like to know is whether a sufficient number of copies of the evidence that has been published will be kept in the Library to permit of any member consulting it who desires to do so? If there will not be enough copies, ment? it would be advisable to incur the expense of Teprinting the evidence, even though that might be heavy. there will be ten copies of the evidence [40] available to honourable members. Of course, if the House desires that the evidence shall be reprinted, it will be reprinted. It is only with the concurrence of honourable members that I propose not to incur the expense of, perhaps unnecessarily, setting up the type again. long it is usual to keep evidence in type, but I think that, generally, matter is kept reported that, on standing in type for some time. It cannot be the practice of the Government Printing Office to melt down type directly a few copies of an important document have been struck off, because, if that were done, we might frequently be unable to obtain copies of very important documents. Committee look into the matter? Mi'. SPEAKER I think that the matter might very well be inquired into by the Printing Committee, which could Both the report and the evireport its conclusions to the House.

A little later I asked h i m whether, as he had represented the consumers at the Conference, he could say what the consumers would he called on to pay for their sugar. To that his reply was that he did not know what the price of sugar would he when retailed. vote on the agreement, no mention was made of the retail price of sugar. I object to the fixing of the retail price of sugar at 6d., which gives the growers of cane and the millers I d . per lb., or £9 6s. 8d. per ton-to divide between them, leaving l i d . per lb. to he swallowed hy some one else. the adjournment of the House last F r i day to discuss this matter had not the honourable member for Wannon( Mr. Rodgers) prevented me from doing so, by moving it to discuss another matter which he considered of great importance. This is also a matter of vital importance to the consumers of sugar in Australia. The people wish to know why the price of sugar has been fixed at 6d. per l b . It has not been fixed at that sum because of the agreement. that statement is the Prime Minister, who, on Thursday, saidI t is necessary to emphasize that the increase in the price of sugar to 6d. is mainly due, not to the contract made with the Queensland Government for the purchase at £30 6s. 8d., hut to the high price of at least 100,000 tons of foreign sugar which we have bought, or shall be obliged to buy, to cover the deficiency of local sugar that will exist at the end' of the coming season. On the 17th March the Prime Minister said, in the course of a Ministerial statementWhenI tell honourable members that in the last season of 1910-20 we had to import over 100,000 tons of sugar, they will see very * clearly how important a factor the world's price is to us. According to that statement, the Government had then, taken the action according to the statement made by the right honourable gentleman on Thursday last, they have yet to take. On the motion for the adjournment Friday, the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) inquired what quantity of sugar had been imported by the Government, and whether duty would be. paid upon it. The Acting Treasurer ( Sir Mr Tudor. Joseph Cook) stated that no duty would be paid. In reply to that statement on the part of the MinisterI direct attention to the Budget papers for 1919-20, which were presented to the Housei n October last. On page 12 it is set out that the estimated revenue from sugar, including glucose, for the current year is £390,000. I think that the Minister for In connection w i th the Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) said, by way of interjection on Friday, that since the sugar would be imported by the Commonwealth,' no duty would be paid. If that is so, why does the Treasurer ( Mr. Watt) in his Budget papers estimate a revenue of £390,000 from this source? These figures must have been prepared by the Customs Department in September I would have moved last. practice ? The Budget papers show that in 1915-16 the duty collected in respect 'of sugar and glucose was £587,028 ; in 1916-17, £453,380; in 1917-18, £ 5 1 , 1 1 9; and in 1918-19, £107,309. The Government knew as far back as September last that they would have to impart during the current financial year at least 65,000 tons of My authority for sugar. On Friday last I asked the M in ister for Trade and Customs, on notice, the following questions:1. How many tons of sugar were imported by the Commonwealth Government from the 30th June, 1919, to date? 2. From what countries has this sugar been imported? 3. How much per ton was paid f.o.b.? 4. What has it cost for freight? I was informed by the honourable gentleman that the information was being obtained. Statistics in regard to sugar i m portations are more readily obtainable than in rspect of any other line. There are only four Australian ports at which raw sugar is received. The sugar refining mills are situated at New Farm, Brisbane; Pyrmont, Sydney; Yarraville, Melbourne; and Port Adelaide, South Australia. The figures as to imports are which, available' at those mills, and a telegram to each of them would have enabled the Minister at once to give me the exact in formation that I sought. ber think that information can be obtained off-hand on a Friday morning? available ?",19,Adjournment Formal Retail Price Of Sugar

I dare say that 30,000 or 40,000 tons of raw sugar has been sold to the public during the last twelve months at the rate ordinarily charged for refined sugar. Hitherto the admits that they were 27,000 tons short .people have been paying 3^d. per lb. for in their estimate. sugar, but they are now to be charged 6d. extra price in respect of"" only the 27,000 per lb., and people naturally want to tons?

29,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Minisdo so to clearly explain the position for the information of the public. In order that I may make the most use of my time, I shall, read my statement as I have set it out this morningThe increase in the price of sugar has very naturally excited general comment, and the Australian public is anxious to know what are.the reasons for the higher price. In order that the sugar position may be clearly understood, a detailed statement, leading from the past to the present, must be given. It is necessary to charge £ 4 9 per ton wholesale, and 6d. per lb. retail, because the estimated supplies to the 30th June, 1920, cost an average price of £ 5 8 per ton refined. The net return from sales at £ 4 9 per ton is £ 4 5 10s.;' therefore every ton of sugar at present being sold -eve n at the enhanced price of 6d leaves a net loss of £ 1 2 10s. per ton. That is to say, the Commonwealth Government will lose on the 75,000 tons of sugar sold at 6d. a lb. between the 23rd March and 30th June of this year no less that £943,302. If the Government were to charge such a price for the sugar it has purchased to make up the shortage in the supply of Australian grown sugar as would enable it to come out square, and not involve it in the loss of nearly a million pounds, the retail price would have to. be at least lOd. Some short-sighted people condemn the proposal for the purchase of the Queensland sugar crop for a period, of three year's at £30 Os. 8d. per ton for raw sugar. The Leader of the Opposition is not one of them. the price is too high, that in two years or one year the price of foreign sugar w ill f a l l , and that they could import sugar at a much lower price. I will deal with other aspects of the question later, but first let me say that, unless the Queensland crop is purchased by the Commonwealth Government, the price of sugar in Australia, for the next four months at least, will be lOd. per lb. The Commonwealth cannot afford to lose £943,302 by selling sugar at £ 1 2 10s. a ton less than it cost, unless it sees its way to recoup itself of a part, if not the whole, of its loss by handling the Queensland crop. Therefore, sugar can only be retailed at 6d. if we purchase the Queensland crop as provided in the draft agreement laid before Parliament. Otherwise, the price must be lOd. per l b . It is estimated that the new Queensland and New South Wales crop handled by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company w ill amount to about 145,000 tons. But as the crop is late this year, there w ill be a gap from the 1st July, 1920, of at least a month before the new crop comes in , during which the public must be supplied with foreign sugar. The following figures show the position at a glance: . Tons. Per ton. Estimated supplies to 30th June, 1920 . . .. 75,464 at £58 0 0 Estimated sales to 30th June, 1920 . . .. 75,464 at 45 10 0 Loss per ton £12 10 0 Loss on 75,464 tons, at £1210s. per ton-£943,302 . Estimated supplies-1s t July, 1920, to 1st March, 1921 :Tons. Per ton. Cubas (estimated) .. 20,000 at £75 0 0 Queensland and N.S.W. .. 145,000 at 38 0 0 Total. . . 165,000 at £42 10 0 (Average) With' selling price net receipts at £45 10s., this leaves a profit per ton of approximately £ 3 ; or an estimated net profit during eight months, from 1st July, 1920, to 1st March, 1921, on 165,000 tons of £495,000. The position, therefore, may be summarized as follows:Loss on sugar sold 23rd March to 30th June, 75,484 tons, at £12 10s. .. £943,302 Loss on 20,000 tons Cubas, sold from 1st July to new crop .. .. 590,000 £1,533,302 Profit on Queensland and N.S.W. crop, 1st July to 1st March, 1921-145,00 0 tons, at £7 10s. .. . . £1,987,500 Credit balance in sugar account on 31st December, 1919 .. .. 225,000 Deficit-£220,80 2 .. £1,312,500 Against this estimated debit balance of £220,802 must be placed the possible receipts from the operations of the M ill a quin Refinery. Should the Millaquin Refinery secure sufficient local sugar to make 20,000 tonsof refined sugar at an estimated cost of £38 per ton, a profit of",21,Adjournment Formal Retail Price Of Sugar
30,Mr Ttjdok,No; I am not.,22,Adjournment Formal Retail Price Of Sugar
31,Mr Hughes,"Thos e critics say that£7 10s. per ton would accrue to the Government, or £150,000, which will reduce the debit balance to £70,000. From the figures given it will be clearly seen-(1 ) that the price now charged for sugar to the public is very much lower than the price paid by the Commonwealth for the sugar; (2) that this high-priced sugar is the only sugar available for the next four months; (3) that the Commonwealth will make a loss of nearly £1,000,000 by selling sugar at 6d.; and (4) that it can only afford! to do so if it acquires the Queensland crop at £30 6s. 8d., pools it with the foreign sugar, and sells at a uniform price. As I have said, it is estimated that the next season's Queensland and ""New South Wales sugar crop will not exceed 145,000 tons. As the yearly consumption is over 280,000 tons, it is obvious that further purchases of foreign sugar must be made in order to supply the community until the 1921 crop is available. The amount necessary will he anything from 110,000 to 130,000 tons. The price to be paid for this is quite problematical. If , howapart from this, the sugar question canever, the price paid enables the Commonwealth to sell sugar at less than 6d. a lb. after 1st March next, it will most certainly do so. As it is obvious from the facts given that there is,, and can be, no alternative to an increased price for retail sugar, and that, whether this price is to be 6d. or lOd -the price paid' for the foreign sugar purchased and now in course of conaumption-thes e world's prices cannot, of course, be affected by any action taken either by the Government or hy any or all of its citizens-the question whether the priceproposed to be paid for the locally-grown sugar, viz., £30 6s. 8d., is too high, must be dealt with. First, let me point out that this price is far the lowest at present ruling for sugar in any part of the world. And this despite the fact that all cane-sugar grown in other parts of the world is produced by black labour at very low wages, while Australian, sugar is raised by white labour, and the wages paid to' the workers are the highest in the world. 'Secondly, the sugar-grower, as a primary producer, ia as much entitled as is the grower of wheat, meat, or wool, to something approaching the world's parity. If the sugar-grower got even one-half of the world's price to-day, he would receive more than the price he is willing to take. He does this in return for a fixed price for three years. The industry is stabilized, and he is encouraged to increase his output. If the Commonwealth does not give him this guarantee, he will, of course, be entitled to ask that he shall get something approaching the world's parity for this coming season's crop. But it is said that the price paid under the proposed agreement is too high. In all the circumstances, I do not think so. It has to be remembered that the cost of producing sugar has increased very considerably. Wages, which absorb no less than 80 per cent, of the cost of production, have increased very much, and the workers are, owing to the increased cost of living and other reasons, demanding a further increase. The growers quite recognise that an increase will be granted by the Courts, and that some increase is justified. The price is not too high. But, quite not be regarded merely from the standpoint of commerce and industry. It is one of very great national importance. The electors of the Commonwealth have long recognised this. The sugar industry and the conditions formerly existing therein are chiefly responsible for the almost unanimous adoption of the policy known as ""White Australia."" Australians recognised that it was vital to the safety of Australia that the sugar lands of the great, rich, northern State of Queensland should be cultivated, and by white labour. In the face of much opposition it adopted this policy, knowing that it would probably have to pay more for its sugar, but satisfied that it was essential to the defence and the progress of Australia that white men should' be encouraged to settle upon and cultivate thesugar lands of Queensland.. Years have passed;, the greatest war in the world involved Australia in a life and death struggle. The White Australia policy, as applied to the sugar industry, has stood the test admirably. It provided Australia during the war with the .cheapest sugar in the world, and at the same< time it sent thousands of the sons of the white sugar-growers to fight for the defence of the Commonwealth and liberty. Australians have no reason, then, to complain that now, as a result of conditions over which neither they nor tbe Queensland growers have control-the consequences of war, droughts, cyclones -the y have to pay more for their sugar than they have done for the last five years. The Australian people w ill still get sugar cheaper than any other people in the world, and they w ill do this because the Australian grower gets less than any other grower in #he world at the present time. The trouble is, not that we pay too much for Australian sugar, but that there is too little of it to supply our needs, and so we have to buy foreign sugar at nearly three times the price. Raw sugar costs £30 6s. 8d. per ton. The retail price is 6d. per l b . , or £ 5 6 per ton. Where does the £ 2 5 13s. 4d. go to ? It may be asked (1) How is the £ 3 0 6s. 8d -the price paid for raw sugar-divided ? And (2) W h y should the retail price of sugar be 6d.,which is £56 per ton? Who gets the difference? As to (1) the cane grower gets £ 1 9 14s. 5d.; (2) the miller gets £ 1 0 12s. 3d. Out of what they get, they have, of course, to pay all expenses of production, including labour. The refining and distributing costs are as follows :Cost to refine Estimated cost of freight ... 2 0 0 Coal Bags Paid to Colonial Sugar Refining Company under proposed agreement for financing, i.e., paying for the raw or foreign sugar, and managing Selling charge paid to Colonial. Sugar Refining Company To wholesale distributorsmaximum discount 5 per cent. ... To retail grocers ... From tlie foregoing it will be seen how little the cost of refining, and the amount paid to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for managing, financing, selling, and distributing, charges altogether amount to only £2 12s. 6d. per ton-a per pound, or less than one third of the amount paid to the retail grocers; so that Mr Hughes. whoever is responsible for the increased price of sugar, that responsibility can hardly be placed upon the shoulders of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The increase in the price from 3£d. to 6d. per pound is caused by : (a) The increased return necessary to balance the price of foreign sugar and avoid still heavier loss. (6) I d . per l b . of the increase paid to sugar industry. (c) l i d . per lb. in purchase of foreign sugar to meet consumption. (d) The increased amount allowed to retailers-o r more than \ d . per lb. The only increase paid to the sugar company is 2s. ""6d. per ton to cover the cost of the extra capital employed to finance the sugar turnover of, say, £14,000,000 per annum. If the sugar company receive 2s. 6d. per ton on the f u l l quantity of 280,000 tons per annum, it will only amount to £35,000, or 5 per cent., on £700,000. In other words, the total profit made by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company equals 2 per cent, of cost at £ 4 9, or £ 1 2s. 6d. per ton. (Thei n creased price of £ 4 9 as against the old price of £ 2 9 per ton-2 0 multiplied by 280,000 equals £5,600,000 per annum, and this increased turnover will certainly need more than £700,000 additional capi£ s. d. tal to handle it . ) The extra cost of bags ... ... 1 3 0 and coal cannot at present be accurately stated, but will amount to a large sum ... ... ... 0 10 0 during the year. ... ... ... 0 16 0 Why was not enough cheap foreign sugar bought to prevent increase in price ? Some critics say that the Commonwealth ought to have foreseen the end of the war, the shortage in the local sugar crop ... ... 1 2 6 due to cyclones and droughts, and bought enough to make any increased price unnecessary. I will t r y to answer these 0 7 0 gentlemen in a very few words. In February, 1919, nearly fourteen months ago, the price of new crop sugar in Java was ... ... 1 10 0 £22 per ton, and it is quite easy "" after ... 8 9 5 the event "" to ask why more sugar was not then purchased. The answer is that at that time the quantity purchased was expected to suffice, and that in the event of more sugar being needed it would not affect the price. These be required for fourteen or fifteen months or more, and that the price was little more than Jd. not generally expected to increase. However, the unexpected happened, and Java sugar advanced to nearly £100 per ton, including exchange, and as President Wilson declined to endorse the recommendation of the Sugar Equalization Board to again purchase 4,000,000 tons-the output of Cuba at £25 per ton-the price broke, and speculation soon forced it up to £45 or more. The Java sugar-owners in Holland evidently received early news of Germany's plight and the coming of tbe armistice, as prices of Java sugar went up -with a bound, helped by the foundation of the Java Sugar Trust to handle and control all sugar, and the release by the Allies of some forty or more Dutch cargo steamers which had been held up. Then shipment of Java sugar to Europe commenced in earnest, and the glut of sugar in Java became dispersed. It has been stated in this Chamber that Java sugar was offered at £7 per ton or thereabouts. tion received was £13 10s. in August, 1018-no w some twenty months ago. These are the facts, and they speak for themselves. foresee the end of the war; it could not know that through cyclones and droughts, &c, the local crops would fall short of the estimates, and so it did not buy foreign sugar for years ahead. It has been said that the Australian consumer has had sugar at 3£d. per lb., because the Government bought foreign sugar at a low price. vernment did buy very large quantities of cheap foreign sugar, and the community has enjoyed the advantages of this for many months. Leaving out of account the foreign sugar purchased in 1918, in February, 1919, the Government purchased a parcel of 60,000 tons of Java sugar at £22 f.o.b. for shipment in October, November, and December. This was landed here at a cost of approximately £25 per ton. that the duty has been charged. It is a purely book entry, and none of the duty appears in the cost of the sugar. Extension of time granted. that the Government did purchase foreign sugar heavily, and in the quantity which the then estimated output of Queensland warranted as ample for all our needs. With regard to whether the price of foreign sugar will fall to pre-war cost, it have a few copies prepared for distribuis said that while the proposed contract with Queensland growers is good business for the consumer this year, it may not be good for the next year, or the year after, owing to the fall in the price of foreign sugar. Of course, no one can say what price foreign sugar will be in one or two years' time, but there are many good reasons for believing that the price of sugar will not fall to pre-war level during the next three years:1. Beet crops in Europe are not likely to be extensively planted this season owing to industrial troubles. When will they end? 2. Many beet sugar factories were destroyed during the war, and they will take time to rebuild. 3. Cane sugar production cannot be materially increased for some The lowest official quotatime, as more new raw sugarmills must first be provided before the cane is planted. This is a great disadvantage, The Government could not as a large sum must first be expended and a mill erected as a preliminary to cane planting. This factor prevents the opening up of many small new areas of suitable land. In Australia it is estimated the maximum output of existing raw sugar-mills, The Commonwealth Goif the season enjoys favorable climatic conditions, is 350,000 tons. The latest mill South Johnstone cost over £500,000, including tramways, and more lines are still being laid. I only wish to add, in conclusion, that the point which the honourable member stressed, namely, that the retail price of sugar was not warranted by the circumstances, has been disposed of by the facts I have given. It is only because we intend-if the agreement It is not true is approved-to pool the Queensland sugar, that we shall be able to sell at 6d. a commodity which otherwise could only be retailed at lOd. per lb. [3.38] -It is quite impossible for honourable members to have followed the figures contained in a speech such as the Prime Minister has just delivered; and I say again that before important statements of this character are delivered it should be merely an act of common courtesy to tion among honourable members.

The other night the right honourable gentleman delivered himself of a little cheap clap-trap by saying that he was not God Almighty, .and thus could not have foreseen the end of the war, and that, therefore, the Government had mot felt disposed to purchase sugar. The Prime Minister has just stated that twenty months ago sugar was purchasable in Java for £13 per ton. A few months afterwards, when the Government bought, it had risen to £22 per ton. It is a fact that merchants approached the Government and asked for permission to purchase sugar when it was obtainable in any quantity in Java at £7 10s. per ton, but the Government refused to allow them to do so. that? eight months before the armistice. have got any ships then. member will persist in these silly objections. He now alleges that the Government refused to allow merchants to buy Java sugar because there were no ships available. pared to take the risk of getting shipping; some, indeed, had ships available,' and were prepared to bring the sugar down here. And there was.not so very much foresight required to see what the position would be, for some of those same merchants bought sago, tapioca, .and other products of Java at the time when the Government were refusing to allow them to purchase sugar. And they made enormous profits. What is the good of all this clap-trap, and of saying that, because the Government could not have foreseen the ond of the war, they could not have bought sugar? were unable to carry on owing to the want of sugar applied to the Government for permission to purchase the commodity, but were refused, although at the time there were 800,000 tons of sugar lying in Java which could have been bought at less than £7 10s. per ton. I have taken the trouble to ascertain what is likely to be the effect of the increase in the price of sugar on fruit growers. Last year Melbourne jam factories bought 976 tons of quinces and 2,'050 tons of melons, hut this year neither quinces nor melons will be bought iby the factories. The .quinces were purchased at £10 per ton. The factories also bought 3,000 bushels of figs .and 2,000 bushels of pears; but now, owing, first to the scarcity of sugar, and later to the increase in tihe price of the commodity, they refuse to buy either figs or pears. In fact, it is quite safe to say that if sugar retains its present price practically the whole of the less valuable varieties of fruit, such as the cheaper kinds of plums, quinces, apples and oranges, will cease to be converted into jam. ber tell us how we are to get cheaper sugar ?

MrM c WILLIAMS But at this time the Commonwealth Government were preventing any one from purchasing sugar abroad and bringing it into Australia. chased the sugar abroad, even if they did not bring it into Australia. MrM c WILLIAMS W o u l d any one imagine that a person would purchase such a perishable commodity as sugar if there was a prohibition against bringing it intoAustralia ? in Java and sold it to America. MrM c WILLIAMS have referred to this aspect of the question if the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) had not again indulged in "" a little bit of slinging off "" this afternoon about foresight. There was no foresight on my part. I repeat now that some of the men who were refused permission' to buy sugar did buy tapioca and sago, and land it in Australia, and make an enormous profit out of it . Good luck to them for having had the requisite foresight! Several honourable members MrM c WILLIAMS It profiteering. If persons can buy commodities uncommonly cheaply, and sell them at a fair and reasonable price, it is not profiteering. Australia is in a very awkward position. Sugar is being bought in Queensland at-a price which is less than that at which it can be bought in other parts of the world, b u t I differ from the Prime Minister when he says that the shortage of sugar throughout the world will continue L e t me give the for three years. Of course, it is all a matter of opinion and research, but it is a fact that the beet fields of Germany and Austria were not injured by the war. They went out of cultivation He had simply because the beet cultivators were taken into the army, and Germany had no means of exporting beet sugar even if she had manufactured it . We know that thab country is to-day in the direst extremities to produce something which at that time-. There she can export for cash with which to retrieve the terrific slaughter which has been made in tlie rates of exchange between her and the rest of the world. Great Britain is permitting Germany to deal in certain lines, and if there is one thing Great Britain wants more than another it is sugar. Prior to the war she was importing 76 per cent, of her sugar requirements from Germany and Austria. My advice is that the people of Germany are frantically reviving their beet sugar industry. It must be remembered that beet is an annual crop. It takes only one year to produce a beet crop. Therefore, I make bold to say that before three years are over Germany will be exporting beet sugar to a greater extent than before the war, and the inordinately high price of sugar will be reduced.. I repeat that our position to-day is due bo the want of common foresight on the part of those who' were controlling the sugar industry during the war. Now we I would not are told that we must accept this agreement, as it is the best that can be done in the circumstances. Britain buy Java sugar when it was at such a low price? MrM c WILLIAMS The r e was an enormous difference, between buying sugar in Java, which is at our back door, tc bring it . to Australia, and buying it to take it to Great Britain through waters infested by submarines. interjecting, A t any rate, we are told that we can was not take this agreement or leave it . I have endeavoured to obtain information on this subject from some of the best sources in Melbourne, and I say that I am not sure now that it, would not be wiser if the agreement were withdrawn altogether.

56,Mr Greene (Richmond,"Ministe robjection put forward that owing to a lack of foresight on the part of the Government foreign sugar was not bought. The honourable member for Franklin ment that he approached me some eight months before the armistice the date. tleman states that about that time he approached me with an offer to put sugar at our disposal for £7 10s. per ton. All I can say is that, while I have a fairly good memory for matters of this sort, I cannot charge it with the recollection of a single occasion. on which the honourable member ever spoke to me about sugar. If any one asked me at any time before June of 1918 to buy sugar on behalf of the Commonwealth at a low price, I think I would remember it , for the simple reason that we were then just approaching the end of a sugar season with a carry-over of 60,000 tons of sugar. In the 1917-18 season we had a carry-over of 60,000 tons of sugar, and I ask the honourable member whether he thinks that, with a carry-over of sugar to that amount, the Commonwealth Government should have speculated with public money to buy sugar which they did not know they would ever require. can remember the honourable memher standing in .his place only a few day3 ago and berating the Government because, for something we desperately needed, without the authority of Parliament we pledged 'the credit of the country. for? 1 Government bought. the honourable memher the value of consistency. He is now telling us that although we had in hand 60,000 tons of sugar at the time to which he refers, we should have speculated and bought sugar in advance, despite the obligation resting upon the Government at the time of taking f u l l delivery of all the sugar grown in Queensland. The Government could not have done that, nor could they allow the people to buy this cheap sugar, even supposing it were available at £7 10s. per ton, in view of the sugar we had on our hands at that period. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Government knew in July, 1918, that there would be a shortage during the ensuing year. I am not sure of tain extent. tell in July to within 10 per cent, what the crop would be.

It was because the cyclone, which was experienced the season before, shook the cane Mackay? which we expected a very large return. tleman will listen to what I am saying he will learn that it did not matter whether it happened in January or any other month. The fact was that, instead of getting 1 ton of sugar to 9 tons of cane, it took 13 tons of cane to produce 1 ton was that of sugar. That was something which it was utterly impossible for us to foresee. In view of that shortage of crop we bought 57,000 tons of cheap sugar at somewhere between £18 and £19 per ton, and the public have had the benefit of that sugar -. I now come to the next season. On the 14th February, 1919, I wrote to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and told them. I had some doubts as to the position in the future. Honourable members should bear in mind that we were estimating then for this period of the present year, or about fourteen months ahead, and it is not an easy matter to make estimates fourteen months ahead.",27,Adjournment Formal Retail Price Of Sugar

74,Mr Greene,"If the honourable genI told the Colonial Sugar Eefining Company that I wanted them to give me their candid opinion as to what the position was, and what .provision the Government should make to meet it . them to give us the best advice they could give, and this is the reply they sent me:. It is impossible, I venture to think, for anybody to forecast the future of the sugar market for the next eighteen months with a hope pf arriving at a conclusion which would be of the slightest value. There are so many unknown factors involved in such a speculation that the question of supplies and prices must remain altogether uncertain, and to determine whether to buy raw sugar for forward delivery, or to wait the chance of doing better later on, is purely a matter of hazard. I endeavoured in my letter of 3rd instant to tlie Federal Attorney-General' to throw some light on the position as we saw it, and you will notice that we agree to the opinion of our London agents that it will be prudent to secure a portion of supplies required next season. Since then further advices have been received from London, recommending us to commence buying, and these have, no doubt, been prompted by the strong demand, especially from Japan. As things stand, we would, if acting on our own account, and able to command freight, as well as control the selling price for refined products, buy now 40,000 tons to 50,000 tons, leaving balance of requirements to be secured 'later. That is what they thought at that time. 1919. ment acted upon that advice, and immediately purchased, not 40,000 tons, or 50,000 tons, but 60,000 tons of sugar. NowI propose to give honourable members the advice of the London agents referred to. I do not for the moment recollect the name of the London agents of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but they are the biggest sugar people in the world. of the company's letter, the 3rd February, 1919, in the following terms:According expected supplies and increased consumption do not anticipate large surplus end year, That is to say, a. large surplus in the world's marketswhich case f.o.b. values' unlikely decline materially. These experts, speaking at that time, never anticipated the rise that we have seen take place in the sugar market. If anything, their cable, which is very caref u l l y worded, shows that they rather anticipated a decline, though they did not anticipate a material decline. The cable continuesUnder these circumstances perhaps advisable I asked now purchase portion requirements OctoberNovember. At that time the estimate of the Queensland crop for the season r February, 1919. supplied to us by the best experts in the industry was, for the 1919-20 season, 205,000 tons. A f t e r having purchased for the 1918-19 season 57,000 tons of foreign sugar, we carried over, in round numbers, 17,000 tons, and we had already purchased 60,000 tons additional to meet the anticipated 1919-20 shortage. year? carry-over, the estimated crop, and the sugar we had purchased, that gave us, roughly, 283,000 tons. South Walesh i that? affect the calculations to any extent. Honourable members w ill see that that gave us a stock of 283,000 tons, when the estimated consumption was 280,000 tons. A little later we purchased an additional 21,000 tons, and we believed then, as we had every reason to, that we had suffiThey cabled at about the date cient. the additional 21,000 tons? parcel. The quotation for another parcel was in dollars, and I am not quite sure, at the moment, what the exact rate was. We had every reason to believe that we had purchased sufficient to meet our requirements; but, unfortunately, three things occurred which interfered with our calculations. The crop, which had turned out well at the beginning of the 1919-20 season, did not realize anything like what we anticipated, as we received only 167,000",28,Adjournment Formal Retail Price Of Sugar

119,Mr Ryan (West Sydney) [ 4 . 7 ],"Ithe Queensland Government and certain, other persons who recently sat in conference in Sydney. The Government have been guilty of a want of frankness in that respect, and have not shown a desire to discuss the issues raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Speaking of the agreement, I am inclined to think that the Prime Minister's action in asking for the approval of Parliament is evidence of a desire .to transfer from the executive Government to Parliament the responsibility for some particular purpose. that has been brought before the House. purpose. The matter has been brought before the House, but we have not been supplied with the information that was placed before the delegates who discussed, the matter in SydDey. Speaking for myself, I have no doubt that the Queensland Government would not agree to anything unjust as far as the proposed payment 'to the growers or the wages paid to those in the industry were concerned. But we are asked as individuals to approve an agreement, and I think that the least we can expect is that all the information placed before tlie representatives at the conference should be placed before us before we come to a decision on the matter. I am not prepared to support an agreement merely because it has been prepared by some one else in whom I have confidence. When I am asked to give my approval to such an agreement I desire to hear all the arguments, and all the circumstances surrounding it . The Prime Minister placed it before us with very scanty particulars, and obtained the approval of the House on the voices, not because he intended for one moment to ' cancel the agreement if this House did not approve of it , but because he wished to transfer to the members of this House the responsibility that properly rested upon the Government. Nowi t is an entirely ""different issue that is raised in the motion which has been moved this afternoon. The question involved in that motion is, "" Do we approve of the retail price which has been fixed for sugar?"" himself has told us that the rise to a minimum of 6d. per l b . , and possibly to a higher price in the country centres, is not due to the agreement made with the Queensland Government, but is due to the importation of foreign sugar. Yet he suggests that we have approved, not only of the agreement entered into with the Queensland Government, but also of the agreement which he has made with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and which has never been submitted to us. He desires to drag in as incidental to our approval of that agreement an approval of the retail price, which has been fixed by the Government at 6d. per lb. But before we can approve of that price, we wish to know all the circumstances surrounding It is the only agreement the importation of this sugar. We wish to know what quantity has been i m ported, from where it was imported, at what price it was imported, what amount was included in that price for exchange, and what opportunities there were for purchasing sugar at a lower price. The object of this motion is to direct attention to a matter of urgent public im portance, namely, the retail price, of sugar. The man in the street is not concerned with all bhe generalities with which the Prime Minister dealt. There is an old L a t in maxim which reads-In generalibus dolus-in generalities deceit ia concealed. The Prime Minister has dealt out to us a lot of generalities, but the average citizen is concerned' only with the fact that he is being obliged to pay 6d. per lb. for his sugar, and he naturally wishes to know the reason why. It is up to us, as representatives of the people, to inquire into the circumstances which the Government allege provide them with justification for increasing the retail price of sugar to 6d. per l b . I wish to know why. the opportunity referred to by the honourable member for Franklin( Mr. McWilliams) was not seized upon by them. He has affirmed that there are prominent merchants who deal in sugar, and who desired to obtain permission from the Government to purchase sugar in Java at £ 7 10s. per ton. No doubt, they had sumcient foresight to recognise that a shortage would occur here. W h y had not the Government that foresight? Surely they had the same opportunities for knowing what f u t u r e conditions were likely to be. The honourable member for The Prime Minister Wide Bay( Mr Corser) has said that merchants were not prevented from buying sugar abroad, but that they were prevented from bringing it here. W h a t do I understand him to mean? Does he mean that they were prevented by the Government from bringing it here?",30,Adjournment Formal Retail Price Of Sugar

I was not referring to any rise in prices as a consequence of the settled policy of the Government for the encouragement of any particular branch of primary production. I am not quite satisfied with regard to the question as to whether an amount, equivalent to £6 per ton duty, has been added to the price of imported sugar.

Johnson) -The honourable member's time has expired. not surprised at the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) suggesting that some of the burden due to the increased price of sugar should be borne by the general taxpayers, because, as a matter of fact, the taxpayers of Australia have been carrying the Queensland sugar industry for very many years and to the extent of many millions of pounds. The time will soon come when the whole policy will have to be reviewed^ To my mind the approval of the agreement-and this House did deliberately approve of it involves the approval of an increase in price. honourable member's opinion. I disagree with him. I say that the question as to what has been done in the past, or whether the Government might have done this or that, cannot very much affect whether the agreement is a good one, and whether the price is Tair. Whether the to purchase sugar at a certain price should have been seized or not, does not now concern us, although I think the Minister for Customs( Mr Greene) has shown that, so far as the Government could forecast events, they had reason to believe that they then had more than enough sugar in hand or in sight, so that Government purchase would have been I have a different imvery much in the nature of a speculation, and outside the proper sphere of the Government.

148,Member For. Franklin ( Mr Mcwilliams),"£32 or £33 per ton, would have been able to command £79 to £81 per ton, and the people of Australia would have to pay about lOd. instead of 6d. per lb. We have to decide whether it .will be worth, while, temporarily, to pay lOd. per lb. for sugar in anticipation of getting it for less next year or in the following year. The general opinion appears to be that there is no chance in the second year of getting sugar for less than £32 10s. per ton, and the only point, therefore, to consider is whether in the third year of this agreement we could get it for so much less in the open markets of the world, that it would he advantageous to pay a higher price for the first two years. So far as I can judge, the outlook is that sugar prices are unlikely to fall to anywhere near the level of pre-war days. One honourable member said that German sugar-beet fields would shortly become productive again, Lut although Germany was not invaded during the war, other factors affecting production have to be taken into consideration. machinery of German beet factories was, for several years, put to other uses. Her railway lines were torn up for use on the battle front, and there is not. much likelihood, in the future, of the employment of women in the fields again,, or the payment of the same rate of wages to men as prior to the war. The same influences are operating in all sugar-pror ducing countries, so prices are not likely to recede materially. We shall not see £7 10s., or even £17 10s., per ton for Java sugar for many years to come. It must be remembered, also, that the retail price is fixed by the Government on the higher rate now being paid for imported sugar. The Prime Minister has told us that it will fluctuate. It will go down in accordance with the price we have to pay for the imported article, and wo may very fairly anticipate that, although the price will not go up beyond the present figure, there will he in the near future a decrease as the price of the imported sugar decreases. is optimistic. I am justified in my optimism. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr men are provided for, the industry is McWilliams) spoke of the jam manufacturers and the fruit-growers. He should remember that the jam manufacturers of Australia are to-day getting sugar altogether under the world's parity. This gives them >an advantage over the rest of the world to the extent of £25 or £30 per ton. 'With that start,, and with the rebate which has been promised to them by the Prime Minister, if the world's parity falls below what they have to pay for sugar in Australia, they are really on velvet, and ought to be able to make very much better terms with the fruit-growers than they could if they had to purchase at the world's parity. There are enterprising men in the jam-making industry,, and if the manufacturers show any enterprise at all they ought to be able to capture the markets of the world at the rate at which they are now getting their sugar. Mi-.

Zealand sugar will probably be at least 6d. within the next. month, and more likely will, be up to 7d. Taking the wholematter in it§ broadest aspects, so far as we are able to forecast events for the next three years, the agreement is a good one. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) have explained' that the rise of i d . per lb., after allowing I d . each for the growers and the millers, represents the difference which the Common-' ' . wealth has to pay between the prices for the imported and local sugars when they pool the two lots.

In my opinion, the Commonwealth finds itself in the present position because of theshort-sighted policy of restricting production under the former agreement. I dare say the idea was that if there was over-production the surplus would be sold in the open market against the competition of sugar grown by black labour; but it was a short-sighted policy, however it be looked at. It would have been infinitely better, if we had had a surat present, necessary will soon be ended, plus then, to sell it at a loss, because that and that the Queensland growers will loss would not have been nearly as great as the loss we are now sustaining 1 through having to purchase outside at exorbitant prices, due to the restriction of sugar production in Australia. As a direct representative producer,, and a producer myself, I hold that that short-sighted policy has been carried out altogether too much in the past. production in Australia, the better for Australia and its consumers. However, that is spilt milk. I hope that at least it will be a salutary lesson for future Administrations. The agreement at the present increased rate to the producer' seems to be concurred in by the whole House, and the question now before the House is the price to be fixed to the consumer. liams) that the Commonwealth Government should be the supplier to the consumers at a loss. another form of taxation on the : limited number of direct taxpayers in -the Commonwealth. It has been explained that a loss of £1,000,000 will have to be met, and it is the taxpayers who will have to meet it. I object to that just as much as I object to the Government making a profit out of the products of the producers, as in the case of the wool agreement. the Government took my product, made a deal with some other individual, and appropriated the profits for the Commonwealth Treasury, without my being credited as paying the tax, because it is, after all, a tax upon the grower. I say, "" Let the grower have his property, and tax him afterwards. Let the people pay the cost of what they consume, and afterwards, in the Arbitration Court or elsewhere, levy your cost of living on the basis of actual costs."" Why should this Government become the foster-mother of the community in the manner that has bee® indicated? I was extremely sorry to hear the Prime Minister say that 6d. per lb. would not cover the whole cost. The balance will have to.be met by somebody else afterwards. I must vote for a price of 6d.. per lb., seeing that even that will not cover the' cost,, but I sincerely hope that the importation which is produce the full complement,, and more if they can, of sugar required by Australia. We shall then get back to a price of 4-Jd. per lb.

It became 3M. under the first Hughes agreement, and the Commonwealth Government made about £500,000 out of the deal. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company made £1,000,000 per year profit during the war, and has made, under the first Hughes agreement, more than is necessary to pay the whole cost of all its plants in Australia during the currency of the war.

The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) has shown in the House conclusively that under the War Precautions Powers of the Commonwealth a clause in the ""No. 1 Hughe3 agreement prohibited any increase in the milling capacity of Australian refineries, for the specific and intentional purpose of preventing increased sugar production. Thus there appears very strong evidence that the present sugar shortage has been deliberately brought about by the Commonwealth Government. And note that the Government knew in ample time that there would be a shortage, for in all the years during which we have been producing sugar in Australia there have been only two years in which the production 'has been adequate for our local requirements. There are other Australian contributory causes of the decrease in sugar production, namely(1) Cyclones and floods in Queensland sugar districts. (2) Sugar lands being devoted to butter production owing to the high prices for butter fixed by the Commonwealth Government., (3) Extraordinary increase in value of sugar lands-fro m £17 to £37 per acre-sinc e the outbreak of war, due to the fact that investment in these lands yielded veiy large returns. It may be remarked with emphasis that the Inter-State Commission has for the past twelve months been investigating the sugar production of Australia, and recommended to Parliament on the 20th February of this year that the new price for sugar should be £22 per ton. Although this expert Commission investigated the matter for twelve months, and took evidence in the sugar districts, the Government has ignored its recommendation that the price of sugar should be fixed at £22 -per ton, and has fixed it at £30 6s. 8d. per ton. tion, Mr Speaker, to the fact that the honourable member is discussing an agreement which has been finalized-to use a modern word-by this House, and therefore cannot be referred to now. tion to say that that agreement has been finalized by the House.

Mr J. H . CATTS -The increase in the price of sugar is due to the arrangements made by the Government. There are many ways in which the present artificially-created shortage could be met(1) The Federal Treasury could subsidize the sugar control to meet the present temporary sugar financial difficulty. France subsidized bread to the extent of over £50,000,000 to maintain a reasonably priced loaf during the war. (2) The 60 per cent, of sugar necessary for domestic purposes for which there will be sufficient of the Australian product for the current year, could be sold at 3jd. or 4d. per lb., and the balance necessary * for the manufacturer could bear the higher rate. Thus household sugar would be provided at reasonable rates,While sugar made up into luxuries, and less essential sugar foods than household sugar, could bear the higher prices. (3) All manufactured goods for export containing sugar should pay an export tax equal to the difference between the prices of local and foreign sugar based on the sugar content of the article. The resulting revenue should be credited to the sugar control in favour of the Australian consumption.",36,Adjournment Formal Retail Price Of Sugar

We have had no opportunity of moving a motion to refer the matter to a Committee, or of really doing any practical work in connection with it . The temporary crisis being met, there are measures which could, be put into operation which would rapidly increase the Australian production of sugar. That has been shown conclusively by the very able report of the Inter-State Commission to which I have just referred. There is neither space nor time to develop this important phase of the matter. I absolutely repudiate the whole of these arrangements, believing that better could be done, and I suggest now that if the Government wish to give the House an opportunity of making some alternative proposals, a non-party Select Committee, composed of representatives of the different sections of this House, might be appointed to see what proposals they could frame, and bring them before Parliament, so that the matter could be dealt with without party bias or the consideration of party interests. If that were done, I have no doubt that there is sumcient intelligence and resourcefulness in this House to bring about a better deal for the people of this the retail price of sugar should not be in country than that which has been arranged by the Government.

I know of no product that order 119. is distributed in respect of which there is a more rigid limitation of profits. When a merchant, under the terms arranged, and remedial has distributed his sugar, given discount, and taken the risks attendant upon his business, there is no greater profit than 2 per cent, for him, while at the utmost there is not more than 16 per cent, for the retailer, who, under the old agreement, had scarcely enough profit to pay wages. The vast majority of the distributors of this commodity to-day are not making half as much money per week as honourable members receive by way of their allowance. I ask honourable members opposite to show that they have a. conscience by putting the facts fairl y and squarely before the distributors of this country, and particularly the small men, for the vast majority of the distributors are only in a small way of business. I know that the Opposition want to take a vote on this question, their desire being to still f u r ther bewilder the public. They are actuated by purely political, instead of economic, considerations. Let them show that they are men, and be as honest as possible to these poor people, seeing that they themselves are receiving from the public purse more than double the amount that the distributors of sugar are receiving by way of profit on their enterprise.

Of course, they are not prepared to do that. The Prime Minister definitely stated during the campaign that he had made arrangements with the banks to cash the gratuity bonds over the counter, that a large number of business firms had agreed to cash the bonds of their employees, and that the Commonwealth and State Governments would do the same for the public servants; and the honourable member for Cook read .a long list of employers who had given that undertaking. But this B ill providesExcept as prescribed no interest in any war gratuity, or in any Treasury bond issued or to be issued in payment of any war gratuity shall be alienable, whether by way or in consequence of sale, assignment, charge, execution, insolvency, or otherwise howsoever. How are the employers ito cash the bonds of their employees if the bond is statutorily inalienable by any means whatsoever? dependants dies, what becomes of his bond? He gets a promise. He has a bond; b u t bonds are ho good in Heaven. According to this B ill , the soldier will be unable to leave his bond to anybody. He cannot will it away. If I read the measure correctly, the gratuity bonds will be inalienable, non-transferable, non-assignable. They will not be much good, then, to a soldier if he has not lived long enough for his bond to have become redeemable. will benefit by the death of as many soldiers as possible, and those soldiers who may die before their bonds are redeemed will meanwhile live on promises. The banks and the employers, who during the Y o u are election were promising cash for bonds, What is wrong are going to be "" "" let out'.' under the terms of this B ill . The Prime Minister, who went around the country telling soldiers that they were going to get cash for twelve over the counter-that is, when he was not screaming, "" Lie down, Bolsheviks!"" -ha s now introduced a B ill to specifically prevent the employers from keeping their promises. In his time the Prime Minister has got away with some f a i r l y i m pudent things; b u t this caps the lot. I admit, of course, that he has said, "" What does it matter what we said If our 300,000 soldiers have yesterday?"" honourable member mean when he says that when a soldier dies his bond dies with him ? thing of the sort. I said that a bond was no good to a dead man. The Government here propose to insure that a bond shall be no good to anybody else after the soldier has died.

I was like his confrere, the honourable member who sits next to him. next to me. to that particular honourable member, the returned man who was engaged in growing cabbages at the war. The honourable member for Ballarat will be interested, perhaps, to know that I was engaged in producing zinc and lead at BrokenH ill ; but, in saying that, I want him to understand that I do not claim to have been engaged-in anything useful to the Allies or tending towards carrying on the war. Contrary, however, to the views of some other honourable members on my side of the House, who, apparently, think that the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming)' should have been engaged in a more warlike undertaking than cabbage-growing, I hold that the honourable member set a good example to the working classes of Australia.. If they had only confined themselves to growing.cabbages there would not have been so many casualties. I ' hope that the working classes of Australia, and of every other country in the world, will devote their time in the future to some such useful occupation as cabbage-growing instead of concentrating their efforts upon the provision of munitions of war, in order that they may slaughter, one another in the interests of the international capitalistic class. I have nothing to apologize for or explain away in my attitude during the war. When I was returned to this Parliament in 1917, the war fever was at its height; the patriotic prejudices of the people were being exploited to the greatest possible extent. I was taunted, in this chamber and outside, with being the representative of a minority. Those who taunted me then cannot do so today, however. I have not altered my opinions; but the people whom honourable members opposite, and their kind, fooled during the war have altered their opinions, and they have sent me hack here. They have made me the representative of a majority in this chamber.

261,Mr Bell,"I think that the honorableever, I do not tliink that that opinion is held generally hy honourable members. We all have a duty to the returned soldiers, and we all have a duty to see that effect is given to what we said on the public platform during the elections, as far as lies within our power to do so. I am only concerned with my own statements on the public platform at the last election and the statements put forward by the party to which I belong. Setting aside what the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) said at the declaration of the poll, he has told us this afternoon that he was elected because he had made it clear that he did not stand for a cash gratuity. I should say that the great majority of the returned soldiers were not guided in this matter by what the honourable member for Fawkner, or any other individual, said, but by the statements of the head of the Nationalist party. There is no one who will view the matter in an unbiased way but will admit that throughout the campaign the Prime Minister, from practically every platform, gave an assurance to returned soldiers that there would be provision made for employers to pay employees cash for the gratuity bonds, and for the private banks of the country to cash their bonds over the counter. ber for Cook( Mr Catts) compiled the. utterances of the Prime Minister on the question in a tabulated form, which made very interesting reading; but without going into detail it is sumcient, in a broad way, to say that the Prime Minister laid it down that if the Nationalist party were returned to power at least a very great number of our returned soldiers would be able to get cash for their gratuity bonds. We can only be guided in this matter by our own experience, and I can say that many returned soldiers in my electorate, and I can speak only for them, have since my election come to me desiring to know when they are going to get their cash. It has been stated that the returned soldiers voted for the Nationalist party, and the Prime Minister has said that they did so because they did not desire a cash payment at all. Speaking for my own electorate, and the electorates which I visited during the election campaign, I should say, from my own experience, that an overwhelming majority of the returned soldiers were to be found in favour of a cash gratuity. I had a man on my doorstep only this morning, desiring to know when he would receive the gratuity. He has been six months back from the war, and has had no work during that time, though he has made numerous applications for work through the Repatriation Department and in other ways. Will any honourable member tell me that it would not be a godsend to that man to receive his gratuity in cash? the Bill? under the Bill? are provided for. time he could prove that his was a necessitous case he would not be very much better off if paid in cash than if given a non-negotiable bond. His is not an isolated case. There are hundreds of returned men similarly situated. Many of them have been able to get only a couple of days' work in the week, and if they are asked to prove that theirs are necessitous cases, we know the task that will be imposed upon them. From my experience The honourable memI should certainly not be prepared to say that a majority of the returned men are not in favour of a cash payment of the gratuity. Imagine the Prime Minister saying that the Government were returned to power with a majority-it is a very uncertain majority, to say the most of it Opposition, is it not? Opposition will grow, and it is solid, which is more than the Postmaster General( Mr Wise) can say for his side. What an absurd statement it is for the Prime Minister to make, that a majority of the returned soldiers voted to return the Nationalist Government to power. How does the right honourable r gentleman know that? Isi t not more likely that honourable members opposite find themselves where they are because certain vested interests in this country knew that they would have to contribute to the cash payment of a gratuity if the party on this side were returned, and,",48,Joseph Cook O F Course The Turned Soldiers And Sailors Representatives

268,' Mr Parker Moloney,"Thetherefore, put in money as they never did before to .secure the return of the present Government against the wishes of the majority of the returned soldiers. Can honourable members opposite say that that was not the case ? We are told that the trouble is that we cannot afford to pay the gratuity in cash. I recall to honourable members the time when the conscription issue was before this country. I am not going to raise that issue .how, .or to refer to the arguments for or against it , except in so far as the matter is applicable to the particular measure now under consideration. The Government said on that occasion that they required 50,000 men immediately and 16,500 every month thereafter. That is what the Prime Minister at first proposed, and our party contended that if that proposal were carried out it would involve this country in an extra expenditure of at least £50,000,000 Watt), who is now on his way to Great Britain, replying to that contention. He said, "" What nonsense it is to talk about an extra expenditure of £50,000,000.' We are the richest country in the world in proportion to our population."" He said that the extra expenditure involved was no argument against what was proposed, and that if it meant an expenditure of twice the amount per annum, what was proposed was what ought to be done. There was not one member of the Government party then who did not say that if the proposal were carried,, the money would have had to be found. The Treasurer said that if it meant an extra £100,000,000 a year, the money would have to be found, and, according to him, it would be a mere bagatelle for what he described as the richest country in the world. But a change has come over the scene. The country that was the richest country in the world in proportion to population when men were going out risking lives and limbs in order that immense profits might be built up by this country is a cruel slander on the men who went. That is a vile slander. as a result of the sacrifices of those men. help the men who had gone out to make orable member said. Mi'. MAKE said that they went out for that purpose. quite unlike the Postmaster-General, to whom I give credit for being one of the fairest men in the House.

The Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) is very unfair in trying to read a different meaning into my words. the interjection.

I take second place to no man in this country as one who recognises the great sacrifices they did make, hut I say that as a result of their sacrifices other men in this country became immensely rich. That is the point I want to make. When I was asked on the publicplatform where we would get the money to pay the gratuity in cash my answer was that we would find the money in the same way as we would have had to find it had conscription been carried, and had the war gone on for another six months. I said that the men we would call upon to pay this money would be the individuals who had made immense profits out of the sacrifices of those gallant men who went out to fight. one of the men who stopped at home to make the profits? honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) has a returned soldier's badge upon him.

282,Mr Parker Moloney,"I doI think that I did more to stand hy those men than did the individuals I have spoken of, who did nothing hut build up immense profits as a result of the sacrifices of the soldiers. We desired, if we were returned to power, to get at those people, and I say that it was because those individuals put money into the election campaign of honourable members opposite as they had never done before, that they are where they are today, and not because they received the votes of a majority of the returned ooldiers. I refuse to believe that the party opposite are in power to-day as. a result of receiving the votes of a majority of the returned soldiers. I have made a passing reference to the immense fortunes built up by certain people in this country as a result of the sacrifices of those gallant men. I have a list of them here, but they have been too often mentioned to make it necessary to repeat them now. Still, it would be particularly handy in 'support of my statement, which the Postmaster-General misunderstood it. fer to the fact that the very company with which we have been dealing to-day, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, each year for the last four years made profits amounting to just £1,000,000. Then we know that some of the shipping companies made immense profits, and that the profits of the Australian Tobacco Company, during the last year of the war amounted to over £500,000. When at the election I was asked where we were going to find the cash to pay the soldiers' gratuity, my answer was that if the party to which I belonged were returned we would call upon some of those people to do what was just and right in order to make the gratuity a cash one. did not say then that the soldier went away to fight for vested interests. stated my position in regard to that. I have said that those men, for whom I have thegreatest respect, went away to fight for 'the country, and that as a result, other individuals made immense fortunes out .of the sacrifices of our soldiers. [41] I have no desire to prolong the debate. I rose to explain my posi< tion. in regard to this measure. In common with the party to which I belong, I advocated a cash payment. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), before he sat down, said that the proposal to pay the gratuity was not a bribe. Exception was taken to the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) when he said the gratuity was a bribe, and the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) waxed indignant'and said it was nothing of. the kind. The assumption of the honourable member for Werriwa is a reasonable one, because if the gratuity was not to be regarded as a bribe, why was not a Bill introduced before the elections, instead of delaying the matter and allowing it to be used as a stalking-horse at election time? If the Government were in earnest, why did they not do the right thing before the elections? On the hustings the'members on this side strongly advocated payment in cash. I know that I did not endeavour to deceive anybody, I did not misunderstand and the Government should not deceive the soldiers by saying that they cannot pay the gratuity in cash because they have not the money. If the war had continued for another six months the Government would have made money available for that purpose. There. are about many people in this country who have, amassed fortunes as the result of the sacrifices of those who went away to fight for an entirely different purpose, and these are the individuals who should be called upon to pay the gratuity in cash. I deny the statement made that returned soldiers are opposed to a cash payment, a3 there are hundreds of men in my own electorate who are expecting to be paid in cash, because they have interpreted the statements made by the Prime Minister prior to the last election to mean that provision would be made in the Bill for a large number to be so paid. [6.12] -It is very amusing to hear the discussion on the question of a cash gratuity. There is .not one man inside or outside this chamber, wealthy though he may be, who would not be somewhat disconcerted if his Tents were not sufficiently high or were not paid promptly.

House only the other dayFully 98 per cent, of returned soldiers desire a cash payment, and I am sure the returned soldiers in this House would accept cash if they could get it. Wealthy as I am, I would always prefer cash to any deferred system of payment. I take strong exception to statements made earlier in this debate-fortunatel y by only two returned soldier members of this Chamber -that would make it appear that only returned soldiers had a right to speak on this question. I hope I misunderstood them, and, if I did, I am prepared to apologize, but if I did not, I hope they will apologize to the House. Coming down to the broad question of the payment of the gratuity in cash, let us consider to whom it should be paid. But before we do that, I would like to ask, "" Why is the gratuity being paid at all V Tsi t because men who went to the Front received such small payment for the services they performed? Is it because they accepted certain pay, and while they were away the profiteers robbed their wives and families, and this is to be regarded as a kind of recompense? Honourable members on this side have endeavoured to show that many who have 'been overlooked in connection with this Bill should have been included in its -provisions. When submitting this phase of the question we have been met with the replies with which I do not agree. When deputations -have been introduced to the Prime Minister suggesting that certain men should come under its provisions he has informed such deputations, in an elaborate way, which really meant nothing in the end, why they should not do so. I am at a loss to understand why the money is being paid at all. I am not going to agree 'that it is ""blood"" money, as some desire to call it. If it is paid for the risk and danger they mcurred, there are a lot more who should he considered. I believe honourable members opposite will agree with me that the men It is who were serving in the mercantile marine during the war period should he entitled to the gratuity. I am not going to detract one iota from the work performed by the members of our Naval and Military Forces, who were prepared to give their lives if necessary, and who were Wounded-, lost limbs, or were maimed in other ways, but I consider the payment ought to be higher, because they were robbed while they were fighting for the profiteering section of the community. I h'ave not received definite information as to who is to receive the gratuity, and as to why it is being paid; but 1 claim consideration for the men in the mercantile marine, and will show that many members of our Naval and Military Forces who did not risk their lives to any great degree, are to receive the gratuity. Many of those who went to Rabaul did not risk anything but malarial, fever, and yet they will come under the provisions of the Bill. There are many such persons who will receive large amounts, whereas some who '' hopped over '' and took risks far greater than those who went to Rabaul, will not be considered honourable member draw the lin'e in regard to war work? endeavouring to show.

I intend to especially plead for recognition of the work done by the members' of our mercantile marine. that the men on board our warships in curred greater risks than .did our land forces. When boats were torpedoed in the No r t h Sea their occupants found themselves swimming in icy waters, and, as a result, thousands of them perished. Had those men been fighting on land, at least they would have had a chance of saving their lives. Then, again, thousands of the members of our mercantile . marine risk as did the men on board our warships. In this connection I desire to quote an article written by "" F i g u r e head,"" in bhe Melbourne Herald, of 15th November last year. In it the writer deals very exhaustively with the work done by our mercantile marine. article reads:THE HONOURS OF WAR. Triumphs and Losses Recounted. Though the honour of "" putting Australia on the map"" has been awarded justly to her gallant navy and army, the work of the merchant marine, though less spectacular, deserves warm commendation. Before the war, our merchant seamen were confined, for the most part, to the routine of the Australian coastal trade, broken by an occasional voyage to New Zealand or the South Seas. Though the vessels flying the Australian fiagjn 1914 were barely sufficient to cope with the pre-war traffic, during hostilities, merchant vessels of an aggregate tonnage of nearly 200,000 gross were withdrawn from the coastal service to meet the demands of the Allies in the various war theatres and the Australian overseas .trade. A wider horizon then opened for the crews. The particulars of these vessels is set out in a table, which shows that they aggregated a gross tonnage of 199,177. Soon after the outbreak of war a further call was made on the seamen of the Commonwealth, when the Austral fleet of steamers was purchased by the Government, and the German steamers in Australian ports were requisitioned to carry foodstuffs, men, and munitions through the danger zone to different European ports. The shipping made available by the Austral Line and by alien vessels taken over, aggregated 119,160 tons gross, [ 4 1 ] -2 making in all about 300,000 tons of To my mind, the Government shipping. These vessels were used for many purposes, but especially for the conveyance of munitions of war, foodstuffs, and troops. They were also utilized as hospital ships, which should We all know have been immune from attack, but were not. Some of them were employed as decoy ships, and every man on . board these vessels -literally carried his l if e in his hands. Upon them were naval men who were accustomed to fighting w it h the class of guns with which the vessels were equipped. It stands to the honour of our mercantile marine that a number of these vessels rammed many German submarines during the course of the war. incurred as much For the great services which they rendered the Empire they were specially honoured by the Admiralty. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. course of the war, the men engaged in The our mercantile marine service, while in the danger zone, ran a grave risk of being torpedoed. Ships were equipped with guns as a protection against submarine attack, and on many occasions they succeeded in sinking an enemy "" t in fish."" The men down in the stoke-hold were always in extreme danger-as great, indeed, as the men in the trenches about to hop over the top, because once a vessel was submarined, their position was hopeless. No men on a war-ship ran greater risks than did those on board the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company's ship M a l lina, which, as a fleet collier and decoy ship, had numerous adventures when Von Spee's powerful squadron was at large in the Pacific. We are told thatNight after night, this vessel went out in advance of tlie Australian Fleet, with all lights burning brightly, at any moment likely t j be sunk by the gun-fire of the enemy, witl. the loss of all hands.

On both occasions he was very fortunate, as he had. just come up from the stoke-hold for a bath a few moments before the vessel was struck. Tbese men lost all they had when their ships were sunk, and it appears now that they are not to be recompensed. I also draw attention to the fact that the man in control of a mercantile vessel has just as great a strain upon his nerves as Mr MotJieies. Let me put on has the commander of a man-of-war, because the safety of all hands and the ship are in his keeping. I do not want to labour the question, as' I feel sure that honourable members generally agree with me that any man who has done good war work should be recompensed. In some quarters it is said that these men received much higher wages than were paid to the soldiers. I have been waiting for some honourable members opposite to advance this reason as an argument against the payment of the war gratuity to the men of our mercantile marine, because I know ib has been said outside the House. But if the war gratuity is to be regarded as a recompense for services rendered, then the rate should be, not Is. 6d. per day, but 7s. or 8s. per day. The measure is Towed into for the special purpose of rewarding men who offered their lives during the war; and I repeat that no men took greater risks than the men of our mercantile marine, because, while in the danger zone, they risked their lives in the service of their country. Common decency demands that all ranks and grades should be in of the mercantile marine were admitted, how would you estimate the number of days of service? any dennite proposal. My contention is that the men engaged in this service should participate in the gratuity scheme, because of the risks to which they were exposed.

But one point that can be suitably dealt with only at the present stage of the B ill is the question of whether the gratuity should be paid in cash or by means of bonds. Personally, there can be no misunderstanding as to where I stand, because from every platform",53,Record Of Australia S Merchant Service

297,Mr Bruce (Plinders) [S.15],"It isI spoke on-and I did not wait until the gentlemen at the back of the hall asked me the question, hut got the statement in first-I totally opposed to the payment of the gratuity in cash'. It is more or less significant that this was one of the very few statements I ever managed to achieve which met with the most emphatic approval in such very varying places as the quiet and calm industrial atmosphere of Wonthagrgi, and the riotous surroundings of Mornington. everywhere was that the people appeared, if one could take the expressions of a public meeting as in any way. indicating what they thought, to agree with the view that 'the gratuity was more likely to be of benefit to the soldier if it were paid by bonds, and not 'by cash. It should be borne in mind that we have to consider the benefit of the soldier, as well as the actual circumstances of this country, when we are debating how far we can pay the gratuity in cash. I am clear that there should be some restriction upon the soldier on his return here indiscriminately getting in cash the amount coming to him under the gratuity, and that view is, I am sure, shared by every returned soldier who has the welfare of his comrades seriously at heart. On the question of what the effect on the country would be if it were paid in cash, I have no hesitinued, by means of Government distritation in saying that it would be absolutely disastrous. I take that view because we are suffering to-day in Australia from great difficulties, brought about by the high cost of living, which are placing a terrible burden on a great number of people of Australia. Some cheery souls will dismiss the whole thing -and I do not say this is done only for political purposes-by asserting that the present state of things in Australia, particularly the increase in the cost of living, is attributable to profiteering. I am not here, in any way, to plead the cause of the profiteer, but in his worse and most determined moments he could not have brought about the present position unaided. It has been brought about equally-personally , I say much moreby the inflation of credit in Australia, and the hopeless depreciation of our currency. £25,000,000 we should naturally accentuate that position, and place a further heavy burden upon people who, God knows, are little enough able to bear it at the present time. ""We should also play said quite frankly that I was directly into the' hands of the profiteer if we did so. The whole possibility of his indulging in his orgy, if he is doing it, is being created by the fact that money is to-day so plentiful in Australia,"" and yet is depreciated in its value. If we add £25,000,000 to the sum already issued, we shall give a further and greater opportunity to any misguided and disreputable My experience person in the community who wants to profiteer. 1 ful in Australia to-day? ber of reasons, of which I would suggest to the honourable member as the outstanding causes, first, the inflation of our note issue, and, second, the tremendous amount of money that has been raised by the Government for the purposes of the war, and put back into circulation. I wish to emphasize here the opportunities that would be given to tlie profiteer if we increased the amount of money distributed throughout the community in this way. With the best will in the world, and even with a great deal of wisdom, no steps that we could take would be able to stop those people, so long as we conbution, to pour out money which would simply go back into the pockets of the very people from whom we want to keep it. Apart from those probable results of a cash distribution of the gratuity, several arguments are being urged for cash payments, on the ground that under other circumstances we should have spent even more money. A t first sight, those arguments appear reasonably sound, but, when one analyzes them, there is a great difference in the two positions. One suggestion is that, had conscription been carried, it would have involved a very great expenditure in Australia. I agree that it would. Another argument is that, had the war gone on, we should have spent £50,000,000 or £100,000,000, or even more, if that had been necessary in order to carry on the war. Those who argue that way then ask, "" Why should we If we issued now another cavil about a mere £25,000,000?"" cash, like men.",54,Record Of Australia S Merchant Service

300,Mr West,"Hear, hear! Payi t inemphatically agrees with the views of those who ask, "" Why cavil?"" The reason why he should cavil, and cavil very hard, is that circumstances have completely changed. None of us would have hesitated to spend all the millions necessary to preserve our national entity and national safety. Leaving the question of conscription altogether on one side, if the war had continued we should still have been confronted with a great danger. But the spending of those extra millions to preserve our own existence would have placed a terrible burden on the people of Australia. To-day our national safety is not in danger, and the question of paying out purely and siniplv on a domestic issue. I know the soldier, I presume, as well as do most people i u this building, and I am prepared to say that the average decent returned man does not want his money in cash if any of the things that I have said to-night are true, and if the result would be to place a greater burden on the people of this country, who, he knows, have borne, and are bearing already, a very great burden in respect of the services which he rendered to the country. Another point stated is that the last Parliament in its final sittings could have passed a War GratuityB ill , and then there would have been no discussion at the elections, and we should have been saved from what, to me at all events, was a very painful display. I do not agree with that view, because the question arose only in the dying hours of the Parliament, and it would have been one of the most improper things any Parliament ever did if that Parliament, not a single member of which had any absolute certainty of sitting again on these benches after the election, had expended fro m £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 of the people's money at a time when its mandate had passed from it and a. new Parliament was coming into existence. would have been a grossly improper action had that B ill been put through. On the other side we had the question asked of whether there was an attempt to bribe the soldier. Personally, it looks to me extraordinarily as though there was, and some words which I uttered in this chamber before the dissolution of the last Parliament have come strangely true. I suggested then that if anybody proposed to try to bribe the returned soldiers by pretending to be their friend, and to offer them great benefits, he was doomed to a very dismal and unfortunate disillusion. I pointed out that the soldier was a pretty knowing person, and that nobody could have served w it h h i m without realizing that in the main he was an excellent judge of a man and of his sincerity. We saw that proved time and again in the war by the devoted way in which the soldiers would follow some men and would not follow others on any terms. When we went to the election, the position was that certain people did t r y to see if they could catch the soldiers' vote. As I said on the public platform, and say again here, I am not too sure that the £25,000,00.0 in cash turns either party is guiltless in that regard. A t the beginning, a bold, clear, straight out statement was made regarding the gratuity, the payment of which was to be in bonds, cash being given only in certain specific cases, such as those of widows, blind soldiers, and others, much on the lines adopted in tlie B ill . That proposal received the endorsement of the executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, which had the courage to tell its members that it was the fair and proper scheme to support. As the electoral campaign proceeded, the original proposal did not remain quite unaltered, though I am glad that there was a decent air of maintaining it . In my opinion, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) is not above the suspicion that, at one time, he was misguided enough to think that he could make suggestions which would appeal to, and attract, the soldier. But if he is not above that suspicion, honourable gentlemen on the benches opposite were Indecenti n the way they attempted to catch the vote of the soldier. My words have been extraordinarily verified by the attitude of the soldiers towards the party opposite. The support of the soldiers"" was given It to those who had not tried indecently to' bribe them; that is shown by the fact that there are a great number of returned men on this side of the House. I do not think that any of us much doubts that the soldier, his dependants, and his sympathizers greatly sway an election in this country at the present time. Another point I wish to mention before sitting down has to do with the modification of the original proposal. Howf a r",55,Record Of Australia S Merchant Service
301,Mr Bruce,"My honourable friendi t has been modified, I do not know, but it has been stated that certain Governments, and other employers, intend to cash the bonds given to their soldier employees, and so much cash is evidently going to be paid over in connection with the gratuity that we shall be lucky if we do not have a fresh inflation of our credit and depreciation of our currency. Those of us -who are in the position of employers would like a little light from the Government concerning what is to be done in regard to the cashing of bonds. Between 100 and 150 soldiers are employed by the firm to which I belong, who will receive bonds, and may come to me to have them exchanged for cash. I shall make every effort in my power to prevent the cashing of bonds, and the consequent squandering of money, because I feel that it is a wise thing to build up in our community a large body of persons having substance behind them, and that there is great virtue in t h r if t . In the early days of the issue of war loan scrip and war saving certificates, we were approached and asked if 'we could get our people to take up these securities. My wildest estimate of what might thus be raised was something between £5,000 and £10,000. We encoxiraged our people to take up war stock to the value of their salaries, repaying . l ^ d . in the £ 1 per week, in respect of war saving certificates and of equal payments in respect of war bonds, and paying off the whole sum within three years. We financed the operation, foregoing theinterest, which went to those who took up the scrip, that being the attraction that we offered, and the result was that no less than £47,000 was subscribed. I am certain that it is of incalculable advantage to the persons concerned, from the man at tlie bottom of the ladder upwards, that now they have the interest from their savings coming to them regularly each half year, and have also a substantial capital sum at their disposal. regard to 'the war gratuity bonds, we propose to make an extraordinarily attractive offer to discourage attempts to get them cashed, and in the hope of preventing the squandering of money. We intend, however, to give money for the bonds to those who require it , and I ask what distinction will be made between those in our position and low-class moneylenders, who obtain possession of bonds by giving for them"" one-fourth of their value? soldier is to be safeguarded. My firm employs perhaps 150 returned men, whose gratuities will average £100 each. If a firm, can hold £15,000 worth of these bonds, how is it proposed to safeguard the soldier from being taken down by those who make it a business to acquire bonds froni the necessitous for much below their value? do it under the B ill . that I am one of the employers who have pledged myself to pay cash for the bonds; and in view of the various statements that have been made regarding the action that is to be taken by the State Governments and other employers, it will be an extraordinary thing if the B ill does not deal with the matter to which I have drawn attention. If that is so, it will be necessary to amend the B ill in Committee. I shall not discuss the measure further now, because it is one for Committee consideration, but I did not wish the second reading stage to pass without showing where I stood; and having pledged myself emphatically to the gratuity not being paid in cash, I wish again to affirm my opinion on the subject. MrJ . H . CATTS I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) worked himself up into a fine show of pious indignation on the assumption that in my speech about the war gratuity I had used the word "" bribe."" Nowhere in my speech have I referred to the gratuity under that term; I spoke of it as an election promise. I shall not delay the House long, because I realize that this is a B ill which we should get into Committee as speedily as possible. The speech of the honourable memb,er for Flinders( Mr Bruce), to In which we have just listened, was one of the most interesting that I have heard since I first entered the Parliament. I believe that there are in Australia many employers of labour who have endeavoured to treat the returned soldiers in the way in which his firm has treated them, and it reflects great credit on those who are so f u l l y keeping their promises to the soldiers.

It surprises me that those who appeared callous as to the interests of the soldier a few years ago claim now to be keenly anxious for his welfare. I cannot allow to pass unnoticed the remark made tonight by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), no matter how he may try to alter the tone of his statement. He had the audacity to say that the soldier went away to fight, not for liberty, or humanity, or his country, but to aid the profiteer.

If there are no interjections there will be no need for withdrawals. been said about the delay in bringing forward this measure. On this matter I disagree with the honourable member for Flinders. In my opinion, the last Parliament had a full mandate from the people. It was elected for a period of three years, and there-was no excuse for the action of the 'Government in sending it to the country prematurely, at the most unseasonable time of the year, when harvesting was on, and many persons found it impossible to go to the poll. In my opinion, the Government were entirely wrong. The last Parliament should have dealt with this matter. When the elections were pending, I felt that there was something discreditable in candidates having to make statements about a gratuity which, under any circumstances, would be considered by many as in the nature of a bribe, and I should have been much more content had the matter been dealt with by the last Parliament. Had it been so dealt with, it would have been in which it is now being considered. Many are prone to forget the enormous sacrifices made by our soldiers, and the wonderful proof they gave of their patriotism. The' B ill provides for gratuities on a very large scale, hut, to my mind, the gratuity should be paid only to those who went overseas. I know that a number of men desired to be sent abroad, and. were detained here by those in command, but I am certain also that a good many others were kept back at their own desire and at their own inwho had obtained commissions should have paraded the streets of Melbourne in uniform for two, and, in. some instances, for three years, and yet did not go to the I understand that he Front. Probably these men may be able to claim the gratuity under the Bill. I do not think it right that those who served on ships which did not enter the danger zone should receive the gratuity, especially when those who served on hospital ships in the Mediterranean and in the North Sea are left out of the Bill. It is hard to imagine the anxiety of those in charge of a hospital ship filled with wounded men, knowing that should any misadventure happen hardly a man could be saved. There is no comparison between what they went through and what even those in charge of a convoy went through. Yet those who served on hospital ships are omitted from the Bill and members of the Naval Force, who may never have left Australia, are to get thegratuity.

316,Mr Gregory,"A good deal hasscandal when that vessel left Fremantle, was the fault of certain members of tbe Naval Forces in permitting the steamer to leave Melbourne as she was, and yet, probably, they will receive the gratuity. It may not be popular to declare that the gratuity should be paid only to those who left Australia on active service; but that is my view in regard to it, and I bope that in Committee the Bill will be amended accordingly. propose in regard to those who served on the mine-sweepers? include them; there is no question about tlieir claim. This money will have to be found within the next four, five, or six years, no matter what system we adopt. Remembering the terrible sacrifices that were made by so many, I do not think that any person or company should have made profits out of the war. I know instances in which enlisted men, when asked how their wives and children would get on after they had gone, replied, "" Oh! my wife was a milliner, or something else, before she was married, and she will go back to her millinery or the like."" These persons Avere willing, for the sake of their country and the flag, to make sacrifices, but others used the war in every way to make money for themselves. A large proportion of the extra profits made during the war were legitimately secured, but I do not think any big corporation should have profited by the war. They should have been satisfied to secure the same percentage of profits that they previously enjoyed. The Government should bring in a retrospective excess war-time profits tax to raise funds to pay this gratuity. Those who made enormous profits, during the war period should be compelled to contribute a big proportion of the amount which this Bill will involve. other liabilities to meet. Government do bring in such a Bill as I have just suggested, I hope that instead of fashioning it on the War-time Profits Bill, which was framed by a few officials without any business capacity, they will refer it to a Board of solid business men, so that we shall not make undue impositions upon one section and allow other sections to go free. I feel very strongly with regard to the working of the war-time profits tax, because under it some who, after working for years at a loss, are able to show a book profit, are having it taken from them, and may be compelled to borrow to pay the tax, while others who have made enormous profits are allowed to go untouched. I agree with the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) that it would be a grave mistake to pay the war gratuity in cash except in case of necessity, and those who have made undue profits during the war should be specially taxed to raise the money that will be necessary in this connection. Following the example of others, I shall be as brief as possible. We are all convinced that if we were still at war we would be prepared to pour out our millions in order to bring it to a successful conclusion, whereas now that the war is over and we are asked to grant some recognition to those who have risked their lives for us, the Government are not prepared to give them a cash gratuity. There are many wealthy men in our community who were not willing to lend their money to the country free of interest in its hour of need, and they are among those who now say, ""Give the soldiers bonds, not cash."" If we are to make a gift to our returned soldiers, let it be given freely and from the heart. This Bill does not provide for a gift in the true sense of the word. I propose to draw attention to the way in which this Parliament differentiates between those belonging to the Government House"" push "" and those in lowly circumstances by showing that in one case it made a handsome grant to the widow of a man who, I am told, received £30 a week and £1 5s. per day foT field expenses, whereas it is not prepared to make a cash grant to the widow of a man who was in receipt of only 6s. or 8s. per day. The Officers' Compensation Act, No. 49, of 1915, which was introduced by a Government of which I was a supporter, provides thatNotwithstanding anything contained in the War Pensions Act 1914-1S, there shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, the sum of £4.500 to the widow of Major-General Sir William Throsby Bridges.",58,Moloney B Y Way Of Stance I T Was Scandalous That Men

But it was the memory of this treatment of his widow that made me say from the first that the war gratuity should be paid in cash. Only to-day a deputation of returned soldiers urged me to strongly press for a cash gratuity. The Victorian State Savings Bank is prepared to cash at par any gratuity bond handedi n by a soldier, not be possible. is so.. but I am not trying to h it the Government, because a measure of this kind should be above a l l party considerations. The statement that the payment of a gratuity to our soldiers was proposed by way of a ""bribe"" was quite out of place. Such a word should not be applied to anything designed to benefit our brave men. When the Officers' Compensation B ill of 1915 was before the House on l l t h represented the division of Ballarat, moved, as reported in Hansard; page 1526That as the widow of Sir William Throsby Bridges is already provided for under the War Pensions Aet, and as such Act makes provision for the dep.endants of soldiers according to rank, this House cannot agree with any appropriation that nullifies .the existing law, and makes unfair discrimination in order to give exceptional grants to favoured individuals. That amendment was lost by 31 votes to 7. lif e my experience has been that any one occupying an exalted position, especially any one connected with Government House, is freely granted special treatment. I should not have cared if Lady Bridges had received £50,000; it is the principle, and not the individual, that I am attacking. In our Military Department we have fifteen men who are drawing more than von Moltke received when he led the victorious Prussians that overran France, and there are over 100 men in our Defence and Navy Departments who receive more than the Commander-in-Chief of the SwissA r m y of 300,000 men in war time. How different this is from the treatment meted out to the common rankers ! Eighty per cent, of the men of Australia volunteered for active service. Between 700,000 and S00,000 offered to enlist. Many were .re r jected because of age.or infirmity. Over 400,000 were accepted, and over 300,000 left -Australia for the Front. Have we heard of 70 per cent., 50 per cent., or even 25. per cent, of the wealth of the community being offered without interest to the Government of Australia in its hour of need ? When the honorton) was Acting Treasurer, I suggested I 'do not think that that the people should be asked to lend money to the Commonwealth free of I may be wrong, interest. An appeal was made, and £1,200 out of a total of some £200,000,000 was placed at the disposal of the Government free of interest. In five cases the offers represented' the widow's mitethey were offers of £10 each on the part of people who wanted to help their country, while two unions, to their credit, made loans of £100 each free of interest to the country. I am told that some -good man made a present of £50,000 to the Commonwealth. If that is so, his name ought to be blazoned in letters of gold. I have shown clearly the difference between the treatment meted out by Parliament to dependants of some of our big men aud that which the Government are prepared to extend to the rank and file. I invite honourable members to call a meeting of returned soldiers to decide whether the gratuity should be paid in cash or in bonds.

T hope the punishment w ill be more severe than that which he is prepared to mete out to the profiteer. The right honourable gentleman said on one occasion that the profiteers should be shot; but a pop-gun is the only weapon he is likely to use against them. sayHe had been told that hotel keepers and money-lenders were preparing to make money out of tlie soldiers when they got their gratuity, and he did not propose to allow the money to line the pockets of the harpies and sharks. Why is tliere no clause in the B ill to send such men to gaol? The sugar exploiters were fined £50. That is a mere bagatelle. They w ill make f a r more than that as the result of their hoarding of supplies. They should be sent to gaol. cated. member support the introduction of such a clause as I suggest? able member w ill keep his word. There is no man more cunning than the Prime Minister, and I do not know why he has failed to insert in the B ill a clause dealing with the class of offenders referred to by him. When we go into Committee we shall .have power to make such an amendment. I have here a letter from the United Licensed Victuallers Association, forwarding the quotation from the Sydney Morning Herald which I have read. That letter statesMr Dennison and I were discussing the matter this morning, and it was agreed that I write you, asking you to get some influential member to bring the matter up on the floor of the House at the earliest opportunity. Mr tained. I was informed by tb© Minister Hughes ought to be asked to give some facts, not a bare statement, which may probably be idle gossip only. We contend that his remarks are a direct insult to the trade, and an unwarrantable one at that. Hotelkeepers are no more likely to make money out of .tlie soldiers' gratuity any more than any other section of the commercial community. I go ""further than that and suggest that a clause should be inserted in the B ill to provide that any man who trys to rob a soldier or a soldier's dependant should be punished. What is the use of fining men ? Then there is the profiteering that takes place in Plinders-lane. I wish that all persons in the Lane were of the same high moral calibre as is thp. honourable and gallant member for Plinders( Mr Bruce). If a piece of tweed made in Geelong is sent to a warehouse in Plinders-lane and is then sold to a retailer in Geelong,, the factory price is doubled and trebled. These profiteers ought to be in gaol. I He went on to wonder that the honourable member for Plinders dealt so lightly with the profiteer. If honourable members desire to know whether or not profiteering takes place, ask any mother of a family who deals with the butcher, the baker, and the grocer; or any man who buys a suit of clothes from a tailor, or any girl who buys a blouse or a pair of boots. I exhibited in this House two pairs of boots made by the same firm in America, one of which was sold at £ 3 3.s. and the other for l is . l i d . , and an expert bootmaker assured me that the cheaper pair was the better. Yet we are told that there is no profiteering in Australia! So long as any man makes that assertion, Ananias is not without a descendant. Many returned soldiers cannot get em-. ployment, and are not helped to get it . I know the honorThey are sometimes offered work for which they are physically unfit. I know of oue man who had been shot through the chest, the hip, and the shoulder, and he was asked to do hard labour that was only suitable for a man with a good physique. Men of that class could earn £ 4 or £ 5 per week, working eight hours a day, at hand-weaving, but the Government will not provide 500 lbs. of yarn per week with which to start the industry at Bendigo. It was with no desire to irritate the Prime Minister that I asked to-day certain questions regarding the provision of yarn in order to establish a hand-weaving industry at Bendigo.

I have already pointed out that between 70 per cent, and 80 per cent, of the available manhood of Australia offered their services in connection with the war.

I believe that in the next ten years of peace Australia w ill progress more rapidly than it did during the war. If that should be so, why should not the unearned increment be used for the elimination of the war debt ? I do not think any honourable member w ill gainsay the fairness of that proposal. Let us consult the soldiers regarding it-no t the officials. I do not say anything against the officials, but the common, ordinary private has not much respect for them. The truth of that is that another organization is in course of formation, and the members of it w ill not have an officer at their head. I understand that the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) intends to bring before the Committee the in justice that is being done to the Royal Australian Artillery . I have listened carefully to what the honourable member said, and if he convinces me that an act of injustice is being committed, he can I have a letter from count uponmy vote in support of any amendment which w ill do justice to those men. Of all the brave men who sailed the seas none were braver than those engaged in mine-sweeping. Perhaps equal in courage to them were those angel women who served as nurses on the hospital ships. Was there ever anything Probably who, when a hospital ship had been torpedoed by a vile submersible in the Mediterranean and ithe captain ordered the nurses to the boat, said, "" No, save the fighting men."" And they sank beneath the waves. One wonders why God permitted such a thing, but no braver act was ever done. The nurses should be treated in the same way as the soldiers. I am afraid that ThisB ill should not be made a party question. In Committee let us see what we can do to improve it . Asf o r the foolish statement that we cannot pay the gratuity in cash, I say that Australia is rich enough and generous enough to pay cash, and we who represent the people should see that the soldiers get f a i r play. The House appears to be practically unanimous in its approval of the principle enunciated in this B ill , namely, that the war gratuity shall be deemed' to be a free g if t by the Commonwealth to her A t any rate, there soldiers in recognition of noble services rendered during the war with Germany and her Allies. But there seems to be a wide difference of opinion among honourable members on both sides with respect to those who should become beneficiaries under this measure. Of course, it is always popular to be found helping the greatest number of people, but, having regard first to the auality and value of the services rendered by our soldiers, and, secondly, to the rather exhausted condition of our finances, I hold that the gratuity should be limited to those who fought overseas for Australia, or who risked their lives in any danger zone, whether on the coast line of this country, or on the high seas, or on battle-fields in any part of the world.

346,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [9.16],"add day by day to tbe number who may become beneficiaries. But with the general principle of the B ill I am in thorough accord, and I am pleased that the Government have made this one of the early measures of the session. I regret that Australia does.not appear to have placed on record her citizens' keen appreciation of the magnificent services rendered during the war by Australia's most eminent soldier, General Monash. He has come through triumphantly, and with a very great record. His strategy, his consummate judgment and skill, the employment by him of his own capacity and his superb use of that of those who served w it h and around him, proved a trul y magnifioent feature of the operations of the Allies. While Great Britain has set an illustrious example, and while other countries among our Allies have done likewise by their great military leaders, I regret that the services of General Monash have not been appreciatively signalized in and by Australia. Something yet remains to be done. I do not suggest that it be done by way of pounds, shillingsy and' pence; but this country should raise some monument, make some great mark of appreciation of the services of the Australian Commander-in-Chief, and I hope that no consideration other than regard for his grand services will weigh with the Government and people. foremost position among all the Australians who entered the conflict. I trust that there will be speedy recognition in some marked public form of'his splendid services. resolution of this House. is a grave omission, not only by this Parliament, but by Australia as a whole. I only hope that, for our honour and credit, it will be speedily remedied. General Monash be called to the Bar of this House, and publicly thanked ? well worthy of consideration, which, I trust, will not escape the attention of the Government. W it h regard to the question whether the' gratuity should' be paid in cash or in bonds, I may say that as soon as the proposition was made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in its first naked form, I said that I was not much enamoured of the non-negotiable bonds proposal. I was not impressed with 'the idea that the soldiers who had fought for this country, many of whom might be in necessitous circumstances, should be holding bonds, and should be without adequate means or resources, and yet should be unable to deal w it h those bonds in any shape or form. That a man could point to his wounds, indicate his financial necessities, and then direct attention to his bonds, would be-it seemed to merather in the nature of holding up this country to contempt. I do not plead for a payment in cash straight out. Throughout the election campaign, I made a definite suggestion in my constituency, and in so doing I followed no one else's ideas. I have not disguised from the Government or this House that another measure, which was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament w it h the intention of benefiting the Australian soldier, namely, the Repatriation Act , has proved, in my judgment, I will not say a failure, but a source of great disappointment to our soldiers. Very few of our returned men have been able to understand why there should have been provision made for certain of our soldiers, and no provision whatever for others. I hold that there is the closest possible relationship between the General Monash reached measure now before this House and our repatriation legislation. When we were dealing w it h the Repatriation B ill , I referred to it as merely a blank cheque, and as being tantamount to a failure on the part of the National Parliament to indicate who should or should not be entitled to repatriation. Honourable members speak of omissions and in clusions in the GratuityB ill . The Repatriation B ill , as this Parliament agreed to it and as it now stands upon our statute-book, made provision for nobody W h y should hot specifically. It presented a blank cheque to an outside body called a Commission, and that Commission consisted of seven gentlemen, one of whom Was a Pederal Minister. This Parliament l e ft it to six people outside to frame a repatriation scheme, and to provide for whom they much-debated might please. I am bound to say that they have disappointed the overwhelming majority of Australian soldiers. Further, that degree of disappointment which confronted the Prime Minister on his return to Australia hastened in no small measure the project for a gratuity,",63,Maloney T H E Question Of Grander Than The Action Of The Nurses

Section 60 of the regulations governing repatriation provides for only three classes who may be benefited. The time is at hand when we should widen the whole scheme of repatriation so that it shall absorb the gratuity grants, and give a form of control or direction to £28,000,000 of what will otherwise become, I fear, mere spending money. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) has indicated his fears with respect to employees who have been brought up in a business atmosphere, where they should have become almost by instinct thrifty. If we multiply the danger when applying it to the ""60 per cent., or, perhaps, 80 per cent., of our soldiers who have no business training or capacity, and may be in necessitous circumstances, we are bound to be impressed with the seriousness of the position, I suggest that the Government take counsel with the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) and his present Commission-for , in my judgment, 'the proposal to substitute a new Commission in place of the present body is not going to improve repatriation very much. debate in connection with this Bill? relationship between the two principles, and it is apparent on reference to clause 14. There is time, even now, to so amend our repatriation scheme as to gather in a wider range of beneficiaries. If we limit the provision under clause 14 to the very small number of beneficiaries under the repatriation legislation, I say, frankly, that it will be of little use, indeed. It will be of wider use, I admit, in connection with the war service homes scheme; but, if we could widen the scope of repatriation itself, we would not only be making a cash gift, but would be allowing the soldiers, by these grants, to secure what they may require in carrying on their various avocations. Our soldiers do not want money for money itself. will buy goods and other assets. Very manv of them will seek an interest in some undertaking. As I have indicated, under section 60 of the regulations dealing with repatriation, there are to-day only three classes proThat to-day, however, vided for, namely, widows with children, married men who are incapacitated, and men who previously had had a little business of their own. The tens of thousands of other soldiers eligible for the war gratuity are in a position to secure practically no assistance whatever beyond a training under the repatriation scheme. ' If we take this opportunity to recast repatriation in order to bring in the great majority of soldiers, and then make provision that the war bonds shall be available for all the purposes set out in an amended and improved repatriation scheme, the two measures operating together will give business like and direct control to millions sterling which, otherwise,will become ad Zib. spending money, and will go towards increasing the spending power of the nation in a somewhat reckless way. What is there to prevent the Government from recommending that the trading, commercial, and financial community, and any who -are prepared to do so, should advance to soldiers goods or commodities, or whatever they may require to set themselves up-providin g that the transaction is approved either by the Repatriation Commission or by the State Board or by a Local Committee? What is to prevent such a course from being adopted if, in return for those goods, the trading community will take as payment bonds upon their face value plus the interest upon them to date? Why should we prevent such a .thing, seeing that this Parliament could set up adequate and complete safeguards? If we merely pass a measure such as this, and leave repatriation where it stands, we shall be losing a great opportunity to render practical aid to men who hitherto have been disappointed concerning the lack of breadth of the repatriation scheme. I would treat the bonds as this Bill actually treats them at present in relation to the limited purposes of the Repatriation Act; that is to say, I would regard them as equivalent to spot cash, plus interest due upon them.

352,Mr Rodgers,"I have indicated thesecure immediate cash payment for their gratuity bonds; but there are thousands of other soldiers equally deserving and, perhaps, in a more necessitous position, who do not come within the scope of the Repatriation Act, and whose bonds, therefore, cannot be cashed. I assure the Government that no one will be able to face the agitation that will have been aroused in respect to men suffering from wounds, who are out of funds, and yet Who are holding this country's, bonds. under clause 13, paragraph f? member suggests that the cases I have mentioned may be met under the paragraph which provides that a person who is found to be in necessitous circumstances shall be paid in cash if so desired by the person entitled to the gratuity; but, judging by the remarks of various honourable members as to the calibre of the Australian soldier, I should not think that he would be found marching up as a mendicant, or as a person in necessitous circumstances, and asking for cash for his bonds. In any case we do not wish to put him in that position The only gleam of hope for a big proportion of the soldiers is contained in clause 13, paragraph e, which provides that a member of the Forces who has married since the date of his discharge, shall be paid in cash if so' desired by him. There may be a rush to the altar to secure a double-barrelled benefit. I suggest to the Ministry that a practical business-like scheme is still possible. dulge in the expenditure of large sums of There is time to amend the Repatriation Act in the direction I have indicated. The Bil l to amend that Act is practically through another Ohamber, and will soon be here. There is a most intimate relationship between the Repatriation Bill ancl the War Gratuity Bill. prescribed authority in either measure. The one Department has to certify those who are eligible for consideration under this measure. I suggest that now the Government should take a practical hold over this huge amount of spending money, and help to direct its investment in proper and profitable channels. not let it become part of the great flood of spending money that has, in a great measure, contributed to the high cost of living in this country. Various views are put forward by economists of standing as to what is the real cause of the high cost of living. But for a dead certainty, one of the causes may be ascribed to the law of absorption. Just as we make funds or anything else available, they will be absorbed-it is the custom of the world-and until they are absorbed values will rise. When the money is not there to be absorbed, values will recede. If we allow £28,000,000 of unguarded and undirected spending money to be spent at a time when the productive powers of the country are falling, that is to say when the country is in the stranglehold of a drought, it means piling up high costs and increasing the currency, with no corresponding assets building up on the other side. I ask the Minister now in charge of the Bill( Mr Groom) to be good enough to take a note of the suggestion I make. A t this stage it is not my intention to dwell on the details. They are essentially a matter for the Committee. But I ask the House and the country to take some direction over the expenditure of this vast amount of money which is to be placed in the hands of young men, many unaccustomed to dealing with such sums. It has surprised me to hear some of the remarks from honourable members opposite, particularly those which fell from the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), who claims that it would not be just for an expiring Parliament to inmoney. For the honourable member's edification, I may point out that the New Zealand Parliament, just when it was expiring, having run its ful l term, did the right thing for the Dominion's returned soldiers, and voted them a cash There is a gratuity amounting to £6,000,000.

355,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [9.35].,"slavishly copied in our B ill followed the example of New Zealand, not only in regard to phraseology, but also in regard to those who are to be excluded or included. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has said that our B ill is on a f a r more liheral scale than that of New Zealand, but If a i l to see it . The New Zealand measure voted £6,048,000 in October last year, and I think I am f a i r l y safe in saving that by this time all New' Zealand soldiers have received their cash gratuity of Is. 6d. per day. has been paid so f a r . tion from New Zealand is that nearly all the gratuities have been paid. Th'ere is no difficulty in the way. Department in New Zealand, just as is the case in our Department here, has all the records of the men. Before our B ill was introduced, our Defence Department had all the requisite information, and if word had been given to pay in cash, it could have done so, at least three weeks ago, on a properly established actuarial basis. We ought to be capable of doing what New Zealand has done. Complaint has been made that the Prime Minister varied his promises during the election campaign. Every one knows that he did. In almost every capital city, he had a different tale to toil in regard to the soldiers' gratuity, and I shall quote how he was reported by the Adelaide Register, which we regard as the Argus of South Australia, and as a very conservative paper, which stuck to the Hughes Government right throughout the campaign, and throughout the last Parliament. Its issue of the l l t h November, 1919, contained two and a half columns of a report of a meeting addressed by Mr Hughes, and I quote the following interesting dialogueIf you don't agree with wild extravagant statements, made ostensibly in the name of the soldiers, say so, and say in whom you believe. Say something now if you have anything to say. A Tired Voice -We want cash. (Laughter and applause.) arrangements with the banks whereby the soldiers who want cash for their bonds can go there and get it. (Thunderous applause.) A Voice -Supposing we all go at once. (Laughter and Applause.) bonds exactly as they hold war.loan scrip. . . . [42 ] We have A Voice -When will these bonds be delivered ? The Same Voice -And when will that be? over. I have done the best I could do. I am not God. I am not even Ryan. (Laughter and applause.) This shows exactly how the soldiers took the utterances of the Prime Minister. A f t e r they heard him, they f u l l y Believed that he intended that, even if they could not cash their bonds over the counter of the Treasury or the Defence Department, they could be paid cash, if they presented No t more than £1,500,000 them at any bank. If that is not what the Prime Minister intended, I do not know the ' meaning of the English language. Some honourable -members have said, The Defence that the payment of £25,000,000 in cash would mean financial dislocation, but I have not heard of any great financial disruption in New Zealand, where, according to their population, a gratuity has been paid equal to the individual financial burden that would be imposed on Australia by the payment of £30,000,000 in cash. When the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) was speaking, the Ministerf o r the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) interjected that these were not the only financial responsibilities of the Government. He Was quite correct. Our first war loan matures in 1925, and we shall be obliged to meet .about £20,000,000, most likely by a fresh issue. If the strong advocates of paying the soldiers in bonds have their way, the bonds must be redemed in 1924; therefore the' Commonwealth's responsibilities will be much greater in 1924 and 1925 than they are to-day. I do not see that we are likely to cause financial disruption by putting up this money now. I always like to quote the enemies of Labour. The Adelaide Register, the Melbourne Argus, and the Hobart Mercury are the three outstanding outright Tory newspapers in Australia. In a leading article in its issue of the 22nd March, 1920, the Argus saidNo one will grudge the soldiers the gratuity which Parliament has been asked to authorize. Many people have, directly and indirectly, made fortunes out of the war, and many more are better off than they were -before the war commenced. It has long been the custom to give special reward to victorious soldiers.

When in Committee, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) submits the amendment, of which notice has been given, to secure the payment of the gratuity in cash, as every member of this party advocated upon the election platform, I shall be found voting for that amendment to carry out my election pledge. What is more, I believe that by so voting I shall be doing something which the great majority of our returned soldiers desire. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) drew for us a graphic and dramatic picture' of a returned soldier coming to us with his scars and wounds, and to use a colloquialism, "" stony broke,"" and holding in his hand a bond for which he wants cash, it may be to purchase food or to discharge some legitimate liability which he has incurred. That will be an exceedingly humiliating position in which to place any returned soldier. If bonds are to be issued, I hope they will not be of high denomination. I hope that bonds of different denominations, £10, £20, £50, and £100 will be issued, because if the returned soldier is to be allowed to make use of his bonds to purchase goods, to buy land, or to secure a home, he will find many business people prepared to take £10 bonds who could not possibly take bonds of £100. I have said that I believe in the payment of the gratuity in cash, and that our returned soldiers should not be called upon to hawk bonds around the country. may hold the highest possible opinion of ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force, and yet-I say that if the gratuity is paid only in bonds there will, be thousands of men in Australia who during the next two or three years will be exceedingly desirous to turn them into cash. A returned soldier may enter a place of business and say to the proprietor, "" I have no other means, and I desire to obtain certain goods from you; can Mr Fenton. you cash these bonds?"" Although the owner of the business may be exceedingly desirous of doing something for the returned soldier, he will be debarred under this Bill from cashing the bonds offered him, and so granting the returned The Argus here soldier the relief he desires. gone over again in Committee. honourable gentleman that I shall not be long. I have, recently been in the country, and have seen many returned soldiers who are settled on the land, but all whom I have met have said, "" When is this gratuity going to be fixed up ?"" I spoke to one young fellow who has a small orchard for which he has not yet paid. He found that the Repatriation -Department moved so slowly that he had to make a move for himself. It is possible that the Department is assisting him in some way now. I know that he has some payments yet to make on his property, and if he were paid the gratuity in cash it would be of material assistance to him. The Repatriation Department has come to the assistance of some returned soldiers to start them in business in a very meagre way, but I know of cases in which fathers of some of these men are making themselves poor to-day, in order to set their sons up in a business in a substantial way, because the Repatriation Department will not give them the assistance they require. One hundred pounds in cash would be of very great assistance to these men, who are anxious to .get off the books of the Repatriation Department, but who, under the practice of the Department at the present time, cannot secure the assistance they require because they do not dot an "" i "" and cross a "" t "" in accordance with its regulations. We Even though to do so might lead to a little temporary financial embarrassment, we should alter the provisions of this Bill, and provide for the payment of the gratuity in cash. New Zealand, with her population of l,000j000, has paid £6,000,000 in cash by way of gratuity to her soldiers, and if her people could afford to do that, surely over 5,000,000 of people in Australia, where we have a wealthier community than are the people of New Zealand, can afford to pay £30,000,000 to their returned soldiers.",67,Maloney T H E Question Of Grander Than The Action Of The Nurses

363,Mr Fenton,"I can promise themind the honourable member that New Zealand had nearly all the money she required saved by way of surplus. New ZealandB ill , the Minister for Defencei n that Dominion outlined the Canadian scheme, which is not as liberal as ours, or as that of New Zealand. To suggest that the payment of a gratuity to our returned soldiers is something that was evolved from the brain of tbe Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) is only to talk so much nonsense. When our returned soldiers learned that Canada and New Zealand were paying cash gratuities to their soldiers, it was only proper that the executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League should go to the Government, and put it to them that Australia should do what the. other two oversea Dominions were doing in this matter. The Prime Minister replied that the Government were prepared to do so, but they do not propose to pay the gratuity in cash, as has been done elsewhere. They propose to hand the returned soldier a piece of paper, and ask him, if possible, to hold it until 1924. I say that before that date in many thousands of cases our returned soldiers will be offering their bonds to secure relief. Business people by the score have promised to cash the bonds, and the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) pointed' out that he felt that, as an employer of labour, he would be responsible, after the promises that had been made, in common with other people in business, to cash bonds for returned soldiers in his employment. If only a section of our returned soldiers are called upon to humiliate themselves, by asking cash for their bonds, because they are in necessitous circumstances, we shall be making a very invidious distinction, which will not be relished by those concerned. In saying that I support the proposal of the Labour party that the gratuity should be paid in cash, I am only repeating what I last Parliament expired. We desired that this matter should be settled before the general election. It should have been dealt w it h then, and the proposal should not have been hawked before the electors. It should have been settled, as it was settled in New Zealand, on the eve of, a general election. I can only repeat now that I shall vote for the amendment I should' like to rewhich is to be proposed to secure the payment of the gratuity in cash. A t this late hour I do not propose to In introducing the delay the House more than a few minutes. I think that we have all practically in dorsed the principle of the B ill , but I hope some amendments may be made in Committee that will alter the method' of payment, and will also broaden the scope of the measure by adding to the classes of persons who, under it , will be entitled to receive the gratuity. The subject is one to the discussion of which a speaker might devote considerable time, and my justification for not doing so at this late hour is the fact that already a number Of speeches have been delivered upon the matter, and it has been dealt with very f u l ly and, I think I may say, very effectively from my point of view; by honourable members who have already spoken from my side of the chamber. History has shown that in all countries grateful peoples have raised monuments to the memory of those who have been prepared to die, or have died, in order that their country might -live. An y one who has travelled cannot but he struck in Paris, London, or Washington with the monuments raised in those centres, and the engravings upon them of glowing tributes to the memory of those who were prepared to sacrifice their lives for their country. The circumstauces which caused those countries to raise monuments to their soldiers were not comparable to the circumstances in which Australia finds herself to-day. I think it was President Garfield who laid it down that a country is not worthy to be saved if in the hour of its fate it w ill not gather up its jewels of manhood and life and go down into the conflict, however bloody and doubtful, prepared for measureless r u in or complete success. If that is the test by which we should gauge the right of a country to be saved, then Australia has amply proved that she has that right. For Australia, said before the indeed, did gather up her jewels of manhood and life, and went down into this conflict prepared for measureless r u in or complete success. That is demonstrated by the number of men who enlisted, by 'the number of men who went overseas, and. by the number of men who w ill never return, and who are buried in foreign soil.

366,Mr Ryan (West Sydney) [9.55],"proud of tlieir achievements, which will certainly live in history. The qualities that they have displayed, in my opinion, are characteristic of the Australian people as a whole. It is for that reason I am optimistic and confident that Australia will be able to deal successfully with the great problems that we have in front of us. Perhaps the brightest spot in the whole achievement, at all events to my mind, is the fact that what Australia did she did voluntarily. monument, as other countries have done, to the men who have given their lives for their country, I "" hope there will be special mention of the fact that they did so without the imposition of conscription. Conscription is the tap root of militarism, and it is from conscription that most wars spring. There is one thing I regretted in the terms of the peace concluded at Versailles, and that was the fact that provision was not made-ap parently because those assembled there were not able to agree on the point-that there should be an abolition of conscription in all countries simultaneously. If that had been done, I verily believe that the foundation would have been laid for a universal and lasting peace. Just as monuments have been raised, gratuities have been paid after great wars. In my opinion, the proposed payment, which is called a "" gratuity"" is in the nature, of a deferred payment merely, and should not be described as a gratuity. It is something to be paid in return for services rendered, and just as any other services are paid for in cash, so should this payment be r^ade in cash. to Mr Speaker. the payment to every other member of this House. It is idle for the Government to say that it is impossible to raise the cash. That matter has been fully dealt with by previous speakers, who have shown that had conscription been carried it would have been necessary to raise more money, and if the war had continued the cash would have been forthcoming. Is any honourable member on the Government side of the chamber prepared to say that it would have been impossible to do it? Does the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) suggest that it would have been impossible to raise the cash, or that the country would have been ruined had conscription been carried? Does the Minister suggest that had the war continued for even a few months longer we would not have been able to raise sufficient money to meet our obligations ? have hurt us very severely. seated reason for the issue of bonds than has been expressed, or than appears on the surface, when we bear in mind the fact that there are some £700,000,000 or £800,000,000 worth of bonds held as security against Australian assets. It is part of the scheme of those who hold these bond's to make our soldiers also holders of bonds that cannot be cashed until 1924. Interest-bearing war bonds are not subject to income tax, and if at some future date any suggestion is made in regard to the financial position of the Commonwealth which is likely to interfere with the holders of such bonds, the Government think they will have the additional backing of some tens of thousands of soldiers, and will be able to say that any alteration in the matter of taxing income from' such bonds will apply also to the soldiers. I believe that is one of the deep-seated reasons why the Government have insisted in paying the war gratuity in bonds. There is an actual prohibition against cash contained in this measure, as will be seen from clause 15 of the Bill, which readsExcept as .prescribed, no interest in any war gratuity, or in-any Treasury bond issued or to be issuedin payment of any war gratuity, shall be alienable, whether by way or in consequence of sale, assignment, charge, execution, insolvency, or otherwise howsoever. That is a complete prohibition. scribed."" Navy interjects ""Except as prescribed.""

That limitation is included because it is the policy of the Government to insist that these bonds shall be held by the soldiers, and that they shall not be negotiable. That is my opinion, and I have not heard anything from honourable members opposite that has caused me to alter my views. What is it to the holders of £700,000,000 worth of bonds ? What is -it to advance another £25,000,000 on the same asset? It would pay them to hand over £25,000,000 of the £700,000,000 to have the additional security for themselves.

T hope the people of this country will become stirred to such an extent that they will not stand it . We are continually being told that the Government have not the power to deal with the profiteer, and that the responsibility rests on the shoulders of others. Are the people going to stand that much longer? W ill they believe those who state that Parliament has not the power ? If that attitude is to be continued we can well understand there being an increasing objection to our present system of parliameiitary government. When those who are suffering from the action of the profiteers see that the real interests of the people are not safeguarded by their representatives in Parliament, who snap their fingers and say they have no power to be taken. I wish to refer to one regrettable feaI f I were in the position ture of the debate on this measure. I was not present when the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) delivered his second-reading speech, but I have devoted some time to reading his utterances and some of the speeches delivered by other honourable members opposite. It is clear that the Prime Minister went out of his way to jeer at the Opposition and stress the point that there were no returned soldiers sitting on this side of the chamber. I would have expected some of those honourable members who are wearing badges, I am sure the honourable and who are sitting behind the Government, to have disclaimed the sentiments expressed by the Prime Ministeri n this connection. I would have thought that It is idle for the M in the honourable member for Wannon( Mr. Rodgers) would have remembered that his opponent was a man who had rendered servioe to his country, and carries the scars of war as an lionorable souvenir of that service, b u t he listened to the jeers at the honourable members on this side without raising any complaint. It is in keeping with the misrepresentation that I know occurred in connection with the conscription issue, for every one knows that the Labour party was shockingly misrepresented in that connection. There was misrepresentation in regard to the resoluI t was said in the tions of the Perth Conference, and there was similar misrepresentation in other directions. Honourable members opposite know that there were candidates who stood as representatives of the Labour party from the ranks of returned soldiers, and would have sat in this chamber if a majority of the electors had returned them.",70,Maloney T H E Question Of Grander Than The Action Of The Nurses

Minister( Mr Hughes) promised a cash payment, and the party to which I belong has done its duty by endeavouring to make him honour that promise. However, I want to get on to the hypocritical side of .the business. the honourable member understands. the hypocritical aspect of the business. that you are a good judge of it . of hypocrisy am I that, even if the honourable member who just interjected were dressed in "" sheep's clothing,"" I should still know him to be what he is.

Yet the Government did not deal with this gratuity six months ago because it wished to use the returned soldiers in order to secure a fresh lease of power. they plumbed the lowest depths of hypocritical mendacity. contempt for the Government, but I recognise that an injustice has been done in regard to the name of this so-called gratuity. a gratuity is evidence of hypocrisy. What is a gratuity? for Moreton( Mr Wienholt) has told us that it is a ..gracious g if t . gracious gift? men to help to pay interest upon it? Have they not also to assist in the repayment of the principal? of the whole blessed thing ! been a cash g if t it would have been a gratuity, and there would have been no hypocrisy about it . I shall vote for I what I promised to support when I was on the hustings. The next thought which occurs to me My feelings, sir, upon the is that there is still more injustice about this proposal. Suppose, for example, that I invested £150 in one of our war loans. I should receive by way of in terest upon my investment the sum of £7 annually. I would get that amount, notwithstanding that throughout the war I had remained at home and had not been subjected to the hardships to which our returned soldiers have been subjected. Thus within the next four years, under these bond proposals, I should draw as much in interest as it is proposed to give interest to the men who risked their lives and their all for this country. There are many capitalists in Australia who have invested large sums in our war loans. They draw interest -upon their investments all the time. The position, therefore, is that, although we are told that it is impossible to find the cash with which to pay this gratuity to the men I wish to refer again to who risked their lives in the interests of this country, we can find the money to pay interest upon £3,000, £4,000, or £10,000, which has been invested in our war loans by single individuals, who have, perhaps, been blood-suckers in the sense that they have extorted undue profits from the wives and other dependants of some of our defenders. There certainly seems to be some injustice in the present proposal.

J . H . Vaughan? But I want to point out that the Prime Minister started this mud-slinging. If I had been the offender it might have been put down to my inexperience, but this cannot be said of the Prime Minister, with his long political record. When handling such a sacred matter as this he should not have stooped so low. The Prime Minister did not mention names, but on behalf of one "" d i g g e r "" who is not present, I want to say that "" Teddy"" Yates was in the firing line. It is only fair that the Prime Minister should say to whom he is referring when he is making these ugly insinuations. I have said all I wanted to, and as the B ill is going into Committee, I shall f o l turned soldiers in my electorate that if low the advice of the Ministerf o r the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook), and reserve any other remarks I have to make for that stage of the B ill . I am sorry to take up the time of honourable members at this late hour, but I want briefly to place on record my views with regard to the GratuityB ill . Any form of gratuitv other than cash is not acceptable to the great bulk of the returned soldiers. Some honourable members may run away with the idea that a large number of soldiers w ill accept bond's. Only a small section favour accepting that form of gratuity. The Labour party have consistently advocated a cash payment. Avas a burning one during the election, and every member of the party distinctly stated that if returned he would favour paying the gratuity in cash. The Prime Minister himself declared that he would pay cash, and if the men find out in the course of a few days that they are not going to get cash, there is just the possibility of a disturbance, owing to the dissatisfaction among them. ThoseI have come in contact with during the past few months all want to know whether they will receive cash, in accordance with tlie Prime Minister's promise, or non-negotiable bonds. I admit that the sum required, £25,000,000, is a fairl y large amount, but Admirals of the Fleet and [43] Generals of the A r m y received substantial our soldiers should desire the same for m of payment. Admiral Beatty received £100,000 ; Lord Jellicoe, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; Sir Douglas Haig, £100,000; Admiral Bing, do. £ 3 0 , 0 0 0; General Allenby, £50,000, and General Birdwood, £10,000. There appeared to be no very great anxiety about obtaining this money, and steps should be taken to find the necessary cash in order to fulfil the Prime Minister's promises. I believe that an undertaking should be honoured. I desire now to refer to. a few of the promises made during the election, although in doing so I may repeat some of the statements made by other honourable members. me a good deal of satisfaction. During the recent election campaign I told rethe Labour party were returned to power we would pay cash, and I -want those soldiers to know now that the Government have no intention of honouring the Prime Minister's promise. We were told repeatedly that the Labour party were holding out a bribe to get the soldiers' votes. The fact is that the Labour party would have obtained the soldiers' votes irrespective of any promises made in connection with the war gratuity. H a d the Labour party opposed a cash payment during the election campaign they would have received exactly the same number of votes as they did when they decided, if returned to power, to pay the gratuity in cash. H ad we been returned with a The question majority there would have been no disturbance about finding the money; it would have been found all right. There is ample money in Australia to pay the soldiers. Ample profits have been made out of the war, and some of them could certainly have gone towards financing the scheme. A certain portion of the profits made by the Colonial Sugar Eefining Companyf or the years 1916 to 1918 could have helped to pay off a part of the amount promised to the soldiers. If my memory serves me right, the Colonial Sugar Eefining Companyi n those years built up reserves and undistributed profits to the extent of £1,300,000, and their Fiji,branch profits amounted to £650,000.'",74,Joseph Cook I Wish The Honor Prevent Profiteering Decisive Action Will

412,Mr Nicholls,"Becaus e it w ill giveI f necessity had compelled the Government to take that course, some of that money could have gone towards paying the gratuity. In his policy speech at Brisbane, the Prime Minister is reported in the Melbourne Age, of 22nd October last, to have saidAs tlie result of a conference between the executive of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors' Imperial League and himself, the Government proposed to pay a gratuity to soldiers on the basis of Is. 6d. a day, in interest-bearing bonds, non-negotiable, carrying 5J per cent, infurther concessions. terest. These bonds would not be transferable except -with the Treasury Department's consent. Special arrangements would be made for redemption in cases of hardship or urgency, or for"" widows on re-marriage. The indemnity to bo paid on or before May, 1921, would be used for the purpose of redeeming from 20 to 40 per cent, of these bonds. He then went on to describe how this would benefit the soldiers. No. 1 promise. No. 2 promise was contained in a statement handed by the Prime Minister to Lieutenant Cortis, and reported as follows:Mr Cortis said lie had received a statement from Mr Hughes to read to the meeting in regard to the gratuity. Mr Hughes promised1. Immediate distribution of bonds on the assembling of Parliament. 2. Bonds will be taken by banks and Repatriation Department as the equivalent of cash in purchase of land and houses. 3. Cash will be paid in all urgent cases, and where a soldier marries or a soldier's widow re-marries. 4. Tho Government will redeem in cash by May, 1921, not less than f 12,000,000 sterling. Thet h i r d promise made by the Prime Minister appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald, of 20th November, 1919, as follows:The. Treasurer is proceeding with negotiations with the banks, and it is hoped that a still more liberal system of cashing bonds will be arranged in the course of the week. No. 4 promise, according to a report in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 21st November, 1919, was made by the Prime Ministeri n these words1 A Labour leaflet says that all the Nationalist vision in it for the payment of cash to papers refuse to support the gratuity. What do I care about that? Do you mean to say that the Nationalist papers were any concern of mine during my absence in England? When I was fighting the battle of a White Australia, for a fair deal for Australia, I had few friends here. These gentlemen would be pleased if they had anybody else to vote for, and they Mr Nicliolls. are only voting for 'me because they cannot get anybody else. If you think they can make a tool of me, vote for another tool. These are very definite and distinct promises which the honourable gentleman is repudiating now every five minutes in the day. They are in black and white, and he certainly cannot say he did not make them. Here is another, made in a speech on the 20th November, 1919, in the following words:I am now negotiating with the banks for I expect to hear from Mr Watt as to the result to-day. As to the rest of the bonds, we shall pay £10,000,000 in cash in May, 1921, when the G«rman indemnity is paid-if the indemnity is more, then you will be repaid as much as it is-if there is no indemnity, you will still get the £10,000,000. That means that you will get £17,000,000 out of the £28,000,000 war gratuity in eighteen months. That was I presume he meant in cash. Then on 22nd November, 1919, he made another promise, according to the following report :The Prime Minister announced last night that arrangements had been completed with the banks to find the sum of £6,000,000 for According to this, the payment of the war gratuity in cash to the following classes Employers have also agreed to accept bonds. The Commonwealth Government will do likewise with its employees. The State of Victoria is believed to have fallen into line, and it is hoped that other States will adopt a similar course. The Prime Minister said at Ballarat that he was making arrangements w it h the banks to cash the bonds. Immediately he made that statement the banks repudiated it . They said he had made no arrangement w it h them, and when challenged he ! said he meant that he was about to make arrangements with the banks for them to cash the bonds and enable the whole of the returned soldiers to receive cash. On 28th November he said that all unemployed soldiers would receive cash for their bonds. I have made a careful examination of the B ill , and find no proany unemployed soldier. . That is, therefore, another very distinct promise that has been broken. In his speech at Adelaide, published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the l l t h November, 1919, and headed ' Cash Over the Counter,"" "" The Gratuity Bonds,"" ""BanksW ill Pay,"" the Prime Minister saidBonds will be issued wfiich will be reserved for repatriation purposes. The hanks will also receive bonds as collateral security. The Government has made arrangements with tlie Savings Bank and all the Associated Banks by which the soldier who wants to cash his bond through other than the Repatriation Department will be able to go to the banks and get cash for it. I quote these statements hy the Prime Minister, although they have been quoted before by other honourable members, in order to show the soldiers in my electorate that the Prime Minister has utterly disregarded the promises he made to them before the last election. first place, there was no necessity for the Government to make an appeal to the country. They had ample time to make arrangements for the payment of the gratuity. months in which to get over their difficulties and make arrangements to meet their financial obligations. They did not consider the soldiers' request at that particular time. They thought it an opportune moment to make an appeal to the electors, and forgot about the promises that were made to the soldiers.. The result is that the Prime Minister and his Government, on the strength of promising the soldiers that they woidd be paid in cash, were able to secure a good number of their votes; but now that they have been returned w i th a majority-that is, with the assistance of the Country party-the Prime Minister has not the slightest intention of honouring a single promise he made to the soldiers. More than one meeting of protest has been held by the returned soldiers, and. on each and every occasion they have demanded cash. On going through the B ill , I find no provision for the payment of a gratuity allowance to the discharged naval wireless telegraphists. same risks as others, but n o provision for them appears in the B ill . I day to the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook), in the hope of getting the promise of some concession for these men, but I was not very successful. I trust that the Government w ill reconsider the matter of giving cash to those who want it . are willing to take bonds should get them, and I believe a number of returned men who have means which enable them to dispense w it h the cash are willing to take bonds bearing interest at 5£ per cent.; but there are others who are in distressed circumstances, and desire cash. Quite a number of returned men have borrowed money in anticipation of their cash gratuity; others have contracted to purchase homes on the strength of it . The bulk of them know exactly the amount to which they are entitled, and are waiting for it week after week. My only desire is that the gratuity shall be paid in money, and be paid quickly. The promise of the Prime Minister, made to In the catch votes, w ill then be redeemed, and there will be no further trouble. If the soldiers do not receive their money, they will not remain quiet; they will make a demand for it , and they are entitled to They had practically eight do so. I have' been, so to speak, almost suffocated with the gas let loose in this chamber during the discussion on the B ill , and although very desirous that' the measure shall quickly reach the Committee stage, and be finally passed, so that the gratuity may be paid, I feel that I must add a few words to the debate. Like 99 per cent, of those who have preceded me, I am going to say that I shall not detain the House very long, though, unlike them-becaus e the majority detained the House as long as they couldI hope to keep my word in this matter. As one who last week supported the proposal of the honourable! member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) that we should sit here over the week-end to get the B ill passed, I do not wish to detain honourable members very long. I want to see tbe gratuity paid, and paid in cash. When that has been arranged, we should be able to adjourn over Easter. If it were not that this' B ill is before the Those men took the House, I should not be here now, because I have not been well; and my medical adviser has ordered me to keep to my mentioned the matter the other bed; but I feel that everything should be done to amend the B ill in the direction that is desired by those on this side. No question to-day agitates the minds of returned soldiers, their friends and relations, as does the question of the gratuity. In spite of what has been said by honorThose who able members opposite, about soldiers not wishing for a cash gratuity, I declare",75,Joseph Cook I Wish The Honor Prevent Profiteering Decisive Action Will
413,Mr Xavelle (Calare) [10.53],"that the overwhelming majority of them wish to have the cash as soon as possible. There are one or two statement's made by honourable members, opposite to which I must reply. I am sorry that the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) is not in the chamber, because, although I do not intend to say anything h u r t f u l to him, when I am speaking about a man I always like him to be present. other day the honourable member said that only returned soldiers had the righ t to speak on behalf of soldiers. my reply is that I was sent here by the vote of the electors of Calare, to represent and to help the returned soldiers, the primary producers, and the workers of all classes. The only class which I do not represent is the vested interests that stand behind the National party, and are represented by Nationalist members. I have no desire to represent that class, and I shall never, either here or elsewhere, advocate its claims. I .am satisfied that the majority of the returned soldiers in Calare recorded their votes for me on the 13th December last, and did so because they knew that if the Labour party got into power they would provide for the payment of the gratuity in cash. member for Robertson show the scars of battle ? is wearing the returned soldiers' badge, ways to be found, b u t the overwhelming a n d -I do not wish to say anything hurtmajority of the men who performed f u l of him.

The honourable member for Robertson that their votes were not obtained by declared that the Government had the promise of a gratuity. brought in the B ill at the earliest possible knows that that is not so. As I honourable member for Robertson that stated in m y first speech here, the Gonine-tenths of the men desire bonds, vernment could have brought in the B ill and not cash, I would point out before the election: H a d Ministers been that at least 80 per cent, of our solsincere in their desire to give a gratuity diers were drawn from the ranks of the to returned soldiers, the necessary legislation would have been passed, and the economic system receive only sufficient gratuity would have been paid before the to enable them to buy food and raiment elections, because there was no occasion to to keep them healthy so. that they may dissolve Parliament and appeal to the produce more.

"" That was said in effect f r c m every Nationalist platform, and in the columns To that, of the press.

I asked why did the Government, if they were sincere-if they were desirous that this money should be paid to the soldiers-mak e the paymeut of the gratuity conditional on their return to power ? W h y did they r u n the risk of losing the gratuity if they thought that the Labour party would not pay it ? Despite what the Minister for the Navy may interject, I say that the action of the Government proved conclusively that they used the gratuity as a bribe for getting the votes of the returned soldiers, though T doi no'ti think that one soldier's vote was secured by it . The soldiers' votes could not be bought. There may I do not know. He be exceptional cases.

417,Mr Lavelle,"I will repeat what 1who says that nine-tenths of our soldiers do not desire that the gratuity shall be paid in cash is as regardless of the welfare of the soldiers as is a ""West African negro. I do not look upon the gratuity as a bonus to be paid to the soldiers. As I said in my opening speech in this Blouse, I regard it as the fulfilment of a promise made to the men when they went away, that they would receive 8s. per day. That promise has not been kept. certainly received 6s. per day, but the purchasing power of tbe sovereign has so depreciated that at the end of the war 6s. would not purchase more than 4s. 6d. would procure at the outset of hostilities. While our men were fighting, as we were told, to make the world safe for Democracy, the profiteers who stayed at home used! the war as an excuse to exploit the people. They put up prices to such an extent that the men on their return found that the cost of living had so increased that their 6s. per day had no greater .purchasing power than had 4s. 6d. at the commencement of the war. In support of that contention I propose to quote a few figures showing how the prices of various necessary commodities have increased. Sugar, which in 1914 cost 3d. per lb., to-day costs 6d. per lb. which cost Is. 3d. and Is. 6d., is now sold at from 2s. 6d. to 2». 10$d. per lb. Flour, which eost l i d . , now costs 3Jd. per lb. Oatmeal, which cost 3d. per lb., is now 6d. per lb. Sago, which was 2Jd. per lb. in 1914, is now 6Jd. Condensed milk, which was sold at 7d. and 8d. per t in , now costs Is. Kerosene shows an increase of a shade over 100 per cent.; matches an increase of 150 per cent., and candles an increase of 70 per cent. Milk, which was selling in 1914 at 4d. per quart, now costs 8d. per quart. has risen f r om Is. 3d. to 2s. per Ib.; butter, from Is. 2Jd. to 2s. per l b . ; and eggs from Is. 6d. per doz. to 3s. per doz. The selling price of meat has likewise increased to the extent of almost 100 per cent. All these figures go to prove my contention that the cost of living has increased to such an extent that this gratuity may rightly be regarded not as a bonus, but as a fulfilment of the promise made.vtb the soldiers when they went away that they should receive 6s. a day. [44] I shall not traverse the ground covered by other speakers as to what would have been the position had the war continued. Hadi t gone on, we should have been compelled to find money for its successf u l prosecution. During the war our men were asked to make sacrifices, and they did. Sixty thousand brave Australian lives have been laid down in the struggle to free the world from tyranny. That is what tire manhood of Australia, did. The wealth of Australia They made no sacrifice whatever. The wealth of the Commonwealth increased by £400,000,000 while the war was on. That £400,000,000 has been made out of the suffering, poverty, and misery of the people. Under the cloak of patriotism the people during the war were exploited to a greater extent than over before. We know that wealth was protected as it was made, and added to by the sacrifices of our soldiers. We know that the manhood, womanhood, and childhood of the nation have made sacrifices, and the wealth of Australia should be prepared now also to make some small sacrifice. ""When the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) move3 his amendment providing that the payment be made in cash, I shall support it . I hope it w ill be carried, and that the Tea, money will be paid to our men to spend as they please. It has been said by an honourable member opposite, Hi. least in effect, i i not in so many words, that our soldiers, who wero quite' competent to fight far Australia and the British Empire, are not competent to spend their own money in their own way. He urged that it would be necessary to safeguard the men, and to prevent the accumulation of spending power. I hold, however, that the gratuity should be paid in cash, and that, as the money w ill belong to the Bacon men, they should be l e f t to please themselves as to the way in which it should be spent. There should be no restriction, placed upon them. We should pay the gratuity in cash to the men, and let them please themselves how they spend it. We have been told that the-gratuity is to be paid by a grateful nation in recognition of what the soldiers have done. We find that this grateful country, if the B ill be carried in its present form, is going to give our soldiers bonds, bearing interest at the rate of 5J per cent, per' annum. A man who receives bonds of the face value of £100 w i ll thus gain. £5 5s. by way of interest every year, or less than half the amount neoessaTy to buy him a suit of clothes. I shall not detain the House longer. I hope the Committee stage will soon be reached, and that when the amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition is moved, we shall find honourable members opposite, who say they _ are anxious to do justice to the soldiers, voting, in accordance 'with that sentiment, for the payment of a cash gratuity at the earliest possible moment to our men.
