The British House Of Commons, Being I N The City, I Have, Anticipating The Wish Of Honor","able members, invited him to take a seat on the floor of the chamber. Royal assent to tliis Bill reported. F IFTHVICTORIAN CONTINGENT . for Defencei f he has taken any action to get evidence from Major McKnight, of the Fifth Victorian Contingent, in regard to the sentences imposed upon Australian soldiers at Pretoria a few weeks ago ? honourable friend that, with a motion of censure pending, it is tlie constitutional practice to suspend the answering, of questions by Ministers, but that I have not the least doubt that my right honourable colleague has tlie matter referred to in view. called to the form of the motion which .stands first on the notice-paper to-day. I had some doubt as to whether I could permit the motion to be moved in the House, seeing that it refers to business which is before the Committee of Ways and Means, and which has not yet been reported. After careful thought I have concluded that I shall best be promoting the pi-ogress of public business and the public interests by permitting the debate to proceed in the House, with such referenoe to the business of the committee as may be required from time to time to make matters clear. move(1) That this-House cannot accept the financial and Tariff proposals submitted by the Government(a) Because they would place the finances of the Commonwealth and the States upon an unsound and extravagant basis. (b) Because they fail to udjust the burdens of taxation and the advantages-of the free list in an equitable manuer, revealing a markedtendencj', which this House regrets to observe, to press upon necessaries of life aud appliances used iu our farming, mining, and pastoral industries more heavily than they do upon many articles of luxury. (o) And because they would, in their operation, destroy the stability of the revenue by making imposts for national purposes a source of undue profit to a few individuals, and a few favoured industries, at the expense of the whole community. (2) That the foregoing resolutions be conveyed, by address, to His Excellency tbe Governor General. 1 make no sort of apology for the course which I have taken. I believe there has I wish to ask the Minister been an attempt in some directions to complicate this issue by a reference to certain measures which are upon the paper, notably the Immigration Restriction Bill and the Pacific Islanders Bill. Thanks to the precise statistics of the Attorney-General, in reference to the Irnrnigration Restriction Bill, we now know that it was practically decided upon many months ago. And considering that it was the most vital of the whole list of Government measures-the one calling for promptest actionI do not feel that I am to blame, because-it stands on the business paper in an incomplete state. It was entirely within the power of the Government to have had the measure passed into law long ago, and also to have had the somewhat more complicated measure connected with the Kanakas put through long ago. But inasmuch as the House is solid as to the necessity for legislation in each case, although we differ radically on certain matters, I do not see that I am to be blamed because I am performing my duty in reference to thefiscal,policy of the Government at the only time when I can perform it, that being, when they submit their proposals to the House. They have fixed for me the time at which I have to deal with this matter ; I have not fixed it for myself. AlthoughI think their proposals are a sufficient challenge in themselves, I should like",14,Setup

7,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"I beg to to say that the Minister for Trade and Customs, in a manner that was the reverse of conciliatory, challenged this side of the House to assert their principles, and to bring this conflict on. I do not at all say that any challenge was necessary, and that is generally the time when such challenges are offered; but still, there it is. I suppose there is no one throughout the length and breadth of Australia who will not admit that I am taking a proper constitutional course. I also have the belief that it will, in the result, save public time. thatthis discussion will prevent a great many speeches being made in committee, and if it have that result that in itself will be a saving of time. Now, coming to the performance last Tuesday of the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs, a task that required their united efforts is one of a somewhat serious character, and I feel sure that tlie House will show me a considerable degree of patience and'courtesy in dealing with their statements. The Cabinet have made no secret of the fact that their energies have been almost exhausted in the task of preparing this Tariff and financial policy. though they have had all the skilled assistance which the Government service could afford, T have to deal with their proposals without that assistance, but whether it is a source of congratulation or not, the fact remains that it is not at all difficult to -deal with them. I cannot congratulate the Treasurer upon his share in this I have lost no opportunity of expressing my admiration of the great service which the Treasurer-has rendered to the State of Victoria inputting her finances upon a sound basis. Therefore it is not, with any desire to disparage the right honourable gentleman that I make these remarks. But I regret to find in the Treasurer of the Commonwealth a very different Minister from the Treasurer who so successfully steered Victoria through a difficult crisis, the honourable gentleman ..wife.refeisnce to the Estimates of expenditure which he has ' submitted to which I shall refer later on. Now, as to the Minister for Trade and Customs, I think it was an unhappy decision which introduced him into the arena at so early a stage in the proceedings. No one denies the fighting powers of my right honourable friend, but the usual result of a first-class display from Mr Reid, him is the creation of an enormous amount of dust, and at the beginning of an historical debate of this sort the less dust we have the better. Therefore, I should very much have preferred the simpler methods of the Treasurer to those of the Minister for Trade and Customs, who always seems to me in his peculiar elocution and effects like a lion-tamer in a poultry yard. The methods of the right honourable gentleman are magnificent, and would be appropriate if he were dealing I believe with some wild kings of the forest in a menagerie, but when he has only tame and docile Members of Parliament to speak to, it seems to me'that his methods are somewhat above the situation. The right honourable gentleman was never more magnificent than he was in his speech on the Tariff, and the only thing the right honourable gentleman never referred to during the several hours occupied by his speech was the ' Tariff. Now, if the Treasurer had given us the main principles upon which this fiscal policy was founded, or if he had given us some information as to the Tariff, that might have been passed by ; but the fact Alremains that whilst this House and the country were anxious to have a clear exposition of the effects of this remarkable Tariff, it was the last, thing the Treasurer offered us. He told us he had prepared a return which had classified the items in the Tariff into sixteen divisions; but In the first place, even those who are familiar with Tariffs must have found it very difficult to follow financial statement. the arrangements of the right honourable member. However, there the Tariff is, and we have had some time to look at it . One of the chief merits the Minister for Trade and Customs claimed for this Tariff was that-there was no insidious drag-net about it, but that it was a plain, straightforward document. Now this Tariff contains more drag-nets under the mysterious initials of "" x E.I."" than any TariffI am acquainted with, and some of the duties which are buried under these initials are of a sometakes up a position what remarkable character. I 'shall refer to them presently ; but, I think, since I have to deal with the whole matter in as brief a form as possible, that before I come to the Tariffi t is only right that I should make some reference to matters which we should not forget upon an occasion of this sort. I think honourable members will forgive me in the first place if I have a word or two to say with reference to the StateI represent It is well known that the people of New South in that part of Australia. There is one Wales-free-trader s as they are-to a cermanufacturer who has already sent a testitain extent sacrificed their fiscal belief in monial to the Ministry-wh o has conorder to help on the great enterprise of gratulated them-and I think his action federal union. They were prepared to take is explained by the fact that he is exwhat fortune had in store for them, believpecting to make a fortune out of this reing from the many assurances they had remarkable Tariff. I am afraid, however, ceived, that whatever the fiscal policy of that congratulations of that sort will the Federal Government might be, there was not carry much political weight with themi -»ery little probability that it would be of I should like to give the Prime Minister's an extreme character. That is the belief words, so that there may be no inaccuracy. under which the people of New South WalesI n the Maitland speech the people were told entered this union. union the most lightly taxed people through the Customs-o r even, taking the hibition or excessive protection will lead to the whole of our taxation, the most lightly prevention of that access of revenue which is. taxed people in the world. They entered absolutely this Commonwealth with all the industries in the State in a thoroughly free and healthy condition. Even their manufacturing industries showednoneof that ominous dependence upon those principles of fiscal policy from which some people in other ports of Australia hope so much; and as a result we had manufacturing industries which were able to faGe the world, and to increase the number of male operatives at a much faster rate than was possible in Victoria under the other policy. We had that broad set revenue without regard to the effect ? of facts before us. Now, in New SouthI say that is exactly what the Government AVales we should be paying, under this have done in the Tariff before us. They Tariff, 36 per cent, of the whole of the have submitted proposals ostensibly for taxation of the Commonwealth. I think revenue, without any regard for the effect that is a matter that is not altogether unwhich they will produce. It will not be worthy of notice on a great occasion of this difficult to show that even the largest lines sort. The people of New South Wales of revenue, which free-traders and proteccame freely and generously into this Comtionists alike almost agree to put outside monwealth, believing, at any rate, that the pale of fiscal controversy, are most they would be called upon to pay afair amount dangerously imperilled by the proposals of "" towards the revenue ; but now, through the the Government.

But I always speak w it h know to-day how the Tariff has been received | reservation in reference to the Prime 17 s They also entered the by the Prime MinisterOur protection must be moderate, because pronecessary for the proper government. and security of the Commonwealth. I think I shall be able to show, and I am sure experience will shdw, that this Tariff has. been so constructed that Ministers have e x hibited an absolute disregard of the interests.. and stability of the public revenue-that . their proposals are artificial to the highest degree, and are fatal to anything like a . stable, increasing, and elastic Customs. revenue in this Commonwealth. The Prime Minister saidAVhat is the issue, then ? Shall we raise we pile all the duties on the cottager ancTv artisan ? I Minister, because no one has ever accused hini of any knowledge or study of matters of this sort. This is not the Prime Minister's Tariff. I believe that, with the most careless attention from the Prime Minister, he would have been more successful than those who have been the master minds in the construction know the master minds of this Tariff although of ""N.K.I."" who have been framing and I need not go further than the Minister for Trade and Customs. great ability ; but I do not suppose there is a man in Australia who would pick this distinguished public man out to ask his advice on a matter of industrial concern on which any one would risk a £5 note. There is no business man in Australia, who is studying the interests of the smallest industry, who would stake, on that Minister's judgment, the smallestamountof currency. I shall not insult tlie Ministry by saying that they have been open to improper influences ; I shall not, for a moment, impute anything of that sort. Ministers had a veiy delicate task to perform, and I hope they will be able to say that they have kept men who have a personal interest in this Tariff at as great a distance as they possibly could. I feel sure, at least I hope, that is so; because if persons interested in the Tariff were admitted to the counsels of Ministers, I think a few people who are interested in paying the taxation ought also to have been admitted, in which case, I guarantee, the result would have been highly beneficial. Now we come to the proclamation made by the Treasurera proclamation of free-trade. It came slowly and heavily from the hps of the Minister for Trade and Customs, did this proclamation of free-trade. What does it mean? means that, so far as all Australians are concerned, their one ambition and desire was that there should not be the slightest obstacle thrown in the way of their commercial freedom, and upon that part of free trade we have our friends, who bring down this remarkable Tariff, joining with us in the applause which greets the beginning of free commercial throughout the length and breadth of Australia. But to rejoice in an instalment of free-trade of any kind and to place this Tariff of the Ministiy on the table, argues an elasticity of political principle which is without precedent. is that Ministers went before Australia on Mr Seid. this basis-""Our main anxiety will be the production of revenue, and that the burdens levied on the people of Australia shall go into the public Treasury to defray the expenses of government j we shall regard protection,' but of this Tariff. We not as protection was regarded by some honourable members and distinguished men they come under the initials ten or twenty years ago. Ten or twenty We kijow the masterspirits years ago they fought for protection as if it this Tariff; were the one influence that would carry prosperity and industrial greatness throughWe all know his out Australia. Twenty years ago people were asked to take these burdens on themselves, assured that if they did so, the future industrial destinies of Australia were placed on a stable, progressive, and flourishing basis."" But now, with the experience which has been borne in on Australians, and with the vicissitudes of hard times, we see a different attitude upon the Ministerial benches and in the Ministerial manifestoes with reference to protection. It is no longer the conquering principle that is to make Australia great. No; the Prime Minister speaks of protection as if she were a shivering mendicant to whom some sort of charitable feeling must be shown. That is the change which has come over the advocates of protectionI do not say in some parts of Australia, but I think in nearly all. The position that protection can make a country great has been abandoned, and now protection figures on' the list of charitable objects-sh e has become an object of charitable concern. "" Shall we strangle these infants that have been struggling for 30 years in an attempt to become manly and strong ? Shall-we not save them-shal l we not, to some' extent, do something to prevent the pattering of bare feet along the streets of It Australia"" ? The highest ideal of the mission which the Prime Minister had in reference to protection was to save the little feet of Australia from pattering bare along the streets in front of deserted factories. I am happy to say that our cause stands upon a much stronger footing. We do not ask for a sound revenue Tariff on the basis of charity. We ask for it as a intercourse right of the people of all classes and of all industries, and we say as to charity"" We are as charitable as you, but we help, instead of entangling, the industries of the people in similar restraints and similar disastrous expedients, which lead to mendiThe fact, of the matter cancy, and destroy self-reliance and individual life j our assistance will be of a strictly charitable character."" a grand thing, which, whether in political life or private life, human existence. But the most charitable men as a rule are those who make charity a different thing from business management and business enterprise. charity up in their business are men who never have money to give away in charityToo sharp a line can never be drawn between the business interests and business concerns of the community and the cause of charity. Yes, we are all charitable ; but none of us wish to tie burdens on the young industries of Australia in the name of charity. None of us wish to strangle our great pioneer industries in order to keep alive some of those who cannot assert their right to live. is impossible to extend charity unless you draw on some one's pocket, and it is the worse form of charity which draws upon the pockets of the farmer, the miner, and the pioneer settler in order to maintain a number of artificial industries, winch are surrounded by all the comforts and enjoyments of life. The Treasurer, with that superficial assurance of language, which imposes so much on gentlemen who are disposed to agree with him, proclaimed in triumphant -terms that "" Free-trade is with us."" This was a glorious announcement to some of us. It was highly theatrical, but still it was a noble pronouncement"" Free-trade is with us!"" We cheered that announcement, and my right honourable friend saw some significance in those cheers. It occurred to him 'that there was something supremely ridiculous in the statement of a man who was about to table this Tariff, talking of free trade, as productive of national benefit. Thereupon he made this qualification. He added "" Free-trade amongst the people of States subscribing to the same conditions of life."" A very fine platitude! An able, a broad, an equal pronouncement! Speaker-no t we, perhaps, but do not the people of Australia know-the variety that exists in the conditions of life prevailing in this young Continent of Australia ? Do we now know the difference there is between enjoying the comforts of life, and the shorter hours of labour, in these protected industries in the great cities of the sea-coast, with their trams, their theatres, and their gin palacesdo we not know the difference between those conditions of life and the conditions of life .17 s 2 ; Censure. 6015 Charity is which surround the men who are building up the true greatness of Australia in the dignifies interior districts of this continent 1 There is an idea amongst men of shallowness in politics that once you have a political constitution that gives to every man, and perMen who mix haps to every woman, a vote, the conditions of life are made equal. But do we not know, in tliis young country, as also in the great republic of the United States, even though the Constitution speaks in language which seems to point to an equal share of rights and advantages, that in the working out of the great development of Australia there are hundreds of thousands of people living upon the sea-coast of this vast Commonwealth who do not have the same burdens upon them as are cast upon others in the wilds of It the continent? There are no crops to fail in Melbourne and Sydney. There are here none of those vicissitudes which make one feel that men who go out upon the soil of the interior and make homes for themselves, not only have not the same conditions of life as those in the cities, but are men whose lot in life and whose lot in labour we should make' as easy as we can. What is the use of a free and equal franchise if men have not free and equal treatment in all those things which make the money they earn less or more valuable to them ? What is a man's toil, after all, but that which is represented in coin at the end of his week's work ? For money is the medium by which he buys for himself and his family the necessaries of life. Unless we make a man's coin and his wages go as far as they honestly ought to go in the battle of life, we do not treat that man fairly-w e do not treat him equally. My indictment against this Tariff-a n indictment upon which it will be condemned throughout the length and breadth of Australia; because this is not the end of the battle in the Commonwealth -thi s is the beginning of the battle-is upon this ground. I see no mark of deDo we not know, Mr formity and of injustice upon this Tariff greater than the way in which artificial industries are treated, as compared with the manner in which tlie pioneer industries of Australia are treated. When I speak of artificial industries, I speak of industries which notoriously have to come to the Treasury for money to keep them alive. I do not care what the industry is so long as it pays its own way. And surely 30 years of this benevolent policy in Victoria might have made more self-reliant some of these industries which are supposed still to require such strong nourishment ? Do not let it be Mr Speaker, that I have any feeling or desire to bring suffering upon the artisans of this great city of Melbourne. The strength of my belief in the policy I advocate stands upon the best of all foundations. It has been tried amongst the artisans of Sydney. W ill any one say that the artisans of Sydney are more intelligent, more industrious, than those of Melbourne? Victorians will not say so. Yet these artisans who are the objects of -lerision on the part of some Victorian authorities on protection, are asking for no Tariff protection. They are asking for none of your benevolence. They ask to be left alone. Speaker, which came to me without the slightest knowledge on my part that such a letter was to be addressed to me. I am going to read it in order to draw a coutrast between a manufacturing industry which has had to fight its way under natural conditions, and the same industiy which has been drawn to its position of mendicancy along a dreary path of benevolence. Sometimes benevolence is a thing that corrodes a man more than anything else in the world. Sometimes the receipt of the pauper's dole does more to demoralize a man or an industry than competing with the cheap labour of the world. have said, Mr Speaker, I have received a letter, not from some political economist, but signed by the three largest manufacturers in Australia in an industry which is a free-trade industry in New South Wales-the manufacture of boots and shoes. It is an important industry in Arictoria; it has become an equally important industry in New South Wales, employing a very large number of hands. I received this letter yesterday, signed, as I say, by the three largest boot manufacturers of Australia, employing close upon 1,000 hands between them. employs 303 hands, another 345 hands, and the third 320 hands; and the letter is also signed by the largest manufacturer of slippers in Australia, Mr S. Solomon, who employs, in that small line of industry, 95 hands. This is the letter they have addressed to me :Sydney, 11th October, 1901. Sir,-\Ve, the undersigned boot manufacturers, to have some regard not only for revenue, clesire to enter, through you, a strong protest Mr lieid. against the duties now sought to be imposed by the Federal Government. Our reasons are briefly :-Each of our businesses has been successthought for a moment, fully established under free-trade, and we wish to emphasize this very important fact, that under this policy we have developed the three largest boot factories and one largest slipper factory in the Commonwealth. Should information be needed to confirm the above statement, we should be most happy to forward it, but we do not think what has been stated will be controverted. Under federation we recognise there must be a Tariff, and in our opinion 15 per cent, ad valorem is the maximum that would be revenue producing on boots and shoes. Now, there is a clear issue. Here are manufacturers in New South Wales paying the same wages-withou t a wages board, without any scientific appliances to force something out of the manufacturers for the I have received a letter, Mr benefit of the workers-as are paid in Arictoria, and here are men getting the same wages by their own strength. They do not need to beseech Parliament to give them strength to fight their employers. They fight them in the open, and beat them. I suppose that to the average man that simple fact has more political philosophy in it than any other fact in the world. In what countries can men fight capital in the open 1 They can fight them in the open in England! The great trades unions of England can stand up against the great capitalistic combinations of Great Britain and win. When the workers of America-behin d the enorAsI mous barricades which were to make them prosperous and strong and self-reliantstrike, some of them are shot down and others are fined for contempt of court. They have a remarkable contrivance in the United States for dealing with labour troubles. An employer has only to go before a J udge and declare on affidavit that he apprehends some trouble with his workmen, and an order is pronounced by the Judge forbidding the workmen to make that trouble. If the difficulty comes along, then the workmen are guilty of contempt for disobeying the injunction of the court. Such One are the benefits and blessings which labour gets behind the giant barricades erected in the United States of America. But in New South Wales, in the very trade I have mentioned, the men receive maximum wages without any compulsion except that of their own strength and manhood. I will read to honourable members an explanation of some of tlie duties proposed by this Government, which professes but for the ordinary humanity of taxation. What is the principle of humanity that should underlie taxation as far as possible ? It is that the burdens of the State should be made to press upon the different classes of the community, in proportion to their ability to bear those burdens. That is the rule which lies at the root of every sound principle of taxation ; and that is the principle which is flouted again and again in the tariff proposed by this Government. I take now tlie difference between the manufacturers of New South Wales, who only wish to be let alone, and the position of the industry under the duties which this Government propose upon men and women's boots and shoes. I have obtained this information from one of the largest business houses in Melbourne, and it is the result of actual working. A duty of 20s. a dozen and 15 per cent, ad valorem on men's boots and shoes, sizes above 5, ranges, according to my authority, from 33 per cent, to 61 per cent. The worse of it is that the 61 per cent, duty is on the boots of the poor, and the 33 per cent, is on boots worn by the well-to-do. If that is a principle of taxation which this House is going to establish, we shall become a first class conservative body right awaya first class old tory protectionist body. We shall liave the old tory policy of England blossoming again upon young Australia. There are twelve grades of value in boots, ranging from 3s. 9d. per pair, up to 10s. The boots at 3s. 9d. a pair, and those a little above that price, are the boots which the masses of the people wear. It is the 61 per cent, ad valorem duty which is to be imposed upon them, while the 33 per cent, duty is to be put on the boots that cost 10s. per pair. I ventured to predict, a day or two before the tariff was published, that the true iniquity of it would be concealed under some disguise; that the Government would not have tlie courage to come forward and put on ad valorem duties, and let the public know what they had to pay. Hence this discovery of what the Treasurer calls a composite rate. There is no composite rate for silks and velvets and gloves. Twenty per cent, is thought to be quite enough for gloves and 15 per cent, for silks and velvets. There is no complication in those cases. Straightforward ad viuorem duties are fixed. But the boots of tlie masses of the people must be caught on a specific duty of 20s. a dozen pairs first, and then the Government clap on tlie duty-whic h is payable on silks, velvets, and gloves-of 15 per cent, ad valorem. I come now to women's boots. Their prices range from 3s. 9d I mean the average quality thatare sold in the shops-to 9s. 6d. a pair. On the boots at 3s. 9d. per pair the duty is 50 per cent, ad valorem; on the 9s. 6d. boots it is 30 per cent, ad valorem. If the Prime Ministeri n his speech at Maitland had told the people of New South Wales that he was going to put 60 per cent, on tlie cheap boots and shoes of the men and women of New South Wales, he would not have been here to-day; he would not have been in his present position to-day. He would be scouted as a public man. This, however, is a composite rate, and it is hoped that the public will not see what that means. Twenty sliillings a dozen pairs ! How cheap that seems. Why, it is dirt cheap ! And yet beneath it there is this monstrous inequality. Let us contrast the position of manufacturers and their men fighting the world with good machinery-goo d machinery is necessary in order to do that; but any sort of old machinery will do when there is a fence put round the people-wit h that protection which appals the champion of the industries of Victoria, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, with its absolute insufficiency. This sort of thing absolutely shocks him. The people of Victoria are accustomed to take protection neat, aud this Tariff is a sort of blend. Butblendasitis it is too strong for the people of Australia, and proceeds on a wrong principle. "" Oh,"" it may be said, "" b u t just look at the difference. The people who come in and buy a pair of boots at 10s. pay 15 per cent on the difference between the 3s. 9d. and the 10s. boots, in addition to the specific rate."" I think it is a simple fact, which no honourable member' will deny, no matter on what side he sits, that, once a man gets above a certain basis"" of income, it is absolutely impossible for the Customs duties to seriously affect him. A man with £1,000 or £2,000 a year can look upon duties on boots and shoes with absolute contempt. What are the boots which he wears in a year, and how much more do they cost him i Practically nothing! But the mass of the people of the country are those to whom the price of men's, women's, and children's boots is a very serious matter of concern, because they have to pay out of a fund which goes every week. Their capital goes each week. It appears and vanishes from week to week. It may excite the ridicule or laughter of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, because it has been a source of good capital to him. investment tlie honourable member has ever made, or is ever likely to make, and I point to him as a gentleman who can afford to laugh at these little matters of detail. They are sources of profit to him. names of these manufacturers ? Hunter and Son Limited, McMurtrie and £1 which goes into the Treasury under this Company Limited, and S.

I wish to point out a matter which honourable members who represent He is a merchant and he must know that other States will probably find of more imwhat I am stating is correct.

But a Tariff of £9,000,000 for Australia which is built up in this way means £9,000,000 for Australia and £9,000,000 more for Melbourne and Sydney.

I am prepared to follow the Government upon the question of tlie advantage of having sugar grown by white labour if we can only work out that problem. I will not go more fully into the matter now, but I have a very strong suspicion that, unless there is a bounty given direct by the Government to the farmer, the wrong man will get it . There is a vast monopoly in Australia known as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company which makes enormous profits out of the Victorian fiscal philosophy. That company admires the Victorian Tariff. They have made hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the people in Melbourne, though the latter do not grow sugar cane. They have established a mammoth monopoly in Australia. I desire to see all these profits go to the farmers. I am prepared, In order to promptly settle the question of the employment of Kanakas, to accept the proposals of the Government upon that subject. But in doing away with Kanaka labour we are imposing a great burden upon the people of Australia. otherwise I should not support the Government proposals. But this is a matter which will have to be revised after the Kanaka has gone, and after a fair interval of time has elapsed. When Ministers t r y to entangle the Kanaka question with this great question I think that they get below the level of highminded politics. question need not be entangled with a matter affecting the industrial destiny of tins country 1 Surely when we have driven the black man out of Australia we are not going to poison our own system of industry ? It was said over and over again that the Kanaka Bill was intertwined with the Tariff, and it was brought on ostentatiously just before the Tariff was introduced. Surely we can do an act of justice to Queensland in this matter, and do our duty about the Kanaka without mixing up with it matters of high national concern that affect the people for all time ? I think we might, and I propose to do it . NowI come to another matter which must be of great importance to members of this Chamber, and again apart from the fiscal question. Let us again remember those solemn assurances that were directed to the tax-paying people of Australia when this enterprise of national union was recommended to them for acceptance. Wasi t not with unrivalled force and ability from the leading journals and leading public men of Australia pointed out to them that by establishing this Commonwealth, by giving to one central power a multitude of functions of government, which six independent powers were at the time discharging at great loss and inconvenience, instead of adding to the burdens of the people their burdens would in that way be lightened; that the atmosphere would be cleared and that we should have established in this Commonwealth an orderly system of governmentthings national under the national Government, and tilings provincial under the provincial Governments-whic h was to place the finances of the Commonwealth and the finances of the States upon a fair and economical foundation ? Was not that the assurance of our public men to the people of Australia? Are we going to carry it out?' Are we going to feel in this Chamber some sort of lingering consciousness of the solemn obligations into which we entered with the people who sent us here ? Now, I test the financial policy of this Government on the I believe that they are, question of extravagance, and I denounce it. I sliall now show the different gentleman with whom we have to deal in Sir George Turner, the Commonwealth Treasurer, and the Treasurer who earned so much proper credit in administering the finances of Victoria. Who could have expected that he would stand at this table, as he did, and Surely the Kanaka submit to us estimates of expenditure running up to large amounts, which he was at pains to tell us had been inflated by the States for several years past, which he was at pains to Lell us by returns in the matter of defence had been increased in three orfour years from a total of £522,000 for all Australia, to a total, which he submits, of £882,080, an increase of 70 per cent. ! We know it is not the Treasurer. He stands there as a Minister, and has to take his share of responsibility. I do not see him in that, I see the extravagance of the Cabineti n it . It was not a man of his calibre who should have come to this table and have said he was submitting inflated estimates of public expenditure, but that he hoped with our assistance to reduce them. It was a question, he said, of whetherho should wait until the Commandant came, and",21,Motion Of Censure

I say we may have a procession .eternity, and they will not lighten our military expenditure. these estimates of expenditure mittedly travagant, and yet the Government put them before us for our acceptance. So that, -out of their own mouths, I convict them of submitting penditure. ture to revenue, and here we find a singular difference of treatment, which has, I think, a clear motive in it. Treasurer putting his estimates of expenditure on the basis of the year 1900, which, he says, was an abnormally inflated year, and then he points to the year 1899 .as supplying the right basis for a revenue year. When we come to consider imports and exports, the Treasurer says that there were imports to the value of £41,000,000 in 1900, but that we must take a number of millions ofF that, and get back to the year 1899. the amount high duties will look, and the more --absolutely they will impress upon us. I quite admit that there was an inflation to some extent, but I regard the amount at which the right honourable gentleman has fixed the -as absolutely ridiculous. Now there was . a process of unloading going on at the same ' time, and no allowance seems to have been made for that. There was a very large -amount of unloading going on in Australia in connection with these proposals. I look .upon the allowance of £4,000,000 for in-.flation as extravagant, and I also point out .that no allowance is made for normal increase in three years. We know that the history qf our trade for the last six years has shown strong increases year after year, but no allowance for normal increase is made, and we are taken back to 1899 to make the basis as narrow as possible for imports in order to make the high duties seem more absolutely necessary. the Treasurer's estimates, whoever prepared them, are inaccurate in that respect. I shall mention one or two matters which, I think, show that the reductions made by the Treasurer were excessive. £4,000,000 for inflation of values, and £2,500,000 for loading up. Well, I have said there was an unloading process, and I Mr Reid. believe that the loading up did not amount to so much. a little in New South Wales. are adloading up has been in connection with a inflated and admittedly exfew items, and has not been general. The best information I can get is that the amount stated is excessive. I pass the gold and specie and Government goods, as I extravagant estimates of extake the Treasurer's estimates for them. I I go now away from expendinow come to the allowance for the free list of £6,500,000. I appeal to the common sense of this Chamber, in view of the facts We have the I have referred to, as to the condition of our industries in the interior-because, do not forget that they have not 61 per cent, to protect them. They have to fight against India, against the Argentine Republic, and against Russia, in the markets of the world.

Because the smaller whom we are going to put more handicaps ? of estimates, the nicer Are the men who are struggling to keep your great farming industry alive, the men themselves on whom you will pile up burden upon burden for the rice and the starch of Melbourne-for the hats, the boots, and the shoes, and a thousand and one things here? inflation-£4,000,000 There is no clap-trap after all about referring to the farmers. My honourable friends opposite have spoken about them often enough when they wanted to put duties on. When they wanted to reconcile them to the bitter dose, they dosed them enough with attention. I am going to give them a little attention with tlie honest desire to lighten their burdens. I take this free list, and what do I find ? There is a special return which looks more like a page in a scientific encyclopasdia. One or two healthy items in it would do a world of good. Where are agricultural machinery and implements ? They are in the 15 per cent, ad valorem list-the._djjjby;^ v on silks, velvets, and furs.

22,I Say Again That Mr Reid,"S o far as I can learn theVictoria found out the exquisite absurdity of putting duties on the refrigerating machines which are used to keep the temperature of the butter factories steady, so as to increase the value of the product. Victoria had a duty, and abolished it some years ago. New Zealand had a duty, and abolished it a little time The Federal Government bring it in as a new duty-2 5 per cent, under ""N.E.I."" I am not going to take up the time of honourable members with details just now. They will pardon me for mentioning one or two illustrations. There is one, which is brought in in that way. Surely, in that wonderfully constructed free list there might be room for the agricultural machinery of Australia, because remember, although agriculture was once Victorian, we are now dealing with tlie agriculture of Australia. We are trying to speed the plough over hundreds of thousands of fertile acres in all parts of this continent. That is the broad prospect before us. That is the field on which these proposals will work, and surely the Government might have put these things on the free list-no t to be touched by the tax-gatherer. I , of course, shall be told that the farmers of Victoria will derive an enormous amount of benefit from these duties. I should like to mention what was the position of the Victorian farmer in the year 1888 on the authority of the highest protectionist publication here. Tliis is the statement thirteen years agoThe greatest consideration which can be given to the farmers is to protect them in whatever department their produce has yet to compete with imports in the local markets. About the only item in which this competition takes place is stock, and it is only natural that, in respect to this, the fanners should demand and receive effective protection. There was nothing that could be added to the benefits which protection could confer upon them thirteen years ago but the stock tax. away from them by federation. I would ask honourable members-becaus e this is a test of policies, and we are in a position to compare them in two adjacent States-to listen to this picture drawn a few days ago by the leading protectionist newspaper in Victoria-and it may be accurate sometimes-of the farming industryThere has been, during the last twenty years, an increase of our rural population, and a multiplication of agencies for dealing with the products of the country, but has there been a corresponding development of production ? Agricultural statistics give ns a startlingly unstisfactory answer to this question. As comparatively little as possible in the way of taking up new lands, expansion depends to a great extent upon securing larger returns from those already under occupation. It is precisely this kind of agricultural improvement that there is no evidence of iu ago. our statistical returns. On the contrary, startling proofs are available of a retrograde movement. Of the 36,500,000 acres of land under occupation in Victoria, only 3,824,898 acres is cultivated. In 1881 the area was 1,997,943 acres, so that we have taken twenty years to double the area of cultivation. That we have now reached a period of still slower progress is shown by the fact thab the cultivated area was 3,877,922 acres three years ago. While the acreage increased last j'ear, there was a falling-off of 329 in the number of cultivated holdings. The returns of last season showed an increase of oats to tlie extent of 91,409 acres, and haj' to the extent of 01,910 acres ; but there were decreases on all other important crops wheat, 148,372 acres; barlej', 20,715 acres; maize, 1,648 acres; peas and beans 4,421 acres ; potatoes, 16,992 acres ; onions, 1,621 acres ; with a falling off also in rye, mangolds, beet, other roots, hops, and tobacco. The last argument was, "" Well, it is true things are disappointing, but wait until we get Inter-State free-trade; wait until the Victorian farmer has the run of the Australian continent, and then }'ou will see the giant strides he will make."" But in the very dawn of this great change, when this free Australia is about to be opened to the enterprise of manufacturers and farmers of Victoria, what is their position, their attitude? Do we find a trace of buoyancy, excitement, enterprise? Do we find a single wing being added to a Melbourne factory, a single brick being put on another brick to reap this rich harvest from the simple free-traders of Australia ? No. Farmers, according to this, the chief protectionist paper, a day or two ago, are in a retrograde condition, manufacturers any thing but jubilant. On the other side we find factories, houses, rents going up-no t that that is a good thing in itself, but still it is a Their stock tax has been taken sign of prosperity : it is never a sign of ruin, at any rate. We have tlie empty houses filling up, great factories in course of erection. The big men from Adelaide and Melbourne are putting up factories in Sydney after reaping the harvest in those two States for twenty years. ""When the Australian harvest comes, Sydney is going to get it after all. A t any rate, if we do get it we shall have earned it, because we shall not have paid anything for it . AVe shall have got it by our own enterprise. But it is a remarkable thing that now that the great opportunity for Victoria has come, there is nothing but stagnation. another disappointment tionists, I am afraid. I should like to pass on to the question of the revenue, as I want to show the extravagant basis upon which the Tariff is framed. The Treasurer asks the people to submit to a Tariff which will raise £8,900,000. Tariff, and it is about as high an amount of revenue as any one could ever dream of getting from imports; Treasurer's calculation be correct. now, let us see whether the Treasurer pursues a prudent ' course by not upon an inflated year, but upon a normal year. Surely, in laying the foundations of the finances for this great Commonwealth, we should build upon something solid. The Treasurer goes to the year 1899 for solidity, when he puts his duties oil, and why should he not go to 1899 for solidity when he estimates his revenue ? According to his own statement, £7,437,000, and adding £300,000 to that for the Eederal expenditure, in a normal year we should get a total revenue of £7,737,000. now to put on £1,200,000 more than that. He asks the people to pay although the revenue in a normal year, 1899, came to only £7,437,000, the sum now expected to be derived from duties will be nearly more than was received during the abnormal .year that has just closed; so that on tlie revenue basis an abnormal basis has been chosen for taxing the people, although according to the Minister, 1899 was a normal year. If Australia could live on that money, and all Australia did live on it, in 1899, we should be able to live on it now. of taxation upon the people of Australia, and still two or three of the States will be short of the amount they formerly received from the Customs. The total that I have given for 1899 includes £1,000,000 of intercolonial duties, and I am assuming that the Treasurer has taken another £1,000,000 of taxes in Order to make up for that. like to point out that in all these Tariff arrangements there is a marvellous amount of attention paid to the industrial tendencies of a man who makes glass bottles or barbed wire or corks. The profound that has been exhausted by this Eederal Mr lieid. Ministiy in the interests of the man who makes glass bottles is something marvellous. This is We find that there is a duty of 7s. per cwt. for the protecproposed to be imposed upon horse-shoe nails; that is equivalent to 33 per cent. Now, here we have the statesmen of Australia sitting in Cabinet, discussing the momentous question as to how the horseshoe nail industry is to be' dealt with, That is a pretty big and the assembled intellects of Australia coming to the conclusion that the matter is one that really requires some attention. especially if the They find that in the enlightened State of But Victoria there has heen a 14s. d u t j' on horseshoe nails, and if they had made going other inquires they would also have found that they can get the iron made to the requisite sizes in cheap labour countries, and that when they get the iron into the colony all that they had to do is to use little clinches to cut pieces ' to certain lengths, and give them a little tap On the top, and there is an Australian nail. There is tlie Australian horsethe revenue for 1899 was shoe nail industry-ther e is a triumph of manufacturing enterprise. This is an industry that we must clip a little, because I . understand that 14s. per cwt. is equal to But the Treasurer proposes 66 per cent., and that 7s. would be equal to 33 per cent. The Ministiy say"" As we £9,000,000, are for revenue without destruction, we must take a little off this, and we will reand duce the duty on horseshoe nails to 7s. per cwt."" Barbed wire, which is to be subject £1,000,000 to a duty of 20 per cent., represents another great Melbourne industry. The wire is made in the countries where labour is cheap, and is then brought into Melbourne, where little bits of metal are snipped off and twisted round the wire at decent intervals-and there we have the product of the Australian barbed wire industry, which reflects such enormous credit on the The Treasurer puts £9,000,000 enterprise of the people of Melbourne. It does not occur to the Ministry that that barbed wire is bought by settlers all through Australia, who are fighting against pioneering troubles in the bush. It does not occur to them that these horseshoe nails are wanted, in those districts where the people have not a locomotive to draw them to their I should work every morning. Oli, no! These industries must be cared for. Since there is no industiy too small for the statesmanlike interest and ingenuity of the Ministiy, is it not a pity that they statesmanship could not devote some little consideration to the great industries of Australia upon which we all depend for any prosperity we have? I do not want to underrate the immense advantage of producing as much as we can in our own country, but I give to the industry in the barbed-wire shop and in the horseshoe-nail shop no higher value than I attach to all labour throughout Australia. To my mind every honest worker throughout Australia is engaged in colonial industry-whateve r he is doing. That is the broad line on which I float the flag of colonial industry; but according to this Tariff the industry of the man who is solving national problems from the rising to the setting of the sun in the heart of this droughty land is not of sufficient importance for this Cabinet to conplus 66 per cent.; safety matches, 25 per sider. I do not say that we should give him a duty of 33 per cent, to protect him, but we might put his machinery on the free list. Every one knew that the throwing open of tlie markets of Australia could bring no gain to the farmer of Victoria. As a matter of fact it has brought him a loss, because the stock tax was alive to the very last, as people found out only recently. I say that the great industries of Australia are not treated fairly, and thateverything that is used the Tariff. But instead of this protection by these pioneers-the farmers and the miners-shoul d have been placed on the free list. There has been an attempt made to put something on the free list for the miner, but nothing that is worth much. Is not mining machinery one of the most vital things for the development of mining in all parts of Australia, now that the best of tlie alluvial is gone, and gold is so hard to get ? Yet we cannot find a line among these £6,000,000 worth of untaxed imports for mining machinery. been prominence in the newspapers, I need not refer to them more fully here. I want now to bring before the notice, of the House a statement which will throw a great deal of light on the real protection which Commonwealth manufacturers enjoy. When Ministers quote the Tariff rates, and say"" That is the protection we are giving this or that manufacturer,"" let me point out to the House the natural protection which most of these manufacturers have before the customs reach any-one of them. I will mention a few lines. In soft goods, which, I suppose, are most easily imported, the natural protection ranges from 1\ per cent, to 27|per cent., but in addition to this 27£ per cent, on cheaper goods, there is a duty of 20 per cent, on blankets. In furniture, there is a natural protection ranging from 40 per cent, to 120 pei* cent., and another .20 per cent, is added. In glassware, the natural protection ranges from 65 per cent, to 93 per cent., and another 40 per cent, is added. On bottles, the natural protection is from. 75 pei cent, to 100 per cent., and a com1 posite duty of about 75 per cent, is added. On household pottery, the natural protection is 75 per cent, to 100 per cent., plus a duty of 65 per cent, to 112 percent. On blue, there is a natural protection of 15 percent., plus 60 per cent.; on candles, 12 per cent., plus 32 per cent.; corn-flour, 33 per cent., cent., plus 50 per cent.; preserved milk, 12-^ per cent, plus 35 per cent.; rice, 8 to 10 per cent, plus 66 per cent, to 100 per cent.; salt, 100 percent., plus 66 per cent.; starch, 18Jper cent., plus 80 per cent.; and sago, 10 per cent., plus 50 per cent. We thus see that there is an enormous advantage, owing to our geographical position, which the Commonwealth manufacturer enjoys, apart altogether from being thoughtI shall not say gnough-bu t a fair instalment, Ministers are actually piling on these necessaries of life additional heavy burdens. I will mention the way in which Ministers seem to have apportioned the burdens of the people. If there is a principle which is universally accepted in matters of taxation, it is that luxuries shall be taxed more heavily than the necessaries of life. That principle is followed in connection with narcotics and stimulants, which These lines have are luxuries of life. To some people, perreferred to with sufficient haps, they are necessaries; but we know and there is an enormous amount of duty put on narcotics and stimulants. Going away from this special list, let me show, in contrast, the way in which the Government have dealt with the luxuries and necessaries of life. Woollen material is, I suppose, a necessary of life, especially in this part of Australia in winter. Woollen garments have to pay a duty of 20 per cent, ad valorem, while silks and velvets, which I do not call necessaries of life, pay 15 per cent., or 5 per cent, lower than tlie woollens, which have to be worn by the mass of the community. Gloves pay 20 per cent..; and in regard to hats, the cheaper these are the higher the rates. Cheap hats range from 79 per cent, up to over 115 per cent., while cheap boots are 61 per cent, for men's, and 50 per cent, for women's. fumery has to pay 20 per cent., and medicine 25 per cent. The Prime Minister spoke in tones of some levity about the item of medicine; sense, there is no item in the world which probably ought to be more leniently treated than that which has to be used in cases of illness by people of limited means. Medicine may save the lives of children who are as dear to their poor parents as are the children of the rich to tlieir parents ; and yet sometimes the lives of these children cannot be saved, because the people have not in their pockets the money which to purchase that medicine. see nothing in the item of medicine to form tlie subject of amusement, except to persons who are well fed and stand pretty well in the world. Carpets are 20 per cent., and it might have been thought that the Government would have put a little lower duty than 20 per cent, on tents, in which thousands of men have to spend tlieir lives. China and porcelain pay 20 per cent., and earthenware 6d. per cubic foot, and 15 per cent., or from 45 to 55 per cent, ad valorem. It seems to rne that that is monstrous. Let us think for a moment of the hundred and one articles that are in use in tlie home of the poor man, under the head of earthenware and glassware. China and porcelain pay 20 per cent.; earthenware 45 per cent, to 55 pei' cent, ad valorem; glassware, Sd. per cubic foot, and 15 per cent. ad valorem. That comes to 85 per cent, on cheap table glass, and 55 per cent. On the common tumbler. The Victorian Tariff was only 25 per cent. Is that not a marvellous rise-a monstrous rise ? I want to show in a general way, without going too much into detail, what, on the statement of the Government themselves, has been their method of treating our imports in the way of taxation 1 Here is the statement of the Government, and I feelingly appeal to the House whether this is a moderate Tariffwhether it can by any possibility be called a moderate or a revenue Tariff. Taking narcotics and stimulants of f , the estimated totii! imports which form the basis of this Tariff, are £19,100,000. Listen how, according to the Ministry, this burden is divided. Imports that pay 20 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent., amount to £14,767,000, out of the £19,100,000. I want to hear any man say that this comes within the category of a Mr Seid. Permoderate Tariff-of a Tariff that was to aim at revenue, and was only to assist protection in a mild and moderate way. On the Minister's own division of the values of but, as a matter of common the imports, we see that whilst only £1,040,000, will come in under the 10 per cent, duties, and only £3,306,000 will come in under the 15 per cent, duties 20 cent., 25 per cent., and 31 per cent., will be levied on £14,767,000 of imports. How can this be regarded throughout Australia as a moderate Tariff? Regarded as a revenue Tariff, it is destructive of revenue. Regarded as a protectionist Tariff, with it is a yed-hot Tariff; and, if that be I so, it is a fraud on Australia. There was no one point more emphasised out of Victoria than that there was to be no red-hot protection for Australia, but that there was to be a revenue Tariff with incidental and moderate protection. correct. kept with the public, when out of £19,000,000 of imports, £15,000,000 pay 20 per cent., 25 per cent., and 31 per cent. That is on the averages, and it only shows how enormous some of the duties must be in individual cases. On the Minister's own statement that is the character of this Tariff, and I cannot speak too strongly about it, in the light of the assurances which were given to the people-a t any rate, of the colony from which I come, and which, I believe, were given generally throughout Australia. I believe that honourable members, who came from all parts of Australia, assured their constituents that they would follow these lines. Victoria, of course, is an artificial market; but in one sense it is a pretty good test for our purposes, because, if a thing will advance in price in Victoria, it must be something stiff, and it must be something new. I think I may fairly say that of a protected and artificial market such as that of Victoria undoubtedly and admittedly is. On the best authority I can get-on e of the biggest houses in Melbourne-= 1 am assured that in dealing with groceries and matters of that kind, there has been a general advance right along the line. In fact, one merchant in Melbourne told me that ever since the introduction of the Tariff he has been busy increasing the price of the articles in which he deals, and that in no less than 100 lines of trade in his",23,Motion Of Censure
23,Mr Macdonald,PATEBSON That is,27,Motion Of Censure
24,Mr Reid,"On that basis, faith is notbusiness he has had to advance prices. That is in ""Victoria, and we know what must be the effect in other parts of Australia if that is so here. He tells me that in 100 lines the price has been advanced. NowI want to deal, as I think I ought to deal, with a few lines. I referred to the benefit this Tariff would confer upon a few individualsa few favoured individuals and a few favoured industries. I think that this is an aspect of the case as to which the House will bear with me while I bring it before them; because I suppose there are many honourable members sitting opposite to me who, perhaps, have not the remotest intention of voting with me upon this motion, but who probably have a desire to remove abuses. I have no doubt there are some of my honourable friends, who, although they cannot vote with me upon this motion, yet cannot swallow every thing the Government has put before them. If they can, they deserve unlimited credit from a party point of view. I must now, as I have said, deal with a few of these favoured, petted industries, and show how necessaries which are used to an enormous extent in every household, are to be taxed for the benefit of two or three individuals in Australia. I will begin with rice. kinds of duties imposed by this Tariff upon rice. dressed rice-that is, cleaned riceand a duty upon uncleaned rice. It has been thought by the Treasurer, in order to keep a great Australian industry upon its feet, that there should be these two rates of duty. methods employed in cleaning and dressing rice, is aware that it involves a very simple machine, with a man at one end, and a boy or two at the other. There is, nevertheless, a higher difference than £ 2 a ton between these two items. There is a difference of £ 2 a ton under the Victorian Tariffj but there is no allowance for waste under this Federal Tariff, so that we may fairly say that although there appears to be a larger difference there is not, and that the difference is practically the same as under the Victorian Tariff-£ 2 per ton. For that £ 2 a ton the enterprising rice manufacturer who brings rice into Australia, runs it through his little contrivance, which, no doubt, is f u l l of mysterious expensive methods for getting the rice to the other end. Then we have cleaned rice, with this great benefit per ton. There are three firms in Melbourne which indulge in this exercise of manufacturing rice-Messrs.

On that one item,, there are three firms who from that difference in duty on rice will make a profit of something over £10,000 a year out of the people of Australia. champagne luncheons ! those expeditions to the establishments of some manufacturers, which honourable members are invited to, winding up always with a champagne luncheon. The pioneers of Australia are not in a position to extend such hospitalities to honourable members. But I hope they will not be forgotten, though they are absent. NowI come to another item, about which there has been a great dispute. That is with reference to starch. Starch is manufactured in Melbourne by two or three firms. Some time ago, Mr Speaker, there was a controversy in which one of the gentlemen engaged in this industry is said to have made a remark that the price of starch in London was 5d. pei' pound. On the strength of that remark, some one else was accused of gratuitous false-hood in reference to a statement he made about this industry. But I hold in my hand a price list from a London firm of' grocers, which has 50 retail shops, and I find that this celebrated article figures therein in this way:Starch (Coleman's) in 1-lb. boxes, 4d. ; in packets, 3jd. A business firm here has been advised by letter from London that 28-lb. lots of Coleman's starch can be got at 3d. per lb. There is the refutation of the remark that -was made outside as to this statement about starch. .We were told that the London price of starch was 5d. per lb., and that the people here ought to go down on their knees and thank these three firms for their kindness in supplying them with this necessary article at such a ruinous sacrifice. What is the manufacture of starch, Mr Speaker? Starch is something, no doubt, that is "" fearfully and wonderfully made."" AgainI can only trust to expert authority. All the rice produced in the East that is not good enough to sell to human beings to eat-that is to say, the rice that is not marketable-goe s from Singapore to various starch manufacturers in London. Coleman, who is one of these manufacturers, has to take it right through I withdraw the remark. the Suez Canal to London, and then he has to take it to Norwich by railway. After' manufacturing the rice into starch, he has to send it back by railway to London, and to send it out here. One of these enterprising firms has a factory on the water side, and the rice goes from Singapore and other places in the East direct. The wonderful process of making starch is I do not want to refer to about to begin. Some cheap chemical is used, and this discarded rice assumes at once a solid consistency, in which it can be cut up into slabs and pieces. Two or three experts are required, but I believe that the main labour involved in the manufacture of this article is that of the youths and boys and girls who put it up into those beautiful packets that we see, and which must cost a considerable amount. We have now the starch. Let us look at the gap between the price of the raw material and the price at which it can be bought here. I want to put the matter liberally, so as to prevent any offensive statement. The raw material for starch can be purchased in the markets of the East at something like £ 8 per ton, and it can be brought from Singapore to Melbourne, and dealt with, I am told, for something like £ 7 per ton. The price of starch in Melbourne to-day is 40s. per cwt.; that is, £ 4 0 per .ton. My honourable friend the member for Mernda shakes his head, but the other head from which I have obtained this information is just as experienced as his. I do not know what mysterious rebates my honourable friend gives ; but as the result of this Tariff, starch has gone up I d . per lb. The quotation lists were out on the 10th inst., and starch has gone up a f u l l penny since the publication of the Tariff. Thus we see that the Tariff has added another little advantage to tlie manufacturers of starch here, except that they have now to pay a duty on the raw material, from which the starch is made, of 6s. 3d. per central, and no allowance is made for waste. That duty on the raw material has been imposed by the Federal Government, while the duty is kept at 2d. per lb., and the net price to the wholesale dealer has gone up 40s. per cwt.,. or thereabouts. This is a hardship which makes itself felt among people in whom I am somewhat interested. These Melbourne firms usedto send their starch to Sydney, and, in competition with the starch makers of the whole world, they, cut greatly into our trade-greatl y to their",28,Motion Of Censure

41,Mr Reid,"credit be it said. One firm, Harper and Co. Limited, fighting tlie whole world in New South Wales, has made a most creditable and successful onslaught on our trade. It does a very large amount of trade in Victorian starch, without one penny of protection to assist it there. I do not mind the Victorians going on and paying more for tlieir starch for all eternity, if they insist on doing it, but they have now got New South Wales into the ring, and all the people of New South Wales who used to get this starch at 26s. per cwt. wholesale, liave now to pay 40s. per cwt. I believe starch is an article which is used by a A*ery humble, hard-working class in the community, who are not altogether deserving of severe measures, that is to say, the washerwomen and laundresses of Australia. It is not a matter of gloves or velvet, but this duty on starch raises the price about 60 per cent, or more. I come now to a third item which I think is one of the worse of all. In the bush one can do without his dressed and starched linen, but we do not want to be too rough upon the man in the far-away bush, when it comes to a question of putting a little milk into his tea. ' Nevertheless, the man in the bush with his pannikin, who has not got a cow within 500 miles of him, is to be compelled to put his hands in his pockets for the benefit of these Umited firms. Surely, the Federal Ministry could have put preserved milk on the free list, considering that it is one of the few necessaries of life that can be conveyed into the interior. This may be a matter for amusement to some people, but it is not amusing to the man who has to pass his life in the back blocks. amusement to the miners on the west coast upon the finished article. His name is a of Tasmania. thing to be compelled by a mysterious decree of the mighty Commonwealth to deal with Harper and Co, Limited, instead of is it not 1 having the whole globe from which to make a selection. That is something in the it would kill the revenue too, because the way of legislation, and it has to do with manufacturer could not go on for long at that real life, although some people outside may rate. This gentleman says that if this is the think I have been guilty of gross impersort of protection which the united talent of. tinence in referring to it . another aspect of this matter which will become a free-trader. It is remarkable touches more closely the people of the that such a gross mistake should be made in other States. The preserved milk produced that case. There is not any mistake made by Harper and Co. Limited, under the in a number of other cases. NowI come Victorian Tariff, used to be sold to tlie Victorians at 6s. per dozen tins, and to the New South Wales people at 4s. 6d. a dozen. I do not mind the Victorian people using Harper's preserved milk and paying more for it , if they choose to do so, but what have we done in New South Wales that they should be able to knock off that advantage of lsl 6d. per dozen to us % That is the result of this duty. We are all put up now to this artificial level on articles of necessity in every man's life ; we are all compelled to take a share in this burden. I want to show now the different treatment extended to a veryhumble person in Melbourne. He is not a Umited firm, but he possesses a foreign name. I referfcoa gentleman who announced to me very indignantly the other day, that "" If this is the way native industry is to be dealt with I am going to be a free-trader."" This gentleman does not deal in the hats and caps for summer and winter wear to which I made reference a little while ago, but he put in a tender for the supply of 7,941 caps for the service of the Railway department of New South Wales. The duty in this case is 3s. per dozen, and that on the 7,941 caps-the cost of which amounts to £1,200-woul d give him a benefit, if he got it , of £ 9 9 5s. The Ministry present him with £ 9 9 5s. in the shape of the federal duty of 3s. per dozen on these caps. He points out, however-and he gives me all the lines-that while they give him this protection, some of his raw materials and trimmings, amounting to £800, is taxed at 20 per cent, ad valorem, and £ 1 0 worthof trinrmingsat 15 per cent, ad valwem, meaning that he has to pay under this Tariff £181 13s. as duty on his raw materials. He has to pay £ 1 8 1 13s. upon tlie raw foreign one, aud perhaps that may account for it, because we feel strongly upon these matters.

The Minister for Trade and Customs was simply immense upon a policy which he hopes to introduce at some future date in reference to the iron industry. always been one who would like to see the iron industry firmly established, but my method of effecting this would be by giving it direct encouragement from the national exchequer. Myreasonfor so doingwould be that as it is a national industry the nation should pay the expense of encouraging it. The man who uses the iron ought not to be compelled to do that. A national benefit should be paid for out of the national funds. should not the whole community pay this bonus to the iron industry if the establishment of that industiy confers a national benefit ? Why should the man who is encouraging the industry, and who is buying the material, be the only person to pay for this national advantage ? The Government proposal puts the burden upon the wrong shoulders. That is one of the radical fallacies of a policy of protection. advantage should be paid for out of the national exchequer, and not out of the pockets of the particular individual who happens to encourage the production of a particular article. encouraging trade. others produce. Why should he be the only man to bear the burden ? To establish a national iron industry by all means let us give a national bonus, but do not let us run up the price of iron all over Australia. so doing we should accomplish two things : we should cripple our manufacturing industries, and cripple the people who have to buy machinery for those industries. opposition to the view of putting upon iron the moment an iron industry is established, I say, "" Noj encourage the industiy But the Treasurer in order to put a duty vanized iron and a higher duty corrugated galvanized iron. Here, again, there is some little process gone through; some wonderfully mysterious process known only to the manufacturer is proceeded with, and as a result we get out of the iron sheet, galvanized iron. Then corrugated iron is produced by some other mechanical appliance. I put it that if there is any one kind of iron which is used throughout the interior of Australia it certainly is galvanized and corrugated iron. But the Government will Mr Reid. not place these things upon their list of £6,000,000 worth of free imports. That is not all. I come now to tlie item of ""timber."" Erom a free-trade point of view all this I have would be very idle, but I am dealing with the proposals of a protectionist Government. The proposals in reference to timber duties contain some extraordinary features. For example, there are certain kinds of boards which it is well known cannot be produced here. The material which goes to build a cottage cannot be imported free. There is a duty upon weatherboards. A statement was made by the Treasurer that Why the boards used in packing our butterI suppose this is another insignificant item, but still some people take a great interest in it were free of duty. On further inquiry it transpires that they are not free. A certain sort of log or piece of timber out of which these boards can be made is free of duty; but unfortunately-it is really a piece of perversity on the part of these trees-the y are so small that the rate levied makes it A national impossible to obtain these butter boxes without paying what would be equivalent to this duty. The people interested in the butter industiy have already represented this fact. Surely this is a class of people Such an individual is whom we all wish to encourage. I suppose He is buying what that the butter industiy is one of the most promising in Australia. It has done a great deal for Victoria-almos t as much as the man who puts the barbs on the wire. Upon cement there is a nice little duty of 60 per By cent, ad valorem. Now, we have large cement works in New South Wales, which employ hundreds of hands. These firms are doing an enormous business without In being protected by a penny of duty. Now, duties however, 67 per cent, is to be put upon building operations all over Australia in the way of cement. I now come to the item of out of the national pocket."" twine. It is astonishing how some items could not wait acquire a wonderful significance. The upon galitem of "" twine"" refers particularly, upou I presume, to the twine used by farmers. The Government are not satisfied with imposing a duty upon reaper and binder twine, but they have included the twine which binds the fleeces on the stations, and the sewing twine for the bags containing agricultural produce. This twine is to be taxed. Hithertoi t was free in Victoria. Now, however, 8s. a cwt. is to be charged on reaper and binder twine. There are three firms in Australia which make this class of goods-Mille r and Donaghy in Melbourne, and Forsythi n Sydney. Mr Miller. He is a straight-out free-trader. In principle he is one of the best free-traders in Australia. But a paternal Government will force this fortune upon him. He is acquiring a large fortune, because, although he is a good free-trader, the Government will insist upon imposing this enormous tax upon a twine which is used largely upon the farms of Australia. In New South Wales the farmers have hitherto been able to obtain this twine 2d. per lb. cheaper than the Victorian farmer could get it from Mr Miller (a genuine free trader) and Mr Donaghy, and I believe that about 5 lbs. are required for every acre carrying a fair crop. The duty will therefore represent a difference of lOd. per acre to the New South Wales farmer, and this amount would nearly pay the deposit and interest upon his free selection. He pays off the principal and interest on his selection by instalments of Is. per acre per year, and there will now be lOd. an acre a year on that one item of which he had the advantage. Now he will get no more of that. gentleman repeat those figures % veiy good authority. 5 lb. weight of this twine is required per acre for a good crop. out 2d. per lb. are behind the fence here, and thej' make the farmers pay accordingly; but we were outside the fence, and they let our farmers have the twine at 2d. per lb. less. Id. per lb. difference absolutely, aud that Mr Miller, in New South Wales sold the article at 2d. per lb.. less. We have a rope factory in New South Wales which has been working double time for years under free-trade, and without any duty. figures. correct, and the estimate is that 5 lbs. weight of reaper and binder twine would be used per acre for a good crop. We come now to deal with the reapers and binders upon which the Minister for Trade and 17 T Customs broke down. There was a duty of I particularly sympathize with 22 per cent, on reapers and binders in Victoria up to the 30th of July, 1879, which, on the then price of £ 9 0 , meant a difference of £ 1 5 on a reaper and binder. The day after that duty was repealed, the price went down £ 1 5 . There is a pretty solid result from the repeal of a duty. The price went down from £ 9 0 to £ 7 5 the next day, and the present price of these reapers and binders is from £ 3 0 to £ 4 0 . price. member's quotation ? £40. An Honorable MEMBER -They can be. bought from the Massey-Harris Company for £ 3 2 . Tasmania, Mr Cameron, speaking from knowledge, says they can be bought for £40; and I have made the statement that the price is from £ 3 0 to £ 4 0 . I want to. direct the attention of honourable members. to another little article, salt. Salt is au industry which flourishes in South AusI t estimated that tralia. I am sure every one will be delighted to know that it is an industry which, so far as that can be said of a protected industry, has been a flourishing industry.

I believe that they have practically secured, the Melbourne market in spite of a duty of 20s. per ton. The price has gone up only 10s. per ton, on the declaration of the Minister for Trade and Customs. Thiscompany, which was cutting into Victorian trade, against a duty of 20s. per ton, will now have that protection equally with the rest of Australia. The producers of this, article, who have been able to come intoMelbourne against a duty of 20s. a ton, will now have the same protection, although I did not catch those they do not require it. That is a very large advantage to that industiy.. It is an enormous duty, and comes to a considerable amount to the consumer.

There is a natural protection for salt of about 100 per cent., and we are being asked to add to that, what I suppose on the value of salt in England is another 100 per cent., by this Eederal Tariff. I think this is a highly unnecessary item. There is another duty which will press very hardly upon the manufacturers of Tasmania and other places. We have a duty on candles. Under the Tariff we have a duty on stearine, but we also have now a duty upon paraffin wax of l^d. per lb., the same as the duty on candles. There are two or three people in Melbourne who have stearine plants, but there are other people who do not manufacture, in Melbourne, and have no stearine plants. They manufacture from this paraffin wax, and this duty of l^d. per lb. on that material will have the effect of shutting that have not the plant which a few manufacturers in Victoria have got. This is a raw material which one would think Ministers might have allowed to escape. are items which are in universal consumption, but they are not of so much importance to the revenue as are the articles I am now about to mention. draw the attention of the House to the probable operation of the duties on spirits, tobacco, and cigarettes. important lines, and the question as to how the proposals of the Government will work out is a matter which will greatly affect the stability of the revenue. I think it is pretty well known already that under the old Tariffs in New South Wales and Victoria affecting tobacco and cigarettes, enormous fortunes have been made out of the Custom-house. I do not hesitate to mention the names of firms. I do not suppose I shall be blamed if I do, and I think to do so. -Cameron's-which I am informed that their profits amounted every year to a sum equal to the whole of their capital, under the tobacco duties as they existed in Australia under the separate Tariffs. So far as I can see and learn, this Tariff will add a second fortune to the fortune they have been making under the old arrangements. the items for a moment. Wales the imported manufactured tobacco was subject to a duty of 3s. per lb., and imported leaf to a duty of Is. per lb., and there was an excise of Is. 3d. per lb. Mr Beicl. The duty on the imported leaf, and the excise in the case of imported leaf manufactured made 3s. 3d. pei"" lb a difference of 9d. pei"" lb. as against tlie imported manufactured tobacco. That was the position in New South Wales. In Victoria the .duty was 3s. on imported manufactured tobacco, Is. on imported leaf, and an excise duty of 9d. per lb. That is a differVictorian ence of Is. 3d. in favour of the imported leaf, and 2s. 3d. in favour of the colonial leaf. In New South Wales the difference in favour of colonial leaf would be the difference between Is. 3d. and 3s., or Is. 9d. pei lb. 1 In Victoria the difference would be the difference between 9d. and 3s -2s . 3d. a .pound. The Commonwealth proposal is to increase the rate of duty which is enormous at present, on the manufactured article to 3s. 6d. a pound. That increase of 6d. on the up a number of factories imported manufactured article will, I am informed by merchants whose opinions I take, gradually destroy the revenue from imported tobacco. There will always be a Those certain amount imported under any duty, but the duty now proposed will gradually destroy the revenue, and the calculation is that in the course of the year the increase I want particularly to will cause 1,000,000 lbs. of tobacco which would otherwise be imported to be made within Australia. The difference These are very which the Treasurer proposes is a difference of Is. in favour of the imported leaf, and 2s. 6d. in favour of the Australian grown leaf. The House will see that it splits the difference between the difference of Is. 3d. in Victoria and the difference of 9d. in New South Wales. But I am assured that the effect of that extra 6d. will be what I have described. There are 3,411,000 lbs. of imported tobacco consumed at 3s, 3,159,000 it is better lbs. of leaf imported, and 1,680,000 lbs. of There is one large firm local leaf being used. The total consumphas a large capital, and tion in Australia in 1900, 8,250,000 lbs., at 3s. per lb., would yield a revenue of £1,237,000. The difference of 1,000,000 lbs. would, it is estimated, be divided in this way : 750,000 lbs. more of imported leaf, and 250,000 lbs., more of colonial leaf would be used. So that on this calculation on 1,000,000 lbs., at 3s. 6d., It is right to look at the Customs would get £175,000, on In New South 750,000 lbs. of imported leaf at 2s. 6d., £ 9 3 , 0 0 0 ; and on 250,000 lbs. of local leaf at Is., £12,500. Therefore, out of a total of £105,500 there will be a loss to the revenue of £74,500. The total additional consumption of local leaf, 250,000 lbs. weight, would only be worth from £3,000 to £4,000. Most of this leaf-the best leaf-is grown by Chinamen; so that it is a class of industry which we are not supposed to look at with too affectionate an eyea Chinese industry. We lose £75,000 a year on that one line. of revenue production that I am referring to, and I cannot see the object of altering the rates in the ""way the Government have done, because it is not as if the whole of the local leaf was a colonial industry. Under any system, a large mass of it will be brought in from abroad. Even from a protectionist point of view the encouragement is too great, and it will lead to an enormous destruction of revenue which might be saved by putting on the free list a great number of articles used in the agricultural industries. The effect of the Government proposal will be practically to k ill the importation of cigarettes, and about £30,000 will probably be lost to the revenue in the year. We must remember that persons are making enormous fortunes out of this -industry as it is, and that one-half of the sum which Cameron's drawsI am afraid to mention the amount, so enormous is it-goe s straight away to New York every year. Half the capital is in the hands of Mr R. W. Cameron, of New York; he takes an enormous sum out of Australia every year, and it is calculated that on these proposals, as to tobacco especially, his enormous revenue from Australia will be doubled. I regret veiy much that the Government have made a mistake in these lines, because these are amongst the most important in the tariff. Now we come to spirits, the chief revenue-producing line on the Tariff. Honourable members, I hope, will have some patience with me in mentioning these things, because it is well that they should be brought out at the earliest possible moment in order that they may be properly tested. I wish every statement. I make to be properly examined and discussed, and I think it is only right that I should in these matters give the Government straight away my view, on the best information I can get, of tlie effect of their proposals. of the spirits which are to be allowed to be produced in Australia ar 1 Is. a gallon-that 17 T 2 is a difference of 3s. below the duty on the imported spirit-is spirit produced from grape wine, barley, malt, molasses or maize. That is very nearly the same as the Victorian definition, except that the latter had grain instead of maize. The wheat or potato spirit would come under the 12s. 6d. per gallon charge n.e.i.; but the bulk of the These are the great central lines spirit would probably, and could easily be produced on the l is . per gallon basis. The consumption of spirits in Australia in 1900 was 2,800,000 gallons, and there is this remarkable fact that Joshua Brothers, the Melbourne manufacturers, were able to send tlieir brandy into New South Walesthe duty here being then 12s. per gallon, 2s. less than ours, and paying 14s. per gallon, it entered largely into consumption in that State. So far as I can gather the total production of Joshua Brothers was about 269,000 gallons of which they were able to export 75,000 gallons. It is estimated that the production of spirit locally under this Tariff will be 700,000 gallons for all Australia, and that, at 3s. per gallon, would yield £266,000, which is lost to the revenue. The Government estimates of excise contemplate the payment of £266,000 in the that big company of form of excise on spirits. Now, there again, a very large amount of money will be lost to the revenue, owing to the arrangements in connection with the excise duties. The wages paid in connection with this industry are comparatively small; it is an industry which does not employ a very large number of persons, and even from tlie protectionist point of view I think it was a great mistake to have so adjusted these lines as to lead to a great injury to the public Treasury. I am very much obliged to the House for having allowed me to take out from the Tariff a few of the more noticeable items, because I feel that the sooner public attention is drawn to those items the better. The producers of these articles in Australia begin with an enormous amount of natural protection ; and, in addition to that, the Government propose a rate of protection for a number of these industries, which seems to me extravagant and beyond all reason, and as likely to prove most fatal to the stability of the revenue. Tlie experience of New South Wales is a very fair and instructive guide in connection with a The Commonwealth definition large number of these matters. The notion which prevails in some quarters is, that if you have a free port your markets will become ducts coloured races of the world. to be predicted in New South that if we endeavoured to throw our ports open all white men would be crushed beneath the overwhelming avalanche of goods which would be poured in from China and Japan and dumped upon our wharfs, to the destruction of our industries, the ruin of our factories, and the distress of our working population. open our ports for the last five years, so that clamation of the honourable and learned memno one can say that that is a policy which has not been tried in Australia and under Australian conditions. of the finest ports in the world thrown open to the lust of trade of all the coloured races of the world.

If. the policy of protection had made Victoria attractive to any human being-to a workman of any kind-ther e might be some enthusiasm shown in trying to extend that policy all over Australia. The 20 per cent, duties began in Victoriai n 1871, following on duties which were more moderate ; so that this State has been 30 years under the influence of tlie policy of protection. It was stated over and over again, in the early days, that protection was to make Victoria attractive to the best artizans of the world, but the result has proved that Victoria is the one country which men avoid.

But there is the broad test for 30 years. I am told that Victoria is becoming a ruinousplace even for lawyers,, and when a country is in that state,, it is about near back sovereignsfrom other countries but must its end. Stagnation is. the picture that the policy of protection presents in Victoria, while in New South Wales there is nothing, but progress, and the veiy industry which is afraid to face competition in Victoria, is the industry which is strong and self-reliant in the mother State. and learned member give us the. average numbers of the unemployed 1 test, because in some countries people are so tionists would put upon such goods. But well off that more can afford to remain unemployed than in other countries. little fact which has, struck me shows that there is a striking, resemblance; from one point of view, between tlie habitsof our Victorian friendSj and the habits of our friends in Ireland'. The-relative consumption of beef and mutton is,. I believe, a very good, stepsin and puts its hand upon theseif homely, test. In New South AValesI find that the average consumption, per head of beef and mutton is 2S1 lbs., and in Victoria 205 lbs.; and now I begin to understand the pressure of the stock tax. on the people of Victoria. But in the matter of potatoes, the average of Victoria is wonderful. In New South Wales. the people consume per head 195 lbs. of potatoes, whereas in Victoria the consumption per head is 258lbs., so that in the latter State we areapproaching the industrial anxiety which prevails in Ireland, where people can getlittle else but potatoes to live on. The protective policy of Victoria has forced many worthy and promising people toa potato diet. We know that Australiansthrive best on a meat diet, and that is why so many Victorians have forsaken the potatoes of Warrnambool to enjoy the beef and mutton of New South Wales;: and I do not wonder at it . Here isanother fact which embodies a sti-iking truth, and it is a great thing, to get admissions of this sort from our protectionist friendsNations do not exchange coin. They always pay in goods. For every pound of butter, bushel of. wheat, or bale of wool that goes home payment is That is from the highest protectionist authority in Melbourne in the way of a newspaper. That embodies a great principle of trade'a sound principle-bu t it cuts clean against that selfish, deluding policy of keeping money in the countiy. Let us apply that principle. Since tlie products of our great pioneer industries will mot bring bring back goods, we see the close relationship between the prosperity of the producing industries and some method or policy which is not protective. AVhat is the object of protection? Protection looks at these goods which are merely our own produce converted into another form, as if they were accursed-as if they should be shut out-as if we should have nothing to do with them atany price. Ten, 15,1.00-per cent., are the duties which these protecin doing so we impose taxes, upon our ownOne Australian industries.

80,Mr Reid,"That is not always a fairJ)ut upon thetilings which that industry buys heavy burdens of taxation. This is the position taken up, as I have said, by the highest protectionist authority in Melbourne, which sustains the view that I have put before the House. If that is the case we find another reason for pla'cing our revenue system upon a sound basis. As I think honourable members will admit, our farmers and wool-growers have a bitter fight as it is in disposing of their produce. But here again a wonderful remedy is provided by the Minister for Trade and Customs. He would solve the whole trouble affecting our Australian industries in this way. ''Why woollens ? Why should our wool go out of the country to be made up? Why do wenot make it up ourselves?"" His way of turning Australia into a great manufacturer of woollens is to put a duty of 20 per cent, on the few woollens the people of Australia can consume. If my right honourable and learned friend were not a tyro in investigations of this sort, we might ask him another question. It is this : "" W h y is it that Great Britain can send into the United States of America millions and millions of pounds' worth of cotton goods ?"" The cotton is grown, in the United States. It is taken to Liveipool, aud is then sent to Manchester and other places and manufactured into cotton goods, whence it is sent out into the markets of the world to the tune of £66,000;000 a year. The United States is a great protected country, with enormous duties upon import's enormousduties upon cotton goods and goods of all kind that interfere with the trade of their own manufactures. But in spite of those enormous duties the cotton trade of the world is in the hands of a few people inManchester and the surrounding towns. It only shows the value of such suggestions. Mr Murray, the manager of' the Australian Woollen Factorya Melbourne firm-ha s written a very startling letter to one of the papers upon this subject. We know the struggles there have been in Victoria to set the woollen industry upon itsfeet. Mr Murray says he can get on very well without protection ; that most of his troubles at the start were due to bad machinery and bad management; and that now he has got good machinery and good management he does not care'fOr protection. There is a striking statement! thoroughly in support of the views I have expressed. Now, I feel deeply indebted to the House for the kind way in which honourable members have allowedme to go over the matters involved in this resolution. It is a subject which involvesa large number of considerations, and I hope the House will pardon me for having taken up its time as I have done. I should like to recall to the House the terms of the resolution which I have submitted. I think I have proved clearly enough that the proposals of the Federal Ministry, if effected, will "" place the finances of the Commonwealth and the States upon an unsound and He excl'aimSj with astonishmentextravagant basis."" I think I have shown do we riot make upour own clearly enough "" the burdens of taxation "" are not ""fairl y adjusted"" by the proposals of Ministers, and that there has been a conspicuous failure on their part to show' any sort of' consistency with regard to theprinciples which should' be observed inframing a great policy of finance. As to the free list, I feel sure that, regardless of party differences, there must be a large number of honourable members in this House who are resolved that it shall contain upon it appliances which are necessary to the proper development of our agricultural, farming, pastoral, and mining industries. I believe that whatever the effect of my motion is, tlie free list will not be allowed to remain in the unsatisfactory state in whichi t is. Then as to the necessaries of life, the high duties upon them are to be denounced upon two grounds. They are destructive if they are intended to produce revenue from the people. If they are not intended for that national purpose, it is an outrage upon every principle of fairness and humanity to subject the people to these enormous duties upon the necessariesof life for the profit of a few individuals. It shocks thecommon sense of' humanity.. When I speak in this way honourable mem bers will understand that I am not addressing men whose minds have been soddened with a long course of these outrages on. humanity and sound finance. It would' be idle for any one totalk to them, for theii*ears are dulled. I am talking to Australia in all its conditions as represented by this House. Those who have been accustomed to run a country on these lines are not likely to listen to anything which I may say. I speak, however, beyond them to those who, unlike them; have not become It is innocul'ated with the poison. I speak to those who have been accustomed to regard to some extent the interests of the public revenue; who have not been accustomed to regard the people as a flock of sheep to be used for the benefit of politicians and manufacturers, but who have paid some regard to the interests of the great industries upon whioh the Australian community must stand. terests will be; great as the fight will be to maintain tottering concerns which might cease to totter if they were placed upon an honest, sound basis, I feel sure that the interests of the great industries of Australia will triumph in tlie end. I feel sure that the suggestions of private advantage, and -of looking so critically into the affairs of .some exotic industry, instead of studying .the interests of the great natural industries -of the soil, is a process that will be reversed. this question has been always one of intense earnestness. such a policy as this in other countries. I have seen right through the history of every other country in the world that, looking at tlie oldest of them, this process of legisstage a succession of committee speeches lation has not lifted up the masses of the people ; that it has made the gap between the well-to-do and the necessitous classes ' larger than ever it was before. When honorable members direct my attention to America, I find in that young country, cursed with this antiquated policy, that in 50 years the gap between the rich and the poor has become greater than the inequalities of centuries in the countries of Europe. Look where we will, the result is always the same. There may be a .majority in this House that may for a time .succeed in pushing this young Australian Commonwealth off the path of sound progress, and off the sound tracks of legislation, on to the path which has ended in all other countries in evil and in loss. The result has been always the same. In this young continent the result will be just the same as it is in the :freest democracy the world has ever known, and as it is in countries where tyranny is open and undisguised. these countries we see that the outcome of this policy is the same. In the mother country we find the huge chasm between the higher and the humbler classes narrowing down. We find the aristocracy of centuries past coming down to the limits and activities of trade and industries, as Mr lieid. we find the labour of Great Britain during the past 30 years rising from a pitch of misery and degradation to manhood, and more than to manhood, to strength and prosperity. This evil policy which is fastened upon us in the name of a revenue Tariff works the same mischief all the world over. It will, in its result here, as Great as the fight for vested ineverywhere else, add another measure of prosperity to those who have wealth, and a new measure of hardship to those who earn the right to live only by a daily and constant tax upon their fleeting powers of physical endurance.

84,Mr Barton,"The time will come!universal ruin. The experience of every one in regard to the Tariffs' of these States, whether they were free-trade or rotectionist, or merely revenue Tariffs, has been the same, namely, that those who are interested one way or the other rise in a chorus of denunciation. Of course we know that we are going through the normal and usual experience of those who frame Tariffs. A great many of the objections raised to the items in our Tariff are such as would have been raised whatever that Tariff had been. If I had come down here with a Tariff averaging 5 per cent., the party which follows the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney, in New South Wales, would have accused me of sneaking in protection. Fourteen years ago ad valorem duties were brought down in New South Wales at the rate of 5 per cent. My right honourable friend, and that great man, Sir Henry Parkes, with whom he was then seated, joined in a chorus of denunciation. It was said"" These duties are ?nild enough. They are not too much. They will yield the necessary revenue to meet an impending deficit."" But the Government of the day were accused of sneaking in protection, with the result that the* Parliament of New South Wales was subjected to a 56 hours' sitting, at the end of which time-becaus e 12 o'clock on Saturday nighfc hud been reached-the Opposition walked out in a bod} as a protest. If Sir Patrick Jennings7 who resigned unnecessarily, when he had a majority of 33-ha d held his place, as he had a light to do if he chose, those duties would have stood. But my purpose is to show that the party which opposes us, would have opposed us if we had brought down'a 5 per cent. Tariff. Had they not done so they would not have been consistent. We have, therefore, the ordinary outcry about the Tariff. Does anybody who raises this outcry give a moment's credit to those who framed it for the immense labour and toil they have solution of an intensely difficult problem ? What was that problem 1 We found six States, all with differing rates of revenue, and different rates of consumption of dutiable articles-differen t Tariffs. They ranged from a Tariff which touched nothing save narcotics or stimulants to one which reached most of the articles either by enumeration or by a drag-net clause. It was a necessityfor us to evolve order from this chaos, and to frame a Tariff which would yield the revenue that is absolutely necessary to enable us to make the returns to the States demanded of us by the Constitution, and at the same time to prevent the destruction of industries. That is what we set out to do. That is what we have endeavoured to do ; and that is what I claim we shall succeed in doing if this Tariff be passed. First, then, this Tariff is an honest attempt to fulfil our election pledges; secondly, it deals fairly with the States; and thirdly, it does not impose any burden, except what was inevitable, upon the people of Australia. I shall take these propositions one by one. First, we cannot claim-no r can any one claim-that the Tariff is perfect. No Tariff is ever perfect, even with the amendments which Parliament makes in it . The fewer the articles which it lays under contribution, the more imperfect it may be. We do not claim any impossible or absurd standard of excellence of that kind, because it was impossible for any bodj of men to 7 discharge with perfect success the task which we had before us. But we do say that this Tariff fulfils our election rjledges. I wish to quote from my Maitland speech, which has so often been referred to, the following passage :.... a business Turin"" which will yield the sums we need without discouraging production. I am a protectionist, and so are nearly all of my colleagues; but if wo are to raise the great revenue which has been the security of the federation, then we cannot be prohibitionists, and our protection must be moderate. We are bound to fill our Treasury without emptying out our industries. In the Town Hall, Melbourne, I saidAVhether we are protectionists or free-traders, if we consider the problem carefully we must come to the conclusion that, as between the six States comprising the Commonwealth, with their varied Tariffs, the spirit of compromise must have some sway. You in Victoria cannot have your Tariff. That is ont of the question. AVe in Jfew bestowed upon the South AVales cannot have ours. Honourable members have before them a tabulated statement of the duties operating in the several States. I cannot pretend, since notice of this motion was given, to have gone through the printed papers and to have contrasted every one of the dutiescontained in this Tariff with those hitherto operating in the different States. But I may tell honourable members that I went through the first four pages of that long list, and/I found that there were very few duties which tallied with the Victorian duties. A large number tallied with the duties of Queensland and Tasmania, and some of them with those of South Australia. cannot be many duties which tally with the 1 duties in New South Wales, except those in regard to narcotics and stimulants. revenue was to be raised, it could not be raised on the New South Wales basis. What therefore, was the task before us ? The Constitution lays it down that we must return to the States in regard to the transferred departments the amount of revenue raised within them less the amount of expenditure in those States, and that after debiting that transferred expenditure, we must also debit each State with what has been' spent in it upon the new necessities of the Commonwealth. An estimate has been made of the l-evenue which it would be necessary to raise, taking eachState by itself, in order to return to it the amount which it has been in the habit of receiving. have been necessary in the case of New South Wales-I revenue-to would yield £4,973,000.. members to observe that the amount in the case of New South Wales would have been under £5,000,000. have required us in the case of Victoria to raise £7,350,000;. in the case of Queenslaud, £6,642,000; Western amounts, therefore, which would have been sufficient to enable us to return to each State what it was accustomed to receive, upon a fair and liberal computation, and taking therevenue for 1900 as the basis, varied from under £5,000,000 The task before us was to adjust that difficulty in some way which would raise the amount necessary to bereturned to the States without landing any of them in serious financial embarrassment, and in such a manner as not to destroy production, because that we had engaged' not to do. Now, it is one thing to indulge in airy criticisms of items in a Tariff, to make little farces about starch, and to indulge in acrobatism about twine-that but it is another thing to frame a Tariff which wilt meet the required purposes; and where is tlie sign of that in the right honourable gentleman's speech 1 AVhat' attempt has he made to deal with this question Mr Barton. from the stand-point of a practical states1 man? gentleman will go out we will frame a Tariff.

But, sir, the problem that is involved is one which, at the time of the declaration of our policy, depended for its solution upon the closest possible investigation, and if the right honourable gentleman has no Tariff to propose then I can quite sympathize with him, for this reason : that the difficultiesof framing, under such new circumstances, a thoroughly fair and workable Tariff are well nigh insuperable, even to those who have the advice and the opportunity of daily consultation with experts: and for one who sits on the other side, without such advice and without such consultation, whatever his political experience may be, I freely concede it -would be an injustice to expect him to frame a. Tariff. But we are entitled to know in what way it is proposed some tilings should be done; I am not going into the items as tlie right honourable gentleman did, because those are matters for discussion in committee ; but I will give an illustration.

The right honourable gentleman says that that is what we do, but a revenue Tariff, such as he would propose, would, of course, have nothing to do with that. Before this Tariff was brought in the duty upon starch was 2d. per lb. There was no duty upon rice for manufacture intostarch. That rice was free in bond. Since the time of that freedom this Tariff for revenue purposes purposes has placed | d . per lb. on it or 6s. 3d. per central. honorable friend says that the result of that is that the price of starch went 1 up I d . per lb. But that, was a revenue dutj',. and how can the right honourable gentleman reconcile that with this state of things : that before the revenue duty was put on-becaus e we have to turn to these things for revenue under the ckcumstances in which Australia is placed-the price of the starch made here was less than that of the imported starch 1 The nearest quotations I can get are these-Coleman' s starch, the principal imported starch, was sold at 4£d. per lb., less discount of 2£ per cent. local starch was sold at 3^d., less 10 per cent, which would be 3-jd.., and with a further reduction of 2£ per cent, the local article was sold at a rate cheaper than the imported article by 1 §d., or by almost the extent of the duty. The difference is just ^d. per 1 lb., and that \a\. is all that the gentleman, against whom so many insulting remarks have been directed, derives from the whole process; since the Tariff' duty of 6s. 3d. per central, or 7s.. per cwt., for that is what it comes to, is equivalent to l ^ d per lb. added to the price of the manufactured, article. Thisis a pure revenue duty, and it acts, of course, in the same way as if starch had been made subject to an excise dutj'. What follows1 This, l^d. more peilb. has been added to the former price, as above mentioned, and the price now of local starch is 3-id., plus 1-Jd., or 4fd., less 10 per cent.., which is 4^d. net, as against 4-Jd. for the imported, article, so that even now the local starch is | of a pennj' cheaper. That is the way the thing works out, and the local article is cheaper than the imported article, the price ofwhich has been added to by a class of duty used where necessary in this' Tariff, but which would be the very backbone of the right honourable gentleman's Tariff. No other class of Tariff was contemplated if there be any truth, in election speeches. And then we should have had in connection with duties of. that sort a flourish of trumpetsupon the beautj' of taking something out of: the Chinamen. There is an instance of tlie result,, and a. sample of the effect, of the right honourable gentleman's criticisms. What, was further demanded of. us in makaudi I admit for revenue ing this Tariff? Let me look at it in the light of the right honourable gentleman's criticism. My right The first hrancli of his complaint is that the Government did not take the responsibility of reducing the estimate-because , of course, the question of estimatesis intimately related to that of the Tariff-and that we, ourselves j. admit them to be extravagant. We do not admit them to be",41,Motion Of Censure

96,Mr Barton,"Yes; duty paid, and thean extravagance upon our part, but we do admit that, in a way which it will take some time to rectify by way of these departments were handed over to us in some cases overloaded. But we do not turn men into the street at once; we do not turn them into the street at all if we can help it, either with our estimates or with our Tariff, or by means of a Public Sendee Board. The Treasurer has used his pruning-knife upon these estimates, and that to a con-' siderable extent-to once to any one who chooses to refer to these figures, about which as I have said I am not going into details. So far as the Customs revenue is concerned we rightly tried to meet the necessities of the States as shown by last year's Customs receipts, and the Eederal expenditure. Customs' receipts were, as stated, £7,762,000 for all the States. That was a liberal allowance for Federal expenditure to meet anything unforseen placing the federal expenditure at the rate estimated four years ago in Adelaide, when federal needs would not have been nearly they are now, owing to the increase of population and the resources of the country. It would come, with that £300,000, to £8,062,053. Tariff for the remaining nine months, together with the income which has come in for the three months just passed, comes to £8,009,000, which is a very close approximation. the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs have estimated pretty closely to federal requirements; in fact, if we were to spend the whole £300,000 for new expenditure, then the addition of that sum to the estimated net receipts from customs and excise would make us fall short by £53,000 a year. We have not allowed ourselves much margin, but we have allowed ourselves a new expenditure not exceeding £247,000 a year up to the 30th June next. Let us see what would happen if the year 1899 were taken as a basis. difference would then occur of about £360,000. for that year in the various States were £7,402,602, and putting on to that the new federal expenditure-and £300,000-that of £7,702,602, and the figures for 1898 would show about £263,000 less. In 1898 customs and excise yielded £7,139,201. we add to that the additional cost of Mr Barton. £300,000 we get £7,439,201, so that the further we went back the less revenue would retrenchment, have been required. Leti t be understood that that in all cases includes the collections from Inter-State traffic. It was estimated at Maitland. by me that by the time the first Federal Tariff had to be brought down-that is to say in the middle of this year or a little later-ther e would roughly be about £800,000 collected from excise and customs in the States, an extent visible at taking tlie Inter-State traffic. In addition to that, it was thought that the other needs would amount to £500,000 or more. I said that at least £8,500,000 would be required, and perhaps it would be nearer £9,000,000, so that I Was not very far off the mark. And why 1 Because there is another factor The last year's still to be considered, and that is that we cannot give back what is necessary to each of the States by simply raising the revenue which all the States had before and adding it to the federal expenditure, because the bookkeeping clauses in the Constitution force us into what is, as among a cohesive so heavy as nation, in the nature of an equality; although the principle of justice was at the bottom, perhaps, of making that class of division for five years-to give back to The estimated yield from this each State what was collected in it , less what was spent in it, so far as the federal departments were concerned. But the necessity of the occasion was the fact which arose out of the Constitution, and which Honourable members will see that cannot arise out of anything we may do on this side or that side that a very much larger sum would necessarily have therefore to be returned to two or three of the States than they had been receiving before, and a much less sum to the others. What necessity does that force upon us ? A t the outset we stated not only that we must make such repractically turns as would meet the requirements of the States as far as possible, but that where we could not meet their requirements, we should prevent them from having serious finanA cial embarrassments. What have we done then 1 None of the amounts mentioned The customs and excise receipts obviously would give a sufficient total, or if they gave a sufficient total, as I have just put it, would never give a sufficient sum to at the full figure of each and all of the States, and the reason is, would necessitate a revenue first their different necessities, and next their different revenue-producing powers. We have striven to adjust these matters by If a Tariff which in tlie present year will, as I have said, approximately raise £8,009,000 by the combined operation of its own collections for nine months, and the receipts which the Slates have had from customs and excise for the past three months. We must not only do that, but we must provide for the federal expenditure, and we felt that if we were wise we should have to leave a margin for that very purpose to try to ease off the financial exigencies of the States; that is to say, to give them back a little more than would be got by the bare sum which they had raised before, together with the federal needs. And why ? One has only to look at the rate ofconsumption of the various States to see May I point to that rate of consumption? In the year 1900 tlie rate of consumption of dutiable articles was indicated by tlie amounts which they severally paid to the Tariffs so far as we can derive such a calculation from varying Tariffs. The net revenue per head from customs and excise was £ 1 7s. in . New South Wales; £ 1 19s. lOd. in Victoria; £ 3 4s. 2d. in Queensland; £ 1 16s. in South Australia; £ 2 17s. 10£d. in Tasmania; and £ 5 5s. 7£d. in AVestern Australia. It is seen that what they had been accustomed to by way of customs and excise ranged from £ 1 16s. 11-Jd. a head up to £ 5 5s. 7£d., in the latter case no doubt through the greater preponderance of adult males in AVestern Australia, and a very large consumption consequently of stimulants aud narcotics as compared with the States where the proportion of females to males was larger. There was another problem bhat we had to deal with. In a normal year this Tariff will produce £ 2 7s. 5|d. a head, let us say £ 2 7s. 6d., according to the calculations of the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs. What does that mean ? It means that it will produce a larger sum per head than the Tariffs of three of the States and a smaller sum per head than the Tariffs of three other States, and no human ingenuity could, by any means, have prevented that. What is the result of that again? The Tariff, in order to meet the difficulty raised by the average of £ 5 5s. 7£d. per £19,500,000, whereas, in order to place it on the same footing as the former New South Wales Tariff, at £ 1 7s. per head, the revenue from our Tariff would have amounted to less than £5,000,000. That is where the trouble-as the vernacular puts it-bump s up against us. How was it possible to frame a tariff to meet these varying conditions without taking into account the staring fact that to give back all that was required or asked for or expected would have meant a tariff that would yield more than twice as much as that now proposed, whilst to give back the least that was expected by any of the States would have called for a tariff only fiveninths as large as that we are now proposing. We had to endeavour to take the middle course, and we knew that in taking it we should have to pour into the Treasury of New South Wales an enormous sum of the reason of it . money. taxation in other ways. will not do it . tilings with the money, but it is not for us to suggest the way in which they should spend it. Many courses are open to them, suGh as selling less land, the reduction of taxation in other directions, theapplication of the money to the purposes of a sinking fund for the extinction of the public debt, or the appropriation of the money to local Government purposes ; and there are many other things that they might do. I do not think it will be found that, notwithstanding the large accession to its revenue, either the Treasurer or the people of New South Wales will have any complaint to make when tlie Tariff has operated for a few years. Mr AA iLKS -They complain now. r on the other side is that they will find cause to complain ; but there are some people who think that if they say a thing often enough in this world, it must be .true. AVe are fixing a limit, to which we should strive to adjust matters, the total in a normal year being about £9,000,000, although the current year will only bring us in a little over £8,000,000. That must be either approved or condemned by my right honourable friend. If he approves, well and good, but if he does not approve;-and he does not-and if he head, would have produced suggests anything else he must add to the difficulties of the States, which are left with deficiencies under the present arrangement; and how he can be supported in that course by any one elected from Tasmania, Western Australia, or Queensland, is a Chinese puzzle.",42,Motion Of Censure

The figures showing the results in a normal year are given, and these rough computations are given by the officers on a basis of £9,000,000 ; that is, on the supposition that a Tariff of £9,000,000 total will give certain results to each State, and that a Tariff of £8,000,000 will, as a mere matter of arithmetic, give one-ninth less. Therefore, I take it , that the contention against us that we are raising too much, must fail in view of the disastrous results to five out of the six .States. If anything else were attempted the only State whose Treasury would be in the of a sound position, would be New South Wales, and the disaster and suffering in all the other States would be enormous. It was not for that we entered into federation. We have been charged with failing to adjust the burdens of taxation fairly. We have been charged with pressing on the necessaries of life, and on the farming and pastoral industries, more than on luxuries. As to the farming industry, about which so m'uch is said, agricultural machinery, is made here which is pretty well as good as any that can be got elsewhere. It has not been by the duties to which agricultural machinery has been subjected that Australia, or any part of it, has been bled-and we must look at six States, and not at one-bu t it has been by something else. combinations to which protected manufacturers have been strangers, but with which certain importers have been familiar. One of the cases was hinted at in an interjection by the honourable member for Bland, namely, that of reapers and binders. I do not know whether it is a fact, but it may be, that in anticipation of the Tariff to be enacted here, the price of reapers and binders has dropped from £ 5 5 to £32. But with a price of from £ 1 6 to £ 2 0 for reapers and binders i u the United States and in Canada, how come it that, until that Tariff loomed in the distance, a reaper and binder was charged for in Victoria at the rate of £ 5 5 ? Reapers and binders were free-the y were not subject to duty. What protectionist machination was it that took an article worth from £ 1 6 to £ 2 0 and charged for it at the rate of £ 5 5 ? No manufacturer in a protected industry had anything to do with that. Who had to do with it? The importer. There is now a reduction of nearly 100 per cent, on that very article. But what has protection to do with that? There is a typical instance. Who can say rhat the tricks of trade are confined to one class or another? Who contends that every protectionist and every protected manufacturer is an honest man ? Nobody! Who says that every free-trade importer is an honest man ? Nobody, either, who is sane ! The fact is that, while there are black sheep in every flock, abuses of this kind are possible just as much under free-trade as under protection. There are some who would say more ; I will leave it at that. But I will say ""that semblance these abuses are just as much possible under one regime as under the other. It is shown from an instance of that kind that agriculture generally is not likely to thrive while certain people can rig the market, and charge more than three times the value of an article, though there is no duty upon it . As to the pastoral industry, it seems to me that that has been thrown in only as a makeshift. The right honourable and learned member has not given instances that are worthy of attention with regard to the pressure upon that industry. Buti t is quite true-un doubtedly true-that we cannot protect the production of wool, if that is the point of the contention. No one says that we can. No one has urged it on this side, or will There have been urge it . But still there is this to he recollected-that with a reasonable protection, which declines to let down into the'dust any established industry, which does not profess to raise mountains of Tariff walls but only to prevent destruction, it is possible to have such a production of woollen material in this country as will assure the making up of our own product in our own land and at no loss to our own people. While, as I have said, I do not wish to follow my right honourable and learned friend through the numerous intricacies wherein he wriggled among the Tariff papers, yet I would point out that he has complained among other things that silks are not taxed as highly as blankets. Let us take that as another instance. How does my right honourable and learned friend bring about that contention? By taking the duty on the finished article on the one side as against the duty on a comparatively raw product on the other. Silk under the heading of apparel-that is to say, the finished article -is charged 25 per cent., which is the highest ad valorem rate on textiles. It is the same rate as is charged for all apparel, whether made from woollen or silk. To say that we have treated silk more leniently than blankets is grossly incorrect on this comparison, because when we turn to blankets ii? the finished state, we find that this Government has specially taken them out of the 25 per cent, list, and has included them in the 20 per cent, list, though in the case of by talcing out certain lines, and putting them blankets the wool and thefinishedarticle are produced here. See how an instance of that kind, elaborately worked up, disappears immediately one takes the two articles according to the rate of advance in manufacture which they occupy ! Take them both as unfinished articles, and then take them both as finished articles, and it will be found that it is not orable and learned member instanced, instead the poor man's blanket that is the more highly taxed, but the rich woman's silk. Then take silk piece goods, that are not capable of production here, but are the raw material for silken apparel to be made here. They are admitted at 15 per cent., as being, comparatively speaking, raw material. Criticism on this point must be silent if the right honourable and learned member is going to admit that, when he produces his Tariff, if he gets the opportunity, he is going to have one uniform ad valorem list for articles, no matter in what state they are as regards their advance towards being finished products. If he is going to set forth a 5, 10, and 15 per cent, list instead of an average of 20 per cent -becaus e that is the line, except on a very few articles-and if he taxes the finished product under his Tariff more highly than the raw material, then to that extent he is a protectionist. and learned friend discriminates between wholesale ruin spoken of. those two things, and says that he makes an advantage in favour of one of them because it is a finished product-a n adports from outside Australia or within ? vantage, that is to say, to the manufacturer and the employee-and does the opposite total imports, because we have to take those with regard to another, which is either from other, parts of Australia as well as actually or relatively a raw product, by those from the outside world. I have had that act of discrimination he confesses himthem calculated in regard to mining self a disciple of protection. If that machinery, the produce of British and is not so, it seems to me to be hard foreign countries, and also in regard to to see what does constitute protection articles produced in Australia. In 1899 on any article. It is easy to talk of the value of mining machinery produced duties at 10 and 15 per cent., but when in Great Britain or foreign States and one has to face the responsibility of raising such an amount of revenue as will relieve these States from financial distress, one finds that one has to have a Tariff very much like the one submitted to honourable members. As to the case of boots and shoes, of which we have heard a great deal to the effect that under this Tariff they are taxed to an enormous rate, I have had an estimate made to show what it amounts to. There is a great art in instancing matters of this sort. It is an art easy to accomplish, forward as the ruling rate, without saying anything about the average. The question is the average. AVhat is the average ? The average of taxation on boots and shoeswhich is a composite rate-reduce d to the terms of ad valorem rates, is this. On men's boots, size above fives, winch the right honof the rate being 60 to 61 per cent., the average is 30. On women's boots above twos, the average is 35 ; and in the matter of slippers, concerning winch my right honourable and learned friend was so eloquent, the average is 30 per cent. That is enough to show how easy it is to take out certain items, and try to base a general statement upon them which is most dangerously misleading. I have had a return prepared to show the extent to which this Tariff injures mining machinery and supplies, regarding which certain telegrams were published a day or two ago, and were sent to me and other honourable members, from Western Australia. One would think that in these lines there was some j enormous amount imported from outside. I have here a return of the imports of mining machinery into the State of Western Australia; also timber capable of use for mining purposes, during years 1899 and 1900.

Honourable members must recollect, when I read of articles the produce of Australia, that those will be free of duty from now, except so ""far as AVestern. Australia chooses, intercolonially, to render them subject to duty under section 95 of the Constitution. In 1900, the British aud foreign mining machinery amounted to £169,844 and see how closely that from Australia comes -whil e tlie Australian produce amounted to £.152,452. That makes a total of £170,562 for 1899, and £322,296 for 1900. as follows:-British and foreign produce in mining machinery, £ 2 6 6 , 4 5 8 ; Australian ditto, £226,400. Total, £492,858. NowI n 1899, the British and foreign produce in parts of machinery brought in amounted to £27,551, while that of Australia amounted to £27,985 ; a total of £55,736. In 1900, the British and foreign produce in parts of machinery was valued at £61,252; and that of Australia at £49,861, atotal of £111,113. Tlie sum of the two years in each case was: British and Australian, £77,846. These figures will show that except so far as AVestern Australia herself chooses to keep out mining machinery _ and parts of mining machinery, it is open to her, under this Tariff, to resort to a market which she has found in the past practically as good as the British. and learned gentleman estimates that he will get £80,000 from these lines. like to know whatmyhonorablefriend thinks he is proving when he says that. Next we come to timber. The British and foreign unworked timber imported into Western Australia in 1899 amounted to £20,435, and that of Australia to £6,753, making a total of £27,188. British and foreign timber in balk, rough and hewn, amounted to £2,962, and Australian to £ 2 7 1 only; making a total of £3,233. In tlie following year, 1900, we see Jiow the two sources of supply in unworked timber begin to approximate. The British and foreign unworked timber for that year was £13,970, and the Australian £8,332, making a total of £22,302. In balk, for the 17 u same year, tlie figures are: British and foreign timber, rough and hewn, £2,547 ; Australian, £461. Total, £3,008. So that the absolute total importations of timber for the two years were as follows :-British andforeign, £39,914; Australian, £15,S17 ; making a total of £55,731. MrV . L . SOLOMON -That relates only to Western Australia. have some relation to the outcry about the absolute destruction of tlie interests of the miner-and also of the mining company, which is carefully omitted from newspaper paragraphs-in regard to the importations of machinery on the one hand, and of The total for the two years was timber on the other. The return is illustrative as showing that there is an ample market for the supply of all these products in Australia. The fact that the we come to parts of machinery. local products have been imported into Western Australia to such an extent shows that they can be imported to advantage. MrV . L .

The argument on the other side is based on the fallacy that duties on articles winch may be produced here permanently increase prices. That is not correct. So far as some of the items challenged by my right honourable and learned friend are concerned, he will find, if he will take the two betes noir of his party-boots , shoes, and hats^-that those grades of boots and shoes in respect of which he says workmen are so heavily taxed, are sold in the markets of Melbourne as cheaply as in the markets of Sydney. Not only is that the case, but plenty of Victorian boots and shoes are sold in the Sydney market. stand statistics coming from men who call themselves boot manufacturers, such as the "" T Company,"" and the "" Pitwell Company,"" who mention that they are manufacturers, and employ a number of hands. But they employ a much larger number of hands elsewhere, by reason of their importations. We must remember, if we are to set up statistics sources on either side, that we must be impartial, and deal with them as we would deal with others, and. investigate the extent to which these people depend upon importations, when they decry the Tariff. people. 1,063, including those employed in the manufacture of slippers. Now the complaint is made that the article of "" jewellery "" is not taxed sufficiently, because it is a luxury. It is placed on the highest .line of the ad valorem list, and should be so. It is as high, if not higher-and in this . respect I admit that the Tariff goes high than it has been in any of the States or in New Zealand, although 5 per cent, below that of -Canada. It is an article which lends itself to smuggling, and if, as suggested, we were to tax it higher than we propose to do, the extreme rates would provoke smuggling. The comparative rates in regard to Canada and New Zealand are set forth in a tabulated statement which has been put before honourable members. I am not going to weary the House by going through them, but I will make one comparison which is instructive. First of all I have a word or two to say about the Canadian Tariff. It will be within the recollection of honourable members-and this is on the point of whether ours is relatively a higher Tariff as compared with the sister Federation or that of other countriesthat some seven or eight years ago SirW i l f r i d Laurier acceded to power, and proceeded to make alterations in the Tariff. He and his party are what are called ""free-traders"" over there, but I really suppose that they may now be put down under the fashionable term of "" revenue tariffists."" I have here a quotation from the Argus of l o t h February last, which Was tlie day after I addressed an. audience in tlie Melbourne Town Hal l A t very different prices. during the progress of the federal campaign. It reads as follows :Mr Barton repeated the statement which he made at Maitland, and on which, indeed, he founds many of his remarks that to raise the required revenue there must be ""a high Tariff. V That is precisely what my right honourable and learned friend said in the ""Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, on 21st that come from interested February, 1899. The report continues :Mr Barton added that a low Tariff is a delusion. I did not say that. The Argus knows what I said. I said that a low Tariff which would not return to the States what was necessary in order to keep them solvent was employ 1,000 a delusion. The Argus further saysHere we have a long standing controversy as to the revenue effect of low and high duties, which it is unnecessary to-day to discuss. However, there is a present case directly in point. Writing on tlie Tariff reduction effected by the Laurier Government, the Toronto Globe says:-""The change effected by the liberal Ministry removes unnecessary taxation, so that the revenue was increased at the same time that the burdens of taxation were lightened. That was regarded as an impossibility by the conservative Government, and its members are still mystified by the appearance of an increased revenue from a lowered rate of taxation."" What was that Tariff? It was the free trade Tariff. In the tabulated statement it appears side by side with the Tariffs of all the States. Let any one read it, and ask what the free-trade party would have said if we had dared to propose such a Tariff. that proposed by the Government. not be a mongrel one, but it comes",48,Motion Of Censure

I come now to the Canadian Tariff. Without going through it, I ask honourable members to compare the highest rate in the Fede»al Tariff with the highest rate in the Canadian Tariff. The highest ad valorem duty in the Federal Tariff is 25 per cent., whilst in the Canadiani t is 50 per cent.

If he would only look at this matter from the standpoint of an Australian, instead of supposing that the Tariff in one State can rule the Tariffsi n the other five States, if he would realize that not only has revenue to be obtained, but that we must not allow industries which support our people to be so impoverished as to make our people poor, he would not always be harping upon New South Wales.

Apart from that, take the ad valorem basis of taxation in this Tariff, and what do we find ? If a man wants a £2 dress, piece for his wife, and the rate of taxation upon that is 10 per cent., he pays 4s., and the man who wants a £15 dress piece for his wife pays 30s., because he buys a superior material ? Do we require to be told at this time of tlie day that, whatever are held against it, taxation by ad valorem duties-to mit-is nevertheless, where it does exist, a taxation according to means ? Taking into consideration facts of that kind, let us look at this list. The proposed Tariff for all the States is £2 7s. 6d. per head.

Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN It is exactly That is relevant. honourable member does not understand. The cry is about the burden of the taxation, and the cry as regards New South Wales is about the burden of taxation, and not the incidence and mode of levying. These figures are relevant to tliis fact: that the taxpayer, in order to be levelled up, has We get, I admit it, an into pay more in three of the States, and less in the other three, and that then the Treasurer, in order that we may approximate to a level as the years go on, is worseoff in the three States where the taxpayer will be best off, and best off in the three States where the taxpayer will be worse off. Where we have to strike a line is this : We are liable to fall into In this case, where the serious danger and tocauseinjury to the whole of the taxation would of the Commonwealth unless some middle we should have to line is drawn which, without making the burden of taxation too high upon the people, nevertheless takes care and secures that not one of the States shall be landed in any helpless condition. that affect the equality of incidence 1 if I may say so politely, can talk about the equality of incidence until he is black in the face, but I am working up to another point, objections and if the honourable gentleman does not see it I cannot help him.

These attempts to interrupt and prevent a reasonable, friendly discussion of the matter are typical of the sense they have of the exposure of the fallacy of their arguments. Let me contrast this condition, with regard to the burden per head, with the only Tariff of a considerable revenue character which New South Wales ever had-the Dibbs Tariff, which was brought in at the end of 1891. It took effect just about the end of that year, and a normal j'ear of that Tariff was 1892, because, so far as regards its operation in 1893 and 1894, those were panic years, as we all know. The operation of the Dibbs Tariff in 1892 was that the average burden of taxation on the people was £ 2 8s. l i d . per head. two years. years certain and for part of a fourth, but I am not taking in any more than the j'ear which supplies a fair comparison, because the others were panic years. In that year 1892 the Dibbs Tariff yielded £ 2 Ss. l i d . per head. The result, therefore, is that, as regards New South Wales and the rest of Australia, the average payment per head under this Tariff being £ 2 7s. 6d., the burden upon the people is Is. 5d. per head less under tliis Tariff in a normal year than it was in New South Wales under the Dibbs Tariffi n the normal year of 1892. Sir Tariff did the whole of that at 10 per cent. not do it at 10 per cent. It was 10 per cent, and 15 per cent., and my honourable friend will recollect that there was a large number of fixed duties, and, in addition to that, the Dibbs Tariff covered a very large range of the field of taxation. It is onlj' fair that a revenue tariffist should be allowed to make an uninterrupted speech. the right honourable gentlemen. A man who stands in mj' position should not be subject to constant attempts to prevent him from saying what he has to say. If that is fair then I congratulate those on the other side. I congratulate them upon their tactics If honourable members which ought to appeal to every quarter of the House. honourable gentleman does not object to a friendly interjection ' being so friendly in his interjections as to try to make my speech instead of leaving me to make it myself, and that is what the honourable member is doing. Of course, I am accustomed to this sort of thing, and one always knows from it the state of feeling in the quarter from which it comes. It is a barometer. The leader of the Opposition had something to say about wages. Since the right honourable member spoke I have had a comparison made of the wages in Victoria and in New South Wales. we can call Coghlan Ananias; most of the And it operated only for figures are his. taken from the reports of the Victorian wages boards, and I do not know that we should call any one of them Ananias. out of that little comparison. I do not sayi t with pleasure, because I would rather that it was more in favour of the worker in New South Wales. This is the comparison for good and all, and my right honourable friend can ransack the official sources, and see whether it is not true. I shall take some of those employed in the principal industries.

If he will pick out one State, he must expect to be confronted with another, In the coopering trade and until he abandons his idea of trying to decide everything by selected instances with regard to one State, he will never get that Australian view which he has been striving in vain to add to his vision. I do not want to take up much more time on tliis matter. There is much more material in these printed papers, and there is a deal of what my right honourable friend said I might follow him in, if he had not made, as I ventured to say, a committee speech, instead of discussing the' principle of the matter. I want to add that he did not forget the sugar. There is in this Tariff a proIn posal that there . shall be charged on sugar an import duty of £6 per ton, an excise of £3 a ton, but a rebate of £2 a ton in favour of white-grown cane sugar, so that the whitegrown cane sugar stands in relation to the imported article as one to six, paying in the result a balance of £1 excise duty, while the imported sugar pays £6 a ton-. My right honourable friend said that he was prepared to adopt these rates. I do not doubt him, but what became of the rest of his speech once he was prepared to adopt that difference ? That is a scheme no doubt protective, but for the purpose of carrying out a high national object: it is for the purpose of preventing certain legislation from being felt too harshly or too injuriously, and of enabling our own people to be preferred in In tlie shirt-making work on their own land. That is the object of it, and it cannot be disguised either by my right honourable friend or by me. But if he wants to be chosen as a free-trader, and says I am to be rejected as a protectionist, where is the difference between us according to his own showing 1 Try that in Kanaka. In the tanning trade friend will have a reply which may possibly be more effective than these interruptions. If he is prepared to make a difference of £ 3 a ton on sugar, no matter how grown, in favour of the local producer, and a difference of £ 5 on other sugar locally grown, It is a wonder they do not if the producer is white, then how can he justify that except by saying that there are occasions when protection is a good thing ?

We are extending our action to cover the cases of substantial industries because they all belong to Australia ; but the right honourable gentleman will not do it because his heart, although once touched, is no longer open.

He said that he put on. the sugar duty for revenue purposes, but he re-introduced some of the Dibbs duties some years ago. He said then that those duties were intended to producerevenue, but he imposed duties not on articles that would produce revenue, but on those that were being made in New South Wales another slight aberration. If those duties were proposed for revenue W it h regard to the £ 5 purposes:-if my friend's heart was touched to the point of stopping the reduction of. the sugar duties after they had reached £ 3 per ton-wh y was not the ordinary free-trade complement of import duties adopted? Why was not the tax supplemented by an excise duty upon sugar ? If the object was revenue, then a £ 1 or £ 2 excise upon the £ 3 import duty would have been all right, or even a £ 3 excise; because, according to the doctrine which we have by the grace of Senator Pulsford, when you put an import duty on material you can make within the Statei t is your bounden J draw the lina at 70 per duty for the sake of the revenue to clap on an excise duty just as big. That was not done with the sugar duties, and what was the reason why it was not done ? If the object regard to a great Australian inof the duty was to obtain revenue it would and should have been done; but the great and substantial indusobject was a continuance of protection, are now the assets of the however much my right honourable Inter-State free-tradefriend may try to disguise that fact With regard to the sugar duties under tliis Tariff, my right honourable friend stands convicted, not of the disease, but of the crime of protection.

That is the free-trade theory that the righthonorablegentleman preaches, but how, if he sustains it in this case, could he support a sugar duty. of the Kanaka. right honourable friend to that, because the sugar duty is no means of getting rid of the Kanaka, if the proceeds go into the pocket of the employer, and not into the pockets of the wage-earners. to see to that. right honourable gentleman comes into office, whether it will suit him to abolish the duty or whether he will have his heart touched. I need not go any further into the details of this Tariff. As1 have said, it is far more convenient to discuss these matters when we are in committee. I must, as my right honourable friend did, thank the House for having so patiently listened to me. Notwithstanding the interjections that have been made, I am sure that we shall all be as good friends as before. I believe that nothing I have said has gone beyond the rules of parliamentary courtesy. I think I have sustained the propositions with which I started out, first that this Tariff is an honest attempt to fulfil our election pledges, second that it deals fairly with the States, and third, that it does not impose any burden, except what was inevitable, upon the people of Australia. Those -are the three points which I considered were the real substance of my argument, and I ' believe that I have established every one of them, and that I have established, in addition, the fact that so far from this Tariff having imposed an inordinate burden on Australia it has been exceeded by the burdens which tlie people have borne without any injury whatever in the State of New South Wales, from which the right honourable gentleman and I come; which State will, under the Tariff, get intercolonial free-trade and a leading position in the union at a saving of Is. 6d. per head of its population. feel somewhat diffident about rising to address the House immediately after the Prime Minister, but being the only Victorianunfortunately-sittin g on this side of the House, perhaps I may be excused for thus early taking part in this discussion. I do not propose to enter into the details of the Tariff at all, because I think, with the Prime Minister, that the details can much better be left to the committee stage. I do not think that the reflections the Prime Minister has passed upon.the leader of the Opposition were quite just, because it was incumbent upon him to show by examples from the details of the Tariff in what respect the Government proposals do not carry out the pledge made by the Prime Minister, at Maitland. I admit at once that I did not expect anything but a protectionist Tariff, because it was clearly stated at Maitland that the policy of this Government would be protectionist, but the Prime Minister said it would be moderately protective. Now, I think the dispute really turns on what we mean by ""moderate."" The opinion held by another member of the Cabinet, the Minister for Customs, is that the Tariff was a moderate Tariff and a compromise. In the word "" compromise,"" the Minister for Customs used the word which the Prime Minister introduced into his speech at Maitland, and which he quoted to-night, when he said that the spirit of compromise must have fair play. I think the committee the other night, and certainly some honourable members on the Government side of the House, observed with amazement, or rather with consternation, the manner in which the Minister for Customs spoke of moderate protection. One would have thought that the Minister for Customs was making a rally for the high Tariff party of Victoria. What he said was"" This is a protectionist policy, make no mistake;"" and then, turning to those sitting behind h i m "" Do not be afraid."" I was reminded of that play which most of us have acted at school, entitled Bombastes Furioso. Bombastes, it will be recollected, nailed his boots on the wall, and then saidWho dares this pair of boots displace, Must meet Bombastes face to face.

185,Mr Winter Cooke (Wannon),"Itouched, he making his appeal to honourable members sitting behind him. We have been told that this is a compromise Tariff, but I should have thought that when we entered the Commonwealth, and were making a compromise between the varying Tariffs of Australia, we should have looked to the highest Tariff and the lowest Tariff, and tried in a measure to bring them together if possible. If we look to the list of goods which entered New South Wales free, we find among them apparel, boote, hats, and furniture. heavily in Victoria, the duties ranging from 35 per cent? to 15 or 20 percent. that there shall be a reduction from 35 per cent, to 25 per cent, or a difference of 10 per cent., and from 20 per ,cent. to 15 per cent., or a difference of 5 per cent, so far as Victoria is concerned, whereas in New South Wales the duty jumps from nothing to 15, 20 and 25 per cent. What kind of compromise is that ? It seems to me that if a man came to me and said I owed him 35s., and when I urged that I owed him nothing at all, he offered to arrange the matter by making the debt 25s., it would be an extraordinary kind of compromise to suggest. I cannot consider this a compromise Tariff at all, or even a moderate Tariff. I come from the pastoral and agricultural districts, and represent here the primary producers of a portion of Victoria. I do not mean to say that I represent these producers of Victoria only, because I represent producers throughout the whole of Australia, but I endeavour to look at the question from their point of view. The Prime Minister seems to have looked at the question from only tlie Victorian manufacturers' point of view, and has bee"" extremely sensitive as to his treatment of them. He accuses the leader of the Opposition of not taking an Australian view, but surely when we find the Victorian Tariff reduced to the small extent I speak of, and when we see the great rise in duties in New South .Wales, we can fairly retort on the Prime Minister that he is looking at the matter from the Victorian manufacturers' and not from the Australian point of view. shall refer to presently. draw attention to the fact that what is called the farmer-the land-owner living in the country and getting his living out of the land-doe s not wish to evade his fair share of taxation. He is prepared to pay his proper proportion like any other citizen. Under the proposals of the Government the fanner will have to pay on such things as sugar, biscuits, candles, cocoa, tea, rice, sago, starch, apparel, blankets, hats, caps, woollen goods, lamps, oils, paints, earthenware, furniture, boots and shoes, leather, and many other items, in addition ' to having to pay the increased duty on ale, spirits, and tobacco, which may, Those articles were taxed I suppose, be considered as luxuries. ThoughI admit at once that many of the farmer's tools of trade will be free from taxation as The Commonwealth proposal is they are in Victoria at the present time, I hold that if possible all his tools of trade should come in free. As the Victorian manufacturer claims that his tools of trade should be free in the town, so in the country should the farmer's tools of trade be free. What is proposed in the Bill1 It is proposed that tents, tarpaulins, galvanised iron, agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machineiy, nails, engines, boilers, bolts, nuts, barbed wire, all leather manufactures, and various other items, shall be taxed. The tendency at the present day, no matter what the fiscal policy may be, is for population to centre in the towns. That arises from a variety of reasons-tli e desire for a pleasanter life, the opportunity of seeing one's neighbours and friends, and of enjoying all the pleasures which town offers-and surely it should be the duty of the statesmen to aim at making country life as attractive as possible, which can only be done by making country life pay. 1 am not an advocate for protecting the farmer at all, but I say that we should give him all the freedom we can in the matter of earning his living, and not impose a fine on him by means of duties on the goods he has to use. position in regard to all his agricultural machinery and implements, as he is in in regard to reapers and binders and cream separators. are always bringing forward reapers and The so-called moderate duties I binders, which are like to them "" K in g I now wish to Charles'head.""

The worse of these rings formed by protected manufacturers is that the people first of all call the protected industry into being by putting then hands into their pockets and enabling the industry to be established, and when they have done that the manufacturer turns round and says"" Now, then, we will make you pay what we think proper for your goods.*' The importer has never acted in that way, andj as a rule, it will be found that these importers' rings break down. The reaper and binder ring broke down, I believe, considerably before the introduction of the Eederal Tariff. of its operations. wants to make money, I do not think any exposure will stop him as long as there is nothing dishonest about what he does. There is nothing dishonest in getting the highest price possible. If we have anything to sellcattle or sheep or anything else-w e get the best price we can for it . It might just as well be said that because some people have the good fortune to have fat cattle and fat sheep in Victoria just now, and are asking high prices for them, thus causing people to pay high prices for tlieir meat, they are doing something improper. The reaper and binder is the only instance which has been mentioned. The Minister for Trade and Customs brought it of trumpets the Prime Minister has referred to it again to-night. In speaking for the farmer I am not advocating protection. I do not believe that protective duties on the articles produced by the farmer will be for his benefit; at all events they will be only very slightly for his benefit. It is true that for some little time, possibly, produce may come in from New Zealand, and compete with what is produced here, and tinned meat may be slightly protected; but, speaking for Australia generally, our great industries of wool, wheat, and frozen meat cannot be protected to any large extent. Some of us hope to see the day when New Zealand will come into the Federation. Certainly, none of us desire to shut out New Zealand. In that event, the Australian farmer will cease to be protected against New Zealand products. It is impossible, except to this limited degree, and for a short time only, to protect the primary producers of Australia. Therefore, I hold that this Tariff is a wrong Tariff, because, in addition to trying to get revenue, it checks revenue, whilst at the same timei t injures the primary producer. Moreover there is the point which, I think, is almost worse-m y honourable friends representing labour will think it far worse-that the working classes will, under these proposals, be very severely taxed. I do not t h in k I never have thought-that what we call the working classes-that is the artisans-who earn the lowest wagesjvshould be free from all taxation. They should be taxed. But the taxes should bear upon them with fairness. Any man who has a vote to return a Member to Parliament should be taxed to some extent. He should bear his fair share. ber tax him for having a vote 1 pay any taxes at all I would not give him a vote, which comes to the same thing. The Tariff taxes arrowroot, bacon, and biscuits, which are things which the working man' uses. South Wales. ing fault with any particular item, but with the aggregate. Other items taxed are-blue , candles, cocoa, currants, raisins, honey, forward with a great flourish matches, rice, sago, soap, starch, tea, apparel, the other night, and blankets, hats, woollens, mangles, kerosene, earthenware, furniture, boots and shoes, not to mention ale, spirits, and tobacco. On each of these items separately the amount of taxation will undoubtedly be small. on some of these articles. of the taxation on the working man is, it seems to me, enormous. Take a man earning wages from £ 2 to £ 3 per week. Suppose he is married and has a family to keep. In that case the aggregate amount of taxation is simply enormous, as compared with what will be paid by those who are fairly well off in the commxmity. I say that if possible wherever the duties on these goods are for protective purposes they should be considerably lower. We have heard much of the Victorian industries.

"" I would gradually reduce tlie duty to the revenue-producing stage and ultimately wipe it out altogether. I did not expect that the Government would propose a Tariff of that kind, because they said they wanted a protectionist policy.

The right honourable and learned gentleman has stated in this House to-night that this Tariff is not,going to k ill any industry, but that if any lower duties were imposed some of the industries would suffer and possibly die. have had these duties in Victoria for I do not know how many years. Eresh industries will grow up under this Tariff in the other States. ticular Tariff they will grow up. Tariff is higher than this. worse for South Australia. not as bad ; is that by keeping up this protective Tariff we shall bring into existence or keep in existence throughout Australia a number of vested interests. As population increases these industries will become stronger and stronger, and when Parliament endeavours to touch any one of them we shall have, as II said in my speech on the Addressi n Reply, those interested in the industries coming and interviewing Members of Parliament. We shall actually create for the new capital of Australia the very evil which has grown up at Washingtona profession of lobbyists, men whose time is spent simply in interviewing Members of Parliament, and influencing them when a Tariff is proposed to be touched. As Bryce, in his American Commonwealth, has told us, that is the state of things that exists at Washington. I do not say that we shall have here a wholesale with practically Viccorruption of the Legislature, but I am convinced that if we carry out proposals of this nature, for the protection of industries throughout Australia, we shall have the same corruption when questions affecting the Tariff arise, as they have had in the great United States of America. This question of the Tariff is the only question upon which I really feel strongly. I believe it is of far more importance than anything else which we are likely to have before us in this Commonwealth Parliament. As the Attorney-General told us, it was the one I am afraid it is not so. question which the people of Australia had to decide at the ballot-box. I have taken the greatest interest in it , and I deplore the fact that the Government have not seen then way clear to come down to the House, not with a farewell to protection, but with a statement showing what industries no longer require protection. We know that boots and starch aud candles of local manufacture, which have been protected in Victoria, are selling in New South Walesi n the open market, and the protection on such articles should be lessened or removed altogether. I have not veiy much more to say, but shortly sttited, I object to the Tariff proposals of the Government for these reasons: First of all, they are not a compromise. Surelyi t is not fair The South Australian that we Victorians should seek to raise so largely the Customs duties of New South Wales, while we reduce very slightly those which have ruled in Victoria? That cannot be called a compromise. ThenI say the Tariff proposals are not moderate.

Lastly, to repeat what I have said already, the Government are proposing to saddle Australia with a protectionist policy, which it will be very difficult for us debate. to remove, and which I am firmly convinced will lead to the corruption of the future legislators of this country. rise at this early period of the debate because I find that there is a conspiracy of silence on the other side of the House. silence. spiracy of silence on the other side to prevent the possibility of this question being debated, and I have risen, therefore, unprepared as I am to speak to-night, although I had intended to devote a considerable amount of attention to this question, which is of more importance, particularly to the people of the State that I have the honour to represent, than any other matter that is likelj' to claim the attention of the Eederal Parliament for very many years to come.

I have risen at this stage because certain honourable members on this side of the House desire to put off their remarks until to-morrow night, and think it would be inconvenient for them to speak at this juncture. The Government have arranged, as far as they can, to prevent honourable members on their side of the House from continuing the debate. The Government are afraid to have the light of day thrown on their policy, and some honourable members behind them are in the same position. They thought that by some subterfuge they would be able to close this debate at once. The Prime Minister told his constituents that he was going in for a revenue Tariff, and even with all his deception he only obtained a majority of about 100 votes after weeks and weeks of canvassing against a gentleman who had been in the field only a few days. If the Prime Minister had been honest to the people of Australia and told them exactly what he was going to propose would he have been on the Treasury benches today? as a A ictorian. r toria he spoke with one voice, whilst he spoke with another in New South Wales.

It was further stated that New South Wales had imported 6,800,000 lbs. of preserved beef, whereas, in point of fact, she had only imported 564,000 lbs. Can any one wondei-at the ignorance of the people of Victoria, when such misrepresentations appear in the newspapers? Mr O'MALLEY to make tlie workers of Victoria cry, to have statements of that kind published, and then to find that they are incorrect. Unfortunately they have great difficulty in finding that out. £41,652 worth was imported, and of this amount, £19,086 worth was a l l that was imported from outside the Commonwealth. Strange to say no reference was made in this article to hay, chaff, poultry, honey, cattle, sheep, or pigs. The writer pointed out that there was a duty of 20 per cent. on this article, and 20 per cent, on the other, and so much a lb. on another, but he made no mention of the quantities imported. Why? We have only to look at the figures to ascertain that. What, do we find? Taking straw first, it was stated that there was an import duty of 5s. per cwt. to help the poor farmers of Australia, and especially of New South Wales, and yet we find that tlie total value of straw imported into free-trade New South Wales was £126. MrO ' MALLEY No doubt New South Wales is strong in chaff. something solid besides the chaff. Of hay and chaff, importations to the value of only £ 6 9 4 were introduced into our free-trade State of New South Wales, which has been open to the whole of the producing countries of the world. No mention was made of that, but only of the fact that there was a duty upon those products of Is. per cwt. for the protection of the farmers of New South Wales. Again, take poultry. It was pointed out that there was .a great protection and help afforded to people raising poultry, but we imported only £220 worth of poultry, and nearly all were prize poultry imported from the old country in order to improve our breeds. ' Then take honey. It was said with great glee, ""Look what the Government propose to do. They propose to place a duty of 2d. per lb. on all honey imported. See what a great thriving industry that will become."" Yet free-trade New South Wales imported only £ 8 worth of honey. honourable friend is familiar with eggs.

'Theni f we take pigs, I believe the Government are going to help the farmers in that line also, and I find that we imported only £ 3 0 worth. To sum up tliis article what do we find? « l t said that the total imports into New South Wales of butter, cheese, eggs, wheat, bran, pollard, flour, bacon, ham, extract served meat, onions, potatoes, and straw for 1899 amounted to £1,236,000, and that the great bulk of those importations were from places beyond the Commonwealth. No mention was made of hay, chaff, poultry, Jioney, cattle, sheep, or pigs for 1899 for the reason I have already mentioned. The writer also omitted to make any reference whatever to the re-export of goods imported into New South Wales. The re-exportation of goods imported into New South Wales amounted to £221,000 in value. Taking the figures given, £1,236,000, without any reference to the matters to which I have referred, we find that according to Coghlan -and the writer quoted Coghlani n the first article, but did not quote him correctly, because it would not do to let the people of Victoria know the truth of this matter ber really think the people of Victoria are so easily led astray as that ? think that they have been led astray by men like my honourable friend and others in the past, but I am glad to think that there is a better time coming for Victoria. Coghlan points out that instead of £1,236,000, as quoted by the Age, the imports into New South Wales, from places beyond the Commonwealth, for 1899, were only £369,126. £1,236,000. ""great bulk."" said that the great bulk of it came from places beyond the Commonwealth, whereas, in point of fact, imports only to tlie value of £369,126 came from places beyond the Commonwealth. Of hay, chaff, poultry, honey, sheep, pigs, and cattle, the total imports from beyond the Commonwealth amounted to £377,842, or about £900,000 less than the Age tried to make the people of Victoria believe was the case. But if the writer had gone to the year 1900, as he should have done, because he had the statistics for that year before him, what would he have found? He would have found that the imports of the farm produce mentioned had been reduced from £377,842 to £182,962, or by one-half the figures for 1899. It did not suit the Age to refer to that. The exports of the same of meat, pregoods to places beyond the Commonwealth amounted to £1,023,817, so that the exports of farm produce mentioned (a) and (b) were in excess of the imports to the extent of £840,000. And that was under free trade. Could any one ever believe that any reasonable journal would endeavour to deceive the electors of Victoriai n the way the Age has done in this matter? Of course, the farmers in New South Wales, I am glad to say, have realized the hollowness of the whole system of protection. They realize that Australia is going to be an export country so far as farm produce is concerned, and that if we were only to have our own markets open to us, we could not utilize all the produce that would be grown here. In wheat we have a surplus, and we must find a market for it outside Australia. The protection we give will not therefore help the wheat growers. The only way in which we can help them is by assisting them to get markets abroad. The same with our flour, preserved meats, and I am sorry to butter. Instead of importing, as the Age wants to make out, what do we find ? In New South Wales, under our free-trade Tariff, we exported last year over 10,300,000 lbs. of butter, or about 10,000,000 lbs. more than we imported. In other words, tlie value of our exports over imports was as follows:-Butter, £426,000; wheat, £139,000; flour, £69,000; preserved meats, £219,000 ; and cattle, £24,000 On the principal lines of farm produce our exports over imports amounted to £840,000. I believe the farmers in Victoria are just as intelligent as ours, and we have had evidence of that from the fact that a large number have gone over and settled there, and I am happy to say adopted free-trade. I may add that a number of them voted for me on the last occasion. you get them under a fair system. right, but they were gulled by reading articles in the newspapers here, day after day, until at last they began to believe that there was something in the contentions.",61,William Mcmillan Th E Dibbs The Minimum Wage Is 50s For 48 Hours

273,,"I doubt that. Mr SYDNEYSMITH I was drawnthe farmers are concerned, they are not going to benefit by this system of protection. We cannot increase the prices of the articles grown by them, because they have surpluses of dairy produce, wheat, and meat, which have to be exported, and we cannot help them by increasing the cost of living and of the machinery, twine, &c, which they have to use. Every increase in the cost of production renders them the less able to compete in the markets of the world. Some honourable members seem to think that this Tariff is going to benefit the miners. I have read some excellent speeches, delivered by several honourable members of tliis House, notably by the Attorney-General, and the honourable and learned member for Indi, on this question of the protection of the miner. These honourable members have pointed out, and very properly so, too, that no system of protection could be devised which would help the mining interests of the country. We cannot increase the value of the gold or silver, or copper by any system of protection ; and we are certainly not going to help the miners by putting taxes on all the necessaries of life, and upon machinery. A telegram received from Western Australia dining the last two days points out that some of the mine-owners who contemplated erecting extensive and modern machinery in order to cope with the difficulties in that far western country have had to cancel orders for machinery that would have cost a quarter of a million of money simply owing to these iniquitous duties. This will have the effect of throwing out of work hundreds of miners, and of seriously hampering the mining industry of AVestern Australia, and the duties will also operate prejudicially to mining enterprise in all the other States. I. should like to know how honourable members are going to account to their mining constituents for this iniquitous Tariff. Those who are interested in mines not only have to undertake the importation of expensive machinery j but, in many cases, machinery has to be conveyed for long distances by railway or other means of transit, and the cost thus involved is such as to heavily handicap the industiy. Now we are adding to all these drawbacks by imposing an iniquitous duty. taxes on other things afterwards. aud I do not see how anything can be put forward to show how this Tariff is going to 17 x benefit the miner. The Government have tried to catch the farmer's vote by ' the scheme which I have just revealed, but they cannot show any reason why the Tariff should have the support of the miners. When the miners have an opportunity of speaking they will make their feelings known most decisively, I have no doubt. or twice already.

I supported Sir Henry Parkesi n his desire to bring about federation, but because of that it is not to be supposed I was in favour of every line in the Bill. I wanted a B i ll that was fair and just, and I took my part in voting and speaking against the measure which was presented to the people. Of course, when the people accepted the Bill, I was one who loyally abided by that vote, as I believe every honourable member should. I feel sure, however, that if the people had had an idea that they were being deceived, a very different result would have followed the elections. Prime Minister, no doubt, succeeded in obtaining a seat for a free-trade constituency, and in securing supporters in other places by the misrepresentations made while the election was going on. I have no hesitation in saying that if the Tariff, as now proposed, had been submitted to the people of Australia at that time, there would have been no Barton Government to-day; and, further, if the people had an opportunity of deciding now, we should soon see a different state of affairs. The people have been deceived, and none more than those the Prime Minister represents. But the Prime Minister did not deceive me, because I had had experience of him before in connection with this very question. I was a member of the Parkes Government when the right honourable gentleman moved the adjournment of tlie debate and brought -about the defeat of that Administration. The right honourable gentleman was then pledged not to alter the Tariff-and he has made some reference to that matter tonight-and said that he would have nothing to do with the Dibbs party. But within ten days of our defeat he joined the Dibbs Government, and afewdays af terwards brought forward his protectionist policy. I believe that a result will follow the debate to-night, similar to that which followed the debate to which reference has been made by the Prime Minister. The fangs of protection were fastened on the State of New South Wales by misrepresentation, which misled the people, and when the Government went to the country with their protectionist proposals, the Barton Government became a thing of the past. tionist Government has ever appealed to the in regard to federation. issue and won at the polls. election ? tion was the only eleotion for twenty years in which I was not an active member of the election committee, and it was the only election during that time which was not fought on the fiscal issue.

I am sorry that I did not hear the whole of the Prime Minister's speech tonight, but in the short time. I was in the Chamber, I heard him refer to the benefits of protection. As to that, I have heard the right honourable gentleman make strong speeches on the benefits of free-trade. I have heard the right honourable gentleman time after time tell the electors of East Sydney, one of the strongest free-trade constituencies in the State of New South Wales, what a great thing free-trade is. I have heard tlie Prime Minister refer to a Chinese system of protection. Would he apply that term to the proposals before us to-night ? the Prime Minister advocated free-trade. to say anything personal, but it is difficult to find out what the Prime Minister does advocate. It must be admitted, however, that he has been free-trader, protectionist, and free-trader again; now he has come back from free-trade to protection again. member knows very well that what I say is correct. knows that when the Prime Minister joined the Dibbs Government, he joined on the",64,William Mcmillan Th E Dibbs The Minimum Wage Is 50s For 48 Hours

They admit, in point of fact, that they have not succeeded under the protection system, notwithstanding the high rate of duty that has been imposed. Minister's point as to the wages paid ? and learned friend must admit that the employees in New South Wales have shown that they are able to look after themselves, and to insist upon proper wages being paid to them. are higher than those paid in Victoria. What a different picture we have between tlie position of the manufacturers of boots and shoes in Victoria and in New South Wales. The four largest manufacturers in New South Wales are importers ; but they are also the largest manufacturers in our State, and have the best machinery. They employ 1,000 hands, and have no protection at all. They say that they are prepared to live on without any protection, whereas the manufacturers of Victoria say that they will die without protection. they employ 1,000 men? boot manufacturers and a slipper maker employ 1,000 between them. The three are McMurtrie and Company, Taylor and Company, and John Hunter and Sons. tailers also ? ployes include their salesmen ? men employed in factories. That is what they say in their letter. In Victoria the manufacturers have been protected against imports, tlie unfortunate consumers have had to pay a higher price for tlieir boots, and the cost of living has been increased to that extent, whilst in some cases the little ones have had boots to their feet in consequence of the high price charged for boots. The Victorian manufacturers have had the advantage of our free market, whilst theiilocal market has been conserved for their benefit; whereas we in New South Wales are thriving without any such restrictions, and do not want any protection for our industries at all. Wherever one looks in New South Wales one finds prosperity attending our industries. We employ men in our factories. Take the male hands in Victoria by way of comparison. I have pointed out that there is no increase in male hands. about 8,000 or 9,000 females employed in New South Wales, and double that number of females employed here. In some instances the wages female employment in free-trade England? that presently. Honourable members talk of England. I am sure they are very proud to live under the British Crown. They are glad to look to the old country for help and assistance, and proud to enjoy a measure of freedom which does not exist in any other I dare say they country. If we compare the United Kingdom with any of the great countries of Europe, it will be found that the agricultural and manufacturing industries, per head of population and per square mile of territory, are wonderful. I take the area as well as the population, because my honourable friends opposite are fond of comparing the area of Victoria and New South Wales in this respect.
