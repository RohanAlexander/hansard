7,Mr Ctjnnin & Ham,"As honorablethis Parliament resolves that the government of the territory shall, be administered in accordance with the White Australia policy, Hindoos, 'Malays, and natives of the Pacific Islands other than the territories to which the mandate applies may be introduced. It is for us to say now how those territories are to be administered. If we do that, and should trouble arise in the future, it w ill be known how we stood, and whether we upheld our principles in the interest of those whose welfare is handed over to the safekeeping of this community. It is distinctly laid down in the Peace Treaty that these mandates are given over territories whose peoples have not arrived at a very advanced stage of civilization. This mandate is given to us, not to exploit the people of the territories to which it relates, nor to allow capitalists to bleed them, but so that their affairs may be administered in the best interests of civilization and humanity. considers it to be its duty to see that effect is given to the mandate in accordance with the Peace Treaty, and that there shall be no exploiting of the people of the territories in the interest of capitalists, no matter where they may come from . I am confident that, no matter what the future may have in store for Australia and for the whole world, the wisdom of what I am proposing w ill be manifest in the future, and w ill be recognised by the people of Australia, who will be asked to expend money on the administration of these territories. Let the charge never be made against the Australian people that they were parties to the enslavement of the peoples of the Pacific Islands. second the amendment.

The right honourable gentleman must be aware that at this stage of the measure it is competent for any honourable member, indeed, it is the duty of any honourable member, who wishes to safeguard his rights in the subsequent stages, to see that the order of leave is wide enough to admit of the amendments which he may wish to have inserted in the B ill . member say that the order of leave is not wide onough to cover an amendment of the kind suggested ? which the Minister has given, the motion which he has moved is not wide enough, but the assurance which he has given I accept. When I took exception on Eriday to the motion being put through without a word of explanation from the Minister, it would have been quitepossible for the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) or the Treasurer (Si r Joseph Cook) to give the explanation which has been given this afternoon in a few words. My objection on Eriday was not captious or obstructive in any way. I have been accustomed to the parliamentary practice that at this stage of a measure questions are asked and information given, and, if necessary, amendments are moved. I have no doubt that in the past records of this Parliament it will be found that a similar procedure has been followed. A Minister moves for leave from the House to bringi n a B ill , and it is right for any honourable member to discuss the motion, and to ask for information in regard to it , without an attempt being made to browbeat him, and prevent h i m from speaking. I regret that the course adopted this afternoon was not taken on Eriday; but, in view of what the Treasurer has stated, that amendments of the nature suggested may be moved m Committee, I can see no objection to tihe proposal made by the honourable member for Gwydir, and I therefore, for that additional reason, support it .

Johnson) I have received from the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr shortage is due to abnormal circumstances Makin) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The serious shortage of coal supplies in the State of South Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. have taken this action in order to impress upon the House the gravity of the situation that confronts South Australia at the present time in respect of her supplies of coal. Tlie shortage of coal is so serious that tbe industries of the State may be suddenly brought to a standstill. Representatives of South Australia, no matter on what side of the House they may sit, are, I am sure, fully seized with the importance of this question. well) has again and again emphasized the point that definite action will have to be taken to facilitate shipments of coal to that Statei f its industries are not to be held up at an early date. The actual shortage in the supply of coal delivered at Port Adelaide for the fourteen weeks ending 31st July last amounted to 73,000 tons. That ""was the shortage in respect of arrivals at one port alone, and Commander Bracegirdle, Chairman of the State Coal Board, states that if supplies do not come to hand in larger quantities it will be impossible to avert an industrial crisis. South Australia in this regard does not stand in an isolated position. Victoria, as pointed out by the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) last week is also suffering from an acute shortage; but the position in South Australia is even more serious, and it is with the object of impressing this fact upon the responsible authorities, and securing sufficient supplies to keep the wheels of industry going that I have taken this action. Quite a number of excuses are forthcoming, and it might be well this after'noon to analyze some of them. We aretold in the first place that the shortageis due to decreased production. Then, again, it is said to be the result of increased exportations. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has suggested that the that have prevailed in this country during recent years, and among these he includes the influenza epidemic and industrialunrest. Others again claim that the shortage is due to lack of shipping facilities; while, lastly, we have the statement made by a prominent coal merchant in Victoria that it is the result of Government control and interference with the distribution of supplies. Let us deal, first of all, with the allegation as to decreased production. This will naturally impress some people as the reason for the shortage at the present time, and, as a consequence, this responsibility will be focussed by public opinion on those directly employed in the coal industry. But, according to Mr J. M. Baddeley, the president of the Coal and Shale Employees FederationNotwithstanding that the Commonwealth GoThe vernment had about 800,000 tons of coal at grass at Newcastle, he had known ships to be kept there a fortnight, and it was nothing ior them to be held up for a week. statement is as correct as the first part, he is a "" long way out "". ments made by others' in evidence given before the Sea Carriage Committee which confirms the statement that large quantities of coal are at present lying at grass. confirm Mr Baddeley, at any rate.",22,Parliamentary Tour Of Th E Islands

44,Mr Corser,"That evidence does not to sayThe Shipping Board at Newcastle was regulating shipping, including colliers; but the workers, who had practical experience, were not represented on it. As far as the miners were concerned, the output of coal for the past few months had exceeded the record for any corresponding period for as long as he could remember. The coal going overseas was responsible for the shortage. The .Federal Government should provide more ships for the conveyance of coal from Newcastle to Victoria and other States. In addition to the large stocks the Federal Government had on hand, the Government of New South Wales, as well as a number of collieries, had large quantities. Some shortage. In America, for instance, it of the coal, in fact, had been there since 1016. was found necessary in June of this year Eveni f tlie statement as to decreased production is correct, but which. I do not admit, we are told there is still at grass a large amount of coal, and we should have an explanation why the States today are practically starving for this commodity. Before the Sea Carriage Comander Robert Douglas, colliery manager, who stated that there is sufficient coal at Newcastle to relieve the Inter-State shortage if extra shipping is provided, and he admitted that there has been a great increase in the export of coal. An' other gentleman, MrM . C. McDonald, of the Northern Colliery Association, gave evidence, in which he saidFor five years there had been a surplus of coal and a shortage of tonnage to carry it, but during the past few months the position had been reversed. Some of the northern collieries had had to charter ships to convey coal to their customers. Ships were now waiting at Newcastle to load to both foreign and InterState ports. I ask honourable members to contrast these two statements by Mr Douglas and Mr dependent chiefly on the Newcastle minesMcDonald. If there is this coal at Newcastle, why are ships waiting, and why are South Australia and the other States not on to speak about a shortage of 54,000 tons in Inter-State exports, and 129,000 tons in foreign exports, and to say there had been a decrease in production of over 300,000 tons in 1919 as compared with 1918; but, at the same time, we have the statement about the surplus lying at grass, and an assurance by Mr Badnot conflict. McDonald stated that it is not a shortage require an explanation. of shipping that is causing the shortage of coal in the Inter-State trade. As to ister to give us an explanation of them. exportation, I find . the following statement given in evidence before the Sea Carriage CommitteeThe extent to which oversea exports are expanding at the expense of Australian needs is indicated by the fact that of the total quantity despatched from Newcastle during July of this year of 434,959 tons, the amount allocated to Australian and New Zealand requirements was 266,877 tons. For the first week of August the total output was 91,989 tons, and of that amount only 51,160 tons has been allocated for the Commonwealth and New Zealand. Australia does not stand alone, for other countries have felt the effects of a coal to put a temporary embargo on the export of coal as a national necessity; yet an American boat is in Australia seeking coal for Honolulu in order to fulfil orders on behalf of America. In other words, America is not prepared to allow the export of American coal to Honolulu in order to meet her contracts, but this American vessel is under orders to proceed to Newcastle to take coal to Honolulu on behalf of America. If America is not prepared to supply her own orders, I do not see that we in Australia are under any obligation to assist her in the matter, and thus place our own people at a disadvantage. The American authorities do not hesitate to conserve the interests of the American people, and keep the wheels of their industries turning, and we ought to be alive to the position, and see that we make ample provision for the requirements of this country. South Australia is in this unfortunate position, that it has no coal-fields at present known or explored apart from isolated deposits of brown coal, and is for its supplies of coal. There appears a circumstance which requires explanation in the evidence given before the Select Committee which is inquiring into matters affecting sea carriage, because one colliery manager has stated that there are ample supplies of coal, and another that ships are waiting in Newcastle to be loaded.",23,Adjournment Formal

The Inter-State demand for coal is likely to continue for some time, ibecause there are no reserves in South Australia or Victoria. The supplies of public utilities are reduced to a minimum, and some of them have not more than enough coal for one week. The present demand may continue for some weeks, and it is necessary that more shipping shall be provided.

If , when they cannot get the coal from the mine, honourable the Government will be free of blame. It will then be clear that the shortage is due to the fact that we are exporting coal which ought to be made available for local industries. There is a feeling abroad that foreign ships are taking away coal that ought to be diverted to the Inter-State trade.

91,Mr Mathews,"I do not know, butthat to take place to-day; they would not show much acumen if they did. However, the fact confronts us that a shortage of coal exists, and it is lamentable to think that works employing 600 or 700 hands may have to close down, and remain out of operation for a month. So far as Victoria is concerned, particularly in my own constituency, the shortage of ' coal is such that thousands of men will be out of work unless arrangements are made by the Government to supply coal in greater quantities. Treasurer) [4.17] -It is rather a peculiar circumstance that immediately following the best monthly output we have had for some years the shortage of coal should suddenly become accentuated in the House. One would have thought that after such a month as July people would be glad to say, "" Well done! improvement already effected in the output; go ahead and do better."" But , strange to say, after the best monthly output for years, the position appears to be more acute than ever before. In regard to South Australia, that State does not appear to be in very great difficulties. Out of 200,000 tons made available for the Inter-State trade last month, South Australia has received 60,000 tons. Of course, on the principle that the more one gets the harder one growls, South Australian members are entitled to move the adjournment of the House on the coal question, but that really is not the State which should insist on dragging the coal question before the House, at any rate, at present, in view of the fact that it of all States fared best last month. The distribution of coal in July wasVictoria, 85,000 tons; South Australia, 60,000 tons; Western Australia, 14,000 tons; Queensland, 10,000 tons; and Tasmania, 9,000 tons; total, 200,000 tons. ceived 60 per cent, of its normal requirements. impression that 60,000 tons is as much as South Australia can use in any one month. The trouble is that when stocks are reduced to a minimum it is very difficult to distribute evenly all through the industrial lifÂ© of the country the littl e coal that is available. industries do not get thÂ© quantity required to keep them going, whilst other [149] industries may be getting as ' much as they require; but, because there is not enough for all, trouble arises. ThÂ© difficulty can only be overcome by building up stocks of coal. Every industry must have certain reserves so that when these temporary dislocations occur they can tide themselves over u n t i l the processes of distribution are again equalized. The problem is to get a greater quantity of coal circulated throughout Australia, and in bhis connection I may mention that last month's distribution was one of the (Parramattabest we have had. In July, 1913, the quantity circulated was 254,000 tons; in July,-1914, it was 200,000 tons; and last month it was also 200,000 tons, as much as was distributed in July, 1914. Therefore, the position is rapidly becoming better, and w ill still improve, I believe, if we can prevent these dislocations of We are grateful for the the industry which take place from time to time in consequence of one thing and another. However, all this trouble dates back to the influenza outbreak, which laid up shipping for three months, and to the two shipping strikes, which occupied three months each, and prevented accumulations of coal being made. As a matter of fact we shall never get ahead in our requirements u n t i l we have a little peace in the land, and every effort is directed towards improving the position as it arises from day to day. ThÂ© Government propose to appoint a Coal Administrator in thÂ© Newcastle district. HÂ© will probably be located in Sydney, but he will have f u l l control of the transportations of coal from the pit's mouth, and will issue permits for berthing at the wharfs. In this way we hope to be able to turn into the Inter-tState channels nearly all the coal which is won in the Maitland district, leaving some of the other kinds of coal to bÂ© used for the foreign trade. All of the States have a distinct preference for Maitland coal. I am under the trade. obliged to make a choice it is only f a i r that we should keep the best for ourselves. Some trade?

There is no reason why we should divert that trade which, in some cases, our own States really do not want, to the detriment of the export trade; but we believe that by the arrangement we are making we shall be able to limit the export trade to dimensions that will permit of tlie building up of InterState stocks. down to liedrock we hope that, while not destroying our export trade, we may at the same time build up our stocks of coal here. That is the fundamental trouble, but it comes back to the general question of the lack of shipping, and the lack of production. In the Newcastle district last year the production was 350,000 tons less than it was in the year before. of the European market opening. Sir JOSEP H COOK -The European market is opening, and in healthy conditions our coal trade ought to be able to supply the foreign markets in abundance, as well as our own. us the boats? That is the whole difficulty. Sir JOSEPH COOK I am told that the shipping position is easing a little, and I believe that if we can only continue for a month or two as we are now doing the trouble w ill rapidly cure itself. It is bound to break out sporadically, because the systematization of the trade is not as perfect as it ought to be; but the Government believe that the new Administrator w ill be able to obviate vessels hanging about and not being able to coal. Soon there ought to be enough coal for local requirements, and even some to spare. I agree that if we are obliged to dig into the stocks at grass for the purpose of keeping our industries going and our ships filled we ought to do it ; but I do not know that we should do away w it h that storage altogether. easilv replace what we take away from the stacks. done. However, I can assure honourable members that the position will ease very In fact, as any of our rapidly. We have been living from hand to mouth unti l we could get more shipping and greater production, and if the miners and owners will only act sensibly at the conference now proceeding, and agree to pull together to overcome the present difficulties, we ought very soon to be over them. Every one deplores the shortage of coal supplies in Victoria and other States, but as the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) has pointed out, there has been an improve-Now that we have got ment in the output from Newcastle. I believe that owing to the rush of foreign shipping to Newcastle to meet the coal starvation all over the world to-day, one or two of our steamers have returned from that port with empty holds; but that is not the normal position. times it was quite common for vessels to remain at Newcastle for two or three weeks to load coal. exceptional in any port of the world when a rush occurs. In normal conditions the mines and the loading facilities at Newcastle ought to be able to cope w it h the increased demand for coal in Australia, and keep up w i th the foreign trade as it existed before the war. The Commonwealth Government have 750,000 tons of coal in heaps at Newcastle. Government have not 500,000 tons of coal there. that there are 750,000 tons of coal stacked at Newcastle, but some of it may belong to the State Governments.

The Government ought to borrow loading appliances which the New South Wales Railway Commissioners have available, and load the 100,000 tons of coal which are stacked on the dyke at could supply the immediate requirements of the other States, and prevent any ships leaving the port empty.

108,Mr Watkins,"C o a l so stacked muststocks which the Government have purchased as a deterrent against future industrial trouble. They would, have no more chance' of getting men to work them if trouble did occur than they would of getting them to go into the mines. I know that two handlings would be required for the coal which is stacked on the Sulphide Corporation's property and elsewhere, in order to pick it up and transfer it to the ships' sides in waggons, but the coal stacked on the dyke could lae loaded direct into vessels by means of grabs almost as rapidly as it could be discharged out of waggons into a ship's hold. If boats are blocked from getting to the cranes at Newcastle they could easily br filled, from these dumps. Therefore, it is useless to cry out about a shortage of coal in the southern States when these huge stacks of coal are lying untouched at Newcastle. The situation could be relieved in the way I have indicated. ing the production, which was 350,000 tons less last year than in the year before ? Would not' that be a better way of meeting the difficulty ? duction has not been the faul t of the miners, but has 'been due to other troubles. The output of the mines to-day on any one day is greater, than it has ever been at any previous time in the history of Australian coal mining. It has not been the fault of the men that we have not reached the l i m it attained in pre-war days. Many of the mines were idle during the war, and they are only now being put into commission. mines which undertook the export trade. A few shiploads of Newcastle coal may have gone in a new direction, but the bulk of our exports have been designed to regain the markets that we held before the war. As to the statement that coal has been exported to Honolulu, or to some of the western ports of America, I would remind the House that Newcastle has always held that trade. not be allowed to regain it? During the war, because of the loss of this export trade, some of our mines did not work at all, while, .for the same reason, others were closed down for months. those who suffered in this way during the war should be al'owed an opportunity to regain the old trade. It is a curious fact that, while the Australian market seems to call for one class of coal, the whole [149]2 of our foreign trade demands the Newcastle Borehole steam coal. That is a heavier coal, and will stand the fiercest draught better than any other, whilst it is also said to have more by-products. The one course which the Government should take is to l if t the coal now on the dyke. If they did that, and at the same time secured increased shipping facilities, the position would be relieved, pending the re-establishment of the coal mining industry on its pre-war footing. Unless the Government have some inside information which honourable members do not possess, it seems to me that it would be wise for them to adopt the advice that has been given by representatives of coal mining districts in this House, and to dispose of the surplus coal now lying at grass. Some of that coal has been lying there for quite a long period. It is a well-known fact that coal begins to deteriorate in some cases as soon as ' it reaches the surface, while even the very best of it deteriorates within six months, and, in bad weather, very shortly after it is brought to the surface. If the GovernT h e shortage of proment could see their way to dispose of the coal now lying at grass, and to replace it to the extent dictated by considerations of safety, they would be well advised. I rose, however, more particularly to deal with the suggestion made by the Acting Prime Minister( Sir Joseph Cook) that the export trade should he deprived of the best coal, and given only that which is generally considered to be of second rate quality. The honourable These were the member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) has rightly said that our export trade is dependent upon our being able to supply a coal of rare quality. It is because we are able to cater for that demand, and to supply the best quality of steam coal that we are able to maintain our export trade; and so to keep our mines busy. The coal trade could be largely extended if there were a little more security atShouldi t taching to it , and we must undoubtedly continue to export our best. The Acting Prime Minister has said that our inferior coal is very much better than most of Surely the coal produced in the East. No.doubt that is so.

113,Mr Fleming,"The right honorablecoal is not as good as the northern coal. No coal shipped from any other part of Australia is equal for shipping requirements to that which comes from Newcastle. Sir member for Newcastle has just pointed out that the Borehole coal is better than Maitland coal for shipping purposes. coal is considered by experts to be best suited to the dye industries. It is claimed that it contains more of the best qualities of material necessary for dyes thau does any other coal. Our coal trade has been growing for years, and would have expanded far more than it has done, but for the insecurity attaching to it . I have had something to do with various phases of the coal trade, and know that there is a magnificent prospect for both the mine-owners and the miners if the business is but placed on a proper footing. mines now working be increased, but there are scores of places where seams can be opened up which will bring abundant wealth to Australia, and provide employment for a. great body of men who should be satisfied workers, since the trade can carry the highest possible' form of wage and still make good progress. Despite this fact, we have the Government suggesting a course that would be absolutely dangerous to the whole trade. I hope that before they appoint a Coal Administrator and give him power to control the coal export trade-befor e they make any move to restrict the export of our best qualities of coal, and so l i m it employment over the large fields in New South Wales where thousands of men, women and children are dependent upon this trade-the y will give the matter the fullest possible consideration. orable member for Hunter( MT . Charlton) and the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), who particularly represent the coal-mining districts of New South Wales, know the business from' beginning to end. as I do I am convinced that their sole' desire is to advise the Government to do that which will prove best for the coal trade as a whole. I do, that if the mine-owners and the miners are set against each other, trouble is sure to arise. Government shall not restrict the export of coal merely to secure a slight and momentary advantage. To restrict our coal exports would be very imuch like cutting down a tree to secure its f r u it . The manufacturers of Victoria, according to to-day's newspapers, are calling trict the export of ooal unti l our wants are satisfied, so that we can go on exporting that which we produce -"" WhatY e s , and Maitland would be their attitude if those engaged in the coal-mining industry were to say to them, ""The export of your goods must be restricted until we are satisfied, and can obtain all that we want?"" These manufacturers are selfish, and so utterly blind to the interests of Australia as a whole as to ask the Government to restrict the export of coal in order that they may be able to carry on and export their own produce. It is pure selfishness. They ask for downright discrimination between two sections of the coor.munity. I hope that this motion Not only can the output of the will lead the Government to view this question from quite a new angle, and to realize that the voice of the manufacturers in Melbourne is not the voice of Australia. [4.45] -It is quite obvious that the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr. Fleming) is not impressed w it h the gravity of the situation that confronts the industrial forces of this country. Our manufacturers have met and have stated definitely that unless they are supplied with coal it w ill be quite impossible for theTr to continue their industries. As the result of the shutting down of these industries, thousands of employees will be thrown out of work, and they and their families will be l e f t to starve. Can such a state of affairs be viewed with equanimity, knowing as The honwe do that enormous quantities of our coal are being exported to meet the coal shortage abroad, and really to enable foreign manufacturers to continue their operations? In other words, our own manufacturers are to be permitted to Knowing them starve-thei r industries are to close down in order that Australia may supply coal to manufacturers abroad, and so en* able foreigners to continue their work.

I s the Australian workman to be starved to enable the foreign workman to live? If there is any question as to whether Australian or foreign requirements .are to be supplied, then undoubtedly the preference must be given to Australia. The evidence which has been given in regard to the coal shortage is most embarrassing. The conflict of testimony is surprising. plains that there is a shortage of shipping, while another asserts that there is ample shipping available. One elass of witness declares that there has been a greater, and another that there has -been a. lower, output of coal than before the war.

He therefore contends that the situation is easy, and that Victoria has no right to complain. it had' no right to complain. honourable friend realize that owing to the shortage during previous months we had been brought to a state of desperation, and that the supply of S5,000 tons during July, which was by no means equal to our requirements, has permitted our industries only to carry on, so to speak, from hand to mouth?

Honourable members will find that this measure is one for discussion in Committee rather than at the present stage. TheB ill proposes a series of amendments in the conciliation and arbitration law, which the operation of that law has* shown to be needed, and of which I shall make a short general explanation. Section4 of the principal Act contains a lengthy definition of the term "" indust r i a l matters,"" but this definition has been held not to cover disputes arising between unions as to the demarcation of the functions of their members, and it is proposed therefore to insert in the definition the words "" and any matter as to the demarcation of functions of any employees or classes of employees."" The disputes which these words w ill cover have arisen chiefly in the dockyards. The definition of "" lockout,"" which now : includes the closing of a place or part of a place of employment, or the total or partial suspension of work by an employer, with a view to compel his employees, or to aid another employer in compelling his employees to accept any term or condition of employmentis to be widened by the insertion of the words and the total or partial refusal of employers, acting in combination, to give work, if the refusal is unreasonable. Similarly, the definition of "" strike,"" whichincludes the total or partial cessation of work by employees, acting in combination, as a means of enforcing compliance with demands made by them or other employees on employersis widened by the addition of the words and the total or partial refusal of employees, preacting in combination, to accept work, if the refusal is unreasonable. sory work clause; that is Lenin and 'Trotsky! is a f a i r arid reasonable extension of the definition of a strike. It is proposed to insert in the principal Act a section, 6A, which w ill impose a penalty upon any person or organization bound by an award of the Court or entitled to the benefit of such an award, who does anything in the nature of a lockout or strike, I or continues a lockout or strike. Section6 makes provision for penalties, but no proceeding can be taken under it unless leave is first obtained from the President.

In 'Tasmania, a company was charged on information with having dismissed an employee by reason of the circumstance t h a t he was a member of an organization, and the magistrate dismissed the information, declaring that, by the Act, the onus was cast on the defendant of proving that he was not actuated by the reason alleged, and that the director of the defendant company had sworn that he dismissed tbe employee because the latter was dissatisfied, and there was no reason to doubt that testimony. On appealtbe case is set out under the heading of Pearce v.

Section 24 provides that where there is a dispute before the Court, and the parties have come to an agreement to which the Judge has certified, the agreement shall be filed i u the office of the Registrarand unless otherwise ordered, and subject as may be. directed by the Court, shall, as. between the parties to the agreement, have the same effect as, and be deemed to be, an award. It is proposed to add at the end of that paragraph the words, "" for all purposes, including the purposes of section 38,"" the intention being to make it clear that the Court has power over an agreement to the same extent as over an award, so that it may deal w it h applications for variation or w it h any technical amendment that may be considered necessary during the currency of an agreement. Clause 10 contains a rather .important amendment to section 28, which provides thatThe award shall be framed in such manner as to best express the decision of the Court and to avoid unnecessary technicality, and shall, subject to any variation ordered by the Court, continue in force for a period, to be specified in the award, not exceeding five years from the date of the award. (2) After the expiration of the period so specified, the award shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, continue in force until a new award has been made. That section recently came under review by the H i g h Courti n two cases, but, unfortunately, the f u l l text of the decision in one case is not available.

The duty of the Judges is to interpret the laws made by Parliament. This decision was not an attempt by the Judges to frame a law, but was an interpretation of the Act passed by this Parliament, and it is open to Parliament to amend or vary its legislation as it thinks fit. In the course of his judgment, Mr. Justice Powers saidThe action taken in the matter referred to may not have been authorized by the Act; but. if this Court holds that no new dispute about the minimum wage beyond the claim made when the plaint was filed can be dealt with by the Arbitration Court during the term of",37,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill Second Reading

154,Mr Groom,"That is hardly a f a i ran award, the Arbitration Court, until Parliament sees lit to amend the Act, can only '.' fiddle while Rome is burning,"" and employees can only resort to strikes to enforce claims employers will not grant. Employees will not in these days try to live on less than what the Arbitration Court has fixed as a living wage. Such a result ought, I hold, to be avoided, unless the Court feels bound to adopt, as the only possible, reasonable construction of section 68, the construction contended for by the respondents. And Mr Justice Isaacs saidWithout venturing to intrude into a domain not belonging to us, we are impelled to observe that the preservation of the present general plan of section 28 is not inconsistent with a supplemental provision for emergencies tliat could not reasonably be contemplated, namely, a provision to the effect that, even during the specified period, the arbitration tribunal may, in the event of abnormal circumstances arising which disturb the fundamental justice of the award, have power to adjust conditions. The object of this legislation is to secure industrial peace and certainty of conditions for employers and employees, and also some definiteness in the settlement of disputes in the interests of the public. In its wisdom Parliament thought f it to enable the Court to specify the period during which an award should continue to have force, the reasons being that employers were entitled to know, w it h a reasonable amount of certainty, the duration of an award, that employees were entitled to have some security that the minimum wage applied to them would continue for a certain period, and that the public ought to be in a position to realize that a dispute once settled would be ended for a definite period. a variation retrospective? considered that there should be some power to amend an award during the time for which an award stands, and the Government, realizing that there ought to be some elasticity in this regard, have proposed the following amendment:Provided that notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, if the Court is satisfied except on the application of an organization \hat abnormal circumstances have arisen which affect the fundamental justice of any terms of an award the Court may, in the same or another proceeding, set aside or vary any terms so affected. That amendment will bring the provision into line with the suggestion of Mr Justice Isaacs. make an award retrospective. proposed to remove the congestion of business and -give the Court power to vary an award, the same reason does not exist for making awards retrospective as may formerly have existed when cases were held up for a long period. It is proposed to amend paragraph b of section 29 of the Act, which specifies the persons upon whom an award of the Court is binding, by inserting the words "" o r notified "" after ""srummoned,"" thus making the paragraph more extensive in its operation. of making an award a common rule? only be binding on parties who have been summoned or notified to appear. In the operation of the Act, section 37, dealing with power to issue orders to take evidence, has been found a little too rigid'. The President of the Court may issue an order to any person to take evidence on behalf of the Court in relation to any industrial dispute, but it has been suggested that the Judge ought to be empowered to confine the order to take evidence as to suchissues and subject to such limitations as he may direct; that is to say, to enable evidence to be taken, not only in regard to the whole issue, but also in regard to part. Provision is made in clause 12 to carry out this suggestion. . The last clause amends section 39, which deals with the powers which the Court may exercise on its own motion or on the application of parties. The section providesThe Court may exercise any of its powers on its own motion or on the application' of any party to the industrial dispute, or of any organization or person bound by the award of the Court, but no order or award shall be varied and no submission shall be re-opened It is proposed to alter "" submission"" to "" question,"" which is considered a more appropriate word to useor ii person affected or aggrieved by the order or award. In the administration of the Acti t has been found that the public should also have a right to intervene. Therefore, it is proposed to give power to have awards varied or questions re-opened on the application of the Attorney-General.

I do not know whether the honourable member for Indi( Mr Robert Cook) remembers that conference, but I think I may safely say that there must have been present from all parts of Australia some seventy or eighty gentlemen.

I read the cablegrams, and told them. I could not say at that moment what the British Government intended to do, b'ut that the Government would endeavour loyally to carry out their decision, whatever it might be. I said at this conferenceI am here to tell you, as the representative of the Government, that the decision which is to be made to-day is to be your decision. . . .

I need not quote further from my ' remarks on that occasion. I desire to give the House the terms of the resolutions which were passed at the Conferenceresolutions arrived at by men dealing with their own produce. The resolutions were1. That this conference of representatives of the dairying industry of the Commonwealth favours a return to pre-war conditions of marketing butter and cheese when the present contract with the Imperial Government terminates in August next, and that there be ""freedom from price fixation and all other Government restrictions. 2. (o) That this Inter-State conference be urged to request the Minister to inform the Imperial Government that the producers desire a free market. (6) That in the event of the Imperial Government deciding to retain control of the importation and sale of dairy produce in Great Britain after the completion of the present contract, the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee be empowered to negotiate with and sell to the Imperial Government next season's surplus butter and cheese.

These are tbe resolutions which this representative body passed. Subsequent to the meeting of the Conference the f o l lowing cablegram, dated 23rd. March. 1920, was sent by us to the Secretary of Statef o r the ColoniesAdverting to my telegrams, 5th March, and previous dates, representative Inter-State conference of dairymen has considered question of sale to the Britisli Government of surplus butter find cheese for further period of twelve months, and desires me to urge their wish for a free market. If, however, His Majesty's Oovernment decides necessary to continue control dairy products, will be much obliged for earliest possible information as to nature of control proposed to be exercised, and particularly if it would involve purchase by Britisli Government of foreign butter as heretofore. Jn that event producers willing to negotiate. We received rro reply to that telegram, and as time was going-on the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee, acting on the instructions which it had received from the Conference, decided to appoint two delegates to proceed to London for the purpose of interviewing the British Government. were to press first of a l l for a free market, and, if they could not obtain a free market, to enter into negotiations for the sale of the surplus butter and cheese of the Commonwealth. Government ask for a reply to that cablegram? It is rather extraordinary that a further reminder was not sent. of any such reply among my notes. I asked to be supplied with copies of all cablegrams, and I cannot for the moment remember whether a rejily was or was not received. The important fact is that these delegates went to London. Whilst they were on the water the British Government announced that they had It was decided furtherdecided to decontrol cheese and to still continue the control of butter. which the decontrol of cheese would come into operation? information for the honourable member. As a matter of fact, cheese is not controlled in Britain to-day, but butter continues to be controlled there. As the season was drawing to a close, and as these negotiations generally take some time, it was considered, advisable, whilst we were awaiting a reply, that two delegates should go to London, and they were accordingly despatched on their mission. Mr Hugh Sinclair, who represented Moreton in this House for many years, was on'e of those appointed by the Dairy Produce Pool Committee, , and Mr. Osborne, of the Western District Cooperative Association, was tbe other. We gave them letters in which we informed the British Government that 'they had been empowered by this representative Conference of dairymen to enter into negotiations with-the Home Government for the sale of their produce, and we also told them that, as far as practicable, in the event of a contract being entered into, the Australian Government would support their action. delegates from the Government. vouring to make it quite clear that they are not Government delegates in the ordinary acceptation of the term.

The cable concludedGovernment having decided retain control till 31st March. That is the 31st March, 1921, and that answers the question put to me a little while ago by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney). On the 23rd June, 1920, this cable was receivedAfter lengthy negotiations with Controller and Committee we obtained definite offer 240s. f.o.b. end March ninety grade one shilling point .up and down other details not arranged sameiebnditions as before.

It w ill be noted that the But tbe Government gave British Government refused to decontrol butter. The London market is f a r and away the most important market for our surplus dairy products.

248,Mr Charlton C Â« N T E R ),"not only the butter producers in the Commonwealth, but Australia as a whole. The measure provides for an agreement between the British Government and the Australian Butter Pool, and under its provisions, no butter will be exported after the agreement comes into operation without the approval of the Butter Pool. Every one admits that our surplus products should be disposed of in the most favorable markets, in order that our producers may obtain the best prices, and inthat product, and we have ascertained recidentally assist the Commonwealth. It is well known that we produce a considerable surplus of butter. I have before me a statement made in the Victorian Journal of Agriculture by MrR Crowe in regard to this matter, in which he says that during the past season seven-eighths of our production was consumed locally: and, therefore, the quantity available for export, and coming under Commonwealth control, represents only one-eighth of the production. Knibbs' figures in regard to production show that, in the period from 1909 to 1913, ' the butter produced 945,014,305 lbs., valued at Â£47,742,910. The quantity consumed in Australia during that period was 557,408,071 lbs., valued at Â£28,160,720, leaving a surplus for the five years of 387,606,234 lbs. If we take the figures for the years 1914-15 to 1918-19a further period of four years-it will be found that the quantity of butter produced in Australia was 896,413,192 lbs., valued at Â£58,733,739. Of that quantity we consumed in Australia Â£42,130,904, leaving 253,397,700 lbs. as a surplus. It will be seen from these figures that we produce a large surplus, and that it is necessary that provision should be made to market it under the most favorable circumstances. The question then arises as to whether the arrangement embodied in the Bill will do what it is intended; I am very doubtful. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) stated that a conference of butter producers was held recently, at which the question of the fixation of prices was discussed, and at which the representatives were of the opinion that the butter producers should have the freest possible market in disposing of the surplus quantity. That was practically agreed to, and delegates their own business? were sent to Great Britain to enter into an arrangement with the British Government. We are now being asked to sanction an agreement providing for the sale of butter at240s. per cwt. f.o.b., which works out at approximately 2s. 1.6d. per lb. During recent years I have a vivid recollection of different Boards fixing the prices of certain commodities produced in this country. In connection with wool, a committee was appointed to deal with cently that some have made a tremendous profit as a result of the price at which the wool was sold when that profit should have gone to the Australian producer. occurred in regard to a previous sale of butter. nexion with wheat we find the same thing prevailing. Boards have fixed the price of wheat, and after it has been exported it has been sold at practically double the in Australia represented price at which it was sold by the producer, thus enabling others to reap the benefit from fixed prices. In view of these instances, which have occurred quite recently, it seems strange at this juncture, when there is a scarcity of commodities in other parts of the world, that we should be asked to sanction an agreement which may be the means of depriving the producer of that profit to which he is justly entitled. The future price of butter will depend largely upon 643,015,392 lbs., valued at the conditions abroad. In Europe today the situation is bad enough; and in view of what is transpiring, always allowing for the intervention of bad seasons, it is more than likely that butter will he at a very high price for a considerable time to come. If we enter into the agreement contained in the Bill, and fix a price of 2s. Id. per lb., it is quite probable that within a very short time the retail price of butter will'be in the vicinity of 3s. or 3s. 6d. per lb. have made this sale to the British Government. a loss to understand why. orable member suggest they do not know",45,Moloney Tha T Is Tion Of The Term

We have made mistakes, and it is possible that we are Â»n the verge of committing another.

Trade and Customs now says that he omitted to place certain facts before the House, and that certain, latitude is to be allowed. If the producers are to have freedom, they should not be tied at ail, and should be allowed to take tbe fullest advantage of any market abroad. It may be said that the price arranged is a good price, because it is practically the same as they would be receiving in Australia. To-day the producer is obtaining 2s. per lb., or perhaps a little less, and the price embodied in the agreement is slightly higher. But we know that in the event of a drought intervening, and during the winter months, the supply wonld be reduced, with the result that prices would rise. Before we export any surplus, we should make sure that our own. people obtain the commodity at a. reasonable price what we are doing to-day, as our coal is being sold at such a reasonable price that we can send it to the Baltic and elsewhere at a cheaper price than British coal can be supplied. member advocate an embargo? one word about an embargo on the export of butter. products, we should allow the people of the Commonwealth to obtain them at a f a i r and reasonable price; but hy that I do I am not saying not suggest that we should rob the producer; he should receive a f a i r price for the work he performs. world's parity a f a i r price? what the world's parity may be next . week.

It seems to me that this B ill has become absolutely necessary, because of the sale that has been effected of one of our primary products. tbe agreement which has been entered into legislative authority, so that it may be properly carried out, and our butter producers may obtain the price of 240s. per cwt., secured by Messrs Sinclair and Osborne, who I am sure made the best contract that it was possible to make at the time the agreement was entered into. which we are to receive 240s: per cwt. for our butter. of a higher quality than the average, and less ifj! it is a lower quality.

It is an agreement by yesterday in my office, to three men, one of whom is closely associated with the Government Department which deals with the matter, and they told me that the contract was not completed and that the New Zealand Government was negotiating with the Imperial Government on the same basis as our contract with a premium of 2s. if the New Zealand producers get a premium of 2s. on our price, the Australian I look upon the B ill as producers w ill be given the same advantage. practice, though I do not know why, to give New Zealand a slight premium over Australia, because in pre-war days, New Zealand butter always secured a small premium over Australian butter.",50,Eable Page Wher E Could We Would Be Better Off I F He Were Not Ham

When I entered this House eighteen months ago, I was surprised to find how little interest honourable members opposite took in the primary producer. Since the establishment of the Country party, it seems to me that honourable members on both sides are anxious to consider the interests of the primary producer, and I hope that he is .coining into his own, as a result of the in-flvjence of the little party that is now established on the cross benches. JThe dairying industry is one which deserves very great consideration. worth something like Â£19,000,000 per year, and I regret to say that it is absolutely going backwards notwithstanding the fact that prices are going up. To-day in Australia we have 200,000 dairy cows less than we had in 1913, and that, notwithstanding the fact that 'the numbers of other cattle have increased. This shows that the dairyman is going out of business, and it will be an unfortunate thing for this country if he does. Let me inform honourable members of what has happened as the result of the last sale of butter effected, not by the representatives of the dairymen, but by the Government. suggests that the sale was effected by the Prime Minister. That sale was effected at 175s. per cwt. at a time when the British Government were paying 300s. per cwt. for butter. We sold our second-grade butter, not fit for consumption in Australia, to the East at 205s. per cwt. to say that that butter was unfit for consumption. s not good enough for Australians, and that will qualify my statement sufficiently. The price at which the sale was effected was 175s. per cwt., and we got 243s. per, cwt. from South Africa. That is the treatment the dairymen received in connection with the last sale of Australian butter. [IS AUGUST, 1920.] Bill. 3609 cwt. was regarded in Queensland as a good price, considering the difficulties of shipping. we shipped to Africa for 243s. per cwt., and to the East for 205s. per cwt. land producers were satisfied that it was a good price. themselves effected the last sale, and they had sufficient common sense to make a contract covering a short period. It terminates on 31st March next, and is for only one season's butter. Dairymen are out to get the advantage of the open market at the earliest possible moment. If I thought that the open market was availI t is able to them now I would not be supporting this contract. When I find that the Imperial Government arc controlling the butter trade in the Old CountryI know that all that we can possibly do is to effect a sale to them upon the best conditions possible. the contract? the contract effective, so that it can be carried out. tract? that the butter is to be sold for 240s. per cwt. marketed in London, and under what conditions? will make a nice thing out of it. are not in this contract. The butter was sold by Messrs. Sinclair and Osborne as representing the producers who met in conference in Melbourne. If we fixed the price of butter at as low a price as that fixed by the Imperial Government when the previous sale was effected, the result would be that the condensed-milk factories in Australia would be able to pay a higher price for milk than the butter factories could pay. In my own district one milkcondensing factory belonging to the Nestles Company are paying a higher price for milk than the butter companies can pay.",51,Gbegoby An D

If whole milk is sold, and no skim milk is kept, there will be no calves reared in the districts in which this takes place. My own electorate is probably one of the best butter districts in Australia. one of the best dairying districts, not only in Victoria, but in Australia. If a low price is paid for butter, men engaged in dairying will be induced to sell their milk to the milk-condensing factories, and there will be no young stock reared in this country. That will be a calamity to tbe cattle-rearing industry in Australia. on selling milk if they do not rear calves. is happening to-day in the dairying industry. If the price of butter goes up, it will be better for the dairying industry, and generally for those engaged in rearing cattle. Warmambool some time ago was one of the best pig markets in Victoria; but to-day, since Nestles have become established there, it has become a district in which the milk produced is used in the whole state for the production of condensed milk, and there are practically no pigs sent now to the Warmambool market. Colac is the centre of a butter-producing district. There is no condensed milk manufactured there, and they have in consequence a very large pig marketabout 600 pigs per week. We shall have no young stock and no bacon if low prices are obtained for butter, and milk is sent iu the whole state to the condensed-milk factories. I support the Bill because I feel that it is necessary to enable us to carry out the contract we have entered into. It was a good contract, entered into by men of ability anxious to conserve the best interests of the producers of Australia. able member the contract. It would be well for the Minister to acquaint the House with the particulars of the contract, because very often the lack of information retards the passage of legislation. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) and quite a number of others have asked whether a representatives of the dairymen of Australia and the British Government; and when this Parliament is called upon to endorse such a contract by the passage of legislation it ought to have the fullest possible light on tbe subject. I agree with the honourable member for Hunter dissatisfied. I shall quote from the London letter of the Pastoral Review, which cannot by any stretch of imagination be termed a Labour paper, some remarks by Sir Thomas Mackenzie, the High Commissioner for New Zealand, whom any one who has studied his movements on the other side of the world will recognise as a valiant fighter for the interests of the Dominion he represents. It is an indictment against the British Government in relation to its handling of the commodity with which we are dealing to-night, and reads as follows:Sir Thomas Mackenzie, High Commissioner for New Zealand, speaking last month on the subject of Government purchase of overseas butter, made a strong indictment of the Government's Empire policy, and his utterance has attracted widespread attention. He said that with regard to butter, New Zealanders were threatened wit h expulsion from this market unless they accepted the price the Government chose to give them. Surely a young country like New Zealand, which had been loyal throughout the war, should be put on an equal footing, at any rate, with Ireland. The Irish people could .sell their butter at 5s. per lb., and the highest price offered to New Zealand was Is. 7Jd. He ventured to think that with the assistance of the Colonial Office no such injustice would be done to us as a refusal of the free market in Great Britain.

390,Mr Fenton,"The honourable memgood as that of New Zealand, but for our best butter we should not be content to accept less by 7s. per cwt. than New Zealand secures. The High Commissioner for New Zealand, Sir Thomas Mackenzie, has put up such a good fight for New Zealand producers that if they do not obtain the Danish price for their butter they will at least"" get very close to it. Are the producers of Australia content to accept, in respect of their surplus butter, 7s. per cwt. less than is obtained by New Zealand? I am putting forward figures to which no exception can be taken. I do not hesitate to say that the Danes will receive about 247s. per cwt. net for their butter. It is stated that New Zealand producers are likely to get something like the same price. If that be so, the Australian butter producers, notwithstanding that some of their own representatives have arranged this contract, will receive under it 7s. per cwt. less than their brothers in New Zealand. I say to every producer, "" Get the best price you can for your products in every other part of the world, and we will deal reasonably with you in your own country."" pleased that honourable members of the Labour party are taking a keen interest in these proceedings. I would point out to them that this Bill is not designed to ratify any agreement made in regard to the sale of our surplus butter; it is merely to give assistance in the carrying out of an agreement -made with the British Government by representatives of the dairymen, of' the Commonwealth. It is abundantly clear to me that the two gentlemen who entered into the contract went to London with full authority to act for the dairymen of the Commonwealth, and the contract entered into by them, is, I think, giving general satisfaction. those delegates? after consultation with tlie various cooperative butter companies throughout the States agents represented on the committee which elected them? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has found fault with the nature of this contract, and has urged that there should have been an open market. I invite honourable members to consider for a moment what would have happened if there had been an open market. Quite a number of speculators would have bought up our butter, exported it to various parts of the world, and so have obtained the profits which, under this agreement, will go to the dairymen themselves. The contract has been well advised, and the Government, in bringing forward this small measure to assist in giving effect to it, are certainly doing a great deal to insure that the whole of the bu'tter purchased by Great Britain shall be delivered. No one can say that, having regard to the conditions under which our dairymen work, the price of butter is too high. We have periodic droughts throughout the States. In Queensland, for instance, every third year is a dry one. I well remember the last drought, when the farmers had to spend the little they had in purchasing fodder to keep their cattle alive. We have been told time after time, of the long hours worked by dairymen-w e have been told that they and their families are practically the slaves of the industry-and the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) was not far wide of the mark when he said that if the dairymen were to receive fair payment for the hours-worked by them, then 4s. per lb. would not be too much to pay for butter. It is the one industry in Australia in which fair working conditions are not insisted upon. It is unreasonable to expect dairymen to work long hours, and to contend with droughts and the various pests which affect their herds, without receiving anything like a fair return for tbe work they do. I do not anticipate that this measure will occupy the attention of the House for any time. It is to my mind very important that it should effect may be given to the agreement that has been made with the British Government by the representatives of the industry. collar; and admit that this is really a Bill to prohibit the export of butter? the carrying out of tbe contract entered into by the representatives of the dairying industry and nothing further.",54,Chapman Question Mr Charlton That Many Dairymen Are

398,Mr Robert Cook ( I N D I ) [8.7],"Imperial Government have control of the shipping, and could take the butter at their own price. I venture to predict, however, that the Imperial Government have given our delegates the price they would previously have taken, and probably a little more, and that within the next few weeks we may even get an in creased price. Primary producers generally do not require any ""spoon-feeding,"" but they do ask for the world's parity and an open market. As to the butter previously sold at 175s. the producers did not definitely fix that figure; they asked something slightly over, bu t the PrimeM i nister ( Mr Hughes) sold it at that price to the Imperial Government. That contract was certainly considerably under the world's parity, but the Imperial Government was good enough to give us half the profits on the butter exported, amounting to something like Â£600,000. In regard to the present contract the dairymen held a Conference composed of representatives from all parts of Australia, and representing both proprietary and co-opera tive industries. From every place where dairying was carried on, and there was any organization, a representative was asked to attend; and, representing the industry to the extent we do, and having had the privilege and honour of appointing our own delegates to send Home, we feel that the bargain made is one that all interested should be satisfied with. This Bill is simply to give statutory power to the Butter Pool to deliver the goods, and I trust it will receive the support of the House, and be disposed of within a very short time. We have the interesting spectacle this evening of our honourable friends in the Government corner, who claim to represent country interests, joining with other honourable members opposite, who represent, amongst other interests, those of the middlemen, in support of a measure, i which I may say at the outset, is not properly described in the title. described as the "" Butter Agreement Act of 1920,"" a euphemistic name, but really it is a measure to empower the Minister for Trade and Customs to prohibit the export of butter except under certain conditions. Tbe Bill is to confer on that tioneering speech! Minister a power he does not already possess under the CustomsA c t , and is a electioneering sppftch, but a statement of special measure, the effect of which canfact to this House. not be to increase the price received by the producers for their product from Augustu n t i l March next. In fact, it will be generally admitted that the only purpose that the measure can have is to reduce the price-to keep the price as low as it is fixed in this alleged agreement. I make no apology for addressing the Housei n the interests of the primary producers, because the platform of the Labour party is framed in the interests of the primary producers and of the consumers of Australia. As I have pointed out before here, the Labour party is the only party that can point to its platform and its programme as standing for the interests of tbe toilers, whether on the land or in the secondary industries. Every opportunity should be taken on the floor of the House to point out that fact, and to draw attention to those combinations between the middlemen and the alleged producers' representatives, of whom we complain. On this side of the House we have honourable members representing primary producing constituencies, and sent here by primary producers. Amongst these are the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), the honourable member for Calare( Mr Lavelle), the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr. Cunningham), the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), the honourable honourable member for Barrier( Mr. Considine), and others. These honourable members, would not be here unless they had been sent by the votes of the primary producers of the country; and they -have the advantage that they can command the support of the representatives of such constituencies as Melbourne Ports, Port Adelaide, and West Sydney, witb the waterside workers, there and all -around the coast, who are pledged and bound by the same platform and programme. This party can rely on the support of the miners of Kalgoorlie, BrokenI t is H ill , and Charters Towers, and the shearers and shed hands of tbe Parl^ng and other places; and we can call this army in to the support of the primary producers.",56,Moloney Wh O Elected Be Passed Without Delay In Order That

Those who have entered into the agreeanent evidently consider it a fair one. Ehearing is very good, and the honourable Eiiember said that he could not say if the agreement was a fair one, and that he was. not concerned with it. He is evidently in favour of passing the Bill, because he is a good party man, and is going to stand behind the Government, right or wrong. is a logical deduction from what the honourable member did say. He does not know what the agreement contains, and I am sure other honourable members do not. Asi t is very desirable that we should have an opportunity of perusing the document before passing the Bill, I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) if he is prepared to grant an adjournment at this juncture? a course, as the dairymen need their money, and it is necessary to pass the 'Bill.' greatly handicapped in attempting to discuss a measure of this nature in the absence of the agreement mentioned in honourable the Bill. terms of the agreement. cannot carry all the terms and conditions in one's mind, and, as the Minister for Trade and Customs has promised to table the document, I am sorry he will not agree to an adjournment. It has been stated that the agreement' was entered into by the dairy farmers, but I absolutely challenge that statement, because I do not think its provisions were sanctioned by those who are actually engaged in the dairying industry in the Commonwealth. I agree with the remarks made by the honourable member for Indi( Mr Robert Cook), and the honourable member for Lilley' ( Mr Mackay) that the dairy farmers in Australia experience more hardships than, perhaps, any other section of the community. paid. because those engaged in dairying work seven days a week.

Sandford is one of the biggest dairy produce merchants in Adelaide, and it cannot be said that the . interests of ford are in common with those of the men who milk coWs for seven days a week. I have heard it stated by the representatives of the Country party in this , Chamber that they were here to fight the middlem in, and the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) had a good deal to say concerning the middlemen during the election campaign. withstanding the position that the members of the' Country party were supposed [150]2 . to adopt, they are now assisting the Government in giving effect to an agreement in the interests of four middlemen. I am inclined to think that there is a good deal in the cartoon published im the last issue of the Sydney Bulletin^ and I am now beginning to realize It is an absohow appropriate it is. The cartoon to which I refer depicts the PrimeM in ister ( Mr Hughe?) leading a little l a m b which represents the Country party.

Ever since I came factory into the HouseI have objected to t h e manner in which the producers were wool and wheat.

That will mean a loss to the primary producer. The same thing happened in connection with the sales of wheat and wool. When the Australian farmer was receiving 3s. 9d. to 4s. 2d. per bushel the Canadian and A r gentine farmers were receiving 9s. to 13s. per bushel, and whilst the Australian wool-grower was receiving 15^d. per lb. for his wool, the growers in other countries were receiving as much as 5s. per lb. more. We are told that the Australian wool producer should be satisfied, because lie is to receive 50 per cent, of any profit made on re-sales at prices over and above the fixed rate. There is no small wool-grower in Australia who is not in direct disagreement with that contract. The primary producers have a right to expect that, the war being over, we shall return to normal conditions. They were the greatest sufferers during the war period, but we are asked to perpetuate their hardships. price for their butter than they received before. are many honourable members on the Government side who will agree with me that this agreement may prove a very great hardship to the dairy farmers: The price is being fixed u n t i l March of next year, and no one can deny that it is possible, and, indeed, highly probable, that the fixed price will be much below the world's parity before the agreement terminates. .able member think that the people repreI do senting the primary producers know their own business as well as he does?

I received the votes of a large number of primary producers, and I shall do my best to see that they, get the best treatment possible.
