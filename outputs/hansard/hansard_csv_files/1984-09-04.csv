The most important thing is that on this occasion Because of the deceit of the former Government the public have got a real tax cut of $7.60 a week, there was no possibility of giving tax cuts in costing $2.1 billion in a full year which is almost 1983-84, and that is why this year the tax cuts twice as much as tax indexation.

So the Government is left stage in this debate. He normally makes very with some very embarrassing questions.
