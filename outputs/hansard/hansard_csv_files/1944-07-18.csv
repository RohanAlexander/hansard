3,Mr Curtin,"This matter is underMiners Federation, a miner who had been defying the disciplinary code of the federation was refused a lamp, with a view to giving effect to his suspension. The Government is solidly behind the attempt of the federation to enforce its disciplinary code. The matter reached a very critical stage in the events recounted by the honourable gentleman. of the miner concerned, leading to a stoppage of the operations of Richmond Main colliery. occurred, not only at Richmond Main colliery, but also at several other collieries. been on a purely expert level. I do not The Government is hopeful that the federation will carry to a successful conclusion its fight against the malcontents who are defying its authority. Shouldi t fail to do so, the Government will take independent action with a view to achieving the desired result. Harald published the statement by the manager of the Melbourne Gas Supply Company that unless supplies of coal reached Victoria by midnight of that day, all Melbourne users for either domestic or industrial purposes would be without gas on Wednesday. Has the Acting Minister for Supply and Shipping Inter information which would indicate rliat the position has been met? information which I ask the press not to report. The delay in the delivery of coal consigned to the company mentioned by the honourable member was due to extraordinarily bad weather for two days off the south-east coast of Australia. manager of the company would not know of that. The explanation could not be published in the press, because it would have disclosed the movement of a vessel on the Australian coast. he held by such an organization? liers know, reserves are very short indeed. One could not give publicly a full answer to the question raised by Mr Dunstan through the press without revealing the movements of this vessel. I understand that the Security authorities would not permitthat to be done. Information which reached me this morning disclosed that this particular consignment of 15,000 or 16,000 tons had arrived at its destination. PLAN. surer, before the rising of the House, state what progress is being made by the International Monetary Conference, and define exactly the proposals that are being discussed and Australia's attitude thereto ? relation to the monetary plan have so far know that any other government has definitely committed itself to a particular plan. The Commonwealth Government certainly has not done so. The final proposals which are now being discussed at Bretton Woods, are in our hands in cable form, but we have not been able so to formulate them as to make them available for complete consideration hy either the Government or the Parliament. In conjunction with the Minister for External Affairs, I shall endeavour before the rising of the House or as soon thereafter as may be possible, to make a presentation of all the proposals that have heen formulated by the experts in regard to, not only the monetary plan, but also an international bank. say whether restrictions likely to be imposed as a result of decisions reached at the monetary conference now meeting are likely to affect the development of Australia's overseas export trade? I cannot imagine that the proposals have been coming to us during the last few days. The proposals themselves are only tentative, and must be submitted to the various governments. I am not in a position to answer the honourable member's question. MT.

If so, will the Minister inform the House under what authority these servicemen are voting? What guarantee can he give that each serviceman will receive the official referendum pamphlet?

I understand that Captain Martin, when he was on .the staff in New Guinea, was asked to deliver some lectures, because it was known that he was a very experienced lecturer. I do not know what the text of those lectures was; but, knowing'him, I am sure the talks were of high-standard.

Sr/RFurs MILITARY OFFICERS. the number of army officers is now in excess of requirements, and many are being demobilized, particularly officers of the rank of major, lieutenant-colonel, &c, because of a lack of units for them to command. I ask the Minister for the Army whether, instead of demobilizing those officers, it is not possible to give them the opportunity to take positions at Victoria Barracks and in other governmental departments at present occupied -by officers who have seen no war service at all ? I am referring to the active service in the Middle East and New Guinea. They bitterly complain that at Victoria Barracks are large numbers of officers, who have never been outside Australia, and could be sent back to civil life instead of men with records of active service. tirements take place of officers w-ho have reached the regulation retiring age. The honourable member's suggestion is that positions might be found for them at Victoria Barracks in place of other officers. That aspect is always considered by the Commander-in-Chief and the Adjutant-General. It is a question of suitability and qualification. There is a mistaken idea that, at Victoria Barracks, are a great many officers young enough to be sent to combat areas; but that matter has been very carefully goneinto and only officers who are specialists are retained in Victoria Barracks, if they are of ages which would enable them to be used in forward areas. I see the point of the honourable member's question; we have a great deal of sympathy for the men who reach retiring age; but the Army is frequently criticized for having too .many officers; so, these retirements must take place from time to time, and .the men concerned are made available for civil employment.

The honourable gentleman's question regarding prices is a matter for the Prices Commissioner. Some time ago a conference of vegetable-growers was called which was attended by prominent officials of my department. A suggestion was made at that time that minimum prices for vegetables be fixed, but the vegetable-growers objected because they feared that the minimum prices might become the ceiling prices. At that time they were against the fixation of minimum prices. I shall take the matter up with officers of my department and ask them to discuss the subject with the Prices Commissioner. for Commerce and Agriculture' tell me whether it is a fact that the butter production target for the year ended June last was not reached by between 20,000 and 40,000 tons? If those figures are not correct, will the honourable gentleman tell me how the production figures stood in relation to the target figure? Is it not a fact that dairy herds are still being reduced in number, and that dairy-farms are still going out of production, owing to man-power difficulties consequent upon the failure to release sufficient men from the Army? If this is the situation, will the honourable gentleman take steps to expedite releases from the Army in order that butter production may be stepped up according to the Government's desires? production last season was below the target. No one knows better than the honourable member for Richmond that last season was one of the most disastrous that the dairying industry has ever known, owing to the drought conditions that were experienced over practically the whole of the dairying areas of Australia. The position in Victoria was calamitous. In the honourable gentleman's own constituency, conditions could be described as disastrous. That is true also of Queensland. Even if all the man-power desired could be made available bad seasonal conditions could render f u l l production quite impossible. The Government realizes that there is a shortage of man-power in the dairying industry as there is, in fact, in practically every other essential industry, and it is doing its best to meet the position. Every thing that is humanly possible will be done to make man-power available to speed up production in this industry. Commerce and Agriculture aware that the ravages of the buffalo-fly in North Queensland are seriously reducing production in the dairying industry? If some national effort is not made quickly, on an adequate scale, to deal with this pest, no meat will be available for export ten years hence; indeed, there may not be sufficient meat for home consumption. Dairying production in North Queensland has already dropped by about 33 per cent.

Having said that, I turn to the statemeat which was made to us by the Prime Minister. within the compass of one speech to discuss aU the matters to which some reference was made, hut there are some things upon which a joint statement of opiniou in this House may be of value. I propose to put forward my views, not because I apprehend that they differ fundamentally from the views of the Prime Minister, but so that, where there is uniformity of opinion on these great foreign questions, that may appear. First, I join with the Prime Minister most wholeheartedly in the tribute which he paid to the British people, who, within the last few weeks, have once more found themselves, as civilians, in the very front line of battle. There is I believe, for us and for all British people all over the world, a profound feeling of satisfaction that the final and, as we believe, fatal western thrust in this war is corning from and through Great Britain. A few years ago, the ITnitcd Kingdom was almost a lonely outpost in a free world. It was, a few years ago, on the defensive, and, indeed, liberty itself seemed to ibe on the defensive in those days. To-day we rejoice to find that Great Britain, far from being an outpost of defence, is a base of attack, a base of victorious attack, a base from which there is proceeding at this very moment the greatest invasion, certainly, the greatest amphibious invasion, of human history and an invasion which, for the first time in history, is not an invasion of conquest, but an invasion of liberation. Those things give to us all a profound feeling of satisfaction, and we join with the Prime Minister in offering to the people of Great Britain and to their magnificent leader, Churchill, and to all their armed forces and to those who fight with them, our congratulations and our admiration. Then, I tuun to ihe conspectus -with which we were presented of the ;ganeral progress -of the war in Europe. It is, I think, worthwhile .stating one <or two things about that progress, even though ibeldepe that they have .a great bearing: upon the future of the world. What is the outstanding feature of He present war in Europe? It is not merely that It is impossible progress is being made on the Western Front, not merely that there is dramatic and far-reaching success on the Eastern Front, not merely that there is, after some pause, a great and notable advance in Italy; each of those things by itself, of .course, is a great cause for satisfaction; but the remarkable thing, .the notable thing, is that each of thost movements marches with the others. Here, we have three successful attacks, each depending to some extent, and, perhaps, to a large extent, upon the other two. I i anything in the history ,of war has shown the interdependence of allies, it is the three movements that we now see in Europe. Russia, with all the miracle of its battle, would probably not have had so much success in these last few weeks or months if it bad not been for preparations for and delivery of the assault upon the western wall of Europe. Our forces in Italy could not have hoped to have the measure of success they have had there if it had not been for the diversion of the German strength because of the other two attacks. So, we have' learned, whatever preconceptions may have existed, in these recent times, that the price of victory in this war has been the inter-connection and interdependence of great allies. It will be a great tragedy if , when the war is won, that interdependence is dissipated. tragedy if we fail to realize that victory in peace will depend upon just the same kind of co-operation and should exhibit exactly the same kind of interdependence as victory in the war. Now, nobody, least of all the Prime Minister, who has discussed the matters on the spot, will under-estimate the difficulty of the task of maintaining that close association",24,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency

129,Mr Menzies,"It will be a greatwhen the war is over. It will not be easy. It is not for one moment to be taken for granted. There will be vexed questions. We all know of some of them. I have no doubt that Ministers themselves, particularly those directly handthat the news is good news-goo d ling these matters, have been greatly concerned about the possible problems which begin to emerge. Yet, unless these three great allied powers, with all those who fight with them, are prepared to work together in peace, I do not myself believe that peace will be of long duration. Indeed, I think it could be said quite truly that the peace of the world in 1964, twenty years hence, will depend almost entirely on how far the international comradeship in arms of the British Empire, Russia and the United States of America has heen perpetuated as a comradeship in peace. It does seem odd to those who have been interested in the progress of European history and world history that we should, at this stage, when victory is in sight be discussing the world's great mention of France, and I to say a word about France, because I believe that some discouraging things-unnecessarily discouraging things -have been said about France in the world in the last six or twelve months. We can only speculate as to the causes of France's decline and defeat in the early stages of this war, but I still believe profoundly in two things about that country. I believe, in the first place, that it is still one of the great homes of European civilization, and, as I believe in civilization, I must believe in France. "" balance of power"" in Europe in the In the second place, I believe that whatdays before this war. Now, the traditional ever decay may have occurred in some high places in France, and deeay there undoubtedly was, it is still true that the real people of France, peasants and artisans, are fundamentally sound. Because of those things, I do not believe that France can be indefinitely left out of this picture. I believe that a restored France, a France which has recovered after what may be a very slow convalescence, because it has suffered cruelly in this war, is essential to any consideration of a restored Europe and a stabilized world. On that, I merely pause to say this: I profoundly hope Mr Menzies. that the news that has come out of the United States of America quite recently which appears to suggest a clearing of the air between de Gaulle and America is true, because I believe news for the restoration of France and good news for the future ipeace of Europe. Then, the Prime Minister referred, not elaborately, but by a series of citations, to what will be perhaps the greatest international problem of all when this war ends-the problem of devising some adequate machinery for maintaining international peace. This is a problem which has troubled thoughtful men for many years. My only fear about it is that we may be much too tempted to try to solve it by some rather superficial formula, and that we may unduly pin our faith to some particular word or phrase. We are a little disposed always to classify our attitudes towards foreign affairs, towards the preservation of peace, according to some word or another. One man is an isolapowers without very much tionist, another believes in collective want security, another believes in power politics, and yet another believes in regional pacts. All these phrases have become a part of our stock-in-trade of recent months and years. Not one of them is, in itself, entirely satisfactory. Let me make a comment or two on some of these, because if we come to see what we are driving at in these phrases, we may come much nearer to the truth. Take the references which were made rather unkindly to the policy of preserving the British policy of maintaining the balance of power iu Europe was, after all, a policy that maintained peace in Europe for a very long time. And the peace of Europe, so long sustained in the nineteenth century, became troubled and uneasy and finally war came because the preservation of the balance of power in Europe, as the result of the growing strength of Germany, required constant intervention by Great Britain. Instead of maintaining the balance of power with other countries, Great Britain was an intervening power. The moment it became an intervening power, its risks iii Europe grew; and as Germany's strength increased, so the risk of war in Europe grew. Isolationism, which a. year or two ago bad many adherents and which had, as we know, millions of adherents in the United States of America up to the attack on Pearl Harbour, ignored the fact that peace among the great nations is really indivisible. It was once thought that that was a mere cant phrase. Events have shown how true it is. As the Prime Minister himself pointed out yesterday, the small nations that sheltered behind their neutrality have learned in this war to their cost in what a dilemma they live. Isolationism ignores the facts of life, of each nation composing it. And the the facts of the world. The United States of America has learned, I hopeand I speak with profound respect of a great ally and a powerful friend-as the result of the events of the last two or three years, that it can never hope as the world now stands to contract itself entirely out of the affairs of Europe. Great Britain cannot contract itself out of the affairs of Europe. Isolation for Great Britain in relation to European politics would be sheer madness, because it would mean that ultimately Britain would fight alone. Similarly, events have shown that if Great Britain is at risk in this world, the United States of America also is at risk. As the world's airways grow shorter through increasing speed, so the risk of the United States will be greater. When it is said that the great Powers Conference, for example, the process of of this world must, after this war, mainre-armament had begun in Germany. I tain military strength in order to predid not refer to this matter merely to rake serve the peace, somebody will come over the ashes of the past, except so far along and say that that is mere power as one can learn something from expolitics. Power politics are dismissed perience. The point which I want to as something which connotes mere force make is that if there is to be collective and, therefore, provokes war. Buti f security in this world after the war, those world politics are to maintain the peace, nations which participate in it must have they must have power, because this war and must maintain military strength has shown that righteous weakness will which will prevent aggression from comnever prevent war from being waged by ing to life. BecauseI believe that those unrighteous strength. There must be were the two outstanding reasons for the power in our international policies. Then failure of collective security under the again, in the statement that the Prime League Covenant, I was intensely inMinister has presented to the House, terested to find that the Prime Mdnister reference is made to future military referred to the Moscow Declaration of collaboration. I turn to the phrase November, 1943a declaration to which, "" collective security"" which held such perhaps, we have paid insufficient attenhigh hopes for everybody before this war. tion, because implicit in it, as I believe, Collective security is embodied in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Why did that fail? There were many contributing reasons for its failure. Sometimes in my own thought on this matter, I have attached more weight to this and more weight to that; but in the long run, I have come to the belief that there were two great reasons for its failure. One was that it had no international force, and so its commands lacked sanctions-a n almost fatal weakness for a new world body. In the second place, having no international force of its own, it was driven to rely upon the sum total of the individual force truth was that right through the fifteen years of slowly growing disorder which preceded this war, the powers concerned with keeping the peace were militarily weak powers, whilst the aggressor countries were militarily strong. It is one of the ironies of history that between these two wars, those countries which had won the last war proceeded to disarm each other in the face of defeated countries that were first secretly and then openly re-arming themselves. the enemy. My point is that at the very time when the United States of America and the British Empire were discussing the limitation of naval strength, as at the London",25,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency
130,Mr Bktsis'nan,They also disarmed,27,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency
131,Mr Menzies,"-Only temporarily.i :i very important statement of principle. The passage which was referred to by the right honourable gentleman was as follows:That they recognize the necessity of establishing at tlie earliest practicable date a general international organization based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peacepeople that between them they will, at all loving States. That reference to the ""sovereign equality of all peace-loving States"" is -something which, as I understand it, rejects or postpones-eithe r will do for this purposethe idea of the super State. It is stiil held by many earnest and anxious people that the right solution of the world's problem of peace and war is to set up a super State, which itself will have the military power and will control what has been called an "" international police force"", and to which the constituent nations will be subsidiary. This declaration at Moscow is much more realistic than that. It recognizes that in this state of the world's development,, it is hopeless to expect that great nations will sovereignty in favour of a super State. Some day they will, because some day international civilization will rest on the 3ame kind of basis as does domestic civilization -Some day there will be a community of nations in which order is as much taken for granted as it is in a community of people in one country. At the moment all this seems a long way off than a slightly enlarged form of isolaIn the meantime, it is, I believe, a good thing to find a realistic view being taken of the situation. That view is that, if States are to retain their sovereignty, they must look for collective security in their association and co-operation in one military plan. The same idea that the super State has, at any rate, been postponed is implicit in another passage in the Prime Minister's speech, which readsThe world organization must have a combined naval, military and air staff to prepare plans and to co-ordinate action. That does not involve a super-State navy, army and air force; it implies that those nations which are co-operating shall have their own navy, army and air force and that there shall be co-ordination of action among them through their chiefs of staff in order to keep the world's peace. I find in aU that something good. The truth, I believe, is that power politics, Ur. Menzies. which have been rather contemptuously treated by some debatovs, must now be given a collective quality by an alliance not on lines which are based on mere self-interest to preserve or gain territory, but on lines which represent a real consensus of thought among peace-loving times, have enough strength to keep the peace. The picture of the future, as I see it in my mind, is .that we shall not ignore the conception of and the necessity for power; we shall not rest our faith upon mere paper covenants, and we shall refuse to revert to alliances based upon territorial conceptions. ""We shall endeavour fo get out of the comradeship of mighty races in this war a permanent association in peace and the maintenance, for their common purposes, of such power that there will be no room left for war by revengeful and defeated enemies. I mention now the reference i 1 1 the Prime Minister's statement to abandon their regionalism. Regionalism is a word which has been freely discussed, particularly in Australia where we have, as we can plainly see, certain special regional interests. I am sure that the Prime Minister will forgive me if I say that even that word is by no means free of ambiguity. It is open to the view that it may involve nothing more tionalisma collective form of isolationalism, if I may use a curious phrasein which two or three smallish nations may act together instead of one acting by itself, if they think they have common regional interests. Of course, we have our own regional interests in Australia. There is a regional interest which may involve agreement by Australia with New Zealand and the Netherlands East Indies, which are in our particular zone. If a three-cornered agreement between those countries were reached, it might be imagined that they had arranged for co-operation in peace in that quarter of the world, and that therefore they had finished with the problem of peace and war. If we were to form such an opinion we should make a very great mistake because the truth about our own country is that we have three types of responsibility. Our problem, internationally, is in 3ome way more vexed than that of .some of the greater powers. Our three types of responsibility include first, xesDonsibility to our immediate neighbours', secondly, and broadly, our Pacific responsibility which involves our position in relation to the American countries and to 'China and Japan; and, thirdly, world responsibility, which I hope we shall desire to recognize, to -be directly associated with the European area and the great European powers and inevitably with peace and Avar in Europe. These three responsibilities, and the problems involved therein, must be kept constantly before us. sponsibility-to the Empire. presently. I emphasize, however, that we must keep in mind the three types of responsibility that I have outlined I do not need to elaborate them at the moment, but I say that in respect of each of them we shall need to have policies. We shall also need constant information upon them. This is necessary if we are to reach a satisfactory position. I consider the Netherlands East Indies to be among our first regional responsibilities, I venture to say that we are a little disposed too hastily to leave out of the picture the Netherlands East Indies. I know that this is not done, at any time, deliberately; but I take the opportunity to say that I believe that to us, in Australia, the Netherlands East Indies are of profound future importance on two counts: The first is because, in this war, the people of the Netherlands have encountered the full blast of German armaments and are amongst the people who must be liberated by victory, but not only that. They have contributed to world councils some very remarkable men. I have been impressed by few people in the last few years more than I have been by some of the leading Netherlands representatives whom I have met in this country and on the other side of the world. The second count is because the Netherlands East Indies themselves represent not only a military and political barrier reef to north-west Australia but also, in the future trading of the world, they present great possibilities of friendly association and mutual development. I would never exclude them from even die smallest picture of the responsibilities and interests of Australia. I include them in my first regional responsibility and do not leave them to be picked up in the general total of Pacific responsibilities. Of course, all of these things involve rights and responsibilities. [Extension of time granted.'] One thing we shall need to keep in mind in Australia is that, when we talk, as I am sure most of us would talk on this topic, of the necessity for the maintenance, after this war, of alliances between the -Great Powers as the nucleus, or the backbone of a league of nations, and of real sanctions behind any new covenant of a league of nations, we shall have to face up to the fact of the need for the maintenance of military power to prevent a recrudescence of aggression. There will be obligations resting upon us to maintain our share of such military power. We, in Australia, must not contemplate ever going back to a position in which we are unarmed and unready-no t to wage war at a moment's notice, because that would involve retaining a burden of armaments -corresponding to those which we now bear, but to play our part in cooperation with our great Allies where ever action shall need to be taken to maintain peace. The last thing that I want to say is that many a good policy -and I believe that what I have been discussing is, in_ broad terms, good policy-ha s failed' in the past because of the attempt to go too far, too fast. I am not sure that the League of Nations did not try to run before it had learned to crawl. We, I believe, while maintaining our great ideals on these matters of world control and world organization, must never lose sight of the fact that, for us, the immediate 'world organization, the one that we now have, is the British Empire itself. A strong chain, which is to bind the world to peace, must have strong links, and for us the first and strongest link is the link with the British Empire, the link which joins us to all the other British countries of the world. I believe that after this war -a strong British Empire will be more than ever vital to Australia. I would",27,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency

133,Mr Menzies,"I shall come to thatlike to see an increasing contact and increasing discussion with other British countries, not only on 'the general principles of post-war security, not only on the great matters which it was the privilege of 'the Prime Minister( Mr believe that if we are thoughtful about Curtin) to discuss with other Prime Ministers in London, but also upon those relatively prosaic matters of trade and commerce which, after all, will have a great deal to do with our strength after the war, with our capacity to maintain military power and force, and with the capacity of the British Empire to resume its proper place in the comity of nations. British Empire there must ibe a strong Great Britain. I am not sure that we are not sometimes tempted to overlook that, to treat it as being something that is perhaps so obvious that it need not be reflected about. In this war, Great Britain has suffered, in the material sense, not only losses of man-powermercifully, up to this stage, as compared with the last .war, they have been relatively small; but it may suffer very great losses in the next few weeks or months of invasion in Europe-but of shipping, ,at which one can only guess, but which must have reduced its total mercantile marine to a fraction of what it was at the beginning of this war; and even at the beginning of the war it was 10,000,000 tons less than it was at the beginning of the previous war. It has also suffered a very great wiping out of its overseas investments, which brought to it so much of its imports, and consequently were responsible for so much of its local standard of living. If Great Britain, as the centre of the British Empire, is to be one of those great forces of power for peace after the war, it must be able to restore the standard of living of its people; and in order to restore that standard of living it must, after this war, be able to export to the world more than it has ever exported previously. Although, in the short run, this perhaps presents a. relatively simple problem, because for some years after this war Europe itself will present an unrivalled market for the disposal of the products of other countries, in the long run the raising of the standard of living and the maintenance of the strength of Mr Menzies. Great Britain will depend, just as it will in our own case, upon its capacity and our capacity to maintain a growing volume of exports to the rest of the world. If that is to be done, then 1 this matter, as I am sure we shall be, we shall come right up against the fact that the raising of the standard of living and the purchasing capacity of great countries like India and China will be of direct domestic concern to us in Australia. I believe that it will appear more and more to be true that the standard of living After all, for a strong of an Indian coolie has a great deal to do with the standard of living of a factory operative at Footscray, in Victoria; because I am at a loss to understand how, without that increased capacity to buy on the part of those great Asiatic people, without real conscious help by us in the development of those countries, all the nations of the world which are longestablished will be able to maintain the standard of living of their own people by selling their goods to the rest of the world. SoI venture to hope that, before also a loss this war ends, there may be not only an Imperial Conference of Prime Ministers, but also an Imperial Conferencewhether or not it be called one-of accredited representatives on both the government plane and the business plane -the production plane. I should like to see an Imperial Conference at which the voices of the Australian farmer and the Australian manufacturer will be directly heard in the discussion of these mutual problems; because I believe that, if we are to be restored as an Empire in a restored world, then our first collaboration must be within our own family of nations. 'General principles on those matters-and general principles are. after all, all that can be hammered out hy busy Prime Ministers at a limited meeting-althoug h essential, will not be enough. The closest detailed work will need to be done. I profoundly hope that the Government will not consider that it will expose itself to any sensible criticism in this country if it multiplies and multiplies the number of people who are sent out of this country or who are received into this country for the purposes of such discussions. It will be work worth, doing, and vital work for us, .because it may be of supreme value in keeping the peace after this war has been won. I am glad indeed of the opportunity which this debate affords to direct the attention of the House to two or three issues which I consider are of great importance to this country. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has said many things with which I thoroughly agree-wit h none more than with his statement on the need to consolidate the British Empire after this war has come to an end. The Prime Minister( Mr during the last twelve months. But I Curtin) has been gracious enough to pay a tribute to what has been done by Great Britain in the present struggle. He has told us also of the appreciation overseas of what we have done. That is all to the good. I am rather inclined, however, to the view ihat, during the four years of war, we as a people have not fully appreciated how much Great Britain has meant to us in this struggle. My mind goes back to the time when the war broke out, and we were so unprepared in the sense that in common with all other democracies we had cast aside the handicrafts of war. Great Britain was in exactly the same condition. We were plunged into a war which brought disaster upon disaster to our. arms. I have a keen remembrance of the time when France went out of the war and of the intervening period until Germany struck at Russia. At that critical time our between ourselves and the heart of the Mother Country alone was the bulwark of democracy. When the fight extended to these regions by the entry of Japan into the war, there were times when harsh things were said because of the failure of Great Britain to help us more; but it must now be clear to every one that it was utterly impossible for Great Britain to render us any considerable direct assistance at, that time although its indirect contribution was far reaching. Therefore, I was glad to hear the tribute paid by the Prime Minister to the people of Great Britain. Much blood will be shed, and great sacrifices will be made by the people of Great Britain before this war is over. Britain will emerge from the war covered with glory but very much weakened. For five years the British people have borne the stress of conflict very close to their shores. The strength of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the post-war period will depend very largely upon the degree of cooperation which can be achieved between its components. The Prime Minister told us that he had placed before the other Prime Ministers his views upon the need for closer collaboration. I applaud his approach to the subject, and Australians generally will applaud the distinctly British and patriotic views which the Prime Minister has expressed, especially regret that he did not press his views to the point of achieving some measure of agreement among Dominion Prime Ministers, instead of just contenting himself with answering objections, and leaving the matter there. However, I have no doubt that a further opportunity will present itself for discussing these matters. I am strongly of the belief that upon closer collaboration between Empire countries depends the safety, not only of this counr try, but of the world itself. If we cannot achieve co-operation and understanding between nations with a common language and a common historical background of a thousand years, how are we'to achieve it between nations which differ in language, temperament and history? Therefore, I urge the need for establishing ever-closer ties between the various sections of the Empire, and particularly Empire. I welcome this debate particularly because it affords me an opportunity to express some opinions upon foreign policy. It was said by the Prime Minister, and it is acknowledged by us all, that peace is indivisible. If war breaks out in Europe we are, in the end, drawn into the vortex, as has happened twice in a period of 25 years. In the hearts of most men and women to-day, particularly young people and the parents of young children, is an earnest desire that when this war comes to an end peace shall be assured if not indefinitely then at least for a reasonable period. This is a matter to which every man and women of goodwill should give attention. It is above politics, because it",29,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency

For my part, I do not believe that the abundant life will necessarily make for peace. That is the easy assumption, but I believe that there exist influences much deeper which touch the life and destinies of nations, important as economic considerations, are. It seems to me that, as this war progresses and draws closer to its conclusion, we are becoming apt to think of it in altogether too simple terms. When I see totalitarian systems of government practically throughout the whole world-ou r own as well as those of our enemies, because we have been largely compelled to imitate our enemy in order to defeat them-whe n I note the tendency of people to submit easily to regimentation, when I note the influences at work in the conquered countries' of Europe, I may be pardoned, perhaps, for entertaining some misgivings regarding the future of the world After the war, Ave shall be confronted Lt will not be easy to evolve a formula for peace.

Last October, the Minister for External. not be allowed to wither once the war is Affairs (Dr. Evatt) made a speech setting out the foreign policy of the Government in regard to the Pacific and the world generally. Without any desire to offer carping criticism, I must say that it seemed to me that there was uncertainty as to whether we should rest our hopes of peace upon the setting up of some form of collective machinery on the lines of the League of Nations, or whether peace was to be guaranteed by the Great Powers. It seemed as if the Government had built two houses, but would not indicate in which it intended to dwell. Even if we were endowed with the wisdom of Solomon it would, be impossible to advance more than tentative views on these matters, but I am concerned with what appears to be the absence of Australia's representatives from the planning committees which are now laying ilr'.

Small though our contribution to the total plan may be, I believe that we should the Pacific, and formulating a statement regarding what we believe should be the general principles necessary for the preservation of the peace of the world. I am not aware that there is any such planning committee in thb country. I am not aware that we have any direct, or even indirect, association with tlie planning committees now working overseas, other than that we may be informed by cable from time to time of their activities. We should lose no time in working out the principles of an enduring peace, and discussing the matter in this Parliament, so that, when the war is over and our representatives sit at the peace table, no ad hoc decisions may be made. Those who have studied the proceedings of the peace conference after the 1914-18 Avar know that important decisions affecting the lives of many people and, indeed, in some instances closely affecting ourselves, were undoubtedly ad hoc decisions. with great problems.

There is no doubt that if we are looking for large numbers of immigrants, we must turn to Central Europe and to areas on the north and north-. eastern coasts of the Mediterranean. From those areas alone can we obtain any really large influx of adult migrants. Some weeks ago I wrote a letter to the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde), then Acting Prime Minister, on this subject. fruitful field for obtaining immigrants in the post-war period will be among the orphans of devastated Europe. Countless thousands of young children in Europe have been left without parents as the result of this war. I believe we could induce a large portion of them to come to Australia if we planned properly to attract them immediately after the war. I can think of no better immigrants than those young children, whose minds will still be in the formative period. Indeed, some of them oould be taken from the country even of our enemies, brought to Australia, and educated to be fine Australians. We could be responsible for them until they attained manhood and womanhood.. Buti f we envisage such a project, we must begin to plan now, and we must plan on the basis of hundreds of thousands, not merely tens of thousands. We must train special types of people who will go to Europe immediately the opportunity presents itself for the purpose of selecting these young children, and we must also establish the necessary organization for absorbing them here. Australia has been most fortunate to survive this war. opportunity of attracting to this country a. large body of migrants. I realize the existence of fear that when adult migrants are brought to Australia, an unemployment problem is created, but I believe that the greater the number of people here, the greater will be the prosperity of this country. Undoubtedly, its security will be increased. Before this debate concludes, the Government should indicate to the Parliament the plans, if any, that it has devised for attracting to Australia the immigrants that I have in mind. I know that one committee has been dealing with immigration from Great Britain, but I am not aware that its deliberations have extended beyond that. realizes the necessity for attracting population. He is aware of the limited number of areas from which Australia can get population quickly. The ideal type of immigrant would be young persons who could be trained quickly to be good AusI n my opinion the most tralians. Therefore, I hope that some consideration will be given to my suggestion. If we are to attract people to this country, we must give them every opportunity to become Australians. In the past, what have we done? By our own attitude we have forced them into camps of their own. We invited them to settle in Australia, and allowed them to enter this country. We encouraged them to become naturalized Australian citizens. Our first objective should have been to weld them into our Australian way o r life. Unfortunately, we did nothing of the kind. We regarded them as races apart. We spoke of them as "" dagoes "", "" pommies "" and "" J ews "". Always they remained "" foreigners "". That attitude must be broken down. We must realize that suitable immigrants will confer upon Australia great benefits in respect of both security and culture. But those migrants must be blended into our own race. This cannot be achieved until there is evidenced a change of heart on the part of our people. Before[ conclude, I desire to refer briefly to China. To-day, and for four Never again may we have the years past, that country has been fighting onour side. For seven years, indeed, it has fought with very little equipment, but with great bravery and stoic patience and endurance, against a tremendously powerful foe. None of us here would hesitate to express tremendous respect and appreciation for the way in which China has achieved all it has. Because China still fights on, it has removed a great deal of the pressure thatotherwise could have been exerted in this area.

I believe in the ""White Australia policy"", but I do not consider that it should be so inelastic as to prevent men and women from China from studying at our universities, or certain approved types of merchants from coming here to carry on trade. In the past, we have rather closed those avenues. MT. WILSON -What about British Indians? them. The important fact that we must keep in mind is that we cannot speak in terms of collective security or in terms of goodwill to other nations if we do not understand them, their country, their culture and. their problems. These we can understand only by an interchange of people. The Minister for China in Australia has made the position clear. China does not ask for the admission into this country of coolie labour, or even of a large number of people. What the Chinese Government has sought to achieve is the admission, for limited purposes, of a limited number of people possessing special qualifications. That would be a wise modification or confession of policy to make to the Chinese nation which has fought so gallantly for the cause that is ours. I. have been glad of the opportunity provided by this debate to direct attention to but a few points which have suggested themselves to me. It is quite impossible in a brief speech to do more than touch upon a few of the important matters put bnforp us by the Prime Minister. There is the final observation that I desire to make. Vital issues are arising in this country, and this Parliament must reassert itself on them. Eor too long we havrbeen prepared, as members of the Parliament with great rpsponsibilities imposed upon us in such times as these, to surrender most of our judgment to the Executive. I say to the Prime Minister that opportunity must be given frequently to the members of the Parliament to r-xpress thcinselvps on important publicissues. I hope that in this debate more, than one honourable member will rise' and; deal with matters .which transcend' domestic importance, such as how we arete secure the peace of this country and; preserve it for our children. We have before us questions of the utmost national importance. I intend to utilize my time to direct attention to matters which I think should be stressed at this juncture. I believe that there is general disappointment' on both sides, of the House at the inadequacy of the Primo Minister's statement. Th-3 right honourable gentleman has been abroad at a time when great events are taking place. It may almost be said that we are at the end of one world era and at the beginning of another. No doubt,, during the conversations that the Prime Minister had with Empire leaders and with President Roosevelt, he discussed not only .the carrying on of the war to the victorious stages which we are now approaching, but also post-war matters, which are of paramount significance to this country. One would have imagined that on his return the Prime Minister would have told a Story that would have ' hit the headlines"" and { that he would have stirred not only the members of this House but also the general community. However, I found his statement singularly barren. It may almost ibe said that it could have been prepared by any honourable member of the chamber who had studied the press reports of recent weeks and months. Although the right honourable gentleman referred to some of the big questions which the Parliament will have to face in the next few months, he made only pass-, ing allusions to them. I appreciate the difficulties of the position in which ha found himself. Some of the questions of world importance which the Prime Minister( Mr Ourtin) discussed abroad are, perhaps, only at the exploratory stage: but I consider that he could have given us much more information than hp has given us on these subjects, which are of world-shaping significance. It was a matter of bewilderment to many of us that although gigantic forces were actually poised in Great Britain for the carrying out of the invasion of",35,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency
145,Mr Spendeb,The same applies to,36,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency
146,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [5.21],".France, the right honourable gentleman should have seen fit to hurry back to Australia before the beginning of that great event. A few weeks' delay in his return to this country would not have mattered if, by remaining behind, be could have stood upon the shores of France with Mr Churchill and Field Marshal Smuts. Had he done so his action would have caused widespread interest in this country and he would have added greatly to his stature. 1 shall not have time to deal at length with many of the points raised in the right honourable gentleman's speech. I have no doubt that one of the main reasons why the Prime Minister went abroad was to discuss Australia's future role as a fighting force in the war. We are citizens of a country of vast distances. We have tremendous problems, which do not confront most other countries because they arc created mainly by the size of this continent. . We have a role to fill as a fighting force in the war, and we also have responsibilities in relation to the provision of food for the fighting forces of Great Britain and the Allied Nations. It was therefore to be assumed that the Prime Minister discussed these questions while he was abroad. subject of the utilization of the man-power of this country in relation to the fighting services and food production is of the greatest importance. We expected the Prime Minister to say something about the agreement that was reached as to the strength of fighting forces which Australia would be expected to provide in tlie concluding stages of the war; but we have heard only the vaguest generalities. I have repeatedly asked in this House whether the Government intends that the 6tli, 7th and 9th Divisions of the Australian Imperial Force, which have already borne the brunt of the active fighting by Australian troops, are to be kept in the field, seeing that there, are thousands of young men throughout Australia who consider that they are doing very little as combatant troops. Many oi"" our young men are thoroughly sick of being kept in training establishments. They feel that they arc doing no useful work on 'the home front, and that their services are hot being employed as they Could be infighting divisions. This state of mind of many thousands of ouiyoung men in the fighting services is having a seriously demoralizing effect. Our young men expected that they would be incorporated in new fighting divisions, but that has not occurred. We heard over the air from a Sydney radio station to-day that many young Australians wished to serve with the Australian Imperial Force, but had been prevented from doing so. It is time that the Government clarified the position in this regard. We wish to know a great deal more than we have been told about the utilization of our manpower in the fighting forces, and we are entitled to a definite statement from the Government as to the approximate number of divisions to be employed. Are we to assume that the three old divisions which have done the bulk of the fighting for Australia since the war began are to be kept in active service until the war ends? Unfortunately, in this country, we have not as good a military record as we had in the last war. The military record of New Zealand far surpasses that of Australia. This is a matter of concern to the relatives of the The whole men in the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions. Mf.

I ask the Prime Minister whether in the talks he had overseas he has always visualized those three divisions, which have done the bulk of fighting, being kept in the field until the conclusion of hostilities. What is the Government doing to settle the man-power position in Australia? Does the Prime Minister realize that some units in the Army have not been used at all in the fighting? I believe that in the women's auxiliary services tliere are many young women who have practically nothing to do. In common with other honourable members, I have relatives in those services.

Doubtless, the matter of Empire collaboration occupied a considerable time at the discussions that were held in London. The Prime Minister has said that some of bis views were not acceptable to the representatives of the other Dominions. 1 have no doubt that the views of those Dominions in regard to the estabEurope, even in the Baltic countries, lishment of a permanent form of secretariat after the war, were influenced largely by their populations. The population of Australia and New Zealand is almost entirely British. Canada has a racial problem, bceause of the FrenchCanadians and other nationals in its population. South Africa also has a racial problem of no small magnitude. Undeniably, Mr Mackenzie King had at the back of his mind the population content of Canada. Anything' which would seem to deny to Canada, even in a visionary way, complete freedom in Empire matters, would not be acceptable to Canadians as a whole. No doubt, that was the predominant factor in the difference of opinion which arose between the Prime Minister of Australia and tbe Prime Minister of Canada. Possibly, with the passage of the years, as we receive population from other countries, we may have to take cognisance of a population content which will be different from that of to-day, and that problem may affect our views in our future relations, or in our conception of an Imperial set-up after the war. It can be said that, over the years, the degree of consiiltation we have had has proved eminently satisfactory, and that actually there can be little dous importance. We are justified in complaint about the present position. I wish to express a view that I have ment regarding them. Before the Governheld for some time, in regard to the ment makes decisions, an opportunity attitude of the British Parliament to the should be given to honourable members to Dominions. For many years Imperial debate them in this Parliament, so that conferences have been held from time to the Government may learn the opinions of time, and always the Dominion Prime honourable members on this side of the Ministers have travelled to London to take House. part in them. There appears to be a feeling in London that when any matter of government propaganda. Until recently Imperial importance has to be discussed, propaganda has, in democratic countries, London is the place in which to discuss always taken a place much subordinate it. There is a failure to realize the real to the activities of other government deimportance of the Dominions. I trust partments. It has been the rule for the that in future such conferences will be Government in power to employ a held sometimes in the Dominions, and that, future Prime Ministers of Great Britain will devote a great deal of their time to dominion affairs. I hope that the time will come when no British Prime Minister will consider his duty fulfilled until he has made a comprehensive tour of the Dominions. During my trip abroad, 1 had occasion to note that a great deal of British capital was being invested in although twice within a period of 30 years all such investments have been lost through war. The point should be stressed that, in the interests of the Empire and of Great Britain itself, British capital should be concentrated more and more in the Dominions. The Prime Minister has told us that he expressed the opinion that Imperial conferences should sometimes be held in the Dominions, and I hope that this view will prevail. The Dominions are not known in England as they should be, and I hope the Prime Minister pointed out that after the war the Dominions would welcome a greater share of British investments, rather than that the money should be invested on the continent of Europe. We have now reached a new stage in Empire building. As the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) pointed out, the future of world civilization is largely dependent upon the strength of the British Empire, and this strength must be steadily increased, not only in the centre, but also in all parts of the Empire. The Prime Minister mentioned, among other things, migration, civil aviation, and food control-all matters of tremenseeking to learn the views of the GovernI desire now to refer to the matter of publicity officer, but if additional publicity is required, the money to pay for it has been provided by some outside organization. In other words, payment for party publicity from public funds has hitherto been unknown in this country. With the Ti.se of totalitarian regimes in various countries, propaganda assumed tremendous importance. We know the importance attached to propaganda by Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin. By all three vast sums of money were -ypent to further the interests of those in power. RecentlyI have come to the conclusion that this Government has learned something from totalitarian governments, and that a similar form of propaganda is creeping in here at the expense of democracy. We have witnessed the unashamed use by the Government of the Public Service, of radio, a nd of the press, for purely political ends, [fc is well that the people should be informed of these things, and of the direction in which we are moving. A referendum, is to be held on proposals to clothe the Commonwealth Parliament with increased post-war powers-. Those powers have nothing to do with the waging of the war. All the power necessary for that is. already in the hands of this Parliament by virtue of the NationalSecurity Act. The Government entered into an agreement with the newspaper proprietors to buy space at cut rates for advertising matters associated with the war effort. That space is now to be used, still at cut rates, for advertising the Government's referendum proposals. the same privilege? beginning of the war the newspapers were asked, as their contribution to the war effort, to provide space at cut rates for government, advertising. The Government has now stipulated to the newspapers, the big dailies as well as the country iprees, that the reduced rates must apply to advertising of the Government's referendum campaign, which has nothing whatever to do with the war effort and concerns only the postwar period. sisted upon that? so. of the sort. able member get his information from? from different newspaper executives. newspapers. for Information knows that as well as I do. question. a charge.

202,Mr Hutchinson,"I do not knowcan deny my statements. That public servants should criticize leaders of political "" knockers"" and so forth is something entirely new in Australia's history. [Eodension of time granted.] These matters involve principles of tremendous importance. If this sort of thing is to go on and if government departments and government money are to be spent shamelessly for party purposes, who can say where we shall end? This Government asks for additional powers after the war. This is the Government which, in the forefront of its proposals to be voted on at the referendum, places repatriation, for which no increase of power is necessary, because this Parliament has always possessed powers of repatriation. That is camouflage designed to delude the people. The real purpose of the Government is to get control of every one, so that the worker and the boss shall be completely in subjection and liable to be of Commerce and Agriculture, who made shifted at the will of the government of the day to wherever that government thinks they should be shifted, fn order to achieve that power this Government is going to spend money taken from the people by taxation. That is something under which we cannot sit down quietly. It must be made widely known because the expenditure of the people's money on party political purposes is something which violates the tenets of democracy. If the Government is, by means of specious advertising, to get power to carry out its purposes we shall enter a new stage in the history of our democracy, and I am afraid that what we shall then have will not be democracy but something else. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8.15 p.m. taught by the "" sawdust"" Caesars of Europe in the realm of propaganda and in the exploitation of the public purse for party purposes have been thoroughly learned by this Government. Honourable members will agree that I am not in the habit of making irresponsible statements in this House or elsewhere. The newspapers have a special reduced rate for Commonwealth advertising matter relating to the war effort. Whilst the Commonwealth Government will take advantage of that concessional rate to advertise "" Yes '"" propaganda, people who are sponsoring parties and call them and supporting "" No"" propaganda and who do not want to be enslaved by any government in the post-war period will be obliged to pay the full advertising rates. In addition, people who in the past have been used for the purpose of advertising various war-time activities, such as Commonwealth loans, are to be employed to support the "" Yes"" case throughout the country. This pilfering of the public purse is something new to this country, and is outrageous. This Government, is engaging in practices that will undeniably undermine our conception of democracy. Public servants are being used under this new tyranny to expound the political principles of the Government now in office. I direct attention to the extraordinary behaviour of Mr Murphy, the administrative head of the Department an attack on one of the political leaders in this House. is not fair for the honourable member to attack a public servant. is a very efficient public servant.

There should be no pilfering from the public purse for advertising or other purposes in the interests of a "" Yes"" vote. It is deplorable to take full cognizance of the whole able that this country should be torn in twain by a referendum at a time like this. We heard the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) say in the House this afternoon, that about 30,000 Australians are prisoners of war. Of course, they will not be able to take an interest in this fight. They will not be able to devote attention to post-war programmes in their own country. in the determination of tlie referendum. They will not be able to discuss the pros and cons of the case with the members of their families. They will not be able 1 to play any part in this matter. But should they not have a hand in the development of their country? Should they not have a say in its future programme? Thousands more Australian soldiers are to-day scattered on battlefields in the islands of the Pacific and elsewhere. We do not know whether their votes are being taken. The Minister for the Army was asked point-blank this afternoon whether the votes of these men were being taken and the question was evaded. orable member did not ask whether the never intended that the slightest aspersion vote was being taken. the question at all.

If it is defeated on elective convention should be held at some future date, in calmer days, when proper consideration can be given to the necessity for an alteration of the Constitution. Under such conditions the people will be state of affairs in the post-war world and have greater knowledge of the vital problems of development, which await Australia.

The whole case was .seriously distorted and I wish to clarify the position. During the last few weeks several mothers of large families have asked me to' do something"" to remedy the tragic circumstances in which they find themselves. One of the mothers has seven children-tw o boys, aged fourteen and fifteen years respectively, and five smaller children. Her husband is away with the forces, and she has asked me to intercede with the Army authorities to see whether her husband can be discharged in ordsr to help her with the rearing of her family. I was casting no aspersions whatever on that mother. Eivo oisixsimilar cases have been brought to my notice in the last two or three weeks and I . have referred them should be cast' on the mothers concerned.

233,Dr. Gaha (Denison) [8.21],"the appeals of tlie mothers of large families. The first two speeches we heard this afternoon in this debate were of a high standard. It is gratifying to know that ^ome members of Parliament regard their duties with sufficient seriousness to dis'-uss subjects of international importance as they should be discussed. The considerations which the honourable members concerned have placed before us were worthy of our attention. At the same time, I have the feeling that old clothes have been taken to the cleaners and that it will not be long before they are again shabby. I remember, from my reading of Greek history, that a good deal was -<aid in other days about the forming of blocs. When the enemies of the Roman Empire were challenging the supremacy of the Romans, one individual repeatedly drew attention to the need to destroy the enemies of Rome. I consider that if too much attention is given to the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) we may again suffer disillusionment. dangerous for us to allow ourselves to be lulled into a sense of false security. Twice in the last 25 years the great British Empire has been caught napping :iud has been saved only by a miracle. It may be helpful to the House to recall the history of the Empire and of the world during this century. honourable members can cast their minds back to 1899 when their fathers went to war and fought until 1902. During that time, nearly 500,000 people were killed, and I do not know now what it was all about. After 1902, we had twelve years of comparative progress, but in 1914 we were at war again for the purpose, so we were told, of making the world safe for democracy. After the war ended we found we had succeeded only in making the world safe for depression. We fought for four years, and during that time, according to a statement in a volume written by Riehet, which is to be found in the Library, about 17,000,000 people were killed directly and indirectly as the result of the war. After 1918, we had a period of comparative peace until 1939 when, once again, we found ourselves at war in the defence of democratic rights. Or. Qaha. Thus, within 45 years the community has been engaged in three major wars. Unless we are prepared to alter completely our ways of living and to forego any effort to dress up old ideals in new clothes there can be no assurance that we shall not again find ourselves engaged in a major war. Taking a long-range view, and remembering the scientific achievements of the nation, which are being used for purposes of war, it may happen that if another war occurs. 70,000,000 and not 17,000,000 people will die. I have previously in this chamber referred to our disastrous population trends and have adduced figures to show that the enormous decline of the birth-rate in the western world may mean that, if another war occurs, we shall not have sufficient man-power to maintain a political system of any kind whatsoever. I say therefore that our experiences of tbe last 45 years, with their devastating effect upon human welfare, force us to the conclusion that the necessities of It will be extremely peace transcend every other consideration. Every single one of us owes it to ourselves and to the nation to try to establish a formula for peace. Such a formula must be found. If it be not found I consider that the children born to-day will not see the end of the twentieth century. That may seem a wild statement, but in the past great Most powers have been completely destroyed by internecine strife, and it may happen that the nations of to-day will destroy themselves. Because of war and its ultimate effect upon the population, we are in grave danger of wiping ourselves out. We have to find the formula for peace. An old Roman named Oato, when lie found that Carthage constituted the greatest thorn in the side of Rome, finished every speech with the declaration, Cathago delenda est. Not many years elapsed before Carthage was lying in ruins. It is believed to have been a waHed city of 1,000,000 inhabitants, and entitled VHomme Stupide, we are not certain to-day of where the foundations of that once great city are. We have to adopt a somewhat similar principle to-day. Every one has to finish a speech with the declaration, "" The formula for peace must be found "". That transcends every other consideration; it makes every other consideration before this Parliament pale into insignificance. No man can justify sending into battle and sacrificing the lives of the young men of this country on account of the political, economic and social fallacies and failures of ourselves and the people of our generation. We have to take a look at ourselves. We spend too much time in finding out what is wrong with our neighbour. mirror ? like other men. Let him who is without sin cast the first stone. I have frankly admitted that I am one who has miserably failed. My egotistical friend is not capable of such an admission, ibecause he cannot comprehend it. I am perfectly sincere when I say that the formula of the present day is the equivalent of the. League of Nations dressed in new clothes. On this occasion, the idea is to have power behind the League of Nations. Those who advocate it are forgetful of the fact rhat one of the most competent nations which the world has ever seen-Russi a -ha s a political ideology that is different from anything that is to be found in the western world. The attempt is being made to gear that political system to another. That will not work, because iu no particular does the one resemble the other. Without preparedness to stand up to change, we shall be engaged in another conflict within the next 25 years, and we might as well begin immediately to make preparations for -the military training of the children who are being born to-day. There is no other solution of the problem. We have had three wars in the last 45 years. If we merely dress up the old order in a new auit of clothes, why should we not have another three wars in the next 45 years? of the honourable member? know the solution.

What facilities has this country ever offered for adult education? There is the profit-making newspaper, but nothing else. If we earnestly desire to do justly by the country in the future, we have to make it clear and unmistakable that the formula for peace must be found, irrespective of who may be hurt in the process. That is essential to the safety of the western world and, 3 believe, of the entire world. If an honourable member of this House had said six years ago that a war would take place in the jungles of New Guinea, he would have been hounded down as a lunatic; yet in actual fact, that has happened. So we have to find a formula for peace, irrespective of where it comes from or how it comes into being. I say emphatically that it is not to be found in an amalgamation of the resources of Great Britain, the United States of America and Russia, with their enormous powers, because at the first conflict of ideologies they would break apart, as similar groups have separated throughout history. in persons who sit comfortably on air cushions. able member that there is a hard way of",45,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency

Upon my return to this country, when I endeavoured to -loll the people what I had seen I was hounded and blackguarded for having even gone there.

Dr. G AHA -.Can a .man be other than a. pessimist when he has seen three wars in 43 years, in the sacred name of this, that or the other? Could he be an optimist in the light of that experience i? We are offered a solution in the future which represents the continuation of an old order that has already failed a thousand times. There have been international jiacts, and group political systems since the dawn of history. Athens .and Sparta united against the Persians in the fourth century B.C. There have been politics in Europe from the beginning of time. In one of fhe most dastardly wars in history, France was invited to defend the Vatican, and with Austria fought outside Florence. Those two countries then fought one another, and the Italian armies beat both of them. If honourable members have no knowledge of the evolution .of mankind, T a.m sorry for their colossal ignorance. I have very little faith in the future. I know that the diseases of mankind are war on the one hand and declining population on the other. That is the disease of .the western world-, a.t all .events.

If I were bought like they are I would not know the difference, either; I would be blind, deaf and .dumb. Honourable members opposite want to coerce everybody, including the miners, but not in the post-war period. For after the war their attitude is, ""Let the boss direct the workers to go here, there and everywhere, but for goodness sake don't direct us"". Their excuse is that the boss is paying the workers, and therefore has a right to direct them, but if the Commonwealth pays the workers, the Commonwealth is not to have the right to direct them. the people to their death, but are allowing others who have stayed at home to let the soldiers 'down. to this man with the bovine intellect, saying that I directed them. Why, the whole of my speech to-night has been a confession regarding the things I have failed in. I have admitted the failure of three wars, and the fact that I have done nothing about them. NowI am watching another war, but I am making an appeal to prevent the possibility of more wars, and to ensure the introducargues tion of something like a decent new order. Some of us hold strong opinions on these matters. The time has passed when we. should be content to live in a world of dreams. Let us have freedom of utterance and of action. There are many people who feel that they have achieved when they have spoken, but it sometimes happens that generations come and go between utterance and achievement. Honourable members on both sides of the House are now agreed that somehere is an extraordinary thing: Seventeen years ago, the right honourable memthe honourable ber for Cowper (i Sir Earle Page), who in those days must have been fairly modern, brought in a Commonwealth Housing Bill. As far back as 1927 he saw the need for such a scheme. Seven years later, in 1934, the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), who was then Attorney-General of Victoria., said at a Constitution Convention that the most, urgent problem in Australia at that time was housing. Seven years went by between the first utterance by the right honourable member for Cowper and the second by the right honourable member for Kooyong, and no houses were built under the Commonwealth scheme. At that time. I was Director of PublicHealth, in Tasmania, and the housing shortage in Hobart was even more acute than it is now. In 1939, just before theoutbreak of war, the Commonwealth Government of the day knew that there was a housing shortage in Australia. It did not even have to get a bill through Parliament.

As he pointed out, the hope of the people is for security from war and the fear of war, and the removal of rhe need to prepare for war. These things, he said, were to be achieved by collaboration among the victorious nations. He raised great hope in our minds as to the progress of the war, and left us in no doubt as to the outcome. That is all very good, and the Prime Minister expressed sentiments which none of us will dispute; but I think it can still reasonably be said that, within rhe limits of a good speech, he left us entirely without a.n indication of the plans of the Government' to improve the previously existing state of the world. No Minister has risen to fill in the gaps, to add an explanation to the general outline. Well, let us take one of the most important points of the Prime Minister's speech, lie makes it quite clear that in his view -and with this we agree-the settlement of the peace and the raising of the standard of human life .and the security of nations against war lie largely in the -successful collaboration -of the victorious nations. Now, collaboration must be on a basis free of any prejudicing prior decisions. It would be beyond thought that Great Britain and the United States of America, which have such obvious common interests, existent and in prospect, should get together and reach an agreement as to where their interests lie, <eal that up in a treaty, and, at that point, go to the peace conference table and, sitting down with Russia, China and the other Allied nations say, "" Let us talk about the settlement of the peace"".

We have had the spectacle of the Australian-New Zealand Agreement concluded at a time when the future developments in the Pacific theatre are in the melting-pot. If we are to expect a fair discussion upon these subjects with our powerful friend, the United States of America, and if we expect the other Pacific nations to come along in good faith to discuss with us the settlement of the Pacific problems, surely they must expect us to come with free hands, untied, by contracts; but we have made a contract. We have bound ourselves, a? New Zealand has bound itself. Minister for Transport is one of the signatories to the Australian-New Zealand Agreement which is no doubt to so before Great Britain and the United Spates of America.

If it is proper for Australia and New Zealand to make a regional pact in this area, who is to say that it is improper for the Governments of Greece and Yugoslavia to make a regional pact in respect of the future of the Adriatic, or for any other two nations to make a prior pact? What sort of peace settlement can we have if the nations go to the peace conference with treaties, even secret treaties, already made? Whether it was ever properly within the Executive authority of the Government to make that agreement is a matter in dispute and upon the legality of the pact I would not express an opinion; but, conceding that the agreement was within the Government's authority, surely in these days, when we hear so much talk of the rights of the minorities, freedom of speech and opportunities for free expression, we should",50,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency

The Minister for Information makes more interjections than any other honourable member and very few ever contribute anything valuable to the debute. On this occasion he has said: "" We will tell you about these things after the 19th August"". That is the date of the referendum and the conviction 1 had derived from the processes of this Government, is proved to be correct by the interjection of the Minister for Information. The omissions from the Prime Minister's speech were more notable than the pronouncements contained in his statement. By a process of deduction, I conclude that the Government was either unwilling or unable to explain its policy for the industrial reconby the Government resolved itself into struction of Australia and the employment of ex-servicemen and persons who have been engaged in war industries. Eitheri t was not sure that it would possess after the war the constitutional authority to "" direct"" as it enjoys in war-time, or it did not care to take the Australian people into its confidence and tell them its intentions, for fear of the consequences on the 19th August. Information concedes that it is true that none of these things has been explained. He has said that "" after the 19th August we will let you know"". That will be after the yoke has been placed upon the neck of the Australian people. Let me refer to impending events. The Prime Minister has already indicated that one of the decisions reached during his mission abroad was that a substantial additional number of men shall be released from the Australian Army for reasons related to the war. That release must be made in accordance with a certain [s.1 policy. The Government has announced that civil and military authorities will confer for the purpose of devising a suitable policy. knows all the details. the details, but I agree that it is the obvious and proper course to take. There is one principle that ought to have been superimposed upon all others in regard to the impending release of troops. At the outbreak of war, hundreds of thousands of young men came clamouring as volunteers to serve in any part of the world in the defence of their country and the cause which we had espoused. When they enlisted, they were eighteen or nineteen years of age. For nearly five years they have been in uniform and have fought on many battlefields. The Government announced that 20,000 men were released from the Army during the last twelve months. Those releases were made in accordance with a policy based upon occupations and industry. But that policy debarred one class of servicementhe early volunteer-fro m entitlement to release. Consequently, the policy adopted one of "" last in, first out"" unless a man's health broke down in the meantime. ment acted upon the advice of its military advisers. Does the honourable member suggest that the Government should have overridden that advice? announced its intention to release 20,000 men' from an army numbering some hundreds of thousands of men. I believe that there could have been superimposed upon the other considerations of policy a provision which would have paid humane regard to the years of service rendered by the class of young men to whom I referred. They fought in Greece and Libya, and upon returning to Australia they were despatched to New Guinea. The Government should have adopted a humane policy, which would have conceded that those men had done their share and that, if any men were to be released from the Army, they should be entitled to consideration.

However, I do not wish to haggle about the past. ""We are now on the eve of a review of that policy, and on behalf of the Australian Country party I put it to the Government as strongly as I am able that, in the revising of policy, these young men who have survived the perils of war for nearly five years should bo given the option of returning to civil life. of that policy resulted in too few men being released for rural industries. The honourable member would then complain that the Government had not released a sufficient number. entitled to express his own views, but he is not entitled to attribute views to me. What is the policy of the Government regarding our export industries in the later stages of the war and in the postwar period? The Atlantic Charter and the mutual aid agreements carry implications of tremendous consequences to the exporting industries of Australia. Surely the Government has something to say to those basic industries of the Australian economy! But not a word has been uttered to reveal to the primary producers the intentions of the Government, for the purpose of enabling them to set their house in order. What are to be the implications after the war of the mutual aid agreements and the Atlantic Charter upon our secondary industries which have sprung up under hot-house conditions during the war? These are grave matters, and one reacts upon the other. If the Atlantic Charter is to function in certain directions in anything like a literal sense, it is doubtful whether Some of our secondary industries will be able to continue. What has the Government to tell these industries? If Australian manufacturing industries now in existence are to be employed to full capacity in the post-war period, how shall we maintain our export markets for primary products in countries from which, in the circumstances, Ave shall not purchase anything? is preaching the policy of free trade. preaching any policy. I am posing to the Government, if the Minister had the intelligence and interest to follow me, certain questions that are crying aloud fcr decision. No substitute for an answer to these questions Avill be found in any wisecracking from Ministers. These are serious questions which affect the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of Australians. The Government should devote serious attention to them. What is to be the future in Australia of civil aviation? If the Government intends to transform civil aviation Avholly or in part, into a governmental activity, it is within its authority to make such a decision. I do not intend to predict the Government's decision. But I do contend that it is high time for the Government to break its silence and to give us some indication of its, intentions. {Extension of time granted.'] If its silence on these numerous and tremendously important subjects is to be explained by the interjection of the Minister for Information that Ave shall be told about them after the 19th August, it is a most reprehensible attitude. If the Minister is not correct, I hope that a responsible Minister will explain the attitude of the Government. I could put many questions to Ministers.

The tactics of the Government in the conduct of its referendum propaganda provide us with every justification for drawing sinister conclusions.

292,Mr Mcewen,"We are used to interadministration of previous governments, not one word is said on that point. This evening the honourable memher for Denison (Dr. Gaha) said: "" If , six years ago, any one had suggested that there would be fighting in New Guinea, he would have been regarded as a lunatic "". Six years ago a government led by the Menzies) was in office and I was supporting it. The leader of that Government introduced a bill to amend the Defence Act to bring New Guinea within the ambit of the act to provide against the possibility of any fighting occurring there. The present Prime Minister( Mr for and against an alteration of the ConOurtin) and all of his present supporters who were then in Parliament, used their voices and votes to try to prevent the passage of the bill. In spite of that fact, and the free expression of opinion, howthis newcomer member for Denison had the temerity to make the statement to which I have referred, and the present Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) has stated in the pamphlet on repatriation that the Government is seeking a clear mandate from the Australian forces. When the Government in office at the time when war broke out wanted to send an expeditionary force abroad, the proposal was resisted by the present Prime Minister. If he and his followers had had their way there would have been no Australian Imperial Force and no Australian contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. Yet these honourable gentlemen have the audacity, to-day, to use public funds to print and distribute pamphlets asking the Australian forces to give them a mandate. These actions are typical of highly improper conduct of this Government for which there is no precedent. Public funds, public servants and public instrumentalities have never previously been used in this way. Yet this Government, clothed with all the power of a war time period, is using all the resources at its command to further its own party political campaign. mate in the interests of the nation. tion of the framers of the Constitution of Nazi-ism.

[Further extension of time granted.'} The framers of the Constitution, and also our early legislators, intended that any statements stitution should be submitted to the people in equal terms even to the counting of the number of words. Freedom ever, can never be set down in purely legal terms. The principles of democracy, the rights of minorities, and the true essence of freedom of expression, are not to be found in written words, but in the hearts of men. There has never been a more reprehensible abrogation of the principles of democracy or a more wretched violation of the principles of free expression than that of which this Government is. guilty, for it is using all the resources at its command to put before the Australian people an entirely class-conscious and party political view in respect to the referendum. If this Government considers that certain principles which hitherto have seldom been challenged, and are inherent in the British parliamentary system, should continue to exist, then it should bring to an immediate end the pernicious practices in which it is at present engaged. Although this may seem an extravagant statement to make, I consider I am justified in saying that the technique which is now being employed by this Government brought to supreme authority the Nazi party in Germany.

I do not predict that we are in sight of that in Australia, but this Government has started to tread that course. It is of no use to ridicule the statements that have been made in this House to-day concerning the danger of the surrender of freedom of expression. The Government should show that there is still some fair play to be found in government circles in this country. I say to the Government that there is deeply ingrained in the hearts of the people of Australia an instinct for fair play. They will realize that these practices are not in accord with the traditional Australian conception of fair play, that what is all right in Germany is not all right in Australia. I hope that before the conclusion of this sessional period we shall have a clear statement of the intentions of the Government in respect of many of these matters, regarding which its most notable contribution so far has been its silence. I certainly expect a cessation of the electioneering practices which to-day are being employed in connection with the referendum. [9.46] I do not wish to traverse ground that has already been covered, or to deal with ancient history, but I do want to make a few observations concerning the paucity of the matters that we have been invited to consider during this week. Actually, these consist only of what is involved in a review of the war. ""We have learned nothing new from any statement which the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) has made since his return to Australia. There is, of course, the implication that in the future this country, in common with other countries, will have to accept responsibilities in relation to defence which in the past it has not been prepared to shoulder. That, in itself, is rather pleasing, coming as it does from the Government, in view of the opposition of the Labour party only a few years ago when an endeavour was made to increase the defence forces of this country. The Prime Minister, in his wisdom, did not elaborate on the subject, and I noticed that when he spoke on it his remarks were received in stony silence. The public is being told that immediately the war terminates 800,000 service men and women will be released info civil occupations. The implication to which I have referred would destroy that assumption. Does any honourable member opposite believe that if the war finished to-morrow Australia would not continue to have a standing Army, to carry on with its Air Force, or to extend its Navy? We have been taught a lesson by what has befallen those nations which in the past desired peace so greatly that they made no endeavour to protect themselves. They found, to their cost, that the desire for peace is not sufficient to ensure peace. The history of the people of Denmark, Holland, and other industrious nations, is sufficient to warn the people of Australia that this country can be held for British-speaking people in the future only by the efforts of those who inhabit it. It may not be popular to say that compulsory military training will have to continue after the war, or that there will have to be industrial conscription such as has been found so necessary during the war. I was amused at the reply of the honourable member for (Corangamite) Denison (Dr. Gaha) to an interjection by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) concerning those who absented themselves from work at the present time while others were facing death and destruction on their behalf. If it be fair to impose military and industrial conscription upon 1,500,000 people in this country, it is just as fair to impose it on those who are engaged in an industry which is providing the lifeblood of the war industries of this country to-day. posed on a fraction of that number; the majority of them are volunteers. Even the workers in the Civil Constructional Corps are volunteers. able proportion of them. Hundreds of thousands of men who were engaged in one-man businesses were railed up. Their businesses were closed, their goodwill disappeared, and they were sent far afield, away from their homes and families. That is industrial conscription.",56,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency

Until compulsory military service was introduced, very great difficulty was experienced in providing the number of men required for the forces which Australia was raising. Every honourable member opposite knows that.' The forthcoming referendum has been mentioned in the Speech of the Governor General.

It was not because of lack of sympathy on behalf of governments that soldiers were not able to carry on.

That report, stated that the Government took over the mines on the 1st May, 1942, and that, up to the 30th November, 1943, it had expended on them £368,939, for a return of £29,127. In actual fact, the production decreased to about one in six, compared with what had been produced formerly under private enterprise by the men who had been engaged in the industry. Does the Minister for Information consider that private enterprise would carry on for that length of time, and lose the colossal sum of £330,000 in eighteen months, without taking steps to arrest the leakage? The statement that I have made will be found at page 81, in section 128, of the report of the Auditor-General. The report also stated that the value of stock on hand could not be ascertained, owing to the absence of satisfactory records.

This is very interesting, having regard to the fact that no previous Government in Australia ever did so much to make big business bigger as this one has. There was never another Government that pushed so many small men out of business, and pushed them out forever. The big businesses have been able to take over the small ones without paying a penny for their goodwill, yet the Government says that it is out to deal with combines and monopolies. Perhaps the Government, having in mind its policy of socialization, thinks that it will be easier to deal with a few big businesses than a great number of small ones, and for that reason is encouraging the extinction of small businesses. ing the "" No "" cause. arc financing the "" Yes"" cause.

To replace those sheep to-day they would have to pay 35 per cent, or 40 per cent, more than the amount for which they were insured. If , before the end of June, they fail to purchase sheep, even though their fences are not up yet, the amount which they received in insurance will be counted as income for taxation purposes. In pre-war times, this might not be important, but to-day, when tax rates are so high, the effect will be that men who, before the fire, were practically independent, will be set back to the extent of £2,000 or perhaps £3,000, unless the Treasurer can make some concession to them. charged as income, or only a part of it? man who had entered the natural increase of his flock at 10s. a head.

A junk sale had been arranged for the purpose of raising funds for the Red Cross, the idea being that everybody was to give a piece of junk and buy a piece. No sooner did the Deputy Prices Commissioner in Adelaide hear of this than he served a notice on the branch requiring it to supply seven days before tbe date of I said. "" Tbat is the sale-whic h is next Saturdaya complete list, of everything which it is proposed to sell, so that he may fix the maximum prices. It is a great pity that Gilbert and Sullivan died so soon. I was told of a few of the things that were given for sale. 'Some one gave a goose, some one else gave a little pig, some oiie else a wireless battery, and some one else a pair of rubber boots. To my mind it is getting down to a pretty low Ipvel when functions of this sort cannot take place without the intervention of the Prices Commissioner. It is time that the Government told that gentleman to attend to things that really matter. Where matters affecting the Red Cross arise, let us remember that, on the statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) himself, 30,000 Australian men and some Australian women are languishing in prison camps, we know not where or under what conditions. Shylock's ghost would be ashamed of the conduct of the Deputy Prices Commissioner in South Australia in demanding to fix pri'ces for the sale of goods on behalf of the Red Cross. Tbat is all 1 have to say on this subject to-night. L hope to hear something from the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) about it in the near future. I hope also that something in the nature of common sense, moderation and decency will be imported into the Government's administration. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [10.17]. has to do with the decision of the High Court reached on the 3rd July last, and it is of far-reaching importance to Tasmanian producers. It was a decision that tbe owners of Tasmanian blue peas compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth under National Security Regulations, were entitled to the full market",60,Mayit Pleask Your Excellency

337,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"value of those peas at the time of acquipecuniary value of the peas acquired hy sition. William Edley Peterson, of Westbury, Tasmania, farmer, and Stenhouse and Company, of Devonport, Tasmania, produce .merchants, claimed compensation from the Commonwealth The Commonwealth had refused to pay more than 15s. a bushel for the peas; but in this case the claimants held out and refused that offer on the grounds that the true market value at the time of acquisition was from £1 ls. to £1 2s. 6d. a bushel. There were many growers not in a financial position to hold out in the same way, and it is in their 'behalf that I speak to-night. It is quite possible that they have no les:ul that it is quite probable that those people claim against the Commonwealth, but they have a moral claim, and in support of that claim, I should like to emphasize some of the remarks of His Honour Mr Justice Starke in making his decision. pensation meant the value or equivalent of the property acquired or taken so that the owner would be in as good a position as he would have occupied if his property had not been taken. Usually the market value of a commodity was the standard or measure whereby the value of the pecuniary equivalent of the commodity could be ascertained, but there might be cases in which the market quotation would afford no true criterion of the value, for instance, if the market had been "" rigged "" or "" cornered There might also be cases in which therr was no market and therefore no value. In such eases, the court would resort to other methods of determining values. In His Honour's opinion the cases presented no difficulty, for the market value of field or blue peas, A grade, on or about the 29th January, 1942, the date of acquisition, was about £1 2s. 6d. f.o.b. at the main ports of Tasmania. Peterson claimed £1 2s. a bushel f.o.r. Launceston, giving credit, however, for the cost of transport to Launceston from his farm, or, in all, £2,659 ls. 9d. This sum works out 'at about £1 2s. 6d. f.o.b. TasGuinea Gold had published the story, mania. Stenhouse and Company claimed £1 2s. 6d. a bushel, or £1,239. Now, the Commonwealth contended that 15s. a bushel was a fair and just price on the Dame Enid Lyons. This was a case in which it. The market value' on the 2Sth January, 1942, was the result, it was said by the Commonwealth, of speculative anticipation and activity. That value was not, in the opinion of His Honor, Government. fhe result of speculative activity, but of war conditions and a largely increased demand thereby occasioned. But war inevitably affected the value of commodities, and indeed was usually an element entering into the value of any commodity in demand, and, even if the market value were the result of speculation, still the market was free, and the plaintiffs were entitled to sell in that market and obtain the prices ruling. I have said already whose . property was acquired on that occasion and who were not in a nnancial position to withhold, have no legal claim against the Government; but I urge upon the Government that in this case there is His Honour said that coma, moral claim, because the difference between the ruling price and the price at which acquisition was made represents 25 per cent, of confiscated income. The other matter to which I desire to refer concerns myself, and it is in connection with a story whicli I believe is still current in New Guinea to the effect that I am alleged to have made the statement that no soldier in New Guinea s-hould be allowed home on leave lest he should bring malaria into Australia. That story is a diabolical lie. I have never ou any occasion made any statement whatever in connection with leave of soldiers, or of the danger of malaria in Australia. The statement which I am alleged to have made. I regard as medically ridiculous and inhumanly cruel. I regret that that story continues to be circulated without its origin being traceable. As soon as I heard it and on every subsequent occasion I communicated with the person who made the statement and asked him to find the paper in which it was published, and on no occasion did I get a satisfactory response. I was told that but I was assured by the editor that that was not so. Others have said that it might have been published in this or that paper, but it has never been traced. 1 myself had a son in New Guinea for eighteen months, and a son-in-law for twelve months. The statement from that point alone is perfectly ridiculous; but in any case I hope that any soldier or civilian who knows any paper which published such a statement will communicate with me immediately so that I may be ;ible to take appropriate action. port the remarks made by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) about blue peas. It will be remembered that recently the High Court declared that where the Government compulsorily acquired a commodity compensation should be paid on a fair and just basis, calculated on the ruling market price, 'fhe Government urged the farmers to grow blue peas, and the farmers patriotically heeded the appeal and increased their acreage by 27 per cent, in 1943, and in the last season it has been further increased. The Government acquired the whole blue pea crop of 1942, and, although tbe (ruling rate was 22s. 6d. a bushel, paid only 15s. Worse than that, the Prices Commissioner recommended the payment of 10s. a bushel for firstgrade blue peas, and only as the result of a deputation from Tasmanian members did he recommend that the price be altered to 15s. a bushel. As the honourable member for Darwin has said, many growers were not in a sufficiently strong financial position to refuse the price of 15s. a bushel, which they accepted under protest, nor were they .strong enough, financially to take the matter to court, 'fhe Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) will remember how continually Tasmanian members made representations to him, and to the House generally, with a view to justice being done to these growers, but our requests fell on deaf ears. Yet because Mr W. E. Peterson, of Westbury, and Stenhouse and Company, of Devonport, went to the High Court and obtained an award of 22s. 6d. a bushel, they were able to get 7s. 6d. a bushel more than was paid to the other growers whose peas were compulsorily acquired. The honourable member for Darwin has referred to the legal position. There is no doubt as to the legal position of Mr Peterson and of Stenhouse and Company, but what about the unfortunate growers who were not financially strong enough to take the matter to court? As the honourable member has pointed out, they have at least a strong, moral claim, and I urge the Government to do justice to them and to see that they receive the same consideration as those who were able to bake the matter to court. I cannot conceive that the Government would be so unjust as to pay 22s. 6d. a bushel to those who could go to court and only 15s. a bushel to those wbo were unable to do so. ister) [10.2S] -in reply-The Government is most anxious to do what is just. The facts of the matter, apart from the law, are that the Prices Commissionei 1 fixed a price for these peas, and that that price will stand as between any sections of the trading community who bought and sold them.; but, when the Government acquires anything, the person whose property has been acquired is empowered under the Constitution to set his own valuation upon it, if he thinks proper, and then appeal to a court. it, but did not have sufficient financial strength to go to court. with what has been said by either the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) or the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Guy). WhatI have to decide is whether the judge who, sitting alone, fixed the price at 22s. 6d. a bushel on the evidence, was in every way the final authority, having regard to the fact that the Prices Commissioner fixed a substantially lower price. I am having that matter considered. There are two points to bear in mind. The. Prices Commissioner may have made as bad valuation. If that be the case, those; whose peas have been acquired by the"" Government at that price have been unjustly dealt with, and something should be done in connection with their moral claim. On the other hand, I say with great respect, the judge sitting alone may have made a bad decision. The department is considering whether an appeal",61,Soldiers I Wish To Raise Two Matters The First

341,Mr Curtin,"I have no quarrelshould be taken against the decision of thejudge, because, as the matter presents itself to me, the Prices Commissioner does, I think, bring an absolutely impartial mind to the examination of the facts. On the evidence available to him he fixes what he thinks is a fair and reasonable price. The judge also held an inquiry, and he has advanced certain reasons for his finding. This is not merely a question of law. I am as anxious to do justice to everybody concerned as are the honourable members who have raised this matter. The Government is responsible for the wise use of the revenues of the Commonwealth. It ought not to pay an excessive price for anything, and, having before us two prices that were circulated:have been impartially assessed, one by the Prices 'Commissioner and the other by the judge, I am endeavouring to ascertain whether the matter should remain where it is.
