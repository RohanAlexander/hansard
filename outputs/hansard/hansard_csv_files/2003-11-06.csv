Thursday, 6 November 2003 ----Humphries, Ben and Beryl: Life Membership of the Australian Labor Party lian Labor Party will be awarded to Ben and Beryl Humphries. Ben and Beryl have been members of the Australian Labor Party since 1960-that is 43 years. Ben began as a mechanic; that was his trade. He became a garage proprietor before going on to become-known fondly and affectionately as ‘the bushman’s friend’-a hawker of bushman’s gear to rural properties across rural Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. He first stood for the Labor Party in 1975, an action of itself demonstrating some considerable courage given the political circumstances at the time. He lost. He recontested in 1977, won and remained the continuing member for Griffith until 1996, which is 19 years in the seat and makes him the longest serving member for Griffith, having won seven consecutive elections in what was always a difficult seat for the Australian Labor Party. Between 1987 and 1993 he was appointed Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, and between 1992 and 1993 he was the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia and a member of the cabinet. Ben’s particular attachment to the veterans’ affairs portfolio, of which he was most proud, came from the fact that he was a son of a TPI veteran from World War II-his father, Ernie Humphries, having been injured during the war-and that his mum, Elsie Humphries, had served on the woman’s auxiliary of the Colmslie RSL for many years. He is also the most famous graduate of the Bulimba State School. Ben met and married his wife, Beryl, in the 1960s. Her father, Jack Dixon, was in fact president of the bus and tramways union at the time and an active member of the Australian Labor Party. When Beryl won Ben’s heart it was her father, Jack, who first introduced him to the Australian Labor Party, through which he became a member. At that time, Ben was one of the few small business people to have entered the Australian Labor Party as a member before rising to become a member of parliament and then a member of the ministry and the cabinet. One of the local pieces of history associated with the Humphries’s engagement with the politics of the southern and eastern suburbs of Brisbane is that Beryl’s father, Jack, was the booth captain of the Hawthorn booth of the Australian Labor Party for many decades. This tradition has been inherited now by Beryl, who will soon also retire from this function before handing it in turn to her daughter, Sharon, to become booth captain for the Hawthorn booth of the ALP. Their children-Sharon, Judy, Brenda, Ben and Jason-are all members of the Australian Labor Party. Sharon has been a member of the Brisbane City Council as a councillor for these last 10 years and is currently chairperson of the finance committee of the $1.6 billion Brisbane City Council. I owe a lot to Ben and Beryl Humphries for their friendship, their encouragement and their inspiration. Ben Humphries was a first-class member of parliament, a first class minister and a first-class member of the cabinet.

184,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (9.40 A.m.),"On9 November 2003, life membership of the AustraEnvironment: Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.43 a.m.)-As we speak a series of meetings in Hobart are drawing to a close. This concerns the meetings of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. The secretariat is in fact in Hobart, and today there are some 24 nationsmember states-dealing with some of the most critical issues concerning the protection of ecosystems in the southern oceans around Antarctica. In particular, they are looking at how to curb illegal and unregulated fishing-not only of the patagonian toothfish; we also need to keep a close eye on the ice fish and the krill that are so easily able to be exploited. charged with establishing ways to better preserve, conserve and sustain the whole of the ecosystems that are so vulnerable in the southern oceans. The Australian Antarctic Division are of course leading the delegation and are doing fine work in trying to establish three critical new strategies to deal with any illegal and unregulated fishing. The first is to enhance the vessel monitoring scheme through a centralised data process. At the moment, vessels simply register where they are by sending their location data back to their flagged state. With a centralised vessel monitoring scheme, the secretariat in Hobart would receive this data in a confidential way, and that would make it much harder for illegals to get away with what they do. The second is to improve the catch documentation scheme through an electronic process. That has received support but it looks like it will require another year of piloting, or trialling, to ensure all nations are happy with the way that might work. The third is a ships of shame list, or black list, where known illegal operators are put onto a list that all members have access to. This means that, when a vessel is seen, they are more able to identify exactly who it is and where it is from. In that way, ports which receive these illegal vessels filled with the patagonian toothfish will very quickly be able to establish whether these ships should be closely inspected. This is a very important way in which we might progress faster the curbing of what is an extraordinary criminal network. At the end of these two weeks of very close and mostly highly cooperative conversations between the nations, we will have made progress on the centralised vessel monitoring scheme and the ships of shame list. I want to commend Indonesia for being, for the first time, an official observer at CCAMLR, because they have been used as one of the ports of call for these illegal fishers when they come to offload or transfer their illegal cargo. We commend Indonesia for taking part in trying to help preserve the ecosystems of the southern oceans. They are also increasingly interested in cooperative research with the Australian Antarctic Division down on the ice. I also particularly want to commend the Australian Antarctic Division for again putting in an enormous amount of work to make CCAMLR a key agent for ecosystem protection.

It does not publish flight paths for the parallel runway, and there was no mention of essential noise amelioration measures to protect nearby suburbs. Sadly, the airport corporation has decided to hide this master plan from the public. There are no plans for community mailouts, no plans for public meetings, no plans for community engagement. The airport corporation is deliberately keeping the public in the dark. In the Senate recently, Senator Santoro rose to his feet to justify the fact that these plans are being deliberately hidden from the local community. If members of the community are to comment on this 2003 master plan, logic would dictate that they are able to see the document. But this is much more difficult than you might think, and any local trying to get their hands on the document would have to be a skilled as Indiana Jones and as cunning as Lara Croft from Tomb Raider to get access to it. The master plan, for example, is not on the BAC’s web site. Indeed, there is very little mention of it on the web site. The search function does not list the master plan as a topic; there is one mention of the term ‘master plan’ in the community contact page, but the link does not work. The ‘have your say’ button leads to a questionnaire on duty-free goods. Nowhere on the web site does it tell you where complete copies of the plan can be obtained, and after trawling through the site the executive summary can be found under the corporate centre-but not the full plan. This seems to be the only way you can find an executive summary. This executive summary, as I have said before, has not been distributed to the wider community either by a mail-out or through public meetings. The only way I, as a member of the public, can see the information I want from the draft master plan is to obtain a copy of the executive summary. But, as I have said, that is difficult to access, and for those people who do not have access to the Internet it is almost impossible. So what does getting your hands on the executive summary do for you? It does very little. The executive summary says: Should you wish to make a submission, you should view the full 2003 Master Plan-Draft for Public Comment version and reference your comments to that document and NOT this abridged version. The problem is: where can they get the full document? The executive summary says: if you want the full document, you have to buy it. You have to buy it for $75. The point is that the consultation process is defective and is being hidden from the local community.

Since the tabling of that report it has been interesting to see the response from around Australia, which ranges from people who welcome the report through to those people, in some of the state governments and state government agencies, who have dismissed the report already. To that second group of people who are making those comments, I say that they should be extremely cautious. I would like to read from my foreword in the report where I said: Most of the evidence presented came from citizens who rolled up their sleeves and physically fought the fires. The volunteer fire fighters. The landholders. People at the fire front. We also heard from many retired people who had years of firefighting experience with various state agencies behind them.

Other people like Robert Maguire, Susan Mitchell, Ian Litchfield, James Litchfield, Bev Allen, Michael Green, Sid Walters, Neil Waddell, Terry Hart and John Snell also provided valuable understanding and experience of the circumstances surrounding Kosciuszko and other national park areas.

(Time expired) Kropp, Mr Allan a service was conducted to remember the wonderful life of Allan Kropp, who died last Thursday having lived a very full life to 91 years of age. Allan was a life member of the Australian Labor Party. He was a life member of the RSL, and was one of the few to have received the 50-year membership award from the RSL. He was a very active worker on behalf of a range of community organisations, having spent decades tirelessly working for Legacy, the Milne Bay association, his beloved RSL and his beloved Australian Labor Party. His life virtually spans the history of our nation. Throughout the greater part of the 20th century, Allan’s involvement in the Australian Labor Party and his involvement in the services of Australia-and subsequently the Returned Services League-made an enormous contribution to the people around him. He will be sorely missed in many places. His characteristic, trademark red beanie, often seen as he strolled around Ashgrove, will be missed. The badge he wore everywhere which said ‘recycled teenager’ will be missed. In his 80s he was one of the people who would go to hospitals to look after the young blokes who were war veterans. He would often comment as he was going out to the old repat hospital, or subsequently to the various hospitals where returned service men and women were in care, about how he was going to look after the young blokes who had come back from the war-virtually all of them were 10, 15 or 20 years younger than him, and he thought nothing of it.

Allan worked for Meals on Wheels for many years, delivering food to people 20 years younger than him, and thought nothing of it. He was a person who contributed an enormous amount to our community in so many facets. He leaves a loving family, he leaves a very large group of warm friends from particularly the broader service community and the Australian Labor Party, whom he gave so much to, whom he worked so tirelessly for and whom he loved dearly. Allan was a great human being who made a great contribution. Employment social requirements for families and individuals. That is why this government has put so much effort into ensuring a healthy economic environment for businesses to prosper in. Businesses provide jobs. It is a simple concept. When I was elected in 1996, unemployment in Gilmore was 17 per cent. Over the last year it has averaged between 6.1 per cent and 6.3 per cent. Contrast this with Labor electorates to the north of Gilmore, which have levels of around 10 per cent. I am proud to stand by our achievements of tackling unemployment head on and I am keen to share some thoughts on how it is done. We work incredibly hard to attract industry to our area. We have not done this by talking to unions, analysts and academics. We do not call endless summits and set arbitrary targets, keeping in mind that these are the suggestions put forward by Labor. We work directly with businesses. I am proud to say that I have come from a background of small business. Since the age of 15, I have been working on the shop floor, driving the taxi cabs, managing the tourism effort and running a guest house. I have experienced how hard it is to make a dollar and how difficult it is to get and keep quality, qualified staff. It is an experience that prepares you for taking on the task of helping to ease unemployment, and it is challenging all the way but so worthwhile. These are some of the principles I work by and have promoted in seeing Gilmore employment grow. Businesses need trained people who understand who and what they are working for. Employees need at least some product knowledge, and to gain it involves an investment by the employees as well as by the business. Flexibility in the work force encourages job growth. Sets of rules formed by external bodies, unions and commissions do not flow directly from actual business experience. They become barriers to servicing clients and taking on new staff. Basic education that has allowed employees to be able to read and add up has been a priority for this government. Our own Bomaderry Primary School has recently won a literacy and numeracy national award as an indication of the increased awareness of this need. Be true to effective philosophies for business growth. This government prefers to see business equipped to do work with job seekers, rather than the government working with them directly. Businesses need to be encouraged to provide jobs and training opportunities, and that is occurring through a variety of programs. The old ‘us and them’ mentality of industrial relations belongs to times gone by. It ignores the modern reality of functioning, interdependent teams. Collect advice from experts who understand where job opportunities are, and take industry and management on familiarisation tours to see the opportunities for themselves. Meet not for the sake of meeting but to understand what the needs of business are. Regular roundtable discussions with CEOs and local, state and federal representatives identify the shortages and concerns and provide opportunities to talk through policy changes.

AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003 Cognate bill: AGE DISCRIMINATION (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2003 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 November, on motion by Mr Williams: That this bill be now read a second time. That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to ensure that federal age discrimination legislation contains the best standards of protection of older Australians, a failure which is consistent with its neglect of the human rights of all Australians, as evidenced by its introduction of legislation to weaken the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other actions to wind back protections for Australian citizens”. Ms KING (Ballarat) (9.59 a.m.)-I rise to speak on the Age Discrimination Bill 2003. The bill seeks to eliminate as far as possible discrimination against persons on the grounds of age in the areas of work; education; access to premises; the provision of goods, services, facilities and accommodation; the disposal of land; the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and requests for information. The government has now, after quite some months, brought the bill onto the parliamentary agenda. There does seem to be some bitter irony to this bill. It is occurring now that there is a push to retain older people in the work force, but many of these people are the same people who not so long ago were subject to large-scale retrenchments within both the public and private sectors. Many found themselves being retrenched before they wanted to leave work, and many faced dismal prospects for regaining work. A proposal for the Age Discrimination Bill has been on the table since 1992. The then Keating government established an age discrimination task force to examine age discrimination and identify options for action, including more comprehensive legislation. This was supported in 1999 by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission being charged with developing a discussion paper on age discrimination. That paper, called Age matters, reported that age is a major barrier to the employment of mature and older workers. The government has now, somewhat belatedly, recognised age discrimination as a legitimate issue. This bill is somewhat of a departure from the government’s usual attitude to issues of discrimination and human rights legislation. The government’s attitude towards the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has, in the most recent past, seen the government seek to downgrade its powers, fail to appoint commissioners and cut its budget. It seems for the government that, now the issue of age discrimination has some political currency, some MAIN COMMITTEE",123,Ccamlr Is Unusual In One Sense It Is Not A Fishing Management Agency But Rather Is

190,Upon Which Mr Mcclelland Moved By Way Of Amendment:,"issues of discrimination are actually worth legislating against. It is a pity that discrimination on the basis of racial vilification and discrimination against women breastfeeding-and, perhaps, a little more compassion for asylum seekers-have not warranted the same government concern. The concept of age discrimination is not new. State and territory law has for some time included discrimination based on age as being unlawful through antidiscrimination and equal opportunity laws. But there is some inconsistency between state and territory laws, and a person’s right for protection from age discrimination can be highly dependent upon where they live and who they actually work for. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has had the power since 1990 to inquire into and attempt to conciliate complaints alleging age discrimination in employment and occupation. However, unlike complaints made under the Racial Discrimination Act, Sex Discrimination Act and Disability Discrimination Act, complaints of age discrimination do not give rise to any enforceable legal right or remedy. The only remedy available to the commission is to report to the Attorney-General for tabling in parliament. The commission has done so on a number of occasions in relation to age discrimination, particularly in relation to compulsory retrenchment. The issue of age discrimination is an important one. It is not news to anyone that Australia is an ageing society. Declining fertility rates, decreasing death rates and decreasing levels of immigration are all contributing factors. One of the things that annoys me most about the debate on the ageing population in Australia-and the Treasurer’s Intergenerational Report fell into this category as well-is that we rarely focus on or discuss the positive aspects of ageing within our society. We constantly refer to the tax burden and the possibility that the proportion of workers contributing to the revenue base will be outweighed by the proportion no longer paying tax and relying on government services. We rarely talk about the need for a dramatic shift in our perceptions of ageing and the contributions made by an ageing population, both through continuation in the paid work force and through voluntary work and community participation. Many older workers are returning to the work force after periods of retirement and are establishing small businesses and employing people themselves. Many older people are involved in training and mentoring young people into work, and many older people are establishing community organisations that are actively involved in policy development, service provision, fundraising and a range of other activities at the local, state and national levels. Continued active participation, through either work or unpaid voluntary labour, continues older people’s connection to the community and, whilst I have not studied the empirical evidence, I think it keeps older people healthier and alive for a much longer period. The environment of work has changed dramatically over the past decade. Government policy has deliberately concentrated on the individual and their relationship with their employer, rather than on the notion of a collective of workers. This has produced an environment in which individuals, regardless of their bargaining power, have had to be far more self-reliant in finding work, negotiating their working conditions and relying on their own savings in retirement. This has unavoidable consequences. One of these-the ability of workers to negotiate when barriers such as age discrimination occur-is largely dependent upon socioeconomic status, literacy and understanding of and capacity to understand what remedies are available. MAIN COMMITTEE However, age is a pretty strong equaliser. Regardless of the fact that some of us try to hold it back, we all get older. Legislating against age discrimination is a good way of protecting many of us against what currently happens. The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee, as quoted in the HREOC Age matters discussion paper, stated in 1995: A common stereotype of older workers is that they are less productive in the workplace. Employers believe that an older worker may bring attributes such as maturity and experience to the job. However, they say that ‘these attributes are offset by older workers’ perceived lack of enthusiasm and drive’ and by employers’ belief that ‘older workers are difficult to retrain’. It is these sorts of perceptions that hold people back from getting work as they age. However, it does not just hold them back from getting work. It also means that they can be discriminated against in the workplace if they are already employed. This legislation attempts to address that. ABS statistics show that almost two-thirds of unemployed job seekers aged over 55 report that the most difficult problem they face in finding work is being considered too old by employers. The same experience is also reported by more than one-third of unemployed job seekers aged 45 to 54 years. Many older job seekers have simply given up looking for work in the belief that employers will consider them too old for the job. Many do not appear in unemployment statistics. Currently, my electorate of Ballarat consists of a population of over 100,000, with 34.7 per cent of those over the age of 45. Within this age group, and particularly within the over-55 age group, there is an unacceptable rate of unemployment. At the other end of the scale, local figures show that the unemployment rate of young people aged 15 to 19 years is around 23 per cent-and they are local figures, not ABS figures. This has devastating impacts, both on the individual and on the community. In many cases, retrenchment has caused the high number of mature age unemployed in my electorate. The Ballarat community in particular has suffered with the closure of the railway workshops. Many of our manufacturing jobs were lost due to international competition and tariff lowering. We have problems, in particular, with the textile, clothing and footwear industries, which employ around 400 people in my electorate. The Thai free trade agreement is going to have a significant impact on those workers, particularly if the government chooses to reduce tariffs for TCF industries. That will have a major impact, particularly on mature age employment in my district. Many mature age workers are unable to find work after being retrenched. Often they need retraining in other areas. That ultimately results in competing with younger applicants for jobs. Failure and rejection in job seeking has devastating implications. For mature age people, it is often their first experience of being unemployed and seeking work after 25 to 30 years of employment. It can impact in particular on an individual’s psychological well-being, family and overall general health. This in turn has overall effects on the community and can also place a large financial burden on revenue. The reasons for unemployment amongst 15to 19-year-olds is more complex: job availability, difficulty linking young people to traineeships and apprenticeships, truancy and early school withdrawal, inadequate support for education programs in the early years, assistance for parents, generational unemployment-the list goes on. This legislation can in some ways MAIN COMMITTEE help prevent discrimination on the basis of age and hopefully remove one possible barrier to mature age workers seeking work and young people gaining employment. However, it is always difficult to legislate in an area which essentially requires a change in attitude. There are a number of inadequacies in this bill and Labor has moved amendments that seek to address some of those inadequacies. The first is the issue of relatives and associates. The possibility of a provision covering discrimination on the basis of the age of a person’s relative or associate was raised in the government’s information paper but has not been included in this bill. It is not difficult to see where this sort of discrimination may arise. An older worker who cares for an aged relative may experience discrimination by an employer because of a concern or an apprehension that the employee may be off work for a long period of time. Another example might be a hotel discriminating against parents with young children by refusing to allow them to stay as guests because of an apprehension that the children will be unruly. I think there are currently examples of discrimination against relatives and associates which could be included in the provisions of this bill if the government so chooses. The second problem in the bill is that discrimination on the basis of age must be the dominant reason for the complaint. This is much tougher than the approach by the states and territories to age discrimination. There are many forms of discrimination in the workplace; to argue over what reason is dominant in each case could prove to be a costly and time-consuming exercise-making it difficult for complaints to succeed and inviting further litigation. In addition, this criterion was removed from the Racial Discrimination Act on the basis of it being impracticable to apply. The third problem with the bill is harassment. As with the relative and associate provision, the government has not included age based harassment in the bill, although the issue was raised in the original information paper. Age based harassment is an issue that is difficult to legislate against but, in my view, it is a significant community problem. We see it all the time. We see young people complaining about being moved on from shopping centres and other areas-on the basis of their age, as opposed to any behaviour that they are engaged in. I have heard that this has happened in my local community on some occasions. I have a delightful story: I remember standing at a set of traffic lights, and an older woman crossing the road was being harassed by some younger people, who were tooting their horns and pushing her to hurry up and cross the road. She handled it beautifully by turning around to them and saying, ‘Do you think I am travelling this slowly because I choose to?’ I think that is a great way to handle harassment, but sometimes harassment goes much further. Age based harassment really does need to be included in this bill. The Age Discrimination Bill 2003 contains no cap for damages that can be awarded under this legislation, leaving it open for generously remunerated executives to file age discrimination suits for thousands, perhaps even millions, of dollars. That is certainly not the intent of this legislation but it is a possibility under it. The bill also fails to mention any protection against discrimination for the volunteer or unpaid worker. Older Australians represent the majority of people in voluntary work at the moment, and we are desperately trying to encourage younger people into that area as well. In Australia, we have an ageing population and it is increasingly difficult to attract people into voluntary work because of their being engaged in paid work and having less time. Certainly discrimination on the basis of age in voluntary and MAIN COMMITTEE unpaid work should be included in this bill. Already we are seeing problems with aged volunteer workers not being able to participate in their communities due to organisations being unable to secure public liability insurance. Sometimes the reason given is the number of older people working as volunteers within those community organisations and the possible injuries that they may sustain in undertaking voluntary activity. SoI think it is important that we look at what the barriers are to participation in voluntary activity and also what protections there should be for older people who are participating in those activities. Labor have amendments to this bill. I, like others, support the content and the principles of this bill, because age discrimination is happening within the work force and it is proving to be a barrier for many older workers-as well as many younger people-trying to get work. Our amendments go directly to the issues around relatives and associates and also look at the dominant reasons for discrimination. Also, broadening the bill that we have before us to apply to situations of harassment would be an important enhancement. So far, the debate in relation to age discrimination seems to have been somewhat overly focused on retirement age corporate executives-mostly men. If we are going to have a decent debate about what to do about ageing in our society, we need to make sure that we do not discriminate and we need to ensure that people are able to participate in the work force and retire when they choose to retire. That time should be when they have been able to get their savings in order and plan for their retirement, rather than them being forced out of the work force, as we have seen in many cases-particularly in my electorate as manufacturing industries have closed. I think that we need to not just focus the debate on mostly male corporate executives. Certainly, some of the media reports and even some of the Prime Minister’s own statements have been overly focused on this group. Women in particular, as they get older, face strong barriers to not only staying in the work force but also regaining employment. It is very important that we understand that there is a whole range of mature age unemployed people-the very people that we are now saying should be staying in work longer-who experienced massive retrenchments through both the eighties and the nineties under both governments’ policies. I also think that the government must lead by example. It claims that these bills will urge businesses to employ older workers. You could ask what has happened about that principle, as the government retrenched 4,000 Public Service employees over the age of 55 when it first came to office. I was working in the Public Service then, and we lost such an enormous amount of experience and wisdom that I think it took quite a long time for the Public Service to recover. This is particularly so in relation to outsourcing, where you had people with a great deal of experience in understanding the content of issues. Suddenly, we were left with people in the Public Service who did not understand the content trying to manage very complex outsourcing contracts. I think many of the problems that we have seen with outsourcing were as a result of the loss of extremely experienced older workers from the Public Service in 19964,000 of them. I was working in the health and ageing department. We lost people with a large degree of experience within the health area. There was a great loss during that period. So the government really does need to lead by example in its own policies. It is important that older people already participating in the work force be covered by legislation that protects them from being retrenched or unfairly treated, but the really tough issue MAIN COMMITTEE for policy makers is assisting mature age unemployed people and young people into jobs. These bills certainly are one way that you can try to remove some of the barriers that are in place to older people getting into the work force and give them some rights and remedies if they believe they have been discriminated against. But, clearly, it is only one way in which we need to be working to assist mature age people and young people into work. In Ballarat there is a group of people who have set up a mature age support group for women, and more recently a mature age support group for men has been established. I think that these sorts of initiatives do a great deal in assisting mature age unemployed people to work together to try to find solutions, to lobby quite strongly their own local, state and federal politicians, and also to participate in the policy debate around these issues. SoI would like to see those sorts of initiatives supported by some federal and state funding as well. I do support the bills before the House today. Age discrimination is an issue that we have talked about for a long time. Many older workers in particular have experienced it, but to date it is not something that we have been able to grapple with in a legislative sense. So, again, whilst I support the bills before the House today, I also think that there are some major problems with the relatives and associates test and the issue of harassment. Looking at the capping of payments is something that should also be explored. tion (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003 before the House are bills I think all members of the House can support. They go to the issue of age discrimination in our community, in our society-an issue that is going to be increasingly important in the future. Some 18½ per cent of people within my electorate of Cook are over 65 years of age, which makes it one of the older communities-a lot of ‘old Australia’, as one might say. The average across Australia is 12½ per cent, but by the year 2020 it is going to be much closer to the percentage in my electorate, so we must address the issue of age discrimination now and ensure that there are incentives for older people to stay in the work force and that they are not experiencing discrimination. There are general benefits to the economy in people staying in employment longer. I believe that just a two per cent shift in the number of those over the age of 55 who stay in the work force adds billions to the GDP of the country. It is important in terms of the ageing of the Australian population and the declining birth rate that we do encourage people to stay in the work force to ensure that we can afford our social welfare and support schemes. If we have increasing numbers of people who move to retirement or onto their superannuation schemes and we have decreasing numbers of young people to replace them, then we will have a bulk like they do in Japan. Part of the problem with Japan’s economy is the fact they have an ageing population and the workers are not being replaced at the younger end. We have an advantage over Japan because of the migration program, and especially the skilled migration program of many young people, but it is an issue. What can we do to encourage older people to stay in the work force? Some of the reports that come to me are disturbing. It is increasingly the trend in corporate Australia that, once people hit the age of 50, pressure is put on them to start considering their alternatives. I understand that in some of the major accounting firms the practice is quite rife-when you hit 50 the skids start to move out. The evidence is there. Think about the people you know in these major corporations who have survived beyond about the age of 53 or MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Ccamlr Is Unusual In One Sense It Is Not A Fishing Management Agency But Rather Is
191,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.18 A.m.),"The Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and Age Discrimina54. There are very few of them, and that is the ethos. It is a great pity in terms of the reservoir of skills and knowledge of these people. Obviously there are factors of IT knowledge and usage et cetera. Nevertheless, to have such a wholesale moving out of people simply on the basis of age is something which is touched on very significantly in these bills. To a lesser extent, I understand the feeling that people have. In Sydney last January there was an ocean swim where the organisers looked at the water and decided it was too rough for those over 50, and they banned everyone over 50 from participating in the race. A small riot developed on the beach, and the next day talkback shows were alive and well with people saying, ‘It is unfair. We can certainly keep up.’ I certainly encouraged those who felt discriminated against to swim in the 45to 49-year-old group, which I did. This is a small example of what it feels like, and for the first time in my life I felt discriminated against. Of course, these bills have much more significance than the small niceties of life that we enjoy in Sydney during the summer. This is about ensuring that our older people are valued in the community, that their skills and abilities are used effectively, that they are included for as long as possible in corporate, business and community life and in volunteer activities and that there is not the active discrimination that we so often find. The fact is that we are world leaders in terms of enabling our society to be free of discrimination in its various forms. We still have a fair way to go in a number of areas, but you have to say that we are a fair society, and part of our ethos is giving someone a go and being fair dinkum. This is part of it: ensuring that we do not have discrimination against our older Australians-particularly those at the other end of the demographic spectrum. This legislation will bring together a whole raft of antidiscrimination laws, and will give comprehensive federal enforcement to age discrimination instruments. We currently have Commonwealth obligations to international treaties, including-among many others-the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention and the United Nations Principles for Older Persons. While age discrimination is addressed in a limited capacity in the federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, it is not unlawful and not enforceable in the Commonwealth. This legislation is an effort to make discrimination laws more comprehensive. There is a need for greater uniformity to complete the existing array of antidiscrimination legislation. The proposed legislation also binds together various disparate acts under state legislation and territory legislative instruments. There is currently little consistency in this area amongst the various states and territories, particularly with regard to superannuation, the legality of compulsory retirement and employment minimums with regard to wages and ages. Compulsory retirement is not lawful in some states but others allow it. However, in all states, age discrimination is covered only as part of common, wide-ranging equal opportunity or general antidiscrimination instruments. This proposed new act specifically for age discrimination will directly address this oversight. The Commonwealth needs to look at this issue as well. Having been a member of the former Australian Trade Commission Service-now Austrade-I know that the incentives to stay beyond the age of 55 are nil; in fact, there is a distinct disincentive to stay after reaching the age of 55. So all these talented people who have experience in international markets hit 54 years and 11 months and they look at the superannuation benefits and decide it is not worth MAIN COMMITTEE their while staying. Some of these people are very experienced and talented, and I think it is a great pity that they leave. So we need to look at some areas and see what can be done. Obviously, a lot of people might prefer to retire and, instead of being in Saudi Arabia, move up to Maroochydore and set up an avocado farm-and good luck to them-but I find that a lot of people want to stay on. When they leave they get bored. I think it is about being stimulated and interested and using their talents. We take years to train them and, once they get some experience, out they go. We are the first nation to legislate age discrimination laws across all spheres of public interaction, not just restricting it to employment related issues. We recognise that age discrimination can occur outside the workplace, and we want to address it as a national priority. The only other countries to have comparable legislation are the UK and the US, but the instruments of these countries are limited largely to employment and workplace related age discrimination. New Zealand has age discrimination legislation in place, but it does not apply to child related discrimination. In the politburos of some of our Asian neighbours the average age is about 78, so they obviously do not need some of this legislation. But Western societies certainly need to move on this. We have specifically recognised some areas as requiring legitimate age distinctions. There is an inherent need for a balance between equality, antidiscrimination and age related distinctions. There are circumstances where proactive and positive discrimination is not only useful but also important in protecting age groups with an age disadvantage handicap. Alternatively, there are some cases where an age limit or minimum experience is essential as a special measure-and not just in employment. We need to ensure sufficient flexibility to allow for situations where age requirements are necessary. I must admit that I was trying to think of various cases where you would positively discriminate in terms of age, and I do not think there would too many. You could imagine that, for a youth worker position, you would not want somebody who is 75 to be in their shorts trying to keep up with the youth as they set out on their long-distance runs-although, if the person were someone like our whip, Stewart McArthur, the member for Corangamite, you might find that they would keep up, but the rest of us might not. But across the board spectrum, there are very few areas where you would say, ‘This is not an area where an older person should be involved.’ We want to give opportunities to age groups that may otherwise be marginalised or disenfranchised. We live in a time when contemporary society should be willing and eager to embrace the full participation of all individuals-economically, socially and culturally. In my electorate I see some fantastic examples of people who are out there and involved every day of the week in community activities of all kinds-running care centres, counselling groups, putting on one-person art shows or swimming across several beaches, and then up they runMs Hall-Stop talking about yourself, Bruce! swimming club and he can swim 50 metres in 31 seconds. We are all pretty proud of him. We have people in their 80s who swim and who do very well. I think we just need a few positive examples of how you can live life to its fullest.

192,Mr Baird,"I wish! We have one guy in my electorate who swims with the Polar Bearsage swimming competition. She is a tremendous person. These people illustrate how you can be involved in life in all its aspects. This legislation, along with other federal antidiscrimination laws, protects the rights and abilities of all individuals to full opportunities in choice of provision of goods and services, entitlements to education, healthcare, welfare and income support, accommodation, membership to clubs and associations, financial participation, taxation application, immigration and employment opportunities. I was glad to see some publicity given recently to an 80-year-old person who was getting a housing loan. You can imagine how this person would have been received in the days when we had those tough bank managers who would give you the third degree. The bank manager would say, ‘How old are you?’ and they would say, ‘Eighty-five and I want a housing loan.’ At least we have moved on in terms of some of those things, but there is always further to go. This legislation is not about limitations; it is about expanding and developing the capacity for all Australians to have full participation. In the next 40 years, one in four Australians will be over the age of 65-a doubling of the present situation. There may be a turn of events where we start to have a significant increase in the birth rate, but on current trends that is not likely. Even now workers over 45 reportedly make up the fastest growing sector of the work force, while younger generations are growing up in the face of this statistic and its consequences. We have a responsibility to introduce younger generations to their opportunities and to ensure they are not being overlooked simply because of their youth. We also want to allow our experienced, older generations to participate longer in the work force, should they choose to do so. By protecting our marginalised groups, we are generating a better equality that will improve all Australians’ rights to full participation opportunities. Chris Sidoti, the former Human Rights Commissioner, said that we should make ‘greater efforts to create a society where we are all appreciated for our abilities, not condemned for our age’. We have empowered the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission with the legislative instruments to educate and enforce age antidiscrimination. While it currently has no power to make determinations on age related complaints, the human rights commission has already been conciliating in some cases and reporting various findings to the Commonwealth Attorney-General under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. At the moment, the Human Rights Commissioner is responsible for promoting awareness amongst Australian employers about discrimination on other grounds covered by federal law, including age. With the introduction of this new legislation, the role of enforcement and education will fall into and expand the jurisdiction of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In conclusion, the introduction of this legislation is an investment in the health of our collective society and its capacity to move beyond value judgments. In 1998 the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, said: ... a society for all ages is multi-generational. It is not fragmented, with youth, adults and older persons going their separate ways. Rather, it is age inclusive, with different generations recognising-and acting upon-their commonality of interest. This legislation is about the government recognising its responsibilities and indicating that age discrimination is not necessary in what should be an inclusive society. We are encouraging people to assert their rights by creating a supportive environment. We are trying to abolish MAIN COMMITTEE age group perceptions that cause negative attitudes towards these groups. We need to make the distinction between disadvantage and discrimination. This legislation aims to make, and legally confirm, that difference. I commend the bill to the House. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.34 a.m.)-The Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and the Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003 are long overdue. Whilst this legislation goes a long way towards addressing age discrimination in Australia, it is still very weak and has room for improvement. But I do congratulate the government for introducing it and for recognising the fact that age discrimination does exist within our society and that it is at a level where we need to address it. By addressing it, we improve our society and improve opportunities for many of the people within our society. Discrimination of any type does not benefit our nation. Rather, it leads to lost opportunities and creates division, negative feelings and actions, and marginalisation and hurt to those who are discriminated against. You could argue just as strongly that those who discriminate are also hurting themselves. Age discrimination can be either overt or subtle, but it is always based on negative stereotypes rather than fact. The negative stereotypes permeate through all layers of our society and impact on it in a variety of ways. Age discrimination is not only directed at older people but also directed at younger people. Anyone who has ever looked at job advertisements in the papers would see that just about everybody has been discriminated against in one way or another. In a previous life, I used to help people find jobs. The common thing that people used to say to me was that they were either too young or too old. No matter what age they were, they were not the right age. Age discrimination has been in the employment area for many years. But it does not to stop with that area; it goes through every layer of our society. That is why it is so important that we address it. Younger people have often negative stereotypes applied to them-that they are young, scatty, not dedicated, do not have a work ethic, are not prepared to knuckle down et cetera. Once again, these are the types of negative stereotypes that need to be addressed-and debunked-and I hope that will happen through this legislation. However, I would like to spend quite a bit of my time in this House today talking about older people and the impact that discrimination against them has. It is in practically every aspect of our society. Older people are undervalued; they are seen as lesser people. When you are older and have grey hair, quite often accompanying that is a feeling that you cannot perform the same duties and tasks that a younger person can, that your cognitive powers are in some way lesser than a person who is younger, that you are inflexible and you obviously have got to have some sort of an impairment and, as such, that you are unable to participate in society to the same level that other people can. I should emphasise that we are an ageing nation, and every speaker before me has probably also emphasised that fact. We have got a declining birth rate-our birth rate in Australia is down to around 1.75 babies per woman-and at the same time, due to advancements in medical technology, we have got an ageing population. In other words: we are having fewer children and we are living longer. Rather than seeing the fact that we are living longer as an opportunity and a benefit to our society, governments of all persuasions in nations throughout the world are seeing this as a problem, particularly in the area of cost, and looking at it from a negative economic point of view. I would argue that rather than seeing this as a negative factor we should embrace it as an MAIN COMMITTEE opportunity-and as an economic opportunity as well. We have this group of older people with a lot to offer our nation. The challenge for us as a country is to look at how we can utilise this wonderful resource we have-this experience. These people are dedicated and want to participate. I see that this legislation goes down that path to some degree. I see employment as one of the areas where there has been, as I mentioned earlier, quite a deal of discrimination. By failing to offer mature age workers the opportunity to participate in the labour market and to have jobs, we are adding to the economic costs of our nation in other areas. For instance, it is a well-known fact that a person who is active and involved in work and who has a decent income and is part of a community has much better health outcomes. So by including older people and mature age workers in the work force there would actually be a saving to Australia in the area of health. Quite often when we look at just one layer of our society we see that there may be some initial costs. Employers may feel that by having to employ mature age workers they are actually going to increase their costs. But I would argue very strongly that that will not be the case. Mature age people have a very strong work ethic, a lot of knowledge and a lot of skills. I think there is a strong argument for lifelong learning so a person can progress and develop their skills while they are in the work force. I do not think that because a person, as the member for Cook says, reaches a magic age they are no longer able to operate in the work force or they do not have the same skills they had the day before or we as a nation cannot benefit from their input. On the grounds of both skills and the savings that we can make in the health area we should be not only accepting but encouraging people to stay in the work force longer. I also think there is an issue of equity associated with older people being able to participate in the work force. The equity issue goes across income and quality of life issues. Unless older people have the same access to employment as other age groups then I feel that we are denying them equity. I will now move to younger people and their employment. Over the years there has definitely been a trend to discriminate in some ways against younger people. One area that I am a little concerned about that is not covered by this legislation is the issue of harassment of younger workers. Within the workplace there has been a culture of harassment of younger workers. I think that is a weakness in the legislation and should be dealt with. There are other areas in which younger workers are discriminated against, particularly with employers wanting younger people to have a level of skill and expertise that is unrealistic for their age. That goes with what I have said about older people and the need for that commitment to the training and skilling of workers and to the lifelong learning concept. I will now move to the area of health. The discrimination that exists within our health system is very subtle. Quite often, those who are discriminating are not aware of the fact that they are discriminating. This goes back to what I was saying at the beginning of my speech about negative stereotypes and how they permeate our society. Older people who present themselves at an accident and emergency department or at their doctor are sometimes treated differently from a younger person. A person may, for example, appear a bit disorientated at an accident and emergency department and may be discounted. People may discount them by saying, ‘They’re older, so maybe it’s early signs of senility.’ When that disorientation is ignored, quite often a medical condition can be overlooked, particularly in the area of urinary MAIN COMMITTEE tract infections-something which has been documented quite widely. There is a need for health professionals to have adequate knowledge of older people and to have incorporated in their training greater levels of training that break down the negative stereotypes that exist. I recently visited a person in hospital. She is a person to whom I am very close. She is a very alert and astute woman. She had had a hip replacement and was in a ward with, I think, three other older people. She is 81 or 82, a very active sportswoman and very intellectually astute-she has no problems with her cognitive functioning. The treatment that she received in hospital was totally different from the treatment that I would expect. Another person there rang a buzzer and said, ‘I need to go to the bathroom.’ The answer was, ‘We’ll be there in 10 minutes.’ This woman took on the role of trying to help a couple of the other people who were in the ward. There was one woman aged 95 in there. Once again, she was quite astute-no problem whatsoever-but because of her deafness, the nurses and staff in that hospital tended to discount what she was saying as being unimportant and irrelevant. This deaf woman was in need of some pain relief, and the health professionals left her for about three or four hours. Simply because she was an older person she was discounted. The other woman ended up, to her absolute horror, actually wetting herself, simply because she was an older person who received a different sort of treatment. We need to spend some time addressing these negative stereotypes. Within society as a whole there is a general feeling that older people do not function in the same way and do not have the same needs as everybody else. I am very hopeful that this legislation is going to stop this kind of discrimination across all areas. It is important to mention that in New South Wales more complaints related to age discrimination were made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission than for any other form of discrimination. More than 200 people phoned complaints to the information line in 1999-2000 and again in 2000-01 because they had been deemed too old for positions. So this comes back to employment again. Under New South Wales law, this was the most common form of discrimination. In the time remaining I will detail my areas of concern. EarlierI touched on the fact that I was worried that nothing is detailed in this legislation about harassment. Another area I am concerned about is that age discrimination must be deemed to be the dominant reason. That is not the case with other antidiscrimination legislation. This legislation puts in place a much greater requirement to prove discrimination for age than there is for other areas. It must be shown that age discrimination is the No. 1 reason that a person did not get a job or was discriminated against in some way, and that is quite often very hard to prove. A person can argue: ‘We didn’t give them that job, because we wanted somebody who had the latest skills,’ or: ‘We want somebody who has just finished university in the last 12 months and has greater knowledge of the latest theories and practices in that area.’ Discrimination, as I mentioned earlier, can be very subtle. This dominant reason test is a more stringent test than exists for any other antidiscrimination law, and it signals to the community that age discrimination is of less importance than other forms of discrimination. The other area I will quickly touch on is the issue of relatives and associates. It is common knowledge and common practice that people who are caring for older relatives are often discriminated against on the ground that caring for an older person could influence their ability to attend work. Therefore, they are not offered a position. That is no different to not employMAIN COMMITTEE ing a woman who has children. The government has missed a prime opportunity to address one negative stereotype that exists in the community, and I feel that if that had been included it would have been of great benefit. I would like to support the amendment that has been moved by the shadow Attorney General. At the same time, I congratulate the government for actually introducing this legislation. As a nation, we will be much richer if we can get rid of all the age discrimination that exists. That will create opportunities for us as a nation and opportunities for individuals who are currently being discriminated against. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (10.55 a.m.)-I would like to speak in support of the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and the Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003. Shakespeare recognised no fewer than seven ages in the spectrum of human experience, which shows how badly Shakespeare, for all his insight, failed to anticipate the generational apartheid now enforced by our market-driven brave new world. In most historical eras the categorising and the exclusion of people from areas of life on the basis of age remains largely unknown. There is little evidence of a youth market outside our narrow, media-driven society which could create, define and, unmercifully, target potential consumers simply on the basis of their birth date. Historically speaking, there is also little evidence of a seniors market based solely on birth date. As social historians have pointed out, the reinvention of childhood as a separate and legally defined phase of life is of relatively recent vintage. It is a concept still, mercifully, unknown in societies which put an absolute human value on the virtue of youth. Equally, the regarding of age as a barrier by which some people would be excluded from productive activity is of even more recent date and, mercifully, remains largely unknown outside a very narrow spectrum of age marketing. The marginalisation and the exclusion of productive members of society on the grounds of years on the planet has been absent through most of history until now. The Chinese, who date age not from birth anyway but from conception-and whose president, President Hu, recently addressed this parliament-base their entire culture on a respect for age. This respect is expressed most notably in the Chinese placement of family names. The name of one’s forebears is always given before individual’s names. The word ‘old’ in Chinese, ‘lao’, is an honour and mark of respect which is used as a universal form of address. Longevity, or old age, is one of the cardinal blessings that a Chinese person can wish for. By contrast, ‘old’ is a word to strike terror into the heart of anyone in our much more disposable Western culture. It is one of the saddest flaws of our economy and our society that old age is seen as a defect, a basis for exclusion from employment and social life. Equally diminishing is the tendency to exclude and undervalue young people on the basis of their youth. Had Mozart been alive today, it is unlikely that he would have ever gotten into a public recital by the age of five, let alone given one-let alone publish a popular minuet by the age of four. It is difficult to quantify how we as a society, a culture and an economy lose by excluding the young and the elderly from mainstream life. In employment, the immediate effect, if not quantifiable, is certainly visible. It is painfully clear if one looks at a particular industry: the media. In the good old days, media organisations-whatever they have us believe today-employed many more young people than they do today. In their golden age, newspapers employed a regular intake of hundreds of copy boys and cadets to be trained up gradually in the rigours of hands-on journalism, as fully literate MAIN COMMITTEE and legally informed writers, proofreaders, sub editors and, in many notable cases, eventual editors. Read the biographies of many of the greats of the golden age of Australian journalism and you will discover how they began their very illustrious careers as humble cadets and copy boys. They did so at ages which today would seem ridiculously young, if not unemployable. Who trained them? On the other end of the spectrum were the veterans, the seers, the men and women who had the experience and the intestinal fortitude gained from organisations which employed them for their professional lifetimes. That transmission of experience is no longer possible in the media world of today, because there are no very old to teach and no very young to learn the lessons of a lifetime-to ensure that they know their p’s and q’s and everything that comes with journalism. Newspapers have abandoned their time-honoured practice of training cadets, while the number of newsroom copy boys and girls continues steadily to fall. Ironically, this is happening at a time when the media, like too many industries, are dumbing down to target the fictitious generations X, Y and Z or the youth markets, which such organisations believe they need to have in order to survive. Recently, a journalist commented to me about this phenomenon. Working on an exchange in the USA a decade ago she noticed the absence of anyone under or over a narrow age band of the mid-twenties to midthirties-no cadets, trainees or senior personnel outside the narrow sphere of senior management. It was generational apartheid at its worse and most glaring. A decade later we see the same process here. What is the result? It is industries without collective corporate memory, with no understanding of Australia’s past and with no future objective beyond the creation of fictitious markets whom they can sell to rather than inform. This situation is critical, and it is critical at both ends of the age spectrum. I am contacted every day by constituents from a wide range of employment backgrounds who find it impossible to break into the work force because of the age barrier. They are people whose anguish is made all that much worse because they are capable not only of still working but of bringing into a job that irreplaceable experience born of long years in the field. The need for the reincorporation of such people and their collective know-how into the social equation makes these bills today vital. It is not only individuals who will benefit from their implementation. Australian organisations and corporations and the economy stand to gain much from the collective input of both young and old-not as mere markets to target but as productive contributors to our Commonwealth. Age discrimination is, to paraphrase Shakespeare, twice diminishing. It diminishes not only those who get it but also those who give it, whether it is dished out by corporations or by the entire mainstream culture. Economies lose an irreplaceable level of judgment, analysis and corporate memory, and mainstream cultures lose the civilising and guiding hand of experience. But holding on to that great asset is difficult. It requires legislative protection in the same way that other areas like sex and race have required legislative reform. Over the next 20 years, the growth in the number of Australians of labour force age will be 14 per cent, but the number of people between 55 and 64 years of age is expected to increase by 50 per cent. On an international scale, participation in the Australian labour force stands at relatively high rates for young workers but at lower rates for older workers. Australia has the highest unemployment rate for men aged 55 to 59 of any country in the OECD. MAIN COMMITTEE Between 2011 and 2031, the number of people aged over 65 in Australia is expected to rise from three million to five million. From 2000 to 2010, the rate of increase in the work force will dwindle to 13.8 per cent. Between 1978 and 1988, that rate was 23.5 per cent. So, from 1978 to 2010, the rate of increase in the work force will go from 23.5 per cent down to 13.8 per cent. This will result in a huge shift from those who are working to those who are in retirement, and it will put increasing strain on the economy. Who will fund retirement and underwrite services to the general population? The projected 10 per cent increase in work force participation by 55to 70-year-olds may neutralise these negative effects, but how do we ensure their participation? We do it by removing the opportunity for discrimination on the basis of age. As Abraham Lincoln said, ‘It is not the years in your life that count, it is the life in your years.’ We must legislate in order to calculate those years back into the social and economic plus for Australia. Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (11.03 a.m.)-I am pleased to participate in this debate on the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and the Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003. In my view, it is the right of the individual to be protected from prejudice and discrimination, and it should be one of the founding principles of our democratic system. Protection against discrimination is a fundamental right that should be enjoyed by the whole community. There are many Australians who, on a day-to-day basis, battle against discriminatory behaviour, attitudes and stereotypes, and these realities are all too familiar to both teenage and senior members of our community. Interestingly, Lillian Carter, the mother of former US President Jimmy Carter, once said, ‘Of course I help the elderly-I too will be old one day.’ It is worth noting that she said that when she was in her 80s. Not only does Lillian Carter challenge the stereotype of older people; she also makes the point that old age comes to all of us. Age discrimination is perhaps the only form of discrimination that can affect everyone in our community. Unfortunately, it is a form of discrimination which is affecting an increasing number of Australians. In my constituency of HasluckI am regularly confronted by stories of age discrimination. This anecdotal evidence is also backed up by hard facts. Back in 2001 the human rights commissioner, Sev Ozdowski, reported a threefold increase in the number of complaints of incidents of age discrimination. Although many of us are lucky enough not to experience the same levels of discrimination as happens in certain parts of the world, we should not become complacent. Australia has an ageing population. Within the next 10 years the Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that the population aged over 65 will be growing at an annual rate of four per cent-considerably faster than the total population growth. As a result, by 2021 over 20 per cent of the population will be older than 65. In my own electorate of Hasluck, more than 12,000 constituents are currently over the age of 65 and approximately 6,200 people are aged between 55 and 59 years. These numbers are sure to grow in forthcoming years. It is imperative that Australia has strong legislation in place to protect older Australians. It is not only important for Australia to legislate against age discrimination but something we are obliged to do. Australia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Australia has promised to ensure that all persons will be protected from discrimination on any grounds, including race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or ‘other status’. Age is broadly accepted as being included MAIN COMMITTEE within the category ‘other status’. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also requires parties, including Australia, to ensure everyone has access to a range of economic, social and cultural rights without discrimination. These include the right to work, to benefit from social security and to participate in cultural and public life. WhilstI am pleased to speak in support of this bill, I have some concerns regarding the actual provisions. I indicate at this point that I also seek to speak in favour of the second reading amendment that has been circulated by the member for Barton. The bill as it stands before us could be said to be in contrast to some of the Howard government’s otherwise dismal record on human rights. Of course, this record on human rights is not a basis for opposing the bill that is before us, but I would like to address certain inadequacies within the bill. One of the most common areas of complaint of discrimination based on age is that of employment. The facts speak for themselves. Since 1978 the average period of unemployment for men over 55 has climbed steadily to about two years-double the national average. According to recent official OECD figures, Australia has the highest rate of unemployment of 55to 59-year-old men of any OECD country. Forty-six per cent of people in the 50to 64years age group do not have paid employment and 33 per cent rely on some form of social security payment. This is an unsustainable situation. So before the next government member rises and raves on about our ‘miracle economy’ and how well we are doing, I ask that you reflect upon the situation of many mature age people battling to make ends meet. This is not a political point-scoring exercise. The ACTU and the Business Council of Australia-which are not normally noted for their rapprochement on matters-have carried out a joint report highlighting the need to maintain and increase the number of older workers within the labour market. The Business Council of Australia concluded: Older workers are adversely impacted by negative stereotypes, and face discrimination in the context of recruitment, training and retrenchment. In 1999 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission received 10 phone calls alleging age discrimination in employment. In a 2001 report entitled Age matters the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission indicated that it had received 207 phone calls alleging age discrimination. Another organisation, Drake Personnel, carried out a survey of 500 employers who regularly use their services. That survey revealed that none would choose to employ managers and/or executives aged in their 50s. Further, 65 per cent of those employers said this group-that is, those people aged over 50-would be the first to go in the event of retrenchment. The story of age discrimination is not new or unfamiliar. The story is being told repeatedly by unions, business groups and independent organisations as well as by many of my constituents. It was therefore disappointing to discover that the bill has been watered down in key areas. The government’s own information paper highlighted the fact that the age of an associate or relative can be used to discriminate against a person. It is not difficult to envisage a situation where an employer discriminates against an employee who cares for an aged relative, because of an unfounded belief that an employee will need to take time off to care for his or her friend or family. Of course, we have seen similar issues with respect to discrimination against parents or those supporting younger children. The value which relatives and associates place on caring for older people needs to be supported by this parliament and protected by legislation. We should not allow the cool, chill MAIN COMMITTEE winds or the hard cold values of the market to override the value Australians place on caring for family and friends. The failure of the Howard government to protect individuals in such circumstances is not only a failure to secure individuals their just entitlements but also a failure to respect and value their contribution to our community. But this shortfall, no matter how disappointing, should not preclude us supporting this bill. A second disappointment is that the Howard government has decided to raise the bar in determining the test for whether particular conduct constitutes age discrimination by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for any complaint. Frankly, this will make it harder for people to make complaints and to make successful complaints. The test the Howard government has laid down follows changes already made in state and territory laws which establish a more reasonable criterion for what actions are considered discriminatory. For example, under New South Wales law, the relevant test is met even if the discriminatory action is only one of two or more reasons for the discriminatory act. But it is not only state and territories which have this more reasonable criterion-there are numerous examples that exist in Commonwealth legislation that regulate other outlawed discriminative acts that incorporate the more reasonable criterion. I ask the government why certain people are given greater levels of protection, while young and elderly Australians are not afforded the same protection. This move has rightfully angered a constituent in my electorate who is over 55 years of age and who has been tirelessly seeking employment with no success. Alan is an extremely talented and qualified individual; yet, having made 30 job applications in a two-month period, he has not received any positive responses. He made the comment to me that he is sure that he is being discriminated against because of his age and he asked, ‘But how the hell can I prove it?’ His experience is not unlike that of many older workers, particularly men who were displaced from work by change beyond their control-like the 1,500 workers who were employed at the Midland Railway Workshops in my electorate when it was closed in 1994 by the then conservative state government. The region has still not recovered from this closure. I still doorknock and talk to many of these men as I go about my job in the electorate. They speak to me of their depression, their sense of failure as providers and their feelings of uselessness. This is something that we as a community must address. By requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for any complaint rather than one among many, the Howard government has made it harder under federal law for people to successfully challenge discriminatory behaviour of employers and does little or nothing for constituents like Alan. To quote from the second reading speech, the government’s justification for its approach is that: … the primary solution to most aspects of age discrimination is based on education and attitudinal change. In doing so, it is critical that that the legislation not establish barriers to such positive developments, for example, by restricting employment opportunities for older Australians by imposing unnecessary costs and inflexibility on employers acting in good faith. Yet this reasoning is at odds with the government’s case for introducing this legislation in the first place. In arguing against retaining the status quo and not legislating against age discrimination the following was advanced by the government: MAIN COMMITTEE The self-regulatory measures suggested in Option2 are not appropriate for the problem of age discrimination as they do not provide an adequate remedy. Legislative mechanisms for providing protection against age discrimination would appear to be the optimum way of dealing with the problem. It then goes on to say: Similarly, simply retaining the status quo, as suggested in Option 1, is not an appropriate option in this case. As noted above, there are gaps in the existing coverage of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws which would not be rectified by simply retaining the status quo. This government is aware of the most effective way to protect people from discrimination but it has failed to follow through in this legislation. This legislation should not be viewed in isolation from the wider debate on human rights and the government’s track record on these issues. The Howard government’s conservative agenda has seen a systematic attack on socially progressive movements like the human rights movement. I will mention some examples. The Howard government has slashed the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission’s budget. The commission has seen its budget reduced by 40 per cent in real terms since 1995-96. On top of this, the government’s first draft ASIO bill-introduced before Christmas last year-was one of the most draconian pieces of legislation ever introduced into this parliament. We have also seen the government’s approach to asylum seekers, the rights of transgender persons to marry, and single and lesbian mothers’ rights to IVF. There was the refusal by the government to sign the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The government voted against the UN protocol against torture-putting us in the company of such regimes as Libya, Nigeria, the Sudan and Cuba. What is particularly concerning is the systematic attack on human rights bodies like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Some may advance the argument that the cuts to the HREOC simply represent a bureaucratic shift in resources. This however is short-sighted, naive and demonstrates scant understanding of the role the commission plays in the Australian community. This government’s bleeding of the commission reminds me of a quote by Professor Denise Peace: An ombudsman makes the Government look good but under-funding the office assures it is not too troublesome. It seems to me that this is the way the government is dealing with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The government has failed to recognise that such bodies are fundamental for accountable government. Importantly, they are the guardians of the values that make Australia the tolerant, accepting and fair society we are-or at least we were and could be. The Howard government is determined to change such agencies, whose functions include dealing with the big picture issues and long-term systemic issues, into individual complaint handling bodies-something that resembles more of a fly swatter than an engine of social change. We cannot afford to live in a society that does not aggressively defend everyone’s human rights. It is the Indigenous Australian, the Arab, the Jew, the woman, the farmer, the businessperson, the peace activist, the immigrant, the gay, the disabled, the young and the old who make up the rich fabric of Australia. To discriminate against any group or individual is not simply an attack on that individual but an assault on the wider community and the values that are implicit to our way of life. As Martin Luther King Jr once said, ‘Injustice anywhere is a MAIN COMMITTEE threat to justice everywhere.’ If we fail to properly address age discrimination-and, indeed, all forms of inequality-it will diminish all of our lives. The Howard government, it seems to me, has learnt to thrive on wedge politics, pitching one Australian against another-it is the very lifeblood of this government. Even when legislation is introduced that aims to eliminate discrimination against a certain group-such as the aged or the young in this case-it falls short. This legislation comes in the wake of several state acts-far from groundbreaking in their own right-and yet falls short of providing comprehensive protection against age discrimination. Despite their limitations, these are bills that I intend to support, and I urge other members of the House to do so. But, in saying that, I also urge the government to consider a far more comprehensive regime and more reasonable criterion for further amendment to the age discrimination provisions. that I rise to support the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and the Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003. It has been quite a long gestation, but the fact that we are finally debating these bills and that they will be passed into law gives me personally a great deal of pleasure. Back in 1999, when I was Minister for Aged Care, which was of course the International Year of Older Persons, I made it an absolute priority that we honour older people in a way that we had not before. In fact, the terminology within the department that was used to describe older Australians was far from satisfactory, and I introduced new terminology so that henceforth senior Australians would either be known as senior Australians or older Australians, and I created the Office for Older Australians. For a long time the images of older Australians did not portray them as they were. They were depicted as frail, ailing or ill when clearly the vast majority of them were not. So one morning I took a television camera down to the local swimming pool races at one of my local beaches to shoot some positive footage, which we then distributed to all television channels around Australia. The really terrific thing that morning was that the person who won the seniors’ race was actually 92 and the youngest person in the series of races was aged two, so there was this great coming together-and that was the way that I saw Australia should work as a population. We then embarked on honouring older Australians, which culminated in each electorate right across Australia being able to nominate an outstanding older Australian to be honoured at a morning tea given by the Governor General. It was a very happy event indeed. Part and parcel of that was that we realised we had an Australian of the Year and a Young Australian of the Year, but what was missing was a senior Australian of the year award-so I created one. The first person to win it was Slim Dusty, who only recently passed away. He was a great joy to have as our first Senior Australian of the Year. I am delighted to be able to say that it is now a permanent award and the trilogy is complete. There were other things that came to my attention. In looking at the changing demography of Australia it became quite apparent that the baby boomers, who have dominated economic patterns right throughout their lives, would continue to do so as they aged. The baby boom began in 1941, it peaked in 1947 and it finished in 1965. That cohort of human beings is the first in the history of mankind who, after 40 years of work, will not be physically worn out. Consequently, the ageing of that cohort is going to be tremendously important in economic MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Ccamlr Is Unusual In One Sense It Is Not A Fishing Management Agency But Rather Is
193,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (11.20 A.m.),"It is with a great deal of pleasuretrends, work force trends and the way in which we plan for those people who go on to need special care towards the end of their lives-by making a proper plan for them. What became apparent when I started to look at and gather the statistics was that only eight per cent of people over the age of 70 would need residential aged care. Another 12 per cent would need some form of services. But the other 80 per cent are going to have a fantastic time, and they will be very important regarding patterns of expenditure and the goods that they buy. Successful firms will be those that realise that the changing demographic means that the disposable income will rest in the hands of the senior population rather than a youth generation. We are already starting to see advertisements that acknowledge that reality. But when I began this process in 1999 it was a message that was a hard sell-it was a new thought. I looked at the OECD literature and at several things particularly pertaining to the work force. Australia is down to 1.7 births per female-we are not reproducing ourselves, though we will continue to grow because of our migration policy. But what that means is that the vast cohorts of young and cheap labour that have traditionally displaced senior members of the work force because they have become expensive are no longer going to be available. I thought the only way to properly analyse these trends was to commission substantial research so there was a factual and analytical research base to which people could refer. I began the process by making a speech on precisely these issues at the National Press Club in 1999. I still read that speech, which is a published speech, and it gives me a great deal of pleasure to see that many of the things I said needed to be done are starting to be done. I commissioned Access Economics to do the research. I wrote a substantial foreword to it, and that particular piece of work-Population ageing and the economy-is and will go on being a most important resource for all the work that has been and will subsequently be done. The Intergenerational Report which followed certainly had many similarities with that earlier publication. However, the need to talk about the ongoing contribution which older Australians will make to the work force became of paramount importance. Certain figures and statistics that became available showed where public policy needed to be concentrated. People who are selfemployed will work much longer than those in any other form of employment. People who work in small business will also work longer than people who work in public institutions and in large, bureaucratic, private sector bodies such as insurance companies and banks, where there is still this tendency to want to move people on because they have reached a particular age. We were successful in having the age of 65 removed as a compulsory retirement age for people in the federal Public Service, and that was a great breakthrough. I have to tell a story about it. Before the legislation that made that age of 65 no longer a compulsory retirement age was proclaimed, one Comcar driver turned 65 and they tried to turn him out in the interim. But he appealed and was successful, and he is still driving today. I am very pleased about that. It was an important breakthrough point. However, some of the myths that had been perpetuated about older workers had to be dispelled. One of them was that younger workers are quicker. That can indeed be true, but older workers are actually more accurate. So in terms of the trade-off in productivity, it can be beneficial to maintain mature age workers in the work force. I might add that mature age workers are those people aged at least 45. Another statistic that is very important is that, if you retrain an employee-and retraining has to be part and parcel of our employment practice MAIN COMMITTEE if we are to continue to keep our productivity growth-that retraining will be beneficial for six years. However, a younger employee is only likely to stay with you for about two of the six years that that retraining will give benefit for. So you can expect a younger worker to stay with the employer who paid for the retraining for two years, whereas a mature age worker is likely to remain for the full six years. Some other interesting research has broken up the work force into quartiles to see what the patterns are for people who wish to retrain and remain on top of whatever their job is, and which are the people who ought to be retrained and ought to be remaining in the work force longer. This very interesting research shows that in the first quartile is a cohort of people who want to continue to retrain to get additional information to stay on top of whatever their jobs are-and it is a joy for them to do it. The people in the next quartile will do the retraining and they will be quite good at it; they will be useful, and it will be beneficial. The next quartile contains people who say, ‘I’ll do it, but only if I have to.’ They are very reluctant to take on retraining. In the last quartile are the people who say: ‘Over my dead body! I don’t want to do any more anyway.’ When we talk about retaining mature age workers in the work force-and the cohort I am really talking about is the group of people aged 55 to 70-they are going to come out of those first two quartiles of the work force who are identifiable as people who will be able to benefit from retraining and stay right on top of the job. The concept of knowledge, wisdom and corporate memory is also very important to firms in ensuring that they are getting the best output from their work forces. Indeed, in the United Kingdom the Ford Motor Company retrenched all its mature age workers but then had to form a subsidiary to hire a lot of them back because it had lost the corporate memory and expertise which it needed to go on making good profits. There was also an experience in the UK where a particular hardware firm decided they would have a greenfields operation. They decided to only employ people over the age of 50. Indeed, they put advertisements in the paper and employed only people over the age of 50. Their profits went up, their attendance rate went up and, most particularly, slippage-mispricing and a bit of pilfering on the side-went down. In other words, it was a win-win situation for them. As a result, they employed more people over 50 in their other stores, where they have a mix, as consumers looking for a product actually like to be advised and served by people whom they see as their peers-that is, people of their own age. There was a true story told of a lady who was around 72 years of age. She was managing her own investment portfolio quite successfully. She rang the bank and said, ‘I’d like to make some changes to my portfolio investments.’ The bank said, ‘We’ll send out your personal investment adviser, madam.’ Out came the personal investment adviser, who was aged about 30. He went through her portfolio and made some recommendations. When the bank rang her back and said, ‘How did you go?’ she said, ‘He’s a very nice young man and he seemed to know quite a lot of things. But I’d like some advice from someone who has had some experience.’ That is going to become more and more the reality, and the firms that wake up and pay attention to that are the firms that are going to be successful. Let me reinforce that point. We are just about at the point where the number of people turning 55 and the number of people turning 15 are the same. In the future, the number of people turning 55 will rise on a very steep angle, and the number of people turning 15 will remain flat. That is the reality we are dealing with in planning work force measures, health care and MAIN COMMITTEE areas of education, where some of our costs will actually go down. Contrary to the myth that our health costs will go up because of the ageing of the population, that is the reason for only one-fifth of the increase in cost. The remainder will occur because of the increase in technology. It is an exciting area. It is new, it is innovative, and Australia is actually at the forefront. The OECD praises Australia. I had many discussions with the OECD in Paris and with people at the United Nations in New York on the work that I brought forward which culminated in the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia. That document was all ready for publication at the time of the last election but could not be released prior to the election date in case somebody said that we were using Commonwealth resources for electioneering purposes. But the document that I prepared as chair remains a good document for the way forward. Indeed, it is referred to in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies this bill. In speaking about the need for this antidiscrimination legislation, I am pleased to say that we have already got rid of the very discriminatory piece of legislation that said, if you were a director of a public company aged 72 and you stood for re-election, you had to have not 50plus per cent but 75 per cent of people voting for you, and you had to be elected every year; whereas, if you were under age 72, you could be elected for, say, three years. That age discrimination, which was totally unreasonable, is no longer there. People who are doing the voting can, quite clearly, decide whether someone is valuable on a board or not. In looking at the future, I can say that we can afford to have our pension. We are not in the position of, say, Italy, where there are riots in the streets. It occurred in Paris as well, when there was an attempt to say that people who are in receipt of pensions would have to work for more years before they could be entitled to them-simply because it could no longer be afforded. We can afford ours because the pension we pay is to prevent poverty. It is not meant to be income replacing, as are the pensions paid in Europe, which are simply unaffordable. The OECD points out that, because of our system of paying out of consolidated revenue, we will be able to go on affording our pension payments. At the same time, we have compulsory superannuation and other savings which more and more Australians have-even those who are entitled to a pension or part-pension. The number of people who are totally dependent on a pension, with no other form of income, is comparatively small. With good planning and using our mature-age work force, we can see a tremendous increase in productivity and a great future for our nation. The bottom line of the research I commissioned from Access Economics is that, if just 10 per cent of that cohort aged 55 to 70 remain in the work force, it can make a difference of four percentage points to GDP-and that is bigger than tax reform, which made a difference of 2.5 per cent. So when we look at older Australians, we are looking at a tremendous resource which can aid the continuing increase in productivity which we started to experience in this country in comparative OECD terms only from 1996, when, for the first time, our productivity increases caught up with the rest of the developed world-and that is because we are better at using our resources, because we use privatisation and because we have become more efficient. A society which is truly about valuing the contribution of every individual is a society which values the contribution that is made by the older members of its work force and which cashes in on the expertise, the loyalty and the accuracy in the work that they do. That work MAIN COMMITTEE does not compete with the work of younger workers but complements it. I commend the bills to the House. crimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003 come at a time when the motive for making these changes may be not so much about improving the human rights of Australians as about a means of enticing more Australians to continue in the work force and not take early retirement. We saw in the 2002 budget the introduction of the Intergenerational Report, and we have all heard the warnings of budget disaster waiting down the track if we do not act now to roll back expenditure and force people to work until they drop. So the motive for this legislation appears to be to achieve economic goals rather than social goals. That fits with this government’s idea that we are units of an economy rather than members of a society. But achieving this economic goal will take a lot more than this legislation. There are very strong social forces acting in the opposite direction. While this legislation will go some way to reducing age discrimination, it will not address the many unseen ways that age discrimination operates. To explain this I shall give the House some examples of how society sees age and what it means for access to employment in particular. Some months ago, I was driving back to my electorate office after addressing a group of year 9 school students. As I stopped at the traffic lights a bus drove past with an advertising sign on its side. The sign said ‘leave work early’. I was very tempted to head for home rather than go back to the office, but then I noticed that the advertisement was for a bank and the penny dropped. It was about retiring from work early. That made me think about the session I had just had with the year 9 students. One question I had asked them was, ‘What are your career ambitions?’ I was a bit surprised when a number of students said they wanted to be millionaires by the age of 30 and retire at the age of 40. We hear that so many times from the young ones. I think those comments tell us a lot about the idea of age. For a 15-year-old, 40 is very old. I reminded the students that they would be expected to work until they were 60 before they could access superannuation or 65 before they could get a pension. The reaction was the same as if a judge had given them a life sentence. That started me thinking about this whole intergenerational issue, and that is how we should look at the issue of age discrimination. Age discrimination affects what occurs at every stage of an adult’s life, not just what happens after we turn 50. My first job was with the old Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. For a time, I worked in the bonds and debentures department in that magnificent marble and brass banking chamber in George Street, Sydney, opposite Martin Place. Apart from me, the staff was made up of gentlemen in their fifties who had been with the bank all of their working lives. Many of them had been bank managers. Promotion was based on seniority, and as the managers retired they were replaced by the next in line. Our clients were mostly blue rinse matrons who would come in to check up on their portfolio of Commonwealth bonds. There was something reassuring about having a grey haired gentleman personally attending to their inquiries. The bonds and debentures department was not very efficient. The old men were very much fuddy-duddies, and they worked at a slow pace-but they knew the job backwards and never made mistakes. If you were a blue rinse matron being served by one of those grey haired gentlemen in that marble and brass banking chamber, you did not need an expensive advertising campaign to tell you your money was safe in their hands. But those days are long gone.

194,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (11.40 A.m.),"The Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and the Age Disnot seniority. Years of experience and loyalty to the organisation are no longer regarded as assets by businesses. They are liabilities. Employees have the wrong work culture. It amazes me that Telstra, for example, made thousands of workers redundant but at the same time recruited thousands of new employees. Why couldn’t Telstra retain the old employees? They could have avoided the high cost of redundancy payments. But Telstra wanted to change the work culture, so they got rid of the, dare I say it, ‘deadwood’ and brought in new blood. But this approach has been criticised by the quality guru W. Edwards Demming. When he went to consult for a company he was told that they were getting rid of the deadwood. So he asked this most important question: ‘Were they dead when you hired them or did you kill them?’ What has happened to the work force as a result of getting rid of the deadwood? A conference on an ageless work force in Sydney last August was told that since 1970 the proportion of men between 55 and 59 in the work force has fallen from almost 90 per cent to 72 per cent. In the 60 to 64 age group it has fallen from 75 per cent to 45 per cent. For over-65s, it has fallen from 22 per cent to eight per cent. That is a whole forest of deadwood. And what comment did we get from this government? The Minister for Ageing told the conference: From time to time, a particular generation of Australians is called upon to rebuild our society in order to secure its ongoing prosperity. That time is now. You will notice that it is society and not the economy that is called on. The next thing you know the Minister for Ageing will be printing posters, like that old Uncle Sam one, telling older Australians that their country needs them. One minute we have organisations, including government agencies, throwing people onto the scrap heap and the next minute they are telling them they are needed to help to rebuild our society. The Prime Minister told the conference that he would ask the business leaders in his community business partnership to develop policies to encourage mature age people to stay in the work force. The conference heard of companies making an effort to retain older workers. Interestingly, one company was Westpac Bank, which is recruiting 900 older workers. It was said that they were an asset in dealing with older customers, who sometimes felt younger staff were not experienced enough. But wasn’t that what happened 30 years ago? Nothing is new under the sun. But, while our Prime Minister is talking to business leaders, the Italian Prime Minister is talking about increasing the retirement age from 57 to 62 in that country. In Germany, a government commission has recommended raising the average retirement age to 67, with no-one allowed to retire before the age of 64. But the effect of such changes can already be predicted. According to Peter Saunders, Director of Social Policy Research at the Centre for Independent Studies, since 1980 in Australia the proportion of the working aged population claiming the disability support pension has grown from two per cent to five per cent. That is 630,000 Australians on disability pensions. Saunders says: The typical claimant today is male, over 50 and diagnosed with a bad back or psychological condition. He comes straight from unemployment rolls. So this is where the deadwood finishes up. When the Prime Minister speaks to business leaders he might like to ask them the same question asked by W. Edwards Demming: were they dead when they hired them, or did they kill them? Age discrimination legislation should not MAIN COMMITTEE be looked at as a means of getting more older workers back into the work force. It should stop them from leaving in the first place. Another example of a model organisation given at the Sydney conference was Australia Post. This is the same enlightened organisation that has been in a bitter dispute with its staff over its sacking of workers-and the member for Canberra knows about this-with minor disabilities. There is nothing in this legislation to protect those workers. In fact, by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for the conduct complained about in order for the complaint to be upheld, it makes the test much harder to meet. Employers will still be able to get away with age discrimination by introducing any other lawful reason-and age discrimination is not obvious at the time. An employee at age 40 who is denied the opportunity to upgrade his or her skills will almost certainly face redundancy at age 50 because they no longer have the skills required for the job. But the government’s position, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, is: ... the primary solution to most aspects of age discrimination is based on education and attitudinal change. In doing so, it is critical that the legislation not establish barriers to such positive developments, for example, by restricting employment opportunities for older Australians by imposing unnecessary costs and inflexibility on employers acting in good faith. This is the neat split that the government allows in this important issue of human rights. The Minister for Ageing tells us that it is a problem for society to fix, but the legislation says that economic reasons should prevail-and social and economic goals are not always compatible. We should also recognise that age differences lead to different work cultures, and such clashing of work cultures may lead to discrimination. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, you might remember the Tennessee Ernie Ford song 16 Tons, which goes-I will not sing it; the honourable member for Canberra knows the type of singing voice I have, so I will just say it-‘You load 16 tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt.’ While that applies very much to generation Xers, for many baby boomers it is no longer true. They have paid off the mortgage and have picked up a nice redundancy package-the one they got for having the wrong work culture! Many in government jobs can access superannuation at age 55, and others have built their wealth sufficiently to be less dependent on full-time employment. One particular group in that category is migrants to Australia. Research note No. 35 published by the Parliamentary Library this year noted that migrant participation in the labour force has been trending downwards, from 65 per cent in 1978 to 57 per cent in 2002. As the migrant population on average is older, this in part can be expected. But the paper also noted that, during the 1990-91 recession, that rate dropped sharply from 62 per cent to 59 per cent. The paper concluded that the long term of the recession caused many migrants to leave the labour force rather than remain unemployed. Some of this group may have become part of the Peter Saunders army of disability pensioners, but still others would have left the work force to live off their savings. We should realise that many migrants to Australia have come from areas where life expectancies were lower than our retirement age. Like the year 9 students I talked of previously, their ambition may have been to accumulate wealth in order to retire early. Those migrants from countries without age pensions may have already expected to fund their own retirement and may have brought it forward by a few years. I can think of many examples in my electorate of Fowler regarding early retirees who would fit that pattern. MAIN COMMITTEE As well as that group, we also have the SeaChange generation-those baby boomers who have sold their city homes and purchased smaller and cheaper homes on the coast. Until recently they were able to pocket quite large sums from the sale of their city property and use that cash to partly fund their early retirement. In my own circle of friends, hardly a conversation goes by without there being some reference to retirement. But they are the lucky onesthe ones who have been able to build wealth through home ownership and superannuation or with big redundancy payments. As the sign on the side of the bus that I was discussing earlier suggests, leaving work early has been a dream of many Australians. Governments and business now want to wake us from that dream. In August last year, following the US stock market crash, the cover of Time Magazine exclaimed, ‘I’ll never be able to retire.’ There were dire predictions of the social security system buckling under the weight of retiring baby boomers. Again we saw the economic arguments put forward and the calls for society to make sacrifices. But businesses which for years have given older workers the rough end of the stick only seem prepared to make some minor changes-and it is no different in Australia. So far I have given only half of the picture. The other half is the real worry. I mentioned the proportion of older men in the work force and how their numbers were shrinking; but for women it is a different picture. For women aged 55 to 59, the percentage in the work force has increased from 29 per cent to 38 per cent and, for those aged 60 to 64, it has increased from 16 per cent to 17 per cent. Fewer women have full superannuation and access to savings. Family break-ups have left many women fending for themselves at a time of life when they would previously have expected to have been supported. A friend of mine had, in her late 40s, lost her husband to cancer. She had not worked since she started a family, and she had cared for her husband in his final months. She asked me how she could get a widow’s pension. I had to tell her that there was no such thing anymore and that she would have to apply for a Newstart allowance and look for a job. It came as a real shock to her, as her own mother had lost her husband at a similar age and had lived on a pension ever since. My friend was lucky enough to own her home and to get some compensation for her husband’s death. She is now in her late 50s but she still has to work. There are many other women without their own home and without any savings. They face the prospect of working until they are 60. We therefore have two distinct groups in the aged work force: those for whom work is optional and those for whom work is compulsory. It is the second group that I fear will suffer most from age discrimination. They have the least economic power and are disadvantaged in other ways. I doubt that when the former Minister for Ageing called on us to rebuild our society it was in the interest of older workers who have no alternative but to work until they drop; it is not in their interest. As he says, we should rebuild our society in order to secure its ongoing prosperity. He is happy to mix economic goals with social sacrifice. The problems that we will face as a nation to ensure that older Australians are able to choose a rewarding lifestyle will not be easily overcome, but the solutions should not place an unfair burden on those older Australians who are least able to cope. The economic goals of our nation’s businesses, which themselves are largely responsible for our present circumstances, should not be allowed to trample the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens. They should be protected by the strongest possible measures against age MAIN COMMITTEE discrimination. In searching for answers to dealing with an ageing population, we should remember that we are a society first and an economy second. Workers, young or old, should not be treated as factory fodder, as resources to be used up and thrown on the scrap heap when they are no longer required. As a society we have a responsibility to ensure that each of us enjoys at least some time in the third age-the years of retirement. It should be the right of us all, not the privilege of a lucky few. Age discrimination legislation must ensure that all older Australians are guaranteed the right to employment and to education and have access to the full range of services and laws which make us all equal members of our society. Ms ELLIS (Canberra) (11.59 a.m.)-I am very pleased to speak today in this cognate debate on the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and the Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003 in my capacity as shadow minister for ageing and seniors. I often emphasise to people I meet that I am the shadow minister for ageing and seniors, not aged care-and that is a very important distinction. Australians are living longer and healthier lives than ever before, and policy relating to older Australians extends far beyond aged care. Other major issues for older Australians include retirement incomes, paid employment, volunteering, social participation, family care, relationships, education and recreation. Unfortunately, society has quite a negative perception of ageing and the ageing process. In their book called Australia’s New Aged: Issues for Young and Old, John McCallum and Karin Geiselhart state: Stereotypes and maladaptive structures persist, and make it difficult for older people to create a positive identity. It is not surprising that older people are discriminated against when you consider how society portrays them. Think about the media images thrown at us on a daily basis in magazines and on television, especially in advertising. We are faced daily with images of young people glowing with health, happiness and success. We are encouraged to believe that only the young can achieve these goals and, of course, that we can stop our ageing process by buying products. Betty Friedan wrote a wonderful book called The Fountain of Age, which aimed to revolutionise our ideas about age and how we live our lives. In the early chapters, Friedan discusses the denial of ageing by society and how ageing is portrayed as a problem. We cannot then be surprised that older Australians face discrimination. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report Age matters gives many examples of how people, both young and old, are discriminated against. Today, due to the limited time available, I will limit my speech to issues relating to discrimination against older Australians, although clearly it is also a problem for younger people. Several Australian reports since 1999 have highlighted the issues and barriers for mature age workers, including the report I mentioned earlier, Age matters, by the human rights commission. The report states that the human rights commission has received numerous complaints about employment related age discrimination. Most of the submissions to the commission following the release of its discussion paper on age discrimination focused on discrimination faced by older job seekers. The report refers to statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1998 which showed that almost two-thirds of unemployed job seekers aged over 55 reported that they have difficulty finding work because they are considered too old by employers. MAIN COMMITTEE There is a great deal of research that shows that older workers, once they become unemployed, are more likely to stay unemployed. According to the report Age can work by Emeritus Professor Encel for the ACTU and the Business Council of Australia: A wide range of factors have been identified as contributing to the barriers to employment for older workers, including employer attitudes, community attitudes, and the behaviour of older workers themselves. This is supported by research undertaken by Eyal Gringart at Edith Cowan University which was presented recently at the National Symposium on Ageing Research. Dr Gringart’s research found that employers were reluctant to hire older workers, even though those workers may have the same qualifications, experience and knowledge as their younger counterparts. The employers had many perceptions about older workers that were untrue-for example, that they were not adaptable to new technology, were less able to be trained than younger workers and had reduced memory capability. In its submission to the human rights commission, the Council on the Ageing stated that age discrimination was the most important issue facing older people in the labour market. Clearly, there are some major barriers for older job seekers, and hopefully the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 will begin to address this problem. I am very pleased about this new bill, but I am a little concerned about the focus being placed on the need-I repeat, the need-for older people to stay in the work force just so that they do not place too much stress on the younger generations. A lot of the arguments used for keeping older people in the work force are actually based on quite a negative view towards older Australians. This view is that older people are a burden on society and must ‘continue to pay their way’. It seems to suggest that, unless people are in the paid work force, they are not valuable citizens. The government’s Intergenerational Report certainly portrays older Australians in a very negative light. According to the report: … a steadily ageing population is likely to continue to place significant pressure on Commonwealth government finances. In addition, on the basis of recent trends it seems likely that technological advancement, particularly in health care, and the community’s expectation of accessing the latest health treatments will continue to place increased demands on taxpayers’ funds. The government seems to see ageing Australians through a purely financial framework that turns them into an impost on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, on the age and service pensions and on younger generations. The government constantly talks about our ageing population and the need for them to continue working-basically, until they drop. I would like to stress that we should encourage older people to stay in the work force, but only if they are able and want to continue working. Let us not see the introduction of this legislation as a way of keeping older people in the work force purely to prevent them from being a burden to our society. I see this legislation as a step towards reducing the discrimination faced by older people looking for work and those who want to stay in the work force. And as I said earlier, it is a very important step forward; it identifies specific areas of operation where age discrimination is prohibited. They are: employment, including contractors and agencies; education; access to premises; access to goods, services and facilities; accommodation; disposal of land; administration of Commonwealth laws and programs; and requests for information. It covers both direct and indirect discrimination. I note that this legislation complements existing state and territory laws on age discrimination. MAIN COMMITTEE I welcome this legislation, but there is room for improvement. I support the amendment proposed by the shadow Attorney-General to improve the scope of the bill in three ways. Firstly, Labor’s amendment would extend the operation of the bill to include relatives or associates. The state/territory anti-discrimination laws extend discrimination to include the age of a person’s relative or associate. It is possible to imagine circumstances where discrimination might occur against someone who is applying for a job and has an elderly relative that they are looking after. The employer may be reluctant to employ the job seeker due to a concern that the person may need to take time off work to care for their relative. The information paper on the legislation shows that the government considered this option but decided against it. I am very well aware of the problems faced by carers in our society, particularly in relation to opportunities for education, training and employment. This amendment would go a long way towards assisting our hard-working carers, who make many sacrifices to care for their loved ones. Secondly, Labor’s amendment would include in the act a test that age discrimination is one or more of the reasons, rather than the dominant reason, for the discrimination. In this bill, the government has watered down the test for whether particular conduct constitutes age discrimination by requiring that age discrimination be the dominant reason for conduct complained about. This requirement is a much harder test than that which applies under the state/territory laws dealing with age discrimination. Generally in anti-discrimination laws the relevant test is met even if the discriminatory action is only one of several reasons for the conduct that is the ground for the complaint. The government’s reasons for the more difficult threshold to maintain the complaint are not based on sound reasoning and are at odds with the government’s reasons for introducing the legislation more broadly. Thirdly, Labor’s amendment would include in the legislation age based harassment. The government considered including age based harassment in the legislation, but unfortunately seems to have succumbed to business concerns over the issue and declined in the legislation to ban age based harassment. I have no doubt that a situation might arise where an older worker is harassed in the workplace because of their age. The changes in the amendment proposed by Labor would change this legislation from being one of the weakest in Australia to being one of the best. With the changes proposed in this amendment, this legislation has the opportunity to promote tolerance and allow older Australians to make their important contribution to our nation. Older Australians have so much to contribute to society. I will end my speech with a quote from Betty Friedan’s A Fountain of Age: I think it is time we start searching for the fountain of age, time that we stop denying our growing older, and look at the actuality of our own experience, and that of other women and men who have gone beyond denial to a new place in their sixties, seventies, eighties. It is time to look at age on its own terms, and put names on its values and strengths as they are actually experienced, breaking through the definition of age solely as deterioration or decline from youth. Finally, Friedan says it is time to ‘step out into the true existential unknown of these new years of life now open to us, and to find our own terms for living it’. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.11 p.m.)-I rise today to welcome the bills before us-the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and the Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003. These bills give me the rare opportunity to actually commend the government on taking some positive action in respect of human rights. I commend the government on the introducMAIN COMMITTEE tion of this legislation. This legislation has been warmly welcomed by my supporters; however, there has been some criticism about the length of time it has taken to actually introduce this legislation. Most notably, the government, before even taking office in 1996, made a statement about older workers and said that it was going to do something about age discrimination-and it has taken quite a long time to introduce these bills. But, as many would say, better late than never. Before anybody opposite gets too excited with me stating that I commend the government, I will state that the bills have several large flaws. For legislation which is about eliminating age discrimination, it has in fact entrenched it in one particular case. It is also ironic that I am here commending the government for action in respect of human rights when it has such an appalling record on human rights-which has again been amply demonstrated this week with the posthaste decision to excise several more Australian islands from the migration zone before 14 Turks could seek asylum. The overall aims of this legislation are to eliminate age discrimination in specific areas and to attempt to play a key role in changing negative attitudes about both older and younger workers. The legislation bestows on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission the responsibility to educate the public about this area of discrimination. In November 2001 a human rights commissioner wrote that age discrimination complaints made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission between 1999-2000 and 2000-01 had tripled and that more than 200 people had phoned the complaints information line after being deemed ‘too old for a position’. This reflects the complaints I get daily in my office. I recently had a rather respected member of my community come to see me. He has been active in many community activities, but was recently made redundant. So, as many people do in this day and age, he had been walking around to the numerous job agencies. At one he went to, the form requested that he fill out his date of birth-which he refused to do, noting to me that he was about to turn 50 and thought that, if he had filled out his date of birth, there would be no hope of actually getting the job. The agency declined to take him on as a prospective candidate for any jobs that were to be advertised through that agency. He was brave enough to make the decision to go before the Equal Opportunity Commission in the Victorian sphere, where the legislation currently exists, but the problem was that, in the intervening period, he had gained employment. So he actually did not have a complaint against the agency but he had a complaint about the overall impact this has on people in their daily lives. He came to see me and asked, ‘ShouldI go through with it?’ I told him that it was a fairly onerous decision to go to one of those commissions-having represented people there on numerous occasions-and I told him that he needed to decide whether he wanted to do that. I did give him some very important advice, and that was: ‘You should never go to these things on your own; always take someone with you because it can be fairly daunting. You do not need a lawyer, but please get someone to at least hold your hand.’ He decided that the issue was so great that he really wanted to say to this agency, ‘You cannot force people to demonstrate their age.’ Lo and behold, the agency turned up-they must have seen their lawyers before they arrived-and said, ‘We’re terribly sorry; we’ve changed our procedure and we’re no longer asking for age on our applications.’ I thought that was fantastic. Here was a gentleman who had actually gone through this not for his own personal benefit but for the benefit of all. These things happen daily. MAIN COMMITTEE Unfortunately, there will be some fairly negative impacts of this legislation. The most glaringly obvious is that it actually enshrines age discrimination against youth by ensuring that wage based differential rates still exist. I always thought that equal pay for equal work was exactly that and should not be assessed on the basis of what age you are. I had my first job at 15, selling popcorn and fairy floss, and on more than one occasion I was left completely in charge of the popcorn and fairy floss van, which meant that I had to make my popcorn and fairy floss, deal with customers and their screaming children, deal with cash and all the rest of it. I was paid the measly sum of $1 an hour for that wonderful experience of being totally in charge-on numerous occasions I was totally in charge all day, and of three other staff. I am not saying we should be paid more money for that, but this replicates what happens day in and day out in the employment experiences of many Australians, particularly within the retail industry. Even though people are under 21-they may be 18, 19 or 20-they are on a different rate to someone else in the store, and sometimes they are in charge of that individual. It is just ridiculous, and it is ridiculous that we are welcoming in an age discrimination bill which enshrines this inherent foible. It is interesting to note that in the Bills Digest it says: It is apparent on the face of the Bill that there is a focus on the concerns of older workers rather than younger. According to at least one report many youth advocates ‘are angry that changes to Federal Government age discrimination laws … ignore young people in favour of protecting older employees.’ This report goes on to point out that ‘of the 30 people involved in the (core) consultative group set up by the Federal Government to review the current laws, only four represented youth organisations.’ One of the issues concerning youth which arguably remains unresolved is the question of youth wages. This has been a troubled area which has resurfaced in an on-going manner. It is interesting to note that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission also has not supported the permanent exemption for youth wages within the legislation. I note in the Bills Digest that HREOC noted: ... ‘the unanimous view of youth organisations and young people in submissions to the (age discrimination) inquiry (were) that junior rates are exploitative, not protective, and should be repealed.’ The Commission concluded that there was inconclusive evidence about what effect abolishing youth rates would have on the youth labour market overall. Robert Ludbrook, of the National Children’s and Youth Law Centre in Sydney, has commented: ‘The law is grossly unfair. People would say equal pay for equal work when they think about women in the workplace, but that does not seem to apply to young people. The justification for this is two-fold. People say because young people lack experience and maturity they are usually not as good workers as older people; and that if kids receive the same pay as adults then employers will hire adults instead, but there is no evidence to support either of these propositions.’ So in one respect it seems highly ludicrous that I am welcoming an age discrimination bill that actually enshrines age discrimination. Another area in which age discrimination has been enshrined is immigration. AgainI think it is interesting that the bill has exempted areas of discrimination in respect of age for immigration. In my office I regularly have issues to deal with regarding immigration. One of them is about skilled migration. This country is suffering from a massive skill shortage and yet this bill is locking out the opportunity for people of 45 years plus to come into this country on skill based migration visas. MAIN COMMITTEE Another issue I often have to deal with in my office is where people are applying for business migration. Again, there is a cut-off age that this bill will not assist. Yes, you can get exemptions from it, but it is quite difficult, and not everybody in the world knows Mr Karim Kisrwani. It makes it fairly difficult when we are welcoming a bill that is still enshrining some of these inherent obstacles in respect of age. I think that probably the bill’s greatest benefit will be to the mature age employment market. I stood in this place some time ago-in this very room-to welcome the Age counts report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, which I think was one of the better reports to be released in our time. Sadly, we have seen no government response to that report or to those many beneficial recommendations. I mentioned one of the recommendations in my speech at that time. It reads: The Committee recommends that the Government develop, in consultation with the States/Territories, a sustained national strategy and campaign targeting employers, to promote the benefits of maturity and age-balance in the workforce. Sadly, we have not seen this occur. We have seen the entrenchment of age discrimination in employment, particularly within the managerial section. We are now seeing ageist decisions being made in respect of people being locked out of the work force. Earlier this year I introduced into the House a private member’s bill in respect of mature age unemployment. In my motion I noted that statistics may not reveal the true extent of the unemployment problem for over 45s, the implications of this and so on. Many members got up to speak on that bill and recounted, time and time again, the experiences that their constituents have had of discrimination in respect of work. Only this week I received yet another letter from a constituent, which I would like to read. It says: I am very angry about the way the over 40’s are beginning treated in a very unfair way by employment agencies and employers. Trying to get a job in administration with 25 year of experience and over 40 employers don’t want to know you because you are to old for the position and end up giving a younger person the job so they don’t have to pay so much in taxes or in wages. I have been told the following by employers. 1/ You have the skills we are looking for but you are to old for the position we are really looking for a younger person to fill the position. Hopefully, with this legislation they will never be able to tell them that again. The letter continues: 2/ You will get very board in the position and leave in a few months time for something better. 3/ Management has made a decision to combine the admin job and a pca job together this was not in the job description or in the paper FALSE ADVERTISING. 4/ Companies don’t acknowledge your resume does the job really exist. Jobs can be on the touch screens up to 6 to 8 weeks before beginning deleted from the system after the position has been filled. MAIN COMMITTEE The people who work in them have know idea about the employment market most of them have marketing degrees and don’t know how to help people in their 40’s to gain employment yet if you are just out of school there are plenty of traineeships in office administration BUT NO TRAINEESHIPS for the older people how are we supposed to gain new skills to help us get a job in a different area. JOB MATCHING SYSTEM Another failed system I have been asked to call employers about jobs via the system which I don’t have the skills for ... She notes particularly that this includes teaching English overseas. At the end of the letter she asks: Does the government want us to stay at home all day and watch t.v I don’t think so I do volunteer work to keep my admin skills up to date. I am not going to give in I am not a lazy person I apply up to 12 jobs or more a week. She also asks whether the current government could: ... pass a policy that would allow the unemployed to claim postage ect on out tax returns as the new start allowance does not really cover that time you pay the bills. That is an example of the kind of thing that is coming through my door daily. It is quite entertaining to look at the age demographic of the members of parliament. One of the interesting things about people coming into parliament is that they are getting older. While the rest of the work force is getting younger, people coming into parliament are getting older. I would have thought it would be the reverse, but the average age of people in the parliament in 1901 was 48.1. The average age in 2000 was 49.3. Here we have the majority of people, particularly in the House of Representatives, are over 45. We have one work force that is quite happy to accept people who are over 45; we have thousands and thousands of people out there who are quite happy to send people who are over 45 off to work in this place and represent them. We have a very skewed view of the world. Out in the employment market, they do not want to employ anybody who is over 45. In fact, they make them redundant in their droves. In my previous incarnation, before entering this place, I had to deal daily with middle managers who were being made redundant at 45. They entered the bank at age 15 or 16 and had been there all their lives. They had gone up the ranks, done training at home or done degrees on the side. Suddenly they got to 45 and the world no longer needed middle managers and no longer needed these people’s skills. Nor could they get jobs outside. Most of these people ended up taking contract casual work to get by. But, with the ageing of the population and people starting to have children later, most of these people still had school age children. So they still had a rather large debt burden. They were still paying off their mortgages and trying to raise their children. This put huge imposts upon them, and I was quite often traumatised by individuals coming in who just could not work out how they were going to cope in this brave new world. Whilst we have a lot of people aged over 45 in the parliament, we have a lot of people in that same age bracket outside the parliament who cannot get work and are being made redundant. Unfortunately, we have trends that are seeing the rise in the age of our population. There are many out there who are saying that by 2020 there will be more dissavers than savers. That means there will be more people outside the work force than inside the work force by 2020. That is not very far off. The Treasurer’s Intergenerational Report noted that in 2002 the proMAIN COMMITTEE portion of people aged over 65 compared to the proportion of people of traditional labour force age-15 to 64-was 19 per cent. This is projected to rise to almost 41 per cent by 2042. So we will be seeing quite a skew in the age demographic of our work force. One of the other great problems with this bill is that it will place more pressure on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission while at the same time the government is denuding the role of the commission. In the House at the moment there is a bill, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), which is seeking to take away many powers from resources. The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is yet another of this government’s many attempts to stifle the voice of HREOC, particularly in the area that relates to the scrutiny of government activities in the human rights field. We need only look at the government’s present reluctance to fill a vacant position on the commission to find evidence of their desire to leave this invaluable body underresourced. Indeed, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women stated that it was quite concerned about the delay in appointing a sex discrimination commissioner. The bill before the House in respect of HREOC seeks not to replace any commissioners, and not to have defined commissioners. The government has also been extracting the watchdog’s teeth with the financial pincers. The government has extracted 40 per cent of approximately one-third, with many major inquiry works already abandoned as a direct consequence. The government is progressing well on its way to its desired metamorphosis of the commission from potential doberman to subservient lap-dog. The supposed rationale for the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) was outlined in the Attorney-General’s second reading speech, where he described HREOC as inefficient, top heavy and in need of fundamental cultural change. According to the Attorney-General, the bill will make the commission more efficient and focus upon the delivery of community and business education. This is a poor excuse; more than that, it is not true. In fact, this change will move the commission away from its multipronged approach whereby it is able to fulfil many essential functions, such as handling conciliation-specific complaints, inquiring into cultural attitudes in the workplace and society, promoting public education, advocating human rights issues and, most importantly, acting as a scrutineer of the government’s compliance with human rights and antidiscrimination legislation. HREOC will be a mere shadow of its former self. Under the legislation, HREOC will become a toothless tiger, gagged and constrained by the government’s own leash. It will be forced to focus more on the narrowly defined priority of education alone, a function that is already within its purview. The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is an attack on an institution that has an international reputation for excellence, has protected the rights of ordinary Australians and has ensured that the government is meeting its obligations under human rights conservations. Attempting to place themselves above public and legal scrutiny once again, we are witnessing the government’s intention to quash the rights of the individual, the dispossessed, the disempowered and the neglected. It is the marginalised and disadvantaged of our society who are most likely to suffer at the hands of this discrimination. On the one hand we have a bill that will place more requirements on HREOC but, on the other hand, we have the government MAIN COMMITTEE taking away its right to do many of the things that will need to be done in respect of this legislation. More than that, it is not going to have the resources to do so. There are several technical problems with the bills before us, but speakers before me have gone through them. In conclusion, I want to state that these bills are a step in the right direction, and I wish to add my voice in support of the legislation here today. But I want to sound my note of reservation and caution with the limitations of the bills and to state again that I cannot believe I am supporting legislation dealing with age based discrimination that will actually enshrine discrimination. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Telstra: Privatisation erful organisations within our society. They affect the social and economic life of all Australians. These organisations are also at the leading edge of information and communications technology, which significantly enhances their power even further. At a time when the government seems intent on the full privatisation of this organisation, it is more important than ever that issues relating to Telstra’s culture and its technological capacity to potentially invade the privacy of citizens be kept under close attention. Any such invasion of privacy is absolutely unacceptable whether or not the organisation is in majority government ownership; but at least under majority government ownership there are some checks and balances, which would not be in place if the organisation were fully privatised. In this context I want to refer the Main Committee to an article that appeared in Tuesday’s edition of the IT section of the Australian newspaper. The article is headed ‘Phone database “abused”’. The article states: The telecommunications watchdog is investigating abuse of a huge national database containing personal information on every Australian with a phone connection. The Australian Communications Authority is concerned that companies may be misusing information stored in the database, which is meant to supply data for emergency services, law enforcement and directory services. The review of the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND), managed by Telstra, was requested after the ACA began investigating a company on suspicion of contravening the code of practice that governs use of information in the database. That indeed is a most serious matter and one which I am sure the House will want to continue to monitor. However, on this issue of privacy, I have had several other matters drawn to my attention. One relates to Val Butler, who is a Telstra employee at the National Telemarketing Centre in Burwood. It is alleged that her telephone calls were recorded and her mail opened at work. She also had her activities, including reports and records of her out-of-work activities, recorded. I further understand that, after investigation, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission agreed that there was a prima facie case that Telstra had engaged in such activities. A constituent, Mr Peter Zabrdac, has come to see me, alleging that, without authority or permission, telephone conversations between himself and a Telstra employee and telephone MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Ccamlr Is Unusual In One Sense It Is Not A Fishing Management Agency But Rather Is

196,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (12.30 P.m.),"Telstra and its subsidiaries are very powconversations between a Telstra employee and his mother were recorded improperly by Telstra. Telstra has apparently done an internal investigation and rejects these claims. However, what concerns Mr Zabrdac is that the calls in question were logged. In one instance it was for 13 seconds; in another instance, it was for 31 seconds; and, in another instance, it was for one minute and two seconds. Telstra has provided transcripts of these conversations, which are done in very considerable detail and which Telstra apparently claims were taken down by hand by a Telstra employee. I know there are many outstanding employees of Telstra, but it would be an absolutely remarkable feat to record these sorts of conversations in such a short period of time and with the remarkable degree of accuracy that was presented to Mr Zabrdac in transcript form. He continues to believe that his telephone conversations and those of his mother were improperly recorded by Telstra. That allegation is extremely serious. I think on the face of it there is some evidence to support his concerns, particularly in light of the other abuses that appear to have occurred by Telstra utilising its technology in circumstances that suit it. Mr Zabrdac’s union has taken up his concerns with Telstra. They indicate that he believes that Telstra is treating him in a manner that only pays lip-service to his complaints and that it is putting obstacles in the way of resolving his complaints. These sorts of issues go to the question of the culture of Telstra management and its capacity to make use, potentially and allegedly, of its high-technology capacity to act improperly, including against its own employees when there is an issue involved. These allegations go very much to issues of confidence in Telstra and its capacity-and, as I indicated, not just Telstra but its subsidiary companies-and very much reflect, I believe, on the importance of retaining Telstra in majority government ownership. As I indicated at the start of my speech, there can be very serious concerns indeed presently about Telstra’s conduct in these sorts of matters. How much more of a threat to the privacy of the community would there be in circumstances where Telstra was in totally private hands? Macarthur Electorate: Infrastructure sue in my electorate of Macarthur-that is, future planning and the supply of infrastructure. All of us in this place are elected as representatives of our areas to work hard to ensure that there is proper infrastructure and planning for future generations-to make sure there are hospitals, schools, water and sewerage supply, roads and public transport. While infrastructure planning is the responsibility of state governments, many members of this place work with their local councils and state governments to ensure that the views of the electorates are considered when new developments are proposed. This is especially important in an area like my electorate of Macarthur, south-west of Sydney. Here is an area that has grown beyond all expectations in the last 20 years-from a small country town to a major suburban outpost of Sydney. It is one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia. The population of Camden, for instance, has grown by over 25 per cent in the last five years. Recently WSROC, the organisation representing Western Sydney councils, wrote to all Western Sydney MPs, telling us that the population in our area will grow by up to half a million in the next 15 years. Driven by affordable housing and an abundance of land, young families and first home buyers flocked to my region in the 1980s and 1990s, creating the suburbs in and around Camden and Campbelltown. I, myself, was one of those young home buyMAIN COMMITTEE",158,Adjournment
197,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (12.35 P.m.),"I rise today to talk about the most important isers. I picked up a parcel of land at Eschol Park in the 1980s and built my first home on it. The New South Wales government opened the floodgates, releasing land at an alarming rate. As our neighbourhoods grew, we noticed a lack of services. Week after week, more families moved into new homes but we struggled to see the bus services, the schools and the major roads planned and built to accommodate the population. All of us could be forgiven for thinking that there was no plan for future infrastructure by the state government. While they were happy to levy stamp duty on all new homes, nobody could see where the funding was going. Now, 20 years later, Bob Carr is proposing another major development in my region-this time, 90,000 new homes in and around my electorate in the Bringelly region. This is an issue which will impact on all of south-western Sydney, especially my electorate of Macarthur, which takes in most of the Bringelly area. It cannot happen until we see plans for infrastructure in the form of new roads and improvements to existing roads, like the Northern Road and Camden Valley Way. This is without even starting on the new schools, upgraded hospitals and other essential services needed for the increased population that will come with these new houses. Aside from this, there are serious concerns in my local community about the potential environmental impact caused by the release. It saddens me today that, despite my best efforts, I have not been able to get any concrete information on this release for my constituents. It was announced on 5 December last year by the Deputy Premier, Mr Refshauge, with this promise: The government is committed to quality planning and design for these communities of the future. He went on to say: The mistakes of the previous government will not be repeated and the residents of these new suburbs will not be short changed. In the 10 months since that announcement, I have not been able to get any information on the proposed development and its impact on our local air, traffic and infrastructure. A series of planning workshops were held earlier in the year with the local government and the state government. My request to attend these was ignored and denied. Since then, the public has been kept in the dark, and I have not seen any articles in the local papers. My written request to be kept briefed by the state planning minister was fobbed off. I wrote in May, asking to be briefed as the development progressed and, four months later, after most of the preliminary planning has been done, I received a response. It was said that, once planning investigations were compiled by Mr Knowles, we would be given a briefing later on in the year. While Mr Knowles’s offer was thought appropriate at the time, I fear it will be a case of too little, too late. Almost 12 months after the initial announcement, Camden Council has now been told that this may be on public exhibition by the end of this year. A recent council meeting condemned the state government for proposing to exhibit these plans at Christmas.

199,Mr Zahra,"I ask for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker, from these hard men of theelectoral district one of the important parts of that visit was that we went to Trafalgar High School. Trafalgar High School represents one of those great country high schools that are what secondary education in country districts is all about. They have about 550 students. Unlike a lot of other country high schools, they run an accelerated learning program, and nearly 120 kids from right across the Latrobe Valley participate in that program and are able to get a type of learning that might not usually be available to kids in country areas. So that is a particularly good thing about Trafalgar High School. It is a very friendly school and a school where there is strong leadership in Bill Slater, and there is a very warm and welcoming school community there as well. We had a forum with a number of the year 11 students there and we asked how many of the 50 or so students there intended to go on to university. It was a large proportion of them. We also put the question to them as to how many of them intended to take a year off. A large proportion of those students who intended to go to university responded. When we asked the students what the motivating factor was behind them telling us that they were going to take a year off they said that it was because they could not afford to go to university. This is a big issue for a lot of country kids. While it is my strong view that increasing HECS does deter students who are from families that do not have much money from going to university, certainly I would say that those places that are made available for full fee paying students overwhelmingly go to students in Melbourne and Sydney. It is important to understand that for country kids the additional cost of having to leave their home town and move to Melbourne or Sydney is another very large and often not talked about cost. The average cost, as I understand from speaking to parents who have kids in this circumstance, is about $10,000 per year, to be able to put up a son or daughter in a flat in Melbourne and be able to provide some type of support to them as they go about their studies. This is in addition to the cost of HECS and all those other associated costs to do with their education. So the point I am making today is that, while it is important for us to talk in general terms about how increases to HECS-and the government has proposed to increase HECS by 30 per cent-will be a big deterrent to students trying to get into university, it is important for us to understand in more specific terms that for country students there is an additional financial barrier towards being able to take up a place at university. For country districts which do not have a lot of money, like the Latrobe Valley, and west and south Gippsland, it is a really difficult thing that people are asked to do, even if they are able to get a university place. Even if they are smart enough and have worked hard enough to get those good results, even if they are lucky enough to get offered a place at university and even if they take the courageous decision to accept entry into that course-knowing full well that the HECS cost for them will be very large-there is still the very real issue of how they will support themselves every year while they are going about their university education. It is important that we in this place do not forget about those people. Jenny Macklin was able to get across very clearly to the students that we talked to the importance of higher education as a worthwhile thing to pursue. She also gave a lot of encouragement to the students who were talking about getting an apprenticeship and getting into a trade. Certainly, there is no doubt at all that we need more tradespeople in our country, and this is an area of identified skill shortage. MAIN COMMITTEE Canning Electorate: Health day the provision of doctors in my electorate of Canning. In recent times I have surveyed in particular the council of the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale in my electorate to identify the wants and the needs of my constituents in that region, and particularly to find out their preferred location for doctors. That was one of the largest responses to a survey I have received from the public. Interestingly, there was only two per cent separating the choice of having a doctor located at Serpentine or the town of Mundijong. In my electorate we have one of the highest per capita ratios of doctors to people in need of a doctor anywhere in Western Australia. Some of the inner suburbs of Perth such as South Perth have a very low ratio. As a result, the bulk-billing rates in the inner city areas are quite high because of the competition. The general public and those involved in this debate need to be continually reminded that bulk-billing is a product of the number of doctors. The more doctors you have, the greater the amount of bulk-billing; the fewer doctors you have, the less bulk-billing there is, because they do not see the need to compete for bulk-billing places. I have two areas of need in my electorate. They are in the Armadale-Kelmscott region and in the Serpentine-Jarrahdale region. I am pleased that the government is now putting in place measures. For example, the member for Petrie announced the other day that she had received three new doctors to areas in her electorate under the $80 million provision that was put in place just after the last federal election. That is now being extended. I am pleased to say that I have spoken to the new Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, about the provision of doctors in my area and I will be informing the electorate that within a very short period of time we will be allocating doctors to the areas of need, particularly the Serpentine-Jarrahdale area. I also have the support of the AMA in Western Australia in providing doctors to this area. They tell me, for example, that there are two doctors who already wish to join practices in Byford under Dr Lancee and Dr Beuters and that they will be joining their practices shortly. There is also another doctor who wishes to set up private practice under this scheme. Any doctor that does so receives an up-front fee of $30,000. I think it is quite exciting news. We are bringing more doctors to our area and that means that it will take the pressure off the current doctors in the area. It will also take the pressure off the Armadale-Kelmscott Hospital and it will give a better service to my constituents in Canning. A number of doctors are ready to fill the breach. Not only is the AMA making it easier but, as I said, the federal government is giving enormous incentives to doctors. For example, there are 2½ thousand overseas trained doctors in this country at the moment who could qualify for these schemes. I am told by the foreign doctors association in Australia that there are 500 doctors who could start immediately under this program. So the provision of doctors in this area is waiting to happen. I am pleased to say that my electorate of Canning will be a beneficiary of it. There is no more important issue than this. I feel great that I can deliver this on behalf of my constituents and that, ultimately, the mums and dads and families in my electorate are going to be happy with the fact that this government has listened to their wants and needs in this particular area. It is going to deliver and I am pleased to be a part of it. On a day when the government will announce that unemployment in this country has reached an all-time low of MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment

Telstra: Services visit by the Prime Minister to my electorate. Three months ago the Prime Minister saw fit to attend a couple of local functions in the electorate of Burke. Unfortunately, although it was held by the council, the council did not see fit to invite me or the state member for Macedon, Joanne Duncan, to the formal proceedings. We were excluded from those official functions, which was somewhat disappointing. It is not often that a Prime Minister comes to anyone’s electorate. It is such a privilege to have a Prime Minister-of whatever political persuasionattend your electorate, but to not be invited I think was the height of bad manners, to say the least. He was, however, accompanied by the member for McEwan, the interloper who managed to find her way into those functions, which underlined the point that the local representatives were ignored and neglected by the Prime Minister’s office, and I felt it was a callous and improper use of the Prime Minister’s office. The point I would like to make today is that the local media were in attendance at some of those functions, and they sought answers from the Prime Minister with respect to Telstra and the way in which some of the service deficiencies would be improved before the government would seek the sale of Telstra. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister failed to answer any of those questions. Indeed, there were questions that went to problems occurring in the town of Woodend, where there have been problems getting people on landlines quickly, which was a concern to me and is a concern I have had for some time now. I am also concerned that, despite the high-profile visit, nothing has been attended to. This matter gained some greater importance for me recently when I received correspondence from the father of a constituent who recently moved from a small town called Bullengarook to Woodend. The father spoke of his daughter, who is a single parent, and her child, who moved to Woodend. She has been attempting to get a line for over a month now, and she is concerned that she is not able to have it installed. I will not mention her name as I have not sought permission from her. I have spoken to her but, as I have not indicated that I would raise it publicly, I would rather not mention who she is. When the father wrote to me on her behalf, he indicated his concern that she has not had a landline installed in her new house in Woodend, which, by the way, is a sizeable town. How far from Melbourne is Woodend? Not a day’s drive; not 500 km-this town is one hour from the CBD of Melbourne. The woman has concerns because, as I say, she is a single parent and needs a landline for the business she is operating. She needs to be online to ensure she can have an income to look after her child and herself. I spoke to her again today and still there has been no connection made. She has, however-and I concede this-been given a small box, effectively a mobile phone, which helps her. I accept that mitigates the adverse effects of this failure by Telstra to connect her, but it does not provide her the capacity to engage in her work to provide an income, because she relies so heavily upon being online for work. Notwithstanding the Prime Minister’s visit, notwithstanding the government’s assertions that the Telstra deficiencies would be resolved prior to the attempts by the government to sell it, this is another example of where the government says one thing and does another; of where MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Adjournment

If Telstra is not in a position now to fix this problem for this woman and many others in this area, what will happen when Telstra is privatised? A private operator would not be looking after this woman and her child. Her child is ill. Obviously this is a major problem and it should be sorted out soon by this government and the Prime Minister, who took the liberty of coming to my electorate without notifying me, or anybody else, for that matter, representing the locals. Employment: WorkDirections New South Wales: the Premier comes into everybody’s electorate without inviting any Liberal members at all. If you want to talk about people not being invited, look anywhere in New South Wales where there is a Liberal member. The Premier comes in totally uninvited and never invites the local member. Job creation is essential to the economic security of a family. That is why one of the primary objectives of this government since 1996 has been reforms to make accessibility to employment available to every Australian. I am in the fortunate position of representing an electorate which has the third lowest unemployment rate in the country, at 2.58 per cent. On this very day, we have outstanding news: the unemployment rate has reduced to the very low figure of 5.6 per cent-a great success and a tribute to the very hard work done by this government in economic reform. A large part of the reason for such a low unemployment rate is the success of the Job Network program and the good work of WorkDirections. RecentlyI opened the new offices of Caringbah WorkDirections. WorkDirections works in conjunction with many services in the Sutherland Shire to provide a complete package of human resources options to employers and job seekers alike. WorkDirections adds value to the community in assisting job seekers from all areas of the community and in working hand in hand with other training organisations and community services in the area to create positive employment outcomes. It has a special focus on helping and creating opportunities for the long-term unemployed, women returning to the work force following child birth and family development, youth, Indigenous job seekers and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds. The local small business community in the Sutherland shire has a great community spirit in giving people a go. Through the mutual goals of local business and WorkDirections, the unemployed are now being given opportunities that did not previously exist. With helpful, friendly staff and personalised services and smart, easy to use technologies such as touchscreen kiosks, along with a committed government, I am sure that the unemployment rate will only fall. The changes that the government has made in employment services add very considerably to the government’s great efforts. We all remember, under the tired socialist government that we had previously, the bureaucratic approach to helping people find jobs. This government has created a competitive environment where the job creation network provides incentives, skills, assessment of individuals and the rigour that is required to get out there and assess people’s performance in finding jobs, and this can easily be quantified. In the old days, in the 13 years of Labor, such a thing did not occur. It is not surprising that we had unemployment levels well above 10 per cent for much of the time that they were in government.

It is a matter of trying to find the right opportunities for these people. Sometimes they have been unemployed for some time. The work done and the effort that is made in trying to find the right jobs for these types of people are very useful. The sense of pride they have in themselves in being able to maintain a job and the sense of opportunity that permeates in that office is commendable. I commend the Minister for Employment Services on his work and I commend this government on the creation of some 1.3 million jobs and on reducing unemployment levels, particularly on this very day when we have seen the level of unemployment reach record lows.

(2) Are such comments consistent with the Minister’s department’s obligations under the Coalition’s Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society; if not, what corrective action will the Minister take on the matter. (1) Yes. (2) My Department is committed to meeting its obligations under the Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society, which includes funding interpreting services to facilitate access to government funded services for all Australians. The National Blood Authority (on behalf of the Australian Government and State and Territory Governments) funds the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) to provide a national blood transfusion service for the collection and supply of blood products, blood related products and blood related services for Australia. I have been advised by the ARCBS that the ARCBS welcomes the support of all eligible people wanting to donate blood and plasma. Potential donors are required to meet Australia’s very strict guidelines, which determine the suitability of one person’s blood for transfusion to another. These guidelines help ensure Australia has one of the safest blood supplies in the world. The ARCBS confirms that it can accept non-English speaking donors, as long as they meet all eligibility criteria to donate blood. ARCBS has indicated it needs advance notice on the first visit if an interpreter is required. On the basis of this advice there is no need for any corrective action.

Following that announcement, the Government established the Government-Business Climate Change Dialogue to hear the views of business on the development of the Climate Change Forward Strategy. At the first meeting, on 21 August 2002, a process was established to encourage industry to undertake a considered assessment of the issues through participation in one of five industry working groups in the areas of energy and resources, energy-intensive manufacturing, transport and infrastructure, agriculture and land management and cross-sectoral issues. Each of the five Working Groups presented reports at the second meeting of the Government-Business Climate Change Dialogue, on 14 April 2003. The reports covered business perspectives on the Climate Change Forward Strategy, including technology solutions and foundations for a longer term response; cost effective abatement opportunities; the role of market approaches in delivering abatement, including emissions trading; economic adjustment; avoidance of long term emissions lock-in; and balancing policy flexibility and investment certainty. These industry reports are publicly available at “www.greenhouse.gov.au/dialogue”. The 21 August 2002 and 14 April 2003 Business Dialogue meetings were each attended by around 50 industry representatives from a range of sectors, including fossil fuel and renewable energy, mining and mineral processing, manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, building and transport.

2444) 2003: (1) What has been the total value of assets frozen to date under the Charter of the United Nations (Terrorism and Dealings with Assets) Regulations 2002. (2) What has been the total value of assets subsequently unfrozen to date under the Regulations. (3) What has been the average time taken to unfreeze assets following their freezing under the Regulations. (4) In how many cases following the freezing of assets under the Regulations has a brief been referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. There have been two cases where assets have been frozen under the Regulations. The first relates to the three accounts held by the International Sikh Youth Federation, totalling $2196.99. I understand that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) holds no information relating to the amount of money that was frozen in relation to the second case, being an account held by Shining Path, based in Melbourne. The signatory to the account indicated to AFP investigators that it was a small amount of money. The Commonwealth Bank notified the AFP of their concern about their client, Shining Path, on 27 December 2001. The AFP advised the Commonwealth Bank on 31 December 2001 that the Shining Path was not identical to the listed terrorist organisation in any way other than name. I understand that the account was subsequently unfrozen by the Commonwealth Bank. There have been no cases where a brief has been referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions under the Regulations. Health: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machines (Question No. 2456) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answers to question Nos 2079, 2080 and 2081 (Hansard, 8 September 2003, pages 18988 and 18989) is it the case that the Government does not want to grant a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Machine licence to operate a Medicare eligible MRI unit at Concord Repatriation General Hospital; if so, why; if not, why is it that the Minister cannot give some indication when a licence could be approved. The Government is currently working with the radiology profession, as part of the Radiology Memorandum of Understanding, to develop options for a controlled expansion in access to Medicare funded Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It is not possible to indicate when, or if, MRI services at Concord Repatriation General Hospital will be eligible for Medicare rebates.

207,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Further to the answer to question No. 2082 (Hansard, 8 September 2003, page 18989), when does the Minister anticipate that the necessary processes will be completed enabling the provision of the diabetic drugs AVANDIA and ACTOS on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) has recommended ACTOS and AVANDIA for listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the treatment of a limited group of patients whose diabetes is difficult to control with alternative medications. The Government considered the PBAC’s recommendation to include ACTOS and AVANDIA on the PBS on 22 October 2003. I will be listing these drugs on the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits from 1 November 2003. Government Departments: Legal Services (Question No. 2476) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answers to questions Nos 1620 to 1635 and 1637 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18168) what are the Chief Executive Officers of the Minister’s departments and agencies doing to ensure that they do not retain the services of any barrister or solicitor who has previously been made bankrupt. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: On2 May 2003 the Attorney-General and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer issued a joint news release which provided an update on recommendations in the report of a Joint Taskforce of their Departments titled “The Use of Bankruptcy and Family Law Schemes to Avoid Payment of Tax”. I understand the Office of Legal Services Coordination within the Attorney-General’s Department is available to advise Departments and agencies on procedures to be followed to avoid engaging previously bankrupt barristers who used insolvency to avoid tax. The Department of Family and Community Services and Centrelink (which manages the provision of advocacy services for the Department in social security and family assistance law matters) take considerable care in selecting suitably experienced and reputable legal counsel to undertake litigation. To this end, all legal services obtained by Centrelink are provided by firms and agencies on a pre-selected panel of legal service providers. Legal service providers who are successful in being appointed to the panel of Centrelink legal service providers are reviewed regularly.

Cape Denison is the location of the base of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911 14 led by Sir Douglas Mawson. As is customary with new designations, the CEP (which was established by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty) referred the proposed management plan for the area to an Intersessional Contact Group of members for detailed examination. Final comments from members are expected to be received in December 2003. Stakeholders from within the Australian heritage community and Australian Antarctic tour operators have also been consulted by officers of my Department. Once comments are received, the management plan will be revised and submitted by Australia to the next meeting of the CEP in May 2004 for endorsement by the CEP and approval by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties at their meeting in June 2004. Once approved, the Historic Site and ASMA will need to be proclaimed by the Governor General under the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act.
