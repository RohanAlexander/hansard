The principle has been laid down that no man who refuses an offer of work at current rates is to be retained on relief works or issued with rations. Explicit instructions have, however, been issued to the Administration that no man is to be penalized for declining to acquiesce in an attempt by an employer to secure labour at a wage below the recognized rate of pay. No cases of infringement of this principle have been reported to the Minister.

If it Many matters of the greatest importance did that, it would have to regulate supplies to the different states. would need to be constituted by the Commonwealth, and, under the authority of Commonwealth legislation, would fix the price at which interstate sales should take ment to the dairying industry, we must place. Anybody with knowledge of this country will recognize that any government must hesitate before deciding to interfere with interstate trade, and to remunity of all our great staple products, gulate the supplies passing from state to state. federation was to secure freedom of trade within the Commonwealth. This proposal would cut directly across that principle. The fixing by a tribunal of prices at which trade could flow between the different states was suggested to me. Difficulty has been experienced in maintaining voluntary co-operation. might be satisfactory co-operation within a state, ensuring to producers a reasonable return for their butter, it might be completely destroyed by the action of another state in disregarding the need for co-operation. It was desired to overcome that difficulty. But stabilization is not so simple a matter as has been suggested in some quarters. There are many very grave questions involved in it. The limitation of and fixation of prices in regard to supplies flowing from state to state, towould involve the adoption of the gether with the fixation of prices within t.he various states, might very well create uneconomic production in places not suited to the dairying industry. That could not be said to be in the interest of the general economic development and welfare of Australia as a whole, and almost inevitably any attempt to foster uneconomic trade of that character would break down. By interfering with and regulating the interstate trade we shall come into collision with a grave constitutional principle; certainly there is considerable doubt whether we could carry out such a scheme. But for the moment I do not stress the constitutional difficulty; I prefer to deal now with the basic principle. There are in this country producers who cannot obtain a remunerative price for their products, and to relieve them it is suggested that we should fix a price which they shall be entitled to receive for them. If that is the only way in which we can solve this problem, I see very grave difficulty. in the future development of Australia. would have to be considered at A board great length before a decision to do that could, be made. What we did for one industry would have to be done for another. If we gave this treatbe prepared to give it to all other industries, the inevitable result of which would be the increased cost to the comand an immediate raising of the general The fundamental purpose of cost of living. Thus, far from being remedied, the difficulty with which we are faced to-day would be intensified. A matter that must be borne in mind is the basis on which it is suggested prices should be fixed. The suggestion has been made that they should be based upon the cost of production. But what cost of producWhile there tion are we to take as a basis? Cost of production varies very much in different places and with different producers. We have had considerable experience of this within recent years. As a result of the control which existed during the war period, it was laid down-and I think there was ample evidence to support itthat the profit margin fixed must be governed by the least efficient elements in the controlled trade. Putting aside other difficulties, the fixing of prices basis of the costs of the least efficient producer, which would leave far too great a margin to the efficient producer, and would have a tendency all the time to increase the cost of living throughout the country. The unfortunate producer who for the moment had hopes of increased prices held out to him, would therefore in the end be in a worse position than at present. The problem, as the Government sees it , must be approached from another direction altogether. We must see whether something cannot be done to improve the efficiency of the industry, so that those engaged in it shall obtain a reasonable return for their products. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) said that this industry was efficiently conducted, but he must admit that efficiency has not yet reached the pitch that all desire it to attain. If we examine the statistics relating to the industry, we see that the average Australian yield of butter-fat x per cow is under 160 lb. a year, and yet there are herds which are yielding over 300 lb. per cow. This low yield is not entirely the fault of thc unfortunate small telegram sent to the Prime Minister by producer, for the reason that he has never been in a nnancial position to improve his herd, and so to obtain a greater return, the facts suggest that there is great need to assist the industry throughout Australia. This assistance is primarily a matter for the states, but the Commonwealth Government, having the duty of trying to improve the national efficiency as a whole, is prepared to help the State Governments if they are pre-, pared seriously to take up this problem of improving our herds by the importation of stud stock, and thus to encourage the dairy farmers to increase their general efficiency and production. The realization of such schemes will take a long time, and will not provide a solution of the immediate difficulties encountered by the man on the land in marketing his butter. The suggestion I have been making is primarilv a responsibility of the states. The Government has examined the facts very closely, ancl I Prime Minister has declined to accede would remind the honourable member for 'Wide Bay that the Last few weeks, to which he has referred, have not been wasted, for during that period the Government has been examining the problem from every angle with a view to solving it. able gentleman's time has expired. an extension of time for the Prime Minister? done. desire to speak on this occasion on behalf of those primary producers who are affected by the inefficient methods, over which they have no control, now employed in marketing their products. I sympathize with the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser), who has, no doubt, received hundreds of communications from branches of the primary producers' organizations in his electorate. I have received similar communications; but, unlike him, I am not a supporter of a government that will not give the assistance it should to these people. In order to place on record the attitude of t.he Labour party, I quote the following Mr Theodore, Premier of Queensland, on the 25th instant:On behalf of the dairying industry, which is in a languishing condition, my Government would appreciate action by your Government to bring about stabilization, as suggested by the interstate dairying conference. I am willing to co-operate with you in any action to this end, and urge desirability of early decision. That shows that the Queensland Governr ment supports this proposal. I am sorry that the Prime Minister did not, in his speech, give the dairy farmers of Queensland, and other parts of Australia, any reason to expect the Government's assistance in arriving at a solution of their difficulties. I mention Queensland particularly because the scheme was proposed by the Director of Agriculture in that state when he was a delegate. But I know that the men on the land throughout Australia are affected equally. The to the request of! the dairymen. He offered them sympathy, and said that dairy farmers should introduce improved methods so as to run their industry more efficiently, and he added that one only had to study the question to realize that the industry was not run efficiently. He suggested that the dairymen should improve their herds by introducing high-grade stock, and he promised that if the states would take that matter up, his government would cooperate with them. I remind him that in Queensland to-day the testing of dairy herds is being done under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture; and I know that for the last ten years every effort has been made by dairy farmers to improve their herds and to make their industry more efficient. But what they want at the present time is a living wage. The honourable member for Wide Bay has stated that a certain dairy farmer, at the end of the month, after paying expenses, had only £4 left witli whicli to keep himself, his wife, and family. Clearly that dairy farmer was not making a living wage. too much.",15,Alexr S Douglas

There is no need for the Prime Minister's suggestions about improving herds and introducing high-grade stock, for the dairy farmers in my electorate and in other parts of Queensland, with the assistance of the State Government, have done much to improve their herds. The honourable member for Wide Bay said that this Government had given no assistance to tbe dairying industry, although it had assisted other industries. Let us see where this scheme arose. It was proposed by MrL . R.. McGregor, at the interstate dairying conference, in A p r i l of this year. Mr McGregor is Director of Agriculture in Queensland.

The dairying conference approved of his scheme, and representatives of the conference placed it before the Prime Minister, with the unsatisfactory result that we have heard from' the right honourable gentleman to-day. A t first, he said that the scheme was impracticable, and he asked the conference to reconsider it . It was reconsidered, and the following final proposals for the fixing of prices, based on cost of production, were -placed before him on the 3rd J u l y : The tribunal to be comprised of three members-on e representative of the producers, to be nominated by the federal board; one representative of thc consumers, to be appointed by the Governor General in Council; and a president, to be mutually agreed to by the representative of tlie producers and consumers respectively, failing which agreement the Governor General in Council shall appoint the president. The. tribunal shall fix. the basic price of dairy come to a decision. That decision has produce lor interstate trade, such price to he based on the cost of production. The appointment by the federal board of wholesale distributors in the United Kingdom"" for the sale of. Australian produce. TJie prohibition of the export of Australian dairy produce to distributors other tlian those so appointed. To organize the marketing of Australian dairy produce in overseas markets, and by propaganda, advertising, and in other ways, create a direct demand by retailers and consumers for Australian produce. To make contracts with shipping companies for overseas freights on Australian dairy produce. To co-ordinate with the producers' organizations of New Zealand and other Dominions in organizing the marketing of dairy produce in the United. Kingdom. That would mean concentration in fewer hands than at present. Dairymen have been organizing the industry, but it is essentially a Commonwealth matter. In Victoria, after months of labour by dairymen, organization is rendered abortive by a dissenting minority. The same remark applies in New South Wales and QueensThe Queensland Labour land. They are also improving their herds, and it was with a view to the introduction of stud stock free of transport and quarantine charges, that I asked the Composite Government to honour a defiThe branches of that nite pledge made to the dairymen of Queensland by Mr Hughes to introduce It is a non-political stud stock from abroad.

I refrained from bringing the matter of the stabilization of markets before this House previously, because it might have been said that I was attempting to make political capital out of it , and I did not want to do that. I saw the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) on several occasions. In addition, I communicated with him frequently, and received numerous replies to the effect that, the Government was still considering the matter. Notwithstanding that, I refrained from attacking the Government, as to make the question a party one might have meant the ruin of. any chance that the dairymen had of getting their request acceded to.

Mr Mcgregor, Who Came","the dairy farmers what they require It distiuctly honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) will probably consider the advisability of taking some further drastic action in this connection. Later, I may give honourable members an opportunity to prove, by their votes, whether they desire to assist the dairymen of Australia or not. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Watson), with some effect, threatened to resign his seat if reasonable compensation was not granted to the dairymen of his electorate in connection with the rinderpest outbreak. He got £10,000 for those men. The honourable member for Wide Bay, being a supporter of the Government, may be able to tell us what there is to .prevent the Government from acceding to the request of the producers. Isi t those members of the Composite Ministry who belong to the Country party who are to blame ? W h y has that party not done something on behalf of the dairymen of Australia? They hold half the seats in the Cabinet, and they could have forced the Government to accede to the request made by the dairymen. Minister for Trade and Customs was asked whether any decision had been come to by the Government, and he repliedThe conditions generally relating to the dairying industry are at present receiving the consideration of the Government. The Prime Minister, in replying to a question on the 16th of May, saidNo final decision has been arrived at by Cabinet, but as soon as the matter has beeu determined an announcement will be made. Two months have elapsed, but no announcement has yet been made. I have made numerous requests to the Government to give effect to tlie proposed scheme for the stabilization of dairy produce. On the 25th JuneI asked the Prime Minister the following question: Has the Government reached a decision on the request made by the Interstate Dairying Conference for a scheme for marketing dairy produce ? To this the Prime Minister replied, "" No , "" and referred me to a statement previously made by the Minister for Trade and Customs, that the matter was still the 26th of June, the PrimeM i nister informed me, in reply to a question in this House, that it was found i m practicable to give effect to the proposals submitted by the Interstate Dairy Conturns them down. The ference, and that negotiations were still proceeding with a view to arriving at some practical arrangement which would help the industry. In a letter which I received from MrH . Detjen, secretary of the Local Producers Association, M i l mau, Central Queensland, dated the 30th June, 19.24, the following statement was made:The price of materials used by the farmers is about three times what it was before the war, yet the average prices ruling to-day for primary products are practically not higher than in pre-war days; indeed, on several occasions during the past two years the price for dairy products fell to a lower level than has existed for thc last nine or ten years. . . . Seeing that the producer is so often acclaimed the back-bone of the country, which he really is, as any one hns to admit who has any knowledge of the value of our rural industries to the Commonwealth, it is about time that tbe back-bone of the country got a little more consideration from tbe powers that be. I agree with the sentiments expressed by . Mr Detjen. On the 7th instant, I received the following letter from MrM . J . Davey, secretary, Local Producers Association, Ambrose:On the 9th May, the On behalf of the members of my association I desire to thank you for your efforts in assisting in the stabilization scheme for the marketing of dairy products. . . . Members of this association are patiently awaiting the decision of the Government, and we urge that you use every means in your power to bave the proposed scheme adopted. I have received scores of similar letters, one of which is from MrJ . E . Harding, secretary of the Local Producers . Association, Dalma Scrub, via Eockhampton, and contains the following statements: That Dalma Scrub Local Producers Association notes with alarm that tbe Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, desires to carry on government on the principle of protection to the manufacturer, and world free trade to the producer. That we very much object to, prices being fixed on a basis of import parity. The official organ of the Queensland primary producers, in a leading article on the 12th July, 1924, statedWe purposely head this article "" Proposals receiving consideration."" The Interstate Dairy Conference met in Melbourne in April of this . year. Thc conference endorsed the stabilization proposals of tbe Council of Agriculture. Those proposals were placed before the Prime Minister early in April. He promised that the under consideration. On proposals would receive the consideration of the Federal Government. Three months have elapsed. Those proposals are still receiving consideration. The Federal Government wants a great deal of time to consider these proposals. Meantime fhe dairymen are waiting. These men have been 'informed that they should run their industry more efficiently and improve their herds. Numerous theories have been advanced by the Prime Minister, who is a Flinders-lane business man, who, while he may be capable of running a business in Flinders-lane efficiently, has ledge of dairy farming in Queensland or elsewhere. These dairymen have a right to expect a fair return for their .labour, and no body of workers will object to their obtaining a living for themselves and thejir families. Zealand Government has given to the dairymen of that country what is asked of the Commonwealth Government by the dairymen of Australia. McGregor, the Director of Agriculture in Queensland, at an interstate conference held in Melbourne in A p r i l last, quoted the opinions of the Queensland Solicitor General, and an eminent Australian K . C , to the effect that the Commonwealth Parliament has the necessary power. He saidIn short, this means that the Commonwealth Parliament, if it wishes, can set up a board to control interstate and overseas trade, and then it is left to the states as to whether or not they, along the lines of local autonomy, will set up state power in each state. Mr Theodore has supported that view, and has promised to do his part. member's time has expired. unfortunate that the operation of the Standing Orders prevented the Prime Minister from completing his statement. I was very pleased, however, that he was able to mention some of the difficulties confronting the Government. Had that statement been made public some weeks ago it would have prevented a lot of the agitation that has taken place recently. It has often been said that farming generally is nob so prontable as it ought to be. waste of energy, and the contentment with old methods. time has arrived when we should adopt better methods, better machinery, and more up-to-date organization. Most of our industries have been neglected concerned. getting as good a return from their labour as is obtained by those following other occupations. those engaged in the dairying industry have a right to organize. Attempts have been made to establish voluntary pools to assist the industry, but they have been unsuccessful. These attempts were defeated by a small minority who have disagreed with the proposals made from time to time. That being so, the repreno practical knowsentatives of the industry have approached the Commonwealth Government for something in the nature of control. A f t e r f u l l consideration, the Council of Agriculture in Queensland submitted to a representative gathering of dairymen in MelThe New bourne a proposal for the stabilization of the industry. The proposals submitted to the Ministry were the outcome of that conference. The scheme presented by MrL . R. them was one to which the Government was justified in giving close consideration. They asked for the creation of a board to regulate interstate and oversea prices. I should like to recall the fact that in Melbourne, in 1920, Senator-the n Mr. Massy Greene presented to the dairy farmers of Australia a scheme providing for the organization of the dairying industry. A t that time Senator Greene was Minister for Trade and Customsi n the Hughes Ministry. He explained the scheme, and said that co-operation was its key-note. In reply to questions I recently asked the present Minister for Trade and Customs, that The honourable honourable gentleman said that the essential difference between the two schemes was the matter of the fixation of prices. I believe that reply to be perfectly correct, but the factremains that the farmer has the whole of his capital invested in his farm , and has all his family working with him to produce cream. When the cream reaches the factory all those who handle it are members of an organization whose wages are fixed, and who know' exactly what they will receive. Whether the butter goes to the cold stores, to the retailer, or the ship for export, all who That is because of the appalling handle it know exactly what wages they will receive.' T t is only the man who Undoubtedly, the produces the cream whose return is uncertain. The Prime Minister has promised that the Government will assist industries that prove their claim to assistance by efficient organization and submit a workso far as organization is able scheme. This the dairy farmers of AusThe dairy farmers are not tralia have tried to do. I have received a return from the Department of Trade and Customs showing the number of co-operaI t cannot be denied that tive and proprietary butter and cheese factories in Australia. I quote the figures",18,Alexr S Douglas
21,Mr Speaker,,20,Alexr S Douglas
22,Mr Macka Y ( L I L L E Y) [3.27],"It issupplied to me as some evidence that thc dairymen have honestly attempted to i m prove the conditions of their industry by organization. I find that in New South Wales, there are 106 co-operative butter factories and fifteen proprietary factories. In Victoria, there are 87 co-operative and 66 proprietary factories. In Queensland there are 43 co-operative and three proprietary factories. In South Australia there. are ten co-operative and 33 proprietary factories. tralia there are nine co-operative and one proprietary factory. there are fifteen co-operative and five proprietary factories. These figures are evidence that the dairy farmers have endeavoured by co-operative means to improve the conditions of their industry. I am quite prepared to admit that a lot more can be done. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, we have only to compare the quantity of butter f a t produced per cow in Australia with the quantity produced in New Zealand and Denmark to see that there isgreat room for improvement in the butter producing quality of our dairy herds. A good deal might be done also by making proper provision against droughts. Droughts occur periodically and result in heavy losses, but no reasonable effort has been made to conserve fodder. In 1920 the price fixing commissioner of Queensland, after taking exhaustive evidence, determined the cost of the production of butter at ls. 7d. per lb. No one suggests for a moment that the dairy farmer has at any time obtained anything like that price per lb. for his butter. I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that the New Zealand Parliament has recently passed a Dairy Farmers ExportA c t under which a board has been created to assist the industry in New Zealand and in overseas marketing. confined to the export trade. It does not deal with the industry locally. pression that the act dealt with the industry inside as well as outside New Zealand. I feel certain that the Government is very sympathetic towards the primary producers throughout Australia. It has proved that time after time. The primary producers have no certainty of ret u r n for their labour, whereas, because of the Customs duties, manufacturers know [107] workers, because of the awards of Arbitration' Courts know what they are to receive 'for their work. I am not enthusiastic about the fixation of prices; but the circle is about complete, and this deserving section of the community must not be the exception. I admit that t'he Prime Minister has shown that there are some very real difficulties in the way of what is asked for. But I shall be disappointed w it h In Western Austhe ability of Ministers if they do not devise some scheme which w ill give In Tasmania relief to the dairy farmers, not necessarily in the way they have asked, but in some way that will stabilize the industry and make it more attractive in the future. like to say a few words on the stabilization of the dairying industry. As compared with the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser), I am in a fortunate position, because I am in opposition to the Government. To quote the words of one of the honourable member's correspondents, if there has been any "" dillydallying "" in connection with this matter, it must be laid at the door of the honourable member's own party and the Government he is supporting. I might say that the expression "" dilly-dallying, "" applied to the action taken for the stabilization of the dairying industry, might, from my experience, be applied with equal"" force bo the attempts made to improve the condition of the dried f r u it industry and the industry of those engaged in the production of grapes for spirit manufacture. . dustry is concerned, the honourable member should induce the South Australian Government to do what the Federal Government has asked it to do. these matters desires to throw a great deal of the responsibility for their settlement on the state governments. It is an old practice for the Government to sidestep its obligations in this way; but, while I admit that the state governments I was under the imhave their obligations in connection with these matters, the Federal Government has also a very big obligation in connection with them. There is apparently very little difficulty in securing assistance where the big men are concerned, but when it is a question of assisting small dairy farmers, soldiers, and others on bhe river settlements who are growing dried fruits or grapes, there is great diffihow they stand, and the culty in obtaining consideration for them.",20,Alexr S Douglas

27,Mr Gabb,"The Prime Ministeri nThe Prime Minister seemed to take up the stand that if the dairying stabilization scheme were put into operation, with its fixation of prices, it would have a tendency to increase the cost of living, and progress would be in a vicious circle. But I remind the right honourable gentleman that in connection w i th other matters we have not hesitated to flout economic laws. We have been prepared to take risks, and it seems a little hard that the line should be drawn where the dairy farmers are concerned. have rightly said that no body of men in Australia work harder than do the dairymen. Their women and children also work hard in carrying on the industry. I am prepared to go to any trades hall conference, and tell the conference, though I think it would not be necessary, that if men workers in factories and shops expect to get fair remuneration for their labour, no matter what the effect may be on the cost of living, the same consideration should be given to those engaged in the dairying or any other primary industry. I think that the party to which I belong would be prepared to stand for that. We cannot ask for fair working and living conditions for those engaged in factories and workshops unless we are prepared, also, to concede them to those working in the fields. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) asked, by way of interjection, how it is that the dairying industry has not been organized. In the case for the stabilization of the industry placed in my hand by the secretary of t i e South Australian Dairymen's Protection Association, I find the following statement:Failure of attempts to stabilize -Endea vours to better conditions in any of the states have so far failed, in support of which conclusion may ibe cited: Victoria-Afte r months of labour on the part of dairymen, organization is rendered abortive -by reason of a 5 per cent, dissenting minority. New South Wales-Afte r a month's organized marketing (October, 1923) the arrangement broke down, with 10 per cent, standing out. QueenslandCessation of a voluntary butter pool, after organized marketing had been successfully maintained for fifteen months (to August, 1923). This shows that attempts to organize the industry in at least three of the states have broken down, and for a reason similar to that which I am afraid will lead to the organization industry also breaking down. A certain number of men are so extremely Mr Gabb. that they do not care who goes to the wall, so long as, for the time being, they secure their own ends. The idea behind this proposal, and in the minds of some of those engaged in the dried f r u it industry, is to have some for m of compulsion, in order that the small minorit y who work against the best interests of the industry as a whole can be put in their proper place. The Prime Minister seems to think that it would be almost impossible Other honourable members to stabilize the industry by the fixation of prices, but I would remind h i m that the New Zealand Parliament has passed legislation dealing with the matter quite recently. B y interjection, the right honourable gentleman said that that legislation applies to the export trade only, but in the statement supplied to me I find this passageThe New Zealand Government placed on the statute-book,. during the last session of the New Zealand Parliament, the Dairy Produce Export Control Bill of 1923, which vests control of dairy produce in a New Zealand Dairy Produce Control Board, consisting of nine producers' representatives and two persons nominated by the Government. Investing in the board complete control of New Zealand dairy produce, the act also provides for the following objectives, viz.:-Co-ordinatio n of all selling agencies; fixation of minimum prices; regulation of supply; a system of advertising of the New Zealand national brand; improving shipping facilities.; reduction in ships' freights; elimination of speculators buying forward; elimination of discrepancy between the price of the Danish article and that of New Zealand. I accept that as a statement of fact, because I believe that the dairying association knows what it is talking about, and would not w i l f u l l y supply honourable members w i th misleading information. The quotation shows that the New Zealand act deals w it h the industry in the dominion, as well as w i th the export trade. What has the Commonwealth Government done along these lines? One or two delegates to the dairying confeience came to me and seemed to be quite sure that their proposal would be carried. I said, "" D o you really think that you are going to p u ll it off?"" They replied, "" Yes ; we think we are-on gooJ ground, and that the Government will help us i u the matter."" I said, "" Do you of the dried fruit not realize that if this stabilization project is brought off it w ill affest all thc selfish middlemen dealing in. butter, sooner or later? Do you mean to tell me that they are in favour of the project?"" They said, ""Yes; representatives on the board."" I replied, "" I amsatisfied that they w ill sell you a ' blue cluck' before you are through."" I am sure that they have done -so. If honourable members wish to account for the delay that has taken place in giving effect to the project for the stabilization of the dairying industry, I tell them that, although the proprietary companies may appear to be working hand in hand w i th the co-operative companies, they are selling them in the dark. Those are the persons who are preventing the stabilization of their industry desired by the dairymen of Australia to-day. MT . PATEESON (Gippsland) [3.45] I federal legislation to enable those engaged in the dairying industry to overcome the obstacles which have so far place the industry on a stable foundation Thousands of men on the land, returned soldiers and others, are living in the hope that something will be done to improve their conditions, for if it is not done many of them will probably be forced to abandon their holdings. Australia is approaching another export season for butter, and, as soon as we have one box more than is required for local heeds, the price to the producer will automatically drop to the level of' export parity. So long as there is in sufficient butter for our own needs, we can', without any legislation, obtain a price equal to that at which butter can be imported; but, as soon as we have a surplus, the price falls to the level of the export parity rate. No matter how small the surplus may be, if we have no organization, and no protective legislation, it is inevitable, under economio laws, that the' net price which we shall get overseas for that surplus, after allowing for all expenses and deterioration due to storage, automatically dictates the price which we are compelled to accept for local sales of fresh butter. The export parity in the case of butter is about 16s. per owt., or, roughly, about 2d. per lb. less than the world's rates. In addition to that, the price obtained in London is depreciated to the extent of at least I d . per lb., because the butter is not so fresh as when purchased over the grocer's counter in Australia. Therefore, the price we receive is 3d. per l b . the proprietary companies have less than the world's value for fresh butter. Isi t fai r that the dairymen should be compelled to accept for local sales 3d. per lb. less than world's values ? There appears to be three sections in this country-on e that is sheltered by, and receives benefits at the hands of, the Arbitration Court; a second that fattens with the assistance of the tariff; and a third, that must contrive to live in spite of' both these institutions. The dairymen belong to the last-mentioned section. They do not receive the benefits conferred by either, and yet must carry the weight of both. It appears to me that, if protection is to be the future policy of this country, one cannot deny the justice and logio of the claim have been impatiently awaiting that that portion of the product of the dairying industry disposed of in Australia should be sold at an Australian price. We have been told that such an frustrated their own efforts to arrangement would help to perpetuate the present vicious circle. I admit that, but I submit thab all sections should be in that circle or all should be out of it , for great injustice is now done to the one section that is compelled to remain outside A question that may arise in some minds is whether the primary producer cannot continue on a free trade basis. I point out that, after the overhead charges, such as rent, in terest on stock and plant, and depreciation, have been met, the profits of the dairymen, expressed as wages, are extremely low. Some years ago the Interstate Commission inquired into the alleged profiteering in butter. The price of butter f a t at that time was the same as the average price ruling during the past twelve months-Is. 5d. per lb. I was able to prove to the satisfaction of that commission that, if a returned soldier, or anybody else, took up land for the purpose of dairying, and milked as many cows as one man could handleeighteen would certainly keep him busy -afte r paying 5 per cent, interest on capital expenditure and 10 per cent, depreciation, on stock and plant, assuming his cows produced the then Australian average of 130 lb. butter-fat per annum, his wages return would be only 5d. per hour. Tnat is all he would make if he worked 60 hours a week, and if butter f a t were Is. 5d. per lb. accepted those figures. It may be said that a cow should produce more than 130' lb. of butter fat per annum, and that the dairymen should have better cows. I admit that the present production of our dairy herds is too low, but let me mention the position of a producer who, after many years of herd testing, had raised the standard of his cows to double that of the Australian average. I placed before the commission figures relating to my own farm, and I was able to show that with a herd brought up to an average of 650 gallons of milk per cow per annum, and over 250 lb. of butter fat, or, roughly, about double the Australian production, and with butter fat at ls. 5d. per lb., after allowMassey), and the conclusion was reached ing 5 per cent, interest on the price of the land, a small amount for hand feeding, and interest and depreciation on stock and plant on a very fair basis, all the profits' expressed as wages amounted to about ls. 4d. per hour for that portion of the time devoted to the dairying activities of the farm. That surely could not be described as profiteering. Recently an instance was brought under my notice of a herd in which the owner takes great pride, and which is included in the Government herd-testing herd is averaging 370 lb. butter fat per annum, and it was asserted that with such a yield butter could be profitably produced at ls. per lb. On investigation, I found that this herd was fed at a cost of £18 10s. per head, which is exactly the same as the monetary return from 370 lb. butter fat at ls. per lb. This shows that the theories of some people need to be closely examined. Feeding a cow is like stoking the furnaces of an ocean liner. With a reasonable amount of fuel a speed of 15 knots an hour can be obtained, but to increase the speed to 18 knots the coal consumption must be increased out of all proportion to the gain, whereas to develop a speed of 21 knots an hour coal must be used in a most extravagant manner, lt may be said that the figures I have quoted are not official, but I now propose to give some figures that are authentic. 1920, the State Governnient, yielding to the popular clamour for cheaper butter, asked Judge Rolin to act as a commissioner to inquire into the cost of produetion there. He did things in his own Mr Paterson. The Interstate Commission way. He took an accountant with him, and went to fche dairying districts to ascertain the cost of renting farms, and the amount paid for labour. He also, went to the factories to discover the exact quantity of cream sent there by the various dairymen. Finally he came to the conclusion that 2s. 3d. per lb. was a reasonable price for butter, and that any lower price would make it impossible for the dairy farmer to pay reasonable wages. He thought that it would take at least 2s. 3d. per lb. to enable the farmer to pay £2 per week to efficient milkers and retain £3 18s. per week for his own wages. In New Zealand a similar inquiry was conducted. A member of the commission there was the present Prime Minister( Mr that 2s. 5d. per lb. fairly represented the cost of production. The dairying industry in Australia, therefore, is in a lamentable position. I hope that the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) will yet see his way clear to take the bold course of departing entirely from precedent, and will dismiss from his mind any fear he may entertain regarding the fixing of prices. Let him do something more than deal merely with the export trade. No matter what the states individually may do, even scheme. That if every state does what lies in its power, there will be one link missing until the Commonwealth Parliament ,clothes with sufficient power a board to regulate interstate trade. Until that is done the"" efforts of the states themselves may be rendered futile. When Judge Rolin in 1920 expressed the opinion that 2s. 3d. was a fair price in New South Wales, he also said that he thought the problem of making primary production profitable transcended in national importance all other issues. The average dairyman has very little rest. He works seven days a week, and he has no Easter or Christmas holidays. Even when there is a funeral, a wedding, or a bush fire at his home, his cows must be milked. He receives the wages of a serf, while his family, in many cases, gets no wages at all. I was asked by the Interstate Commission t'o explain why butter could be produced some years ago at ls. per lb. My In New South Wales, in reply was that the dairying industry rested absolutely on the foundation of unpaid family labour.. The labour on dairy farms is largely done by unpaid workers, for little children often milk three or four cows before and after attending school. It is at the expense of those 'workers the consumers get cheap butter. We are told that the dairyman must improve his methods and increase his yields-the n he can carry on. Are the secondary industries told to install better machinery, make their methods more efficient, and stand on their own feet against the world's competition? were taken with regard to all industries it might be reasonable; but is it fair, I ask, should be allowed to receive the benefits of the tariff whilst a primary producer must stand on a free trade level, and. be oven worse off than being without protection because he has to suffer a huge discount, in the shape of heavy ocean freights ? M i \ J. FSANCTS (Moreton) [ 4 . 0 ] am very sorry that the Standing, Orders prevented the Prime Minister from concluding his remarks, but in the time at his disposal he disposed of the suggestion that has been made that the Government has not at heart the interests of the primary producers, particularly those engaged in the dairying industry. I believe that the dairying industry is the keystone of the farming industry. Ifc certainly is the backbone of general farming. There are many thousands of families settled on the land in Australia who are able to carry on only because of the returns, however small, they get from dairying. The industry is certainly one of outstanding importance, and it would be nothing short of a national calamity if it could not be reorganized and controlled so as to enable it to be carried on profitably. I urge the Government to leave no stone unturned to ensure that the dairy farmers shall be able to continue their operations at a profit. It must be obvious to any one who has given serious thought to the matter that the condition of the industry is most critical. The farmer invests his capital in the industry, and generally he and his wife and family are working early and late every day in the year to produce cream. All the men who handle the cream at the factory a>re members 'of an organization and know exactly what wages they will receive. cold storage, to the retailer, or to the ship, all the labour employed in handling it is guaranteed a. certain wage. The sole exception is the man who produces the cream. I have been intimately associated with every development of the negotiations between the representatives of the dairying industry and the Government, and have attended the deputations. It is most regrettable that tliere has been so much misrepresentation of the attitude of the Government upon this important matter.. In my own state, I am If that attitude informed, efforts have been made to create the impression that the Government is indifferent to the pressthat the manufacturing section ing needs of this most important section of our primary producers. As the Prime Minister has so effectively pointed out this afternoon, the reverse is the case. I remind the right honourable gentleman that he promised that the Government would help all primary industries that are prepared tc help themselves. Special efforts have been made in Queensland, New SouthI Wales, and Victoria, to organize this industry within the states. Much has been accomplished; many factories liave been established on the co-operative principle, new machinery has been introduced, and everything that the farmer can do within his limited resources has been done to place the industry on a sound basis. U n fortunately, every effort has been frustrated because of the lack of co-operation between the states, and the absence of efficient organization in L o : ' o n . T . need : 1 for proper organization; i Great Uritain is not questioned, and ha' ---en frequently mentioned by Ihe Prime Minister and Senator Wilson since their rr-turn from the Imperial Conference. Stabilization of this industry is imperative and urgent. Ihe industry has done its part within its limited powers. I hope the Government will early finalize this matter, and enable the dairymen to re-organizetheir industry so that it can be conducted with profit to the producer and the Commonwealth. The dairy farmers await with interest the Government's declaration of what it has done and proposes to do. I trust that its proposals will also provide for co-operation with the states to assist the dairy farmer to conserve fodder as a national insurance against drought. When we gain a footing in the markets of the Old World we must take every precaution to entrench ourselves and keep up Whether the butter goes into the supplies. That is imperative for the effective stabilization of the industry. If we fail to do that, and lose the market at any stage, we shall have great difficulty in recovering it . It is financially impossible for th© individual farmer to make adequate provision for the conservation of fodder. A t present he is making a gallant effort to recover after a succession of disastrous droughts, and his resources are taxed to the limit . Although this is primarily a state responsibility, .something must be done by the Commonwealth, possibly in conjunction with the states, to improve the standard of dairy herds by methods similar to those so effectively adopted in Denmark and New Zealand. The testing of ordinary herds should be subsidized, and the elimination of unprofitable cows encouraged. policy will make the herds more and more profitable, and the cost of production will be materially reduced. A l though the benefits from herd testing are so manifest, many dairy farmers are unable to pay even the small fees necessary to have it done. The whole Commonwealth will benefit if the industry is again placed on a sound footing, and I think the Commonwealth and. states might very well for a number of years share the cost of _herd testing. The most economical way to build up the herds to a more profitable basis is to use bulls of high-production pedigree, and provision might very well be made to enable the struggling settlers to purchase such stock. I should like to draw the attention of the House to the average production of milk and butter per cow in Australia, New Zealand, and DenmarkNew Australia. Zealand. Denmark, gallons. Milk lbs. Butteifat ... 140 ... 160 ... 186 These statistics are convincing evidence that there is yet much to be done to im prove the standard of our herds. Dairy farming is a national industry; it produces new wealth, and must be afforded all reasonable encouragement and assistance to develop on sound lines. regret that the Prime Minister had not time to complete his remarks and let the House know what the Government intends to do. We are all aware of the facts he stated, but it is almost axiomatic that if an industry is profitable it will develop. butterfat offers very little encouragement to the farmers to improve their herds on the lines indicated by the right honourable gentleman. dairying industry is a Commonwealth concern; it is Australia-wide, and free of party politics. We are all anxious to do our best to place the industry upon a better footing. In all its branches it is worth to the Commonwealth about £40,000,000 per annum, of which £20,000,000 is represented by the butter production. There are about 40,000 registered dairy herds, from which the gross return is £520 per dairyman per annum, and the net return less than £ 1 2 0 . I cannot conceive how any person desirous of promoting the rural industries of AusThat tralia can f a i l to realize that early assistance is absolutely necessary if the dairying industry is to be saved from disaster. The report of Judge Rolin shows, that the persons engaged in the dairy industry in New'South Wales have decreased by 6,400 within the last few years. A similar tale of retrogression is told throughout the Commonwealth. the Country party entered politics. It is the greatest curse the country has ever known. ception of the honourable member. Ten thousand soldier settlers have been placed on the land in Victoria alone, and the Commonwealth has advanced about £12,000,000 to that state for closer settlement purposes. Many of the soldiers engaged in dairy farmin g are unable to meet their liabilities to the Crown or pay their municipal gallons. gallons. ... 340 ... 440 ... 550 rates, and they w ill have to leave their lbs. lbs. holdings unless they receive some assistance ; because at the present time they are selling butter for a little over half the cost of production. Hundreds of dairymen throughout Australia are doing the same. Having had 25 years' experience of dairying, as a farmer milkin g his own cows and supplying cream to the factories, I know that the industry is kept I very much going by sweated labour. If the farmer were not getting the unpaid labour of his wife and children, who work long hours every day in the week, the price of butter would be very much higher than it is. member think that dairying is worse than any other primary industry?

The dairying industry is faced with many difficulties. Overseas, through lack of organization, we have lost many thousands of pounds. Owing to the recent wharf What can be done? It is labourers' strike in England there was a considerable drop in the price of butter produced here. What on earth This has a strike in England to do with the cost of producing butter here? Our overseas co-operative association has been of considerable assistance to the dairyThe men, but the industry both here and in England should be placed on a much better footing. There is no question as to who is making money out of the industry. The middlemen say, in effect, to the dairymen, "" Well done thou good and f a it h f u l slave; keep on producing, work"" ten and twelve hours a day,. Sundays and week days. Give us your butter, but for heaven's sake do not interfere with its distribution, as you have not sufficient brains to successfully organize and manage a distributing scheme. Leave that to us, so that we may further exploit you."" W it h adequate assistance we shall be able to build up this, great Australian industry, which is now in its infancy, at the same time ensuring to the producer a reasonable remuneration for his labour and products. The Prime Minister( Mr. Bruce) objects to price fixing, but this in certain directions is absolutely-necessary. Compulsion already exists in this industry. The dairyman is compelled to pay fixed prices for his dairying implements. He is compelled to pay for inspectors, and for the pasturization of his products. He pays wages fixed by the wages boards and arbitration courts. In the factories are many lads whose only requirement is a change of clothes. Their, remuneration is greater than that received by the farmer, with, say, £5,000 in assets, represented by land, stock, and implements. It is the duty of this Parliament to break through the restraints of the Constitution to assist the dairying industry, thus opening up and developing the country and facilitating our immigration policy. While the dairying industry remains as it is we shall not be .able to induce men to settle on the That outline indicates the land. H a l f of the population of Australia is in our capital cities.

I have the greatest sympathy with him and with other members of the Housei n their plea on behalf of the dairying industry. I am pleased that some honourable members of the Country party are at last realizing thab it is necessary to eliminate the middleman, farmer. The Government's attention has been drawn to the manner in which the primary producers are robbed by exploiters. Although there are comparatively few producers in my electorate, yet I am only too pleased to support any proposal which is legitimately calculated to further their interests. point out some of the difficulties with which the dairymen are beset. The honourable member for In d i ( Mr Cook) told us made only a small, if any, profit. There is no need to in f o n n honourable members that the profits are made -legitimatel y or otherwise-by the agents one or two instances of the practices A Camden, New South Wales, used to send his cream to a certain compaary in Sydney, and about every month he received fro m it a report, "" One can sour."" He went to Sydney to interview the company, and was asked to call and see the next can of sour cream delivered by him. Asi t was inconvenient for him to make the journey fro m Camden to Sydney, and, in any case, the cream would have gone sour by the time he got to Sydney, he said to the company, "" A. pastrycook, arelative of mine, is living about three doors from your factory, and the next time that a can of cream from me arrives in a sour condition, you can send it to him, or ring him on the telephone and. ask him to call for it . "" That producer did not receive another report that his cream was sour. Another dairvman in the same district, owing to receiving so many of these reports, sold his herd and grew lucerne for a living. Afte r being out of the dairying industry for seven months, he received a report, "" One can sour "" from the company referred to. I am giving these instances to show that there is urgent need for Government interference. The butter factories handle tens of thousands of cans of cream every month, and deal with from 10,000 to 15,000 customers. If , every month, each customer had one can of cream debited against him as sour, the company would get perhaps from 20,000 to 30,000 cans of cream free. This practice is nothing but sheer robbery. I shall do everything in my power to assist honourable members in preventing the exploitation who has for years farmed the of our primary producers.. The dairying industry should be stabilized, and to bring this about the Government must ensure to our producers and wage earners fair prices for their products and fair remuneration for their labour. I want to I regret that the Prime Minister( Mr. Bruce) was not able to conclude his remarks cm the dairying industry, but I gather that, although the Commonwealth that the producer of butter Government considers that anv scheme of organization can be better handled generally by the states, yet it is prepared to extend a measure of assistance to> the industry. I trust that we shall soon have I wish to point out an announcement from the Government that the dairying industry will receive adopted by the middlemen. some assistance, financial or otherwise, dairy farmer in the district of so as toi place it on a proper footing. Senator Wilson, who did excellent work for us abroad, and the honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse), returned from England to Australia fully convinced that the stand ardizatiou of our exported products was urgently needed. The dairymen of New South Wales have an excellent union-the Primary Producers' Union-unde r the control of practical and sagacious men. An effort is being made by the Australian Dairy Council to assist the dairying industry, and it is now considering the report of the Commonwealth dairying expert. It has practically been agreed to eliminate one or two grades of butter. The fewer the brands, the greater will be the advantage when the butter is marketed overseas. I believe that on the lst of next month the standard national brand will be used. Purchasers of our products abroad, by being sold an average quality of butter-",27,Alexr S Douglas

52,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Trea£4,078,810, and I shall refer only to three of the items. Customs and Excise, 1923-24. The revenue from Customs and excise was estimated at £29,650,000, when, in fact, we received £35,750,784. This amount is a record, and may be compared with £32,872,000 received in 1922-23, and with £14,978,000 in 1913-14. Luxuries figure largely in the revenue returns, as the following particulars for the year 1922-23 indicate (details for 1923-24 not yet being available) :Customs. Ale, spirits, and beverages Tobacco and manufactures thereof Jewellery amd imitation jewellery -Gramophones Kinematographs Films. . Vehicles and vehicle parts (includes motor cars) . . 1,399,879 Motor cycles, side cars, and parts Musical instruments Excise. Beer. . Spirits Tobacco Cigars. . ' Cigarettes Total Some of the vehicles were, of course, required for business purposes, but nearly all the revenue referred to was derived from luxuries. The total of £16,207,970 represented just about half of the customs and excise receipts, and it is a very important consideration that so large a portion of revenue from customs and excise is based on articles of luxury. Income Tax, 1923-24. The only other considerable variation from estimated revenue is in income tax, which yielded £11,057,555, instead of the estimate of £13,000,000. Included in the amount of £11,057,555 is £3,823,000 in respect of tax that was assessed in 1922-23, but not collected at 30th June, 1923. The amount of tax that had been assessed in 1923-24, and was outstanding at 30th June, 1924, was £3,290,000-so it would appear that the Dr. Earle Page. revenue of 1923-24 benefited approximately by £533,000 on account of arrears. It is evident, therefore, that some other explanation must be looked for to account for the discrepancy of nearly £2,000,000 between the amount of the estimate and that actually received. It is known that, owing to disturbance brought about by the transfer of the method of collection to state departments, the work of assessment was considerably in arrear at the close of the year, there being then on hand unexamined returns numbering 279,000, but the amount of Duty. tax remaining to be assessed cannot at £ present be ascertained. Even allowing 2,294,264 for the additional assessments yet to be made, and for the fact that the incomes . . _ . . . 1,699,023 on which tax is payable were affeeted by drought in some parts of the Common.. .. 42,662 wealth, it appears that the estimate was .. .. 25,354 rather too nigh. .. 5,766 Postmaste^General'-s Eevenue, 1923-24. .. .. .103,064 In addition to the two heads of revenue already refersed to, only that of the Postmaster-General's department returns any very considerable sum to the Trea.. .. 147,790 sury.

That sum almost exactly corre.. ... 1,610,139 sponds with the actual receipts in 1923-24, amounting to £9,757,021. Of course, the .. ..£16,207,970 revenue of the Postmaster-General's Department does not automatically increase or decrease with the price levels, but it is an interesting and important fact that the existing charges of the department have been arranged so as to bear upon the people with almost the same weight as the charges of 1913-14. The sums charged by the department for its services, generally speaking, appear to be proper, if we suppose that they were reasonable in 191314. In view of this, it scarcely can be said that the Postmaster-General's Department is being used to provide funds to meet the recurring expenses of the war. Expenditure out of Eevenue, 1923-24. The total expenditure out of revenue in the year just closed was . . £62,484,169 The Budget estimate was 60,951,848 The excess of the actual over the estimate being £1,532,321 The excess may follows: Fruit Bounty, which has restored a weak section ot the f m l t industry to a satisfactory state and has enabled it to do without aid from thc Treasury ..

Excess of revenue over expenditure, 1923-24.

Not including the business undertakings, the ordinary expenditure of departments is estimated for the present year at £6,432,312. penditure was £6,654,800. seen that there is an estimated reduction of expenditure amounting to £222,488. It must be emphasized that the bulk of the Commonwealth expenditure is irreducible without a reversal of the existing policy, because nearly all of the expenditation to states, and other special ture is due to business undertakings, war pensions, interest and capitation payments. the actual departmental expenditure and the amount expended out of revenue on new works total some £7,000,000. This is the main field in which savings can be looked for as a result of economy in administration, and examination of the figures of the last four years shows that reductions have been made, notwithstanding the cost of arbitration awards, to which I shall refer later. Thc natural growth of the business undertakings entails increased expenditure. £8,751,830, which represents an increase of £149,755 over the actual expenditure of last year. bring down estimates showing no increase for the business undertakings, but that would mean curtailment of services, particularly in tlie Post Office, and I am sure that is-not desired by the people of Australia. If we are to keep these activities in pace with our development, we must provide more money year by year for these business undertakings, in order to give to the public the services to which they are entitled. The staffs of the departments and busithis year. ness undertakings are to a large extent outside the control of the Treasurer. Parliament has placed staff matters in the hands of the Public Service Board, the members of which are carefully scrutinizing the working of each department. Salaries and otlier conditions of employment are finally determined by the Public Service Arbitrator. mies effected in this budget have been brought about even though the awards of Dr. Earle Page. the Arbitrator have increased salaries in the last year by £250,000 per annum. As far as is possible for the Government directly to effect savings in administration, action is being taken, as in the case of the taxation offices, where the work of Commonwealth and state collection is being concentrated in the hands of Last year, the actual exthe state office, and duplication is being It will be eliminated. There is an increase under the head of invalid and old-age pensions, with which I propose to deal later. There remain only two other general heads under which increases are shown, namely, capiappropriations. As to the former, it suffices to say that the additional sum isOutside of irreducible items, payable to the states owing to the increase of population. The additional expenditure under the head of Other Special Appropriations, however, needs some special reference. The estimated expenditure under Other Special Appropriations is £3,365,161, as compared with £2,992,786. The increase is £372,375, and is much more than accounted for by the interest and sinking fund on public debt incurred for purposes other than those of war. The total paid in respect of interest and The estimated expenditure is sinking fund in 1923-24 was £1,315,165, whereas we expect to pay in the current year a total of £2,044,105, the additional payments amounting to £728,940. To exI t would be possible to plain this increase is not difiicult, because it is due to the loan expenditure which has recently been undertaken for developmental purposes, including the extension of the services of the Postmaster-General's department. The only other item which is included in the table I have just used, and which requires attention, is that of the special defence provision of £1,000,000. This amount will presently be explained when I set out the general defence proposals of Total Expenditure. In addition to the expenditure already set out, there is. a considerable sum which we pay as interest on loans raised for the states. Usually we exclude the figure from the total expenditure, because there is always a corresponding item on the receipts side of the account, and because, in any case, the The econoexpenditure is not really ours. ""We estimate that we ' shall have to pay, in 1924-25, £923,785 on this account. Including that amount, the total expenditure £64,368,968. Defence. The Government has given careful consideration to the question. of the defence of Australia before deciding the sums to be set aside for the services. The responsibility for defence cannot be evaded even by a laudable desire to restrict unproductive expenditure. the march of events brings nearer the goal to which so many nations are now happily aiming, we cannot allow the country to remain in a defenceless state inviting attack. The Government desires to establish a definite defence policy on a sound basis. It is abundantly clear from past experience that lack of policy or lack of continuity is a f r u it f u l source of waste. A policy cannot properly be framed if its basis is merely the amount of money annually available. capable of acceleration or reduction as the international situation changes is essential. It is not at present within our power to make defensive preparations on such a scale as will enable us unaided to resist attack. As part of a great empire which in the past we have done our part in assisting, we look in case of need in the future to the aid of the remainder of the Empire. The Government believes that a need for a forward movement' exists, and a plan to that end has been devised. To maintain our existing forces on their nucleus basis absorbs a sum of £3,836,997. To retain what we have, which is essential for any expansion the future may demand, and keep it at its present degree of efficiency, the amount cannot be reduced -a facility which in the past has been To inaugurate a modest programme of development, iipon which the Government has decided, there will be required this year the additional sum of £1,000,000. The programme is marked out in stages, the first stage totalling five years, and at the end of that period the Government expects that the defences of the country will have advanced to a definite point. Before proceeding to outline that five year policy, I desire to state that, as a first chargei upon the £1,000,000, the Government proposes to devote the sum of £70,000 towards the betterment of the pay of the Auxiliary Naval Porces and the Permanent Military Forces. The Navy, being our first line of deof 1924-25 is estimated at fence, has received first consideration. The five-year programme contemplates the provision of two 10,000-ton cruisers of modern type. These are adaptable to our requirements. They are capable of co-operation, if need arises, with the ships of the Royal Navy, and they are peculiarly suitable for the protection of out Until sea-borne trade. In addition, two seagoing submarines of modern type will be provided. These, added to our present resources, will give us a definite unit. In fche allocation of the existing surplus it will be seen that funds for the provision of these vessels are being provided independently of the programme of £1,000,000 per annum. From the sum mentioned we w ill within the period named make provision for five 8,000-ton oil tanks and 32,000 tons of oil. W it h in the present year, of course, only a small Some fixed plan portion of the programme can be achieved. But the sum set aside this year w ill make good the deficiencies in existing personnel, give additional training to the Citizen Naval Forces, and produce one 8,000-ton oil tank. The air is now an important factor, and a development of the A i r Force is incumbent. We cannot afford to allow this service to degenerate. A policy has therefore been framed, aiming at the end of five years in giving us, in addition to the existing cadres, four new units. This year it w ill be possible out of the sum allocated to provide two of the four units, both stationed in New South Wales. In addition, the establishment of what is known as an aircraft depot or principal air mobilization store w ill be provided at Laverton, by means of which we shall be enabled to make f u l l use of our resources lacking. The needs of the Navy and the A i r have had to receive first consideration. Nevertheless, a limited programme for the Army has been prepared. W it h continued vigour we will prosecute requirements according to fcheir order of importance. A small sum will be devoted to raising the efficiency of the Citizen Force personnel, to whom we look for trained staff and leaders. But our main effort will be devoted to the repair of the deficiencies which we know to exist in our munitions supply. Our organization has been drawn up, and we know the number of guns -with which we .shall be able to equip our war forces. For the present we have set ourselves the definite task within five years to provide for our field guns a certain number of rounds per gun which professional opinion regards as a reasonable minimum. setting aside annually a sum of some £200,000, which w ill be devoted to the purchase and import of our requirements. Plans will year by year be steadily advanced u n t i l we are able to manufacture locally field guns and ammunition and fuses for guns up to 6-inch calibre. That, in addition to our existing power of manufacturing small arms and ammunition, will advance us a definite stage in our national policy of self-containment as far as it is practicable. Repatriation. The estimated expenditure for the financial year for general Repatriation is £930,600, showing a reduction of £74,900 compared with the actual expenditure during 1923-24. The administrative staff is steadily being reduced as activities decline. Medical treatment is becoming more and more the outstanding feature of repatriation work, the benefits of vocational training, sustenance of soldier settlers, furniture grants, & c , gradually disappearing. During the course of the year the scope of assistance under the head of living allowances was widened considerably, and more liberal provision to the extent of £20,000 per year was made for the education of soldiers' children. Medical Treatment. ment is costing £425,000 per annum, and the number of men under attention is increasing owing to age, progress of disease, and war disabilities complicated with diseases of civil life. During the last year, 27,809 applications for medical attention or surgical aids were approved, and this number w ill be increased in the present year as a result of the grant of medical benefits to widows, orphans, and widowed mothers of deceased unmarried soldiers. W it h a view to the most satisfactory provision patients, an 'agreement has been entered into with the authorities of the State of Victoria, and agreements are now i u course or completion wren the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia to ensure treatment under the Dr. Earle Page. best possible conditions. The soldier patients still, however, will remain a responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. The number of war pensions is still in creasing. Additional expenditure is also This involves required for living allowances, which were made more liberal last year, especially for married soldiers who suffer total in capacity of a temporary character, and for soldiers who are incapacitated to the extent of 65 per cent, OT more. The sum of £5,250 has been provided in the Estimates for the manufacture of light metal limbs which, by lessening the fatigue of maimed soldiers, must prove of very great benefit in advancing tlieir welfare. Royal Commission on Pensions. To ensure that the best method shall be adopted in determining whether an. ex-soldier's disability is due to or aggravated by war service, a royal commission composed of distinguished men of the medical profession is being appointed to investigate the existing methods pf deciding the origin of disabilities and the degree of their aggravation by war service. War Service Homes. A t fche close of 1923-24, 24,381 war service homes had been provided. Every effort has beeu made to dispose of arrears, with the result that most of the branches are now in a position to deal with current requests without delay. During the *yea,r the Government decided to dispose of the timber mills and forests in Queensland, and although a loss Medical treatwas made, the result was satisfactory. In v a l i d and Old-age Pensions. The maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions was increased last year from 30s. to 35s. per fortnight. A further liberalization was effected by raising the amount which an old-age pensioner might earn without affecting the rate of his pension. Other concessions were made in the payment of 3s. per week to inmates of hospitals and in the grant of similar pensions to all inmates of benevolent asylums wbo would have been eligible for pensions if resident outside for treatment of mental the institutions. In addition, the statutory l i m it of property was increased from £310 to £400. The effect is shown in the pensions list for the twelve months ended 30th .Tune, 1924. A t that date there were 113,054 old-age and 42,617 invalid pensions, a total of 155,671, being an increase of 8,213 pensions during tbe twelve months, after allowing for deaths. This is the largest increase which has been experienced in any one year since 1911. The latest figures show that 271 persons in every 10,000 of the population are in receipt of either an old-age or an invalid pension, and the amount paid by the Commonwealth in respect of those pensions during the past year was £6,523,881. referred to did not become operative until the 13th September, 1923, so that the f u l l effect will not be felt until the present year, for which the estimate is £7,000,000, or an increase of about £500,000. The Royal Commission on National Insurance is continuing its investigations on the whole subject of pensions, invalidity, casual sickness, and unemployment. Maternity Allowances. The operation of the Maternity Allowance Aet during the past year shows a slight falling off in the number of allowances paid-the total being 3,652 less than that for the preceding year. This indicates a reduction in the birth rate. The question of mothers' welfare also is receiving the attention of the Royal Commission on National Insurance. Tasmania and Western Australia. The position of Tasmania and Western Australia has been recognized' since the beginning of federation as warranting special consideration from the Commonwealth. In the case of Tasmania, a special grant of £900,000 spread over ten years was voted by Parliament. . The payment commenced in 1912, and after the expiration of the ten years' period, a special grant of £85,000 was made each, succeeding year. The Tasmanian Government recently appealed for assistance under section 96 of the Constitution, owing to tine position in which the state had found itself, and asked for an increase of £115,000 on the present grant. The Commonwealth Government replied that it would be prepared to consider Tasmania's request if the state taxation in. Tasmania were brought approximately up to that obtaining iii other states, and -if evidence of economy were given. The Tasmanian Government has now reported tihat its measures have increased the taxation by the sum of 12s. per head, and that it is making every endeavour to secure economy. The Commonwealth Government has now considered the best way of assisting Tasmania, and has decided to continue the grant of £85,000 this year, and to reduce the amount by £17,000 each succeeding year. The Commonwealth will, at the same time, evacuate permanently the taxation of lotteries in Tasmania, The concessions previously from which the Commonwealth derived £111,000 per year. It is understood that the Tasmanian Government is ready to re-impose that tax. It is hoped that this substantial aid, the greater part of which is permanent, will make Tasmania's position such as to render further assistance from the Commonwealth unnecessary. The position of Western Australia has been recognized as exceptional from the framing of the Constitution until to-day. Section 95 of the Constitution provided that the Parliament of the state of Western Australia might, during the first five years after the imposition of uniform Customs duties, impose a special tariff on goods passing into that state and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. These duties, which were collected by the Commonwealth and paid to the state, totalled £868,963. In 1910, Western Australia's position was again recognized to be exceptional, and provision was made for an annual payment of £250,000, half by the Commonwealth and half by the states, for 25 years, reducing by £10,000 a year. The Tariff Board has recently presented a report which states that the position of Western Australia under federation warrants consideration and special treatment. It also makes recommendations in regard to legislation to give the Minister power to prevent dumping in Western Australia of goods from the eastern states, and suggests an expert investigation into the position of Western Australia, with a view to determining whether or not further financial assistance is justified. The Government has decided to appoint a royal commission to consider the points raised by the Tariff Board, and to report . thereon. The InterestB ill .

Customs and Excise Eevenue, 1924-25-Unde r existing conditions, it is very difficult to estimate the revenue to be received from Customs and excise. While our currency remains detached from the gold basis, prices are liable to fluctuations of a more or less serious character, and, though the note issuing authority in Australia undoubtedly will t r y to arrange the circulation of paper in such a way as to prevent considerable changes of the general price level, the possibility of fluctuation introduces an element of uncertainty in the making of an estimate of Customs and excise receipts. It may be pointed out, too,' that the present exchange situation induces importations, and any amelioration in that respect will re-act in the direcconcession will benefit 200,000 taxpayers, tion of the restriction of imports. A f t e r consideration of all the circumstances, including the existing tightness of money, I do not think we can expect to receive more than £34,000,000 in the present year, that amount being £1,750,000 less than the actual £1,128,000 more than the revenue of 1922-23. Income Tax, 1924-25. The federal income tax was imposed to meet war necessities. These are continuing obligations, and, though the war is over, there are still very heavy commitments for war pensions, also for interest and sinking f u n d on the war debt. The Government is anxious that this form of direct taxation be alleviated, and the field of income tax should Dr. Earle Page. be evacuated by the Commonwealth at the earliest possible moment. The vexation caused by this tax was .. . . £17,7S2,143 lessened last year to some extent by the .. .2,181,675 action of the Government in arranging for one form of return both for the Cominterest, monwealth and for the states. This year .. £19,963,818 the Government intends still further .to lighten the burden by exempting a large number of taxpayers who have hitherto paid tax, and by making a percentage reduction of the tax payable by individuals whose incomes are above the new .. . . £2,363,318 exempted amount. .. .. 396,000 A remission of taxation on incomes is rendered possible only because we are re.. £2,759,318 ceiving a large revenue from duties of Customs and excise. Much of these imposts falls upon persons with small incomes and large families. On such persons income tax presses with severity, and the Government has decided to ask Parliament to grant them a substantial concession. The general income tax exemption will be increased fro m £200 to £300, and w ill diminish by £ 1 for every £ 3 by which the income exceeds £ 3 0 0 . All persons in receipt of incomes up to £1,200, or 96 per cent, of the taxpayers, w ill benefit as a result of raising the exemption. These still w ill bear a large share of the burden of indirect taxation. Persons numbering 260,000 w ill be relieved. altogether of payment of income tax and, by reason of the higher exemption, 180,000 other taxpayers will obtain a reduction of tax. The tax payable by individuals who still remain in the field of income tax will be reduced by 10 per cent. This further and must have an important influence on development in Australia. In view of the special circumstances of the gold-mining industry, the Government has decided to exempt fro m income tax the profit derived from gold-mining until revenue of last year, and the whole of the working capital invested has been returned to the owners. The remission of tax in these directions involves a reduction of revenue ancl a lightening of the burden of taxation by £2,000,000. In the year 1922-23, ""when the present Prime Minister was Treasurer, concessions amounting to £2,100,000 were made in income tax rates, and at that time the number of individual taxpayers was diminished from 750,000 to 460,000. The new proposal will secure a substantial reduction of the work of the Taxation Department, and economies in administration will, of course, result. Thus we are brought one stage nearer to total evacuation by the Commonwealth of the income tax field, and it may be pointed out that the capitation payments to the states w ill soon approximate very closely to the yield of federal income tax, so far as it is paid by individuals. In £2,000,000, the tax on lotteries is being discontinued as part of the proposal to assist Tasmania. the £111,000 from this .source, which, I am given to understand, Tasmania w ill reimpose. Queensland w ill also benefit by this decision. In view of recent legal decisions, the Government proposes to introduce legislation to provide that in ""the years 1918-19 to 1921-22, inclusive, live stock on hand at the beginning and end of each year shall be brought to account at market values. There w ill be a proviso, however, that any taxpayer, who does not notify the department within three months that he desires his assessments to be amended so as to account for live stock at market values, shall be deemed to have accepted the values at which live stock have already been included by the department in those assessments. The proposed legislation will extend this option to the assessments for 1915-16, 1916-17, and 1917-18, so that all asessments at values other than market values may be accepted by the taxpayers as final. To carry out the intention of Parliament, an amendment of the Income Tax Act will be submitted in order to validate past assessments on income earned in relation to assignment or transfer of leases. The Government also proposes to amend the act in regard to the deduction allowed for depreciation of plant, machinery, &c. The present method of calculating a deduction will be retained, but an alternative will be provided. This will permit a deduction of the amount required to write off the cost during the estimated life of the asset. Entertainments seems to be no necessity for the taxation of entertainments which are occasionally held for public and religious purposes and for thc purpose of raising funds for the building of memorial halls. It is, therefore, intended to exclude these classes of casual entertainments from the operation of the act. Postmaster-General's Revenue, 1924-25. The business of the Postmaster-General's department is expanding generally, and it is only natural that we should now begin to feel the effects of the additions to the capital works which have been in progress for -two years. The estimate for the year is £10,004,000, or an increase addition to the remission of of nearly £250,000 over the revenue of last year. New telephone services are affording A t the present time direct benefit to country users, and exCommonwealth receives about ceptional expansion is revealed in the work done during the year. The length of n ew pole routes erected for telephone trunks and country lines was 3,796 miles, and the wire mileage provided 47,126. The reduction of postage rates, which took effect from the l s t October, 1923, entailed a loss of revenue of approximately £800,000 during the nine months of 1923-24. The loss for a f u l l year approximates £1,067,000. It is estimated that the postage revenue for 1924-25 will be greater than that for 1923-24 by only £11,340. It must, however, be borne in mind that the reduced postage rates were in force for only nine months during 1923-24, and so last year got the benefit of the higher rates for three months. The department is engaged in a large programme of improving the telegraph system and meeting the abnormal demand for telephone service. Efforts have been directed during the past year to the elimination of arrears, and although these have not yet been overtaken, the position has materially improved. It is owing to the continuous abnormal public demand for facilities that the arrears have nob been entirely disposed of. During the year 49,000 requests for additional telephones were met. During 1923-24, £3,718,154 was spent on new telegraph and telephone works. In the same period the telegraph revenue increased by 4.7 per cent., and the telephone revenue increased by 10.68 per cent, after giving up £18,000 by way of Tax. There now reduced charges. For 1924-25, it is estimated that £3,230,000 will be spent on new telegraph and telephone works, and it is also estimated that the telephone revenue will increase by 10.8 per cent, after allowing for a loss of £58,000 through reduced charges. expected to increase by 3.5 per cent. It will serve a useful purpose now to set out a short statement covering the major figures of the Estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department for the year 1924-25. As already stated, thc revenue is estimated at £10,004,000 Ta amouutingto Bringing thc total receipts of the Department up to . .

Revenue under Other Heads, 1924-25. Apart from the items already referred to, the Estimates for the new year show no remarkable divergence from the figures of the previous year, except in relation to interest paid by states on loans made to them by the Commonwealth for soldier land Under this head, a total of £1,825,000 is estimated for the current year, that being roughly £1,000,000 more than was received in the preceding year. The explanation is ""that about £500,000 which did not come to hand last year has been added to the normal expectation of 1924-25. Total Estimated Revenue, 1924-25. Under all heads, including repayment of interest on loans raised for the states and repayment of f r u it advances, I estimate that the total revenue of the Commonwealth in the current year will be £64,395,000, £66,017,203 received in 1923-24. Honourable members who are interested will, no doubt, refer for details to the budget tables, which are being circulated as usual. Surplus of 1924-25.

The carrying forward was unavoidable because we had heavy payments to make under these heads in the first few days of the financial year, and it was necessary to have a sum in hand because the revenue of the period would not suffice. The amounts having served the purpose indicated, will stand as a reserve against as compared with any possible shortage of revenue, and thus will ensure a continuance of the present payments, which were liberalized last year by this Government ... 600,003' Total surplus at 30th June, 1924 ... ... 5,100,003 The amounts set down for defence con64,395,000 struction are essentially in the nature of insurance premiums for our national safety.

Under some circumstances, it is not improper to use a surplus for remission of taxation, but, in the circumstances in wbich we find ourselves, it is necessary to keep the amount of remission on this occasion within the limits of the surplus which otherwise would accrue in the accounts of the current. financial year. The Government is satisfied that it is acting in the best interests of Australia by dealing with the accumulated surplus of previous years in the manner described.

The first war loan redemption and conversion operations, covering debt totalling £58,299,478, were successfully carried out in Australia. National Debti Sinking Eund. In August last, an act was passed by the Parliament to establish and to safeguard a sinking fund for the national debt. The earlier sinking funds were merged in the new sinking fund, and provision was made for a sum of at least 10s. for every £100 of the net debt being paid annually out of revenue to the trustees of the new fund. payable for a period of fifty years, both in respect of old debt and of new debt created subsequent to the act. An additional annual payment of 20s. for each £100 of the debt incurred for postal works must also be made to the sinking fund. tion is provided because, generally speaking, postal works must be replaced in considerably less than 50 years. Half of the profits of the Commonwealth Bank are also payable to the sinking fund. The debt redeemed from the sinking funds in 1923-24 totalled £3,008,233, as follows:Contributions from Bevenue Repayments of moneys lent by thc Commonwealtli Half Commonwealth Bank pro Its for six monthsjended 31st December, 1923'..

The trustees of the national debt sinking fund are the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, the Solicitor-General, and the Secretary to the Treasury. With such a commission, there can be no doubt that the sinking funds will be applied solely for the extinction of the national debt, as directed by Parliament. Adequate and duly-safeguarded sinking funds are essential for the maintenance of the high credit of Australia. In view of the necessity for further borrowing for development, nothing is more important than action which will show investors both in Australia and overseas that we are determined to meet our obligations, and have entered into definite and well-considered plans for that purThis contribution is pose. The sinking funds of the several states are not arranged on any common basis, but I am glad to say that the states agreed to make-contributions to sinking funds at the rate of 10s. per annum for each £100 of new loans raised. They This heavier contribuhave not yet, however, taken all the steps necessary to give effect to this agreement. Co-ordination of borrowing. For several years, efforts had been made to overcome the difficulties arising out of the competition of the six states with each other and with the Commonwealth in the raising of loan moneys. No action of practical value was taken, however, until the establishment of the Australian £1,430,141 Loan Council in May, 1923. This .. . . £1,188,246 council, consisting of the Treasurers of the Commonwealth and of the states, was .. .. 61,673 created as the result of representations 110,054 218,119 made by the Commonwealth Government, 1,578,092 and has as its objects the prevention of .. . . £3,008,233 undue competition and clashing. At its first meeting, held on the lst loans in Australia up to June, 1924, were the Loan Council authority to determine the time and method of placing loans in Australia, were also considered, but the members of the council were not then prepared to agree that there should be only one borrower. As the smaller states appeared to be under a disadvantage in securing loan moneys during 1923-24, the Commonwealth agreed to lend £1,250,000 to Queensland and £750,000 to Western Australia, in order to make it unnecessary for thoso states to approach the market during the progress of the Oommonwealth war gratuity effort. These arrangements proved to be satisfactory so far as they went, but further experience convinced all concerned that the solution of the difficulties could be found only by an agreement for one authority to borrow on behalf of all. At further meetings of the council in June and July of this year, a unanimous desire was expressed to limit borrowing, and the following resolution was carried :The Australian Loan Council, having had under review the loan requirements of the various states and the Commonwealth for the forthcoming financial year, agrees as to the advisability of concerted action being taken by the states and the Commonwealth to raise the amounts required in Australia for the year. After careful consideration, and recognizing the need for some central body functioning on behalf of both states and Commonwealth, the council agrees that the Commonwealth should arrange a loan for the agreed amount, and the states will give inscribed stock, bearing concurrent obligations, to the Commonwealth for the amounts allocated on a basis to be determined. The Treasurers placed the Loan Council's proposals before their respective Cabinets,and all . the governments accepted the council's recommendation for a reduction of their contemplated loan programmes. upon the proportion of the loans that shoiild be raised in Australia and overseas, and that might be undertaken without disturbance of the national financial position. Proposals for giving effect to the reduced programme will shortly be submitted to Parliament, and honourable members will be asked to agree to the issue through a central borrowing authority of a loan for subscription in Australia, to provide moneys for the public works of the states during the financial year 1924-25. Tax-Free Loans. In 1918, the Commonwealth discontinued the issue of tax-free loans, believing that it was undesirable and inequitable to add to the already large amount of income which had been placed outside the field of taxation. As five of the states had always followed the practice of issuing loans bearing tax-free interest, the Commonwealth Government suggested at the Premiers' Conference in May, 1923, that the states should agree to interest on all their future loans being subject to taxation. This proposal was accepted by the states, and subsequently the Commonwealth Parliament passed an act providing that all governmental loans issued in Australia after the 1st January, 1924, shall be subject to federal income tax. The position now is that no more loans free of federal income taxes can be issued either by the Commonwealth or by the states, but until two of the states have passed further legislation, the interest on all loans, except those of Tasmania, will remain free of state income tax.

Redemption and Conversion Loans. The large redemption and conversion loans of 1923-24 provided for the continuation of a, 5 per cent, war loan of £38,693,050, which matured on the 15th September, 1923, and for meeting the war gratuities which matured on the 31st May, 1924, and totalled £19,606,428.

The balance of June, 1924, consists ofwar gratuity indebtedness which the Treasury was called on to redeem, after allowing for the conversions, was £15,675,336, of which £7,702,590 was provided by new cash subscriptions received from the public, and £6,000,000 was subscribed by the note issue department of the Common-year was £410,996,316, so that there was wealth Bank.

Allowing only for these liquid assets, the net national debt has been reduced by £1,382,823 during 1923-24. However, as the loan expenditure during the year chiefly has been on works which will be immediately productive, such as telephones, &c, the true position of the national debt can be ascertained only by a comparison of the deadweight debtthat is, the debt after allowance is made, not only for recoverable moneys, but also for Though the value of these revenue-producing assets cannot be given exactly, it is clear that the deadweight debt has ""been reduced during the year by approximately £7,000,000. Maturity of Debt. The debt due to the public matures as follows: 192425 192526 192627 192728 192829 1930-31 1933-34 1940-41 1944-45 1948-49 Various dates Total debt due to the public Nearly all the debt due to the public and maturing in the next ten years is payable in Australia. The figures for 1925-26 include £68,813,950 of 4£ per cent, stock and bonds redeemable in Australia on the 15th December, 1925. This 4^ per cent, debt is free of federal income tax, and j t will be necessary for the Commonwealth to float a loan during 1925 fco provide for the continuation of the greater part of it . made by the Australian Loan Council for one borrowing authority to act on behalf of the states and the Commonwealth during this financial year has a most important bearing on this loan-renewal operation. The plan of the Loan Council provides for all the new money required in Australia during 1924-25 being raised in the first half of the financial year, so that the Commonwealth may have a clear field for its conversion loan after the lst January, 1925.

Assistance to Primary Producers. In the opinion of the Government the most urgent problem facing Australia to-day is that of markets to enable our great exporting industries to expand. Upon the solution depend development, finance, and power to absorb the ever-increasing population which is vital to our national security and prosperity. ment has declared its intention to render a measure of assistance, so that the exporting industries effectively may meet competition in the world's markets. In providing assistance, the Government is following the action taken by many other countries where marketing problems have become the chief economic consideration. Two notable examples are those of New Zealand, where legislation has -been passed to give effective control of export marketing to the organized producers of that country, and the United States of America, where the marketing problems of the farmer have become the anxious concern of Congress and of the executive. The general principles by which the Government will be guided in determining what assistance should be given to any particular industry were laid down by the Prime Minister in his Sydney speech of the 16th April. He then declared that the basis of the Government's proposals was that help would be given only to those industries which were prepared to help themselves, and that a condition precedent to any assistance must be an effective organization which will achieve permanent results. Immediately after the Prime Minister's speech, steps were taken by the Government to ascertain the present position of the exporting industries, tbeir future prograve unemployment problems as being spects, and the degree of organization which had been attained for efficient production, marketing and distribution. As a result of the inciuiries. the Government is satisfied that in many of our exporting industries the methods of production, the degree of organization, and the system of marketing leave a great deal to be desired. ducers have in some cases made earnest efforts to remedy defects, many attempts have failed owing to the lack of unity among the producers themselves. The Government is continuing its investigations, and is also in negotiation with the representatives of several of the exporting industries. investigations and negotiations will take a considerable time before the arrangements ' can be completed to place the industries on a basis of efficient production and adequate organization for the distribution and marketing of products. Pending the final decision as to what action should be taken, it is necessary Dr. Earle Page. The .Governthat some measure of assistance should be given where individual industries are threatened with an immediate crisis. Two instances of that kind have arisen during the Government's inquiriesnamely, the dried fruit industry and a section of the wine industry. In the dried frui t industry, the situation has been met by the scheme, as already announced, for guaranteeing the temporary continuance of advances, a cessation of which was threatened owing to the inability of the ordinary sources further to finance. The crisis in a section of the wine industry has been met by a bounty payable to the growers of Doradilla grapes, in which State Governments have been asked to bear an equal share. It is not possible at present to state exactly the amount of the parliamentary appropriation which will be necessary to carry out the policy of assistance to exporting industries, but for the present year it is estimated that a sum of £500,000 will be sumcient, and this amount is being provided out of the surplus of the year 1923-24. Preference. The problem of markets also affects countries dependent upon the export of manufactured goods. Great Britain now regards the solution of her mainly dependent upon the provision of markets. The Government is satisfied that the people of Great Britain are now beginning to understand what an enormous part the Empire, and particularly the self-governing dominions, can play in the provision of these essential markets, and also that the absorption of BriThough the protish migrants by the dominions is directly conditioned by the provision of stable markets for the produce of -the dominions. The Government is convinced that the final solution of many of Australia's marketing problems will be found in the adoption by both Britain and the self governing dominions of joint schemes of Necessarily, the Imperial economic development. It is therefore determined to do everything in its power to promote the adoption of such a policy of reciprocal preference and to co-operate with the other Governments of the Empire towards the solution of these joint problems. The Government is negotiating with the Government of New Zealand with a view to obtaining special tarif f advantages for Australian currants and raisins. Under tbe present New Zealand tariff and agreements currants and raisins are admitted free into New Zealand, irrespective of origin. tralia enjoys no preference. Tbe New Zealand tariff contains a provision whereby a "" suspended"" duty of 2d. per lb. on these products may be brought into effect by Orderi n Council. of the negotiations is to have the suspended duty brought into effect. Government hopes for a successful issue. Thc Government has taken further steps for a reciprocal tariff treaty with Canada. perial Conferences, the Prime Minister made arrangements for negotiations between Canada and Australia. sult of these negotiations is at present receiving the earnest consideration of the Government. The Prime Minister also took the opportunity, whilst in London, to confer with General Smuts on the subject of a new treaty between SouthA f r i c a and Australia, and the matter is now approaching completion. Dairying. The Government is examining the conditions of the dairying indust r y , the serious position of producers in which is f u l l y appreciated by the Government. The industry has been going through a critical period during the last two years. Though the average price would be considered satisfactory, the great and sudden depression of two years in succession, showing a drop of £ 2 per cwt. in a couple of weeks, at a time when Australian butter was on the British markets in heaviest supply, caused dairy farmers to lose heart to some extent. This, and drought in 1922 and 1923 over a large section of New South Wales and Queensland, reduced the incomes of dairy farmers considerably, and, as a result, development has not been as great as had been expected. There is, however, material evidence that matters are considerably improving. The prospect for the forthcoming season is good., and though the export may not reach the high level which 1921-22 showed, when our total export of butter amounted to 2,274,000 boxes, it is anticipated that we shall export 1,500,000 boxes in the current year, as against an export of slightly over 1,000,000 boxes in the year ended the 30th June last. Though exports have been depressed, the quality of Australian butter has improved, when compared with last year. Consequently, AusThe policy of the Commonwealth Government in enforcing stricter conditions of export and a national brand has been a material influence in bringing about this improvement. The object Prices are expected to be satisfactory, provided the market conditions are proThe perly organized. The cost of production of butter and cheese throughout the world continues high, as a result of increased wages, and that cost cannot be expected to. f a l l to anything like pre-war levels During his visit to the I m while prices generally remain high everywhere. F r u it . The CannedF r u it Pools, estabThe relished in 1920-21 and 1921-22, have at last been brought to an end. On this year's Estimates is an amount of £154,000 to meet the remaining losses. The total amount paid to the growers on the three Pools of the years 1920-21, 1921-22, and 1922-23 was £336,952, and to canners £943,211 . The total losses, including interest, amounted to £643,000. The present Government found that no progress was being made, under the pool system, towards the stabilization of the f r u it industry, and little success might have been expected., in view of the fact that the growers and canners were relieved of all responsibility in the purchase and sale of f r u it . In view of the large stocks on hand in 1923,the ""Government determined to use them in popularizing Australian f r u it and stimulating its consumption in Australia. A substantial reduction in price, together with an intensive advertising campaign, brought a pleasing result, for the consumption increased by 300 per cent, during the past year. For the 1923-24 season, the Government resolved to place the whole responsibility of disposing of this product on the industry itself. To assist the industry during the period of transition from Government control to private responsibility, a bounty was offered to the canners on conditions that all f r u it available was taken and the grower paid not less than an approved minimum price for his f r u it . The bounty was paid for the production of canned fruits of approved quality, and a further bounty on all approved high quality export. Twenty-nine factories accepted the scheme, and operated at full capacity. They will have canned 28,000 tons of fruit by the end of August, making up a total pack of 2,220,000 dozen 30-oz. tins of fruits canned for bounty. Thanks to the success attained by the Prime Minister and Senator Wilson in having jthe old stock disposed of and sold as Australian fruit in England, and also owing to the high quality and grading of the pack, there bas been a great demand in Great Britain, and the prices have been better than the best realized by California. The results of the Government's action both in Australia and in Great Britain indicate that the trouble experienced 'in the fruit industry is the result of an insufficient production, a continuous supbane, and Adelaide. ply to the oversea market nob being available, rather than over-production, as was so pessimistically suggested last year in some quarters. Though the quantity of fruit handled by the canning factories this season exceeded that of the previous season by 5,000 tons, there is good reason to expect that the whole of the 1923-24 pack will be sold before the next canning season commences. Presh Fruit. The total export of fresh apples from Australia this year is 1,680,700 bushel cases. Owing to the unfavorable season, this quantity is less than the export of the previous year. Prices have, however, shown a considerable improvement in Great Britain. Australian apples are at present selling at prices ranging from 12s. 6d. to 20s. a case. Early in the season prices ranged from l is . to 15s. Sugar. The Auditor-General's certifi-' eate on the conclusion of Commonwealth sugar control on 30th June, 1923, revealed a credit balance of £65,958. Of this £40,000 has been paid into the Consolidated Revenue-the remainder being held against possible disputed claims. ' During control from 9th July, 1915, to 30th June, 1923, the Commonwealth, handled 1,705,126 tons of Australian raw sugar, averaging £29 2s. 7d. per ton c.i.f., and 475,947 tons of foreign raw sugar, averaging £37 19s. per ton c.i.f. refinery, or a total of 2,181,073 tons, having a turnover value of £73,500,000. The purely governmental supervision and audit of these transactions cost £10,945, or only a minute fraction of the turnover. Dr. Earle Page. Although the Government suffered considerable loss on foreign importations in 1919-20, the Australian average price during the entire control period was only 4.38d. per lb. retail, and the small profit of only about 0.1 per cent, was made. Tlie Pool created by the industry and the Queensland Government under arrangement with the Commonwealth Government last year is carrying on satisfactorily under thej management of the Queensland Sugar Board. Sugar is still being supplied for export purposes at the Australian equivalent of the world's parity. For internal consumption it is supplied at Fremantle, Hobart, and Launceston at the prices obtaining in Sydney, Melbourne, BrisSugar is supplied to manufacturers of fruit products and condensed milk at less than the ordinary prices, with the object of assisting the fruit and dairying industries. The sugar industry has, by a big increase in crop, reacted toi the fair and reasonable treatment received under the arrangement made by the Government last year, and it is expected that approximately 70,000 tons will be available for export this season. Wool. As foreshadowed in my budget speech last year, there has been a considerable falling off in Australia's wool production. Compared with the preceding year, there was a reduction of over 200,000 bales in 1923-24, and, when compared with the year ended 30fch June, 1920, last season's clip showed a decrease of over 300,000 bales. Unfavorable seasonal conditions were portly responsible for the adverse movement, and to the extent that they were not so, this falling off in the production is a serious matter. Sales proceeded, during last year, practically without interruption, competition was keen and generally well sustained, and the satisfactory prices were fully maintained. Overseas manufacturers, faced with a world shortage of merino wool, are each year realizing more fully the necessity of coming toi the source of supply, and a conspicuous feature of the year just closed was the increase in the number of buyers operating in the Australian market. Advices from all states indicate that the coming season's wool clip will, as a whole, be sounder, better nourished, heavier in condition and somewhat stronger in quality than that of last year, but, as is almost invariably the case when seasons are good, it will carry more seed and vegetable matter. The"" B . A . W . R . A . "" wools, the exhausted condition of manufacturers' stocks, and the fact that the world's supply of wool is now below manufacturers' demands, are all factors likely to maintain the present value of wool for some time to come. Wheat. The present high prices ruling in the world's wheat market, which seem likely to be maintained, is a development that is most encouraging to those engaged in the industry. There is every indication of a ready demand at remunerative prices for the present season's crop. The Government has indicated its willingness to co-operate with the various state Governments, under certain conditions, to assist in the marketing of this year's crop. Migration. The development of migration to Australia during last year showed some improvement. Since the Commonwealth Government assumed control overseas in March, 1921, 74,343 assisted m i grants have been brought to Australia, and of these 26,511 entered during 1923. Tho Commonwealth participation in the migration scheme is confined to the recruiting, selection, and conveyance of m i grants on requisitions furnished by the State Governments. The London organization for this purpose is now capable of supplying far more migrants than have yet been requisitioned, and the Government is endeavouring, by offering further encouragement to the states, to induce a larger flow of migrants up to a total of 50,000 per annum. Three land settlement schemes had already been entered into with individual states by the British and Commonwealth Governments jointly, under which provision is made for the settlement on farms of 14,000 families and their dependants over a period of five years. are, however, now being conducted with the British Government which, it is hoped, will lead to an additional comprehensive scheme covering all states. outstanding feature of the new proposal is the granting of substantial interest concessions by the British Government on £34,000,000, to be advanced by the Commonwealth to the states, not merely for fche purpose of land settlement as stipulated in the three agreements referred to, but for the financing of developmental and reproductive enterprises in Australia, which will ensure proper and profitable absorption of an average of 45,000 midisposal of the last of grants of all vocations per annum for ten years, and incidentally give a stimulus to local industry which should preclude any possibility of local unemployment. The Government is giving special attention to nominated migrants, 11,115 of these having been introduced during 1923. The special advantage of this latter form of migration lies in the fact that persons resident in Britain are nominated by their relatives and friends in Australia, who thus ensure their rapid assimilation into Australian citizenship and reduce fche possibility of failure to a minimum. Provision will also be made during this v ?ar in conjunction with the states and in accordance with agreement reached at the last ^Premiers' Conference, for the erection of proper receiving and training depots to ensure the most satisfactory reception and treatment of migrants upon arrival. Standardization and Power Survey. A t the instance of the Commonwealth Government a definite step forward has been taken with regard to the tabulation of the power resources of the Commonwealth through the preparation for the World's Power Conference, by the Australian In stitute of Engineers, of a comprehensive statement of the known power possibilities in Australia. A Power Survey Sectional Committee of the Australian Commonwealth Engineering Standards Association has also been formed, and this is proceeding immediately to a complete survey of the power resources of the Commonwealth with a view to their development and proper utilization. A t the same time the Electrical Standardization Committee is attempting to prepare uniform standards for Australia in relation to the development, transmission and distribution of power. The experience of the past year has Negotiations shown the absolute need of standardization in engineering, manufacturing, and other allied activities, to stop the huge economic loss now occurring. The diverThe sity, complexity, and magnitude of the work render it impossible to provide from voluntary sources the necessary assistance fco the numerous sectional sub-committees and panel-committees of the Commonwealth Engineering Standards Association. Ever-increasing numbers of engineers and technical experts are engaged ia a purely honorary capacity on technical details, and though accommodation has 1923-24 is very much less than that been found hitherto by the Australian incurred in 1922-23. That has happened Institute of Engineers in Sydney, the debecause more trees are coming into mands of the association are now greater bearing and because there has been a than the space available. The Government is therefore setting improvement should continue. aside a sum of £5,000, to be supplemented by another £5,000 to be contributed by state governments and industrial underthe following way:takings.

A rise in the price of copra would have a most important effect on the sale value of the properties. In view of this, perhaps the wisest policy will be found in hastening slowly.

Grafton-Kyogle-South Brisbane Bail-' way. by the Commonwealth and the state Governments to report upon the matter of uniform railway gauge for Australia presented its report on the 22nd September, 1921, and recommended that 4 f t . 8£ in. be adopted as the standard gauge for Australian railways, that action bo taken to secure a standard gauge railway between Brisbane and Perth, and that all railway lines, of 5 ft, 3 in. gauge owned by any of the states be converted to the Standard. The report was considered by the Prime Minister and the state Premiers in conference, when it was unanimously agreed that a uniform railway gauge was necessary in the interests of trade and commerce, and the safety of the Commonwealth, and that 4 ft . Si in. should be the standard gauge. A ll of the five states affected not having agreed to carry out the recommendations of the royal commission, the Commonwealth and the States of New South ""Wales and Queensland are considering a proposal to give partial effect to the recommendations by the execution of the following works, namely:(a) Construction of a railway of standard gauge between Kyogle, in New South Wales, and South Brisbane, in Queensland, so as to connect "" Sydney and South Brisbane; (o) The re-grading and re-laying of the existing railway between Grafton and Kyogle so as to bring that railway up to a prescribed standard.

The estimated cost of the construction of the works contemplated is £3,500,000, which it is proposed shall, in the first instance, be provided by the Commonwealth. The proportion of the cost will be borne as follows:The Commonwealth' will contribute one-fifth, plus the amounts which Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia would have conThe royal commission appointed tributed if they had come into the scheme. New South Wales and Queensland respectively will contribute towards . four-fifths of the cost in the proportion that the population of each of the two states bears to the total population of the five mainland states. The Commonwealth will pay interest on one-fifth, and, in addition, for the time being, will pay interest on the shares which, had agreement been arrived at by all the mainland states, would have been paid by Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. This is to be subject to review as each of the states comes to agreement on the railway gauge proposals. New South Wales and Queensland will pay interest on their respective shares on a capitation basis. The earnings from the railway in excess of working expenses w ill be used to defray the interest charges on the capital in vested in the following order: Firstly, on the amount representing the sum which the states of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia would have contributed had they been contributors. Secondly, on the amount contributed by New South Wales and Queensland. Thirdly, on tbe amount contributed by the Commonwealth. Surveys are now in hand, and when the agreement is ratified by the respective Parliaments there will be no delay in commencing the work. This may be regarded as the first portion of the uniform railway gauge scheme. The Government is giving consideration to the question of further development of this scheme to connect other capitals. Negotiations are at present proceeding with South Australia with regard to the construction of the North-South Line. Main Roads Development. Last financial year, an amount of £500,000 was granted by the Commonwealth to the various states, on the basis of £ 1 for £ 1 , ment. for constructing roads of a durable description, and so assisting settlers to market their produce. A further grant of £500,000 on similar conditions was recently authorized by Parliament, and the State Governments have been communicated with, requesting their participation in the grant. The expenditure of the first suin of £500,000 has been f u l l y authorized, and the construction of the roads is now proceeding. Comments have been made as to the apparently small expenditure from the grant up to the 30th June, 1924. It must be remembered, however, that organizations for the pro23er and economical expenditure of the money had to be developed in several of the states, and that endeavours were made to obtain contracts for most of the works before it was decided to carry out certain of them by departmental labour. It is anticipated that the unexpended balance of the first grant, and practically the whole of the recent grant, will be expended by the end of the present financial year. The construction of roads under this arrangement has proved of benefit to many settlers, and the expenditure of the money has diminished the unDr. Earle Page. employment which usually occurs in the winter months. It is hoped that, in succeeding years, Parliament will continue the grant, which w ill ensure good roads in the outback, where they are at present inadequate, and in many cases are only unformed tracks. River Murray Commission. Two of the works provided for in the River Murray : agreement have been completed and brought into operation, namely, the weirs and locks at Torrumbarry and Blanchetown. The following are now in course of construction: The Hume reservoir-wei r and lock No. 11 (Mildura), and the Lake Victoria storage-weir s and locks Nos. 2, 3, 5, 9. A t weir and lock No. 10 (Wentworth) preliminary work bas been put in hand, and it is anticipated that construction will commence at an early date. The River Murray agreement directs that the construction of works which will provide for the needs of irrigation shall have precedence over the construction of works which will be primarily for the requirements of navigation. The works now in hand are being expedited with a view to assisting in irrigation developThe total expenditure up to the 30th June, 1924, amounted to £2,704,834, towards which the Commonwealth Government contributed a quarter share. The expenditure proposed during the year 1924-25 amounts to £985,000. Establishment of Federal Capital. Special attention has been given to construction of the Federal Capital. The construction of a provisional Parliament House was commenced in January last; the brickwork of the main portion is nearly one story high. It is expected that the central portion and half of the pavilion accommodation of the main hostel w ill be finished before tbe end of this calendar year, and good progress is being made with the five additional pavilions. The construction of the No. 3 hostel has been commenced, and tenders w ill be called shortly for the No. 2 hostel. It is proposed to erect a provisional building, for the secretariats which will have to be accommodated after the opening of Parliament. The Public Works Committee is investigating this proposal. inestimable Cottages numbering 76 have now been completed, and further batches will be put in hand shortly. The first primary school was opened during the year, and it has been found necessary to undertake extensions, as originally intended, for 500 children. Steady progress with the main engineering services has been maintained. tivities in afforestation, city planting, and the manufacture of materials have been continued during the year. The expenditure for the .year ended 30th June, 1924, was £562,997, making a total capital expenditure at that date of £2,947,603.

The Commonwealth Government is of opinion that national economy is seriously affected by lack of uniformity and co-ordination of the Commonwealth and the states in the administration of the laws relating to health.

The Commonwealth Government has, therefore, decided to appoint a Royal Commission, on which both Commonwealth and states will be represented, to consider the present system of health legislation and administration, to make a recommendation designed to secure the most economical and efficient results, including the elaboration of a national policy which can be followed by all authorities.

As the disturbance of the war recedes further and further, our general position as regards production keeps on improving. A comprehensive review indicates that, with the exception of mining other than coal, the industries of Australia, both primary and secondary, have got back into a position which, when considered in relation to population, is at least equal to that occupied in the years preceding the war, and when considered absolutely is very much better than the pre-war position. Pastoral production certainly is not up to the pre-war standard in quantity, but the prices ruling for wool more than offset the shortage -Ordinanc e of 1924-No. 10-Gaining.

The The proposal provides for the further development of the main sewerage scheme for Canberra, portions of which have already been investigated by the Publio Works Committee and approved by Parliament. In 1915 the main outfall sewer from the city boundary to Western Creek, a distance of 3 miles, was approved, and its construction is approaching completion. In 1922 the main intercepting -sewer connecting the main outfall sewer to the centre of the city wa? similarly approved, and its construction is well advanced. It is now proposed to proceed with the next stage,' the southern intercepting sewer, leading from the centre of the city towards the eastern boundary, that is from Commonwealthavenue to Eastlake.

60,Mr Anstey (Bourke) [8.6],"Th eintroducing this bill. In that time he dealt with the subject of meat bounties generally. This bill does not deal with bounties on beef; it deals with an export bounty' on cattle on the hoof exported from this country to foreign countries. I shall endeavour to be as brief as the Minister was in referring to the points at issue. In the first place the proposed bounty on the export of live stock w ill not affect five of the six states of the Commonwealth. It will apply to a comparatively small number of cattle exported from Australia. member include the Northern Territory? the six states of the Commonwealth. I was going to say that the bill will affect only the Northern Territory, and the north-western portion of Western Australia. This is the third bill dealing with the subject that has been introduced. We wore told when the first was introduced that it would also be the last. When the second was introduced we were told that there would never be another, but now we have the same kind of bill before us for a third time. Live cattle are exported from three districts in the Commonwealth, the east and west K i m berleys and the Northern Territory, and from three ports, Derby, Wyndham, and Port Darwin. trict of eastern Kimberley, of which Derby is the port. The bounty paid on the cattle exported from that port in the last two years amounted to £2,888, and the firm of McGlew, Monger, and Company were the sole recipients of the bounty. I should like to know whether the members of this firm are bona fide pastoralists, and why they wei'e the sole recipients of the bounty on cattle shipped from this port. That is one point upon which I should like to have some information from the Minister. It should be clearly pointed out that whilst some may think that the export of live stock from these districts may result in dearer beef in the eastern states, the fact is that the export of cattle from the north-western portions of Western Australia will not in any way affect the price of beef in the eastern states. The expense would be so heavy and the distance to be travelled so great that it would be impossible to send cattle on the hoof from Derby to Melbourne or Sydney. If the attempt were made the cattle would arrive in such a condition as to be practically unsaleable. These districts of Western Australia therefore are confined for the sale of live cattle to a comparatively limited market in Java. W it h respect to the Northern Territory, I find that of a total bounty of £1,722 paid in two years, the Willeroo Limited Pastoral Company collected more than 60 per cent. The vast majority of the Northern Territory cattle coming fro m the Barklay Tablelands are sent into Queensland. Cattle from the Victoria the honourable River district are exported from the port of Wyndham. Very few are senfc from No , I said five out of Darwin. The payment of a bounty on cattle exported from Wyndham and Darwin will have no more effect on the price of beef in the eastern states than the payment of bounty on cattle exported from Derby, because cattle sent from the Northern Territory would be unsaleable on their arrival in the eastern states. They must find a nearer market, and the market available to them is limited. From Wyndham some 6,000 cattle were exported in two years through Vestey Brothers, who were the sole collectors of the bounty paid. I should like the Minister to explain whether the cattle belonged to Vestey Brothers or were raised on their stations, or whether VesteyI take first the disBrothers were merely buyers of the cattle from those who raised them, and, if so, what guarantee was there that those who raised the cattle received the benefit of the bounty. Owing to the fact that' cattle raised in these districts cannot be brought to the markets of the eastern states, there can be no objection to an effort to open up a market for them elsewhere. An examination of the figures show that whilst 9,000 cattle were exported in the first year of the bounty, and it was presumed that it would give a stimulus to exportation, only 7,000 were exported in the second year. TheM i nister seems to be under the impression that the bill now under consideration will lead to the opening up of a more extensive market, and let us hope it may do so. I should like to know from the Minister why McGlew, Monger and Company were the sole collectors of bounty on cattle exported from Derby, and whether they were the only exporters from that port. I should like to have similar information regarding Vestey Brothersi n connection with the exports from Wyndham. If",55,Cattle Export Bounty Bill Second Reading
61,Mr Jackson,Does,56,Cattle Export Bounty Bill Second Reading
62,Mr Anstey,"these matters are made clear there can be no valid objection to the bill going through. We must all be very glad that the conditions of the cattle industry in Australia have improved to such an extent in the last twelve months that the Government considers it necessary to introduce a measure merely to provide a bounty on the export of cattle, and will not continue the payment of bounty on the export of frozen beef and tinned meat. There can be no doubt that the bounty which has been paid during the last two years on the export of beef has served the purpose for which it was paid. Trado and Customs( Mr Pratten) quoted the prices paid for beef exported this year and last year, and the ngures show that the price now being received is, including the bounty, slightly better than the price received last year. Early this year I was one who waited with others on the Prime Minister to request the continuance of the bounty on the export of beef. A second deputation waited on the right honourable gentleman, but in the meantime the market had improved considerably, and I admit that the Prime Minister, owing' to the improvement in the market, was justified in deciding not to continue the payment of the bounty this year. The actual bounty paid is not a guide to the benefit which is conferred upon producers. The producers were in difficulties two years ago when the bounty was first given. They were then receiving only 7s. per cwt. at the meat works, and it was not worth their while to send in cattle at that price. The bounty given by this Parliament amounted in the first year to £123,000, but it was accompanied by a stipulation that the producers should benefit through a reduction of freights and meat works charges by similar amounts. Thus the amount of the actual bounty was trebled, and the total benefit to the producers was £369,000. waited on the Prime Minister last year with a request that the bounty should be renewed, he stipulated for a further reduction of £d. in freights, and another £d. in the charges at the meat works. Such reductions would equal the bounty to be paid by the Commonwealth, giving the growers a total advantage of £282,000. I regret that the M in ister stated that he is not able to grant to the cattle-owners in the north-west of Western Australia the additional relief for which we pressed. We asked that all the ports of Australia should be put on an equal freight basis, but the Minister stated that no special advantage could be given to any one state or portion of a state. I think, however, that our suggestion could have been adopted. Unfortunately, the cattle-raisers in the north-west of Western Australia are in a much worse position than are those in the eastern states, for, although they are very much closer to the European markets, it costs £d. per lb. more to send meat from Wyndham to Europe than from RockThe Minister for hampton or Townsville. The reason for that is that a boat has to be sent to the north-west for the sole purpose of l if t in g cattle or meat, because no other freight is offering there. MrA . GBEEN -The shipping ring haa something to do with it . cattle trade is so unprofitable that the shipping ring will have nothing to do with it Therefore the Commonwealth Line sends a boat to Wyndham, but in the absence of other freight an extra charge has to be made for the conveyance of cattle. The Minister urged that the Meat Council should take up this matter with a view to helping the producers in the north-west. That is a very easy way of evading ministerial responsibility, but I assure the House that the Meat Council will do its utmost for the north-west cattle-raisers, and I hope that we shall have the same success as we had when the Prime Minister placed on us last year the onus of getting a reduction of oversea freights by ^d. per l b . ' We obtained that reduction although it involved one of the hardest fights in which I have ever engaged. The problem of the north-west is rendered very difiicult by the absence of shipping competition, and the fact that no freight other than cattle and meat is offering. I heard somebody say last night When, we that the Minister had not said a word to justify the granting of this bounty. Any man who holds that view does not understand the cattle problem, because the Minister showed conclusively that the price offered for cattle for export was not profitable, and, therefore, a bounty was necessary. The Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey) mentioned that fche number of cattle exported last year was less than in the year before, and from",56,Cattle Export Bounty Bill Second Reading
63,Mr Manning' (Macquarie) .[8.12],,57,Cattle Export Bounty Bill Second Reading
64,Mr Manning,"The north-west'that fact he concluded that the bounty is not having, the desired effect. I remind the honourable member that two outbreaks of disease militated seriously against the export of cattle last year. One was the extraordinary and unaccountable occurrence of anthrax among cattle shipped the outbreak occurred is a mystery to those who understand anthrax. There was no existence of the disease amongst the stock on the mainland from which these cattle were shipped, and if the outbreak was genuine, it could only have been due to feeding the cattle on the voyage with infected fodder brought from the Philippines. Cattle imported into the Philippines are not taken direct to Manila, but are landed on an island, and slaughtered at the abattoirs there. The meat is then sent to the central markets in Manila. Notwithstanding that precaution, when the government of the Philippines heard that anthrax had occurred amongst the cattle shipped from Australia, it naturally placed an embargo upon further importations. Then followed the unfortunate outbreak of rinderpest in Western Australia, which led to the prohibition of the importation of cattle from any part of Australia. Those two outbreaks explain the decrease in the export of cattle last year. I am glad that the bounty is being granted again, because it will stimulate a valuable trade from those portions of Australia which are most in need of a market for their cattle. investigated the Indian market? shall be pleased to let the honourable member have a copy of the report of the Meat Council's delegation to the East. I was told at one time that the Indian market was likely to be the only pearl in the Orient, but our investigations have shown that it is not likely to be of any value to Australia. countries with which a valuable trade can be developed. The Minister mentioned the lack of facilities for properly, handling a convincing lesson of the value of such cattle at Singapore. That'difficulty is found in an accentuated form' at Hongv Kong. Chinese cattle are so 'quiet that they can be led along the streets. They are handled much more .easily than are Australian cattle. A practical Queensshall not oppose the bill, but a number of lander, who had visited the Far East, told people in the southern states, particularly me that if Australian bullocks were imported into Hong Kong, in the absence of proper facilities for handling them the residents would probably be horrified to see a Queensland bullock with a butcher impaled on each horn rushing madly through the streets. At present, there are to Manila. How no conveniences for handling wild cattle at either the markets or the slaughtering yards. bullocks take charge of the city of Batavia. kind militate against the export trade. I could not understand the Minister's statement, on the authority of his departmental officers, that there will be no trade in live cattle from the northern ports of Queensland. Possibly the explanation is that the prices for frozen meat at those ports make it unprofitable to export live cattle at £4 10s. per head. The Acting Leader of the Opposition expressed some curiosity regarding the ultimate destination of this bounty. It really does not matter who gets the money as long as it achieves its purpose of finding a market for Australian cattle. Increased export must reduce the local congestion and improve the Australian market. If 50 per cent, of our cattle are marketed abroad, a better value will be given to the remaining 50 per cent. The honourable member said, also, that there was no possibility of cattle being brought from the northern parts of Australia into the southern markets. I have seen thousands of cattle from Victoria Downs yarded in the Sydney market. Of course, they arrived as stores, and had to be fattened before they were offered in the market. This bill must commend itself to honourable members, who will rejoice with me in the fact that the cattle market has so improved as not to warrant the Government in reThere are, however, other newing this year the bounty for the export of meat.

68,Mr Manning,"Dangers of thati n Victoria and Tasmania, wondered last year why it was necessary to pay a bounty for the export of meat when consumers in those states were paying exorbitant prices for both mutton and beef. They cannot understand why, if beef meat can be exported to Europef o r l ^ d . per lb., it cannot be placed in the markets of the southern states at not more than 2d. per lb. The Ministerf o r Trade and Customs' ( Mr Pratten) stated last night that the average weight of the live cattle for export to overseas markets is 600 lb., and that the most the exporters expect to realize, including the bounty of 10s., is £5 per head. That price works out at 2d. per lb. on the hoof. It seems remarkable to the people in Tasmania, and doubtless to those in Melbourne, too, they should be required to pay at least l s . per lb. for good beef, and up to 15d. per lb. for prime cuts. Prom ls. to l s. 3d. per lb. is paid for best cuts of beef, and for other cuts about 9d. Victoria, but the people in the two main cities of Tasmania are certainly paying an average of lOd. per lb. for the meat they purchase from the butchers. It is hard to make those people understand the reason for the great discrepancy between the price they pay and that at which the growers are selling exported cattle, namely, 2d. a lb. The Government should consider the possibility of bringing supplies ill the form of chilled meat from Darwin and other parts of northern Australia to the southern states, in which quite a number of families, owing to the high price of meat, cannot afford to buy sumcient for their requirements. I am not speaking as an expert, because I do not know whether it would be practicable to bring cattle from northern Australia to the southern states. New South Wales. Mr O'KEEFE -The position is certainly worth investigating. Our families should consume sumcient meat if we are to build up a strong and vigorous race of Australians. It has been said that meat chilled in northern Australia would probably not arrive in the south in a condition suitable for consumption. But I would point out that chilled meat is taken from the Argentine across the equator to Great Britain, a much greater distance than from northern Australia to the southern states. A better market for this meat would be obtained in Victoria, Tasmania, and even New South Wales, than in countries lying north of and adjacent to Australia. It is very difficult to make people understand why We should deliberately pay a bounty not only on frozen meat, but also on live cattle exported from Australia. We are asked to pay a bounty of 10s. per head on live cattle averaging 600 lb. in weight. .The return to the grower, including the bonus, would be about £ 5 per head, or 2d. per lb. on the hoof at the port of export. Yet we are compelled here to pay from 8d. to l s . 3d. per l b . for various grades of beef. I shall not oppose the bill, although I shall vote for it with a conthat siderable amount of hesitation. I have no wish to see the cattle industry of northern Australia ruined. It is quite possible that a thorough investigation of this question will prove that if a Commonwealth vessel suitable for the carriage I do not know the exact prices in of meat were engaged in bringing chilled meat from northern Australia to the southern states, it would be the means of providing cheaper meat, at the same time keeping in commission a vessel that would otherwise be idle. I ask the Minister to apnroach the Commonwealth Shipping Board with a view to making this experiment. In spite of all that has been said in favour of the bill, I find myself quite unable to support it . In September, 1922, when the first meat export bounty bill was brought down to this House by the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Rodger3),T expressed, at length, my objection to the principle involved in that measure. I do not propose to repeat the arguments that I then used. Wewere assured then by the Minister for Trade and Customs, that beyond October of that year the Government had no intention whatever of continuing the proposed bounty. The words of the Minister were to the effect that if this bounty were given unti l the 31st October, then after that the meat industry would have to fend for itself. He definitely said that beyond that date there would be no further assistance given to the meat industry. I said then, that the giving of the dole created an appetite that grew by what it fed on, and the prophecy that I made, that before long we would be asked to repeat",58,Cattle Export Bounty Bill Second Reading

BecauseI believe that it is absolutely impossiblo to apply the principle universally, I see no reason why we should single out one industry and, in order to provide a profit for those who are engaged in it, put our hands in the public purse. Those who are engaged in the industry ought to take the good with the bad. They make handsome profits in some years, and they ought to face their losses in other years. They ought to take the ""downs"" with the ""ups."" As this industry ought to be able to stand on its own feet, I strongly object to the bounty, aud cannot see my way to support the bill. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr abandoned? The present proposal is to Maxwell) is under a misapprehension. He evidently had in his mind the bounty on beef. member's arguments were not sound. All bis arguments, to the last sentence, applied to the bounty on frozen beef for export. involved. not involved. I point out to the honoryield to it , how can we able member that there is a very big disdemands tinction, because the conditions are as different as daylight and dark. The bounty on frozen meat benefited establishments that were operating, while the bounty on live cattle applied principally, if not entirely, to Northern Territory and Wyndham cattle, where no freezing works were then operating. The bounty on frozen meat was paid to meet very extraordinary conditions, when the owners of works for shipment to the Old World were! worse off than any growers Their condition was due to the operations of an enormous combine of persons in Great Britain, the Argentine cattle-raisers, and the American Meat Trust. That combination was endeavouring to prevent the exportation of Australian frozen meat to the United Kingdom. member suggest that the payment of a bounty of £140,000 will smash that combination ? thing of the sort, but I do suggest that a bounty of £140,000 may prevent cattleowners and their families from being ruined. These people were on the brink of ruin. It was a business-like way to tide the great cattle industry over a crisis such as it had never previously experienced. I could demonstrate to the honourable member that the owners of the cattle could not have realized enough on thc carcasses to pay for their shipment to Gteat Britain. Could we afford to see this great industry,"" which a few years previously was a source of wealth, not only to its owners, but to the country, ruined, and the great cattle stations meet conditions that are entirely different. The great meat works, owned in the .Northern Territory by Vestey's, which not: cost nearly £1,000,000, have been closed for four years, and many of the cattle in the territory will soon be too old, if they are not too old now, for the butcher. The bounty provided in the bill is intended for the benefit of the Northern Territory. It is not a new idea.

The bounty of 10s. a head will enable cattle-raisers in the Northern Territory to send cattle to Manila and Java, and possibly to Singapore and Hongkong. If we have no more appreciation of the possibility of developing this great country than appears evidentto-night, God help the future of the cattle industry, and of this country, too! cattle for £1 per 100 lbs. ? produce beef at £1 per 100 lbs. when it costs 30s. to get them to market. talk of the Melbourne market being supplied from the Northern Territory under existing conditions, with the impossible handicap of the Navigation Act, is senseless. Those who advocate it might as well go to bed and forget all about it. It will be a good thing if a big call is made, on the bounty, because the more cattle we get out of the Northern Territory before the north-south railway is built, the better it will be, not only for the territory, but also for the Commonwealth. There is a railway that is rusting in the territory, and if by paying a bounty we can pass thousands of cattle over it we shall be doing something to employ a plant ancl a staff that are now almost idle. member think that that was in the Government's mind when it suggested the bounty ? 1 slightest doubt about it. ber vote for a grant to the unemployed? thing to utilize the country and sell the produce that comes off it. ber vote to provide a man witb work? work unless we produce something that we can sell. territory to-day because Vestey's works, which ought to be, a profitable business, are shut I do not know what the pracI f frozen meat tice is in the territory to-day, but formerly a shipping contractor, who had a market in the East, chartered ships and purchased cattle, and was responsible for To-day we have the shipment of the cattle to the markets where he had orders. It was manipulated principally through Vestey's, who readily undertook to accept from the smaller holders in the Territory that proportion of cattle to which I have already referred. It was by no means a monopoly in the hands of Vestey's, or of the big landholders. The principle embodied in this bill is a sound one, and we should continue it until the day comes-whic h I hope will be soon-whe n the big meat works in the Territory are again operating. It is ridiculous to say that there is a monopoly in the Northern Territory in regard to meat. In To Great Britain, however, there is a monopolywhich is keeping Australian beef out of the Imperial market. The feeding of the millions of people in the United Kingdom is largely controlled by suppliers who belong to a ring with from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 behind them. clear that matter up? up the Territory the better. I cannot conceive that there will be any opposition to this bill. [9.2] I cannot understand the attitude of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell). Similar measures to that which we are now discussing have been before this House previously, but I do not recollect having heard the honourable member speak on any previous occasion as he has spoken to-night. Although the honourable member had something adverse to say concerning the big squatters, when the division was taken he was caref ul to get on the Government side of the House. While I find it difficult to understand the attitude of the honourable member for Fawkner, I agree with the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) that this bill is essential for the development of the Northern Territory.

92,Mr Nelson (Northern Territorv),"certain big interests in the Northern Territory and the north-western portion of Australia to control the market, and reap huge profits, but any one conversant with the position knows that that argument is absurd. During the past two years 16,300 head of cattle have been exported from the Northern Territory and the north-western portion of Australia, 3,000 of them being shipped from Darwin, and the remainder from the north-west. When we consider that there are 13,000,000 cattle in Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, and only 500,000 in the north-western portion of the continent, and 600,000 in the Northern Territory, it is absurd to talk about influencing the markets in the south. The only way to enable meat to be supplied more cheaply to the consumers in the south is by the Government controlling the freezing works in the Northern Territory, and supplying vessels to transport the meat. that to be done were introduced, it is more than probable that the honorablo member for Fawkner would oppose it. He would not then be concerned about cheap meat. tunity in that direction, but, in the face of those figures, the contention that the market would be influenced is ridiculous. The number of cattle exported from the Northern Territory has been referred to during this debate. Mr abattoirs of Brisbane is very different Sleigh, of Melbourne, played a prominent part in the exportation of cattle from the Northern Territory. He organized the whole of the shipping, and ultimately went in witli the Vestey people. result was that in the next year Vestey's obtained tlie whole of the cattle for themthe mongrel cattle at present there selves, and left Sleigh high and dry, after he had organized the business. There is a good market in the East, despite what the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) has said. In this connection, I speak with first-hand knowledge SinceI have been in Melbourne I sent telegrams to the secretary of the Pastoralists Association offering to purchase 20,000 head on a forward contract. But Vestey's had already got control of most of the smaller men,»and no business was forthcoming. Anotber wire was sent, offering to purchase 10,000 head, outside of Vestey's, on a forward contract, but the same position confronted us. Vestey's took the whole of the cattle of the outside men. If the Government are really anxious to assist in the development of the Northern Territory, and particularly its cattle industry, it should explore the eastern countries for a market, and should make facilities available for the smaller men to market their produce. The amount involved in the payment of this bounty is a mere bagatelle, but it would assist materially in the development of the Northern Territory. The Minister should, however, take care that the bounty does not go to the speculator in cattle, but to the producer of the cattle. I am satisfied that this bill will enable that, to be done. Speculators know when a man has a surplus of cattle, and is financially embarrassed, and they offer a price which they know he must accept. The cattle owner sells, and the speculator gets the bounty. That is contrary to the spirit of this bill, which provides that Buti f a measure to enable the 10s. bounty shall be paid to the producer because of the low price he obtains for his cattle. Cattlemen in the Northern Territory have assured me that if they could be There is a good opporcertain of £5 per head they could carry on at a profit, although it would not be a large one. The cattle grown in the Northern Territory cannot be compared with those in the southern portions of Australia. The average weight in the from that of the average weight of a 30,000 kill in fee Northern Territory. If the Government intends to deal with the development of the Northern TerriThe tory it should ""go the whole hog."" Good stock should be introduced, and should be got rid of. In a 30,000 kill at Vestey's meat-works the average weight is nothing like 6 cwt. That question should engage the attention of the Government. If it is out to develop the Territory, an attempt should' be made to improve the herds there. If the present system of inbreeding is continued for another twenty years, the cattle will degenerate into goats. It was said that Vestey's had improved the herds in the Territory, but after a good deal of argument it was admitted that the whole of the improvement was in the horns of the cattle. The Government should establish meat-works in the .Territory, and provide vessels to convey the meat to the southern market. The home market is better than that in foreign countries. In that direction of knowledge of the hardships of the lies our opportunity. Provided that the Government safeguards the interests of the people who produce the cattle by seeing that they, and not the speculators, obtain the bounty, it will be doing nothing materially wrong by paying this bounty, but, on the contrary, it will be doing a great service to the undeveloped country in the Northern Territory. risen because I do not want to record a silent vote on this measure. I intend to vote against it, as I did last year. opposed it then on principle, and gave my reasons very fully. A t that time we were informed that the bounty then proposed was not to be repeated. twice. promise given ? tioned in the debate. Live-stock for export was also included in last year's bill, and the whole matter was debated then. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, gave no good reason why this bounty should be granted. said that the Government desired to grant it. BecauseI believe that the piling up of these bounties on top of the heavy duties is only piling Pelion on Ossa, and increasing the cost of living, I intend to vote against the bill. should like to see those honourable members who propose to vote against this bill placed on a piece of land in the Northern Territory, and asked to produce beef at £ 1 per 100 lb. It is ridiculous for men who know nothing of the hardships endured by the pioneers to get up in this House and say that meat is dear when the primary producer receives but that price. The producer has all the troubles of breeding, of keeping his stock for three or four years, and of preparing it for slaughter; and the price mentioned is an insufficient return. If honourable members who contend that the price is a good one were placed in the meat business, and had to muster stock, they would soon be found running for safety up the first tree they came across. They would probably leave Australia. Yet they tell us that £1 per 100 lb. is too much for the primary producer to receive. Statements of that kind are due to a lack pioneers, and are an insult to the intelligent members of this House. I hope that the bill will pass without delay. sure that it is the desire of honourable members on both sides to help the man on the land to the greatest possible extent. In common with other honourable members, I am opposed to the payment of bounties if it can be avoided. The honourable member for Denison( Mr O'Keefe) said it was regrettable that we could not I bring meat from the Northern Territory to Melbourne and Tasmania, but I may inform him that some of the primest beef is brought to Melbourne to-day at 4^d. per lb. it comes from. If the producer in the Northern Territory can only get £5 per head for his cattle that will not pay him. We should encourage the markets in the near East that are right at our doors. The Federated Malay States last year took 20,000 head of cattle. An honourable member has referred to the fact that proHe simply ducers ih the Argentine are sending chilled meat to Europe. whether we must go on paying a bounty on meat. necessary. In connection with the export of chilled meat from the Argentine, it has to be remembered that the meat must be suspended in the vessel in which it is carried, and boats have to be specially constructed for the purpose. In addition to that, before the shipping people would undertake to carry chilled meat from the Argentine to Europe they required a ten-years' guarantee of freight. IF we desire to send chilled meat from Australia we must establish freezing works, we must have specially constructed boats, and must give the shippers a guarantee of a certain freight for a number of years. Mr O'KEEFE -'What is wrong with the Commonwealth boats? wealth boats could carry chilled meat. Boats have to be specially constructed for the purpose.

We must assist our producers to market their products abroad, and so help to put Australia on the map of the world. support the bill. I have had recent experience of the man on the land in the north. I saw f a t cattle, weighing 600 lb.,brought to the Wyndham meat works and sold for £ 4 per head. perienced men, it costs in that district £ 3 per head to bring bullocks to the age of three years. Droving and other expenses bave to be added to this amount, so at £ 4 per head there is not much in the business. Darwin meat-works are closed. I have had some experience of the frozen meat trade, and a fairly wide knowledge of works such as those at Darwin. I was led to understand by those who had to foot the bill that the Darwin works cost very nearly £1,000,000. It is a crying shame that they should remain idle when, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) has said, there are 600,000 f a t cattle in the Territory which could be disposed of. I have voted for bounties to secondary industries in the shape of a very substantial tariff to enable them to carry on, and I willingly support a bounty to primary industries that are finding it difficult to make ends meet, ancl these represent 75 per cent, of country industries at the present time. The producers are as much entitled to bounties as are the manufacturers who receive the equivalent of bounties through the tariff. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) has put his finger on the difficulty wifch regard to theoverseas trade. We should do all that we can to place our meat on the world's markets. We have in the Northern Territory some 335,000,000 acres of land, and it can produce f a t bullocks with any part of Australia. I have seen cattle fattened there thafc were equal to the primest cattle raised on the upper Murray, in my electorate, and many honourable members know the magnificent country there is there. There are only about 3,000 white people in the Northern Territory. We contemplate spending huge sums on defence, and what better defence could we have than that which would be afforded by the opening up and development of that country with men who, like the grand old pioneers, are prepared to settle there if they are given a little assistance ? To extend our overseas market we require to have a stall at Smithfield. Those who have been to the Old Country report that we have no organization there worth I rise to speaking of. I venture to back the Australian pioneer and Australian cattle against any in the world. If by the backing of huge combines the Argentine producers can beat us in the world's marAccording to exkets for meat, we deserve to be beaten. If there are huge combines assisting the Argentine producers in this way, surely we can get into touch with the Imperial Parliament, and induce the people of the Old Country to put our producers on a fair footing with producers in other I regret extremely that the countries. Although the bounty proposed is very small, I agree with other speakers that it will be of very great assistance to graziers in that part who are nearly down and out. We have cheap gibes at the big producers of cattle, but I advise honourable members not to run away with the idea that all the cattle producers are Kidmans, Jowetfes, and Vesteys. They include quite a number of struggling settlers in the Territory to whom the bounty proposed will be of very great assistance. I had the pleasure recently bf saying good-bye to two young fellows who were going from Victoria right up to the Barklay Tablelands to develop that country in the spirit of the old pioneers. If we gave one-fourth of the assistance to our pioneers that is given to spoon-fed people in our capital cities it would be very much better for Australia. should like to make a few remarks on the subject of this bounty on the export of cattle. I hold no brief for the payment of bounties, which I believe are abused in every country. I have heard so much about assistance to producers of meat recently, that I begin to wonder whether this is a Parliament of intelligent men, or of self-interested and stupid men. It is proposed to pay 10s. per head on the export of cattle the value of which, according to the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) is about 16s. 4d. per cwt.

But we apparently have no system or method to meet the difliculties created by distance from markets in the Commonwealth. If we can send cattle from Western Australia and Port Darwin to Manila, why can we not bring them to the southern parts of Australia? MrA . GREEN -Becaus e they would be dead before they got here. bring those cattle to the southern parts of the Commonwealth. There is something wrong when meat which can be produced very cheaply in some portions of Australia brings exorbitant prices in the eastern states. on the hoof in city markets for nothing,ls. per lb. would still be charged for beef in the butchers' shops. brains to tackle this question ? I know it is said that we must not interfere with private enterprise, but if private enterprise will not enable us to obtain the necessaries of life at a reasonable price, socialization of industries or some other method must be adopted. I am satisfied that whilst the present Government and its friends are in power there will be no improvement in existing conditions. They will do nothing that was not done by their parents or their grandparents. The only time when in Australia we were not wedded to precedents, and were not afraid to adopt methods to advance this country, was when Labour governments were in power. I do not intend to vote against the bill, but I feel that, because honourable members opposite have no brains, Or if they have they w ill not use them for the benefit of the people, it has been in troduced as the easiest way out of a difficulty, and the people of Australia must pay for it . When I was in the Northern Territory I saw 700 head of cattle brought from the Katherine River to Port Darwin. They were fattened in paddocks before shipment. That was done thirteen years ago, without the assistance of a bounty of 10s. per head. Since that time, Vestey, Brothers have established large meat. ' works in the Northern Territory , not for the purpose of supplying cheap meat to the people, but to obtain a monopoly of the export of meat from thc Territory. We have heard a lot of talk about the company having lost £500,000, but that amount is a mere bagatelle to a company which has large interests in the meat trade in South America and elsewhere, and is anxious to establish a monopoly. The operations of such combines create feelings of indignation among men who, like myself, wish to see tbe people supplied with the necessaries of l if e at a reasonable price. The Government has agreed to a request from the .pastoralists to pay a bounty of 10s. per head on live cattle exported from Australia in order to give temporary relief to the pastoral industry. I trust that the time is coming when such subterfuges w ill no longer be resorted to. The Government appears afraid to move for fear of treading on the toes of vested If we could put cattle interests. The people outside are justified in saying that this Parliament is not the responsible institution that it used to be. Those who, like myself, have been in Parliament for many years, wonder whether the force of character and foresight which at one time were displayed by our statesmen have disappeared. The Government seems to be interested only in pacts and compositions, and in pleasing a few individuals. The real puzzle is to ascertain what interests have been omitted from the Government's distribution of benefits. Apparently, its object at the present time is to dispose of the Estimates so that Parliament may be dissolved, and an arrangement made between the two Ministerial parties to prevent the men on this side of the House, who have knowledge and brains, getting control of the reins of government.

I wish to explain that this is a firm of stock and station agents, of Derby, which collected bounties for pastoralists under written authority given to the Customs Department by such pastoralists.

I was convinced that the dairying industry could do a great deal-to improve the disposal of its products in Great .Britain. The fluctuation of the butter market in Great Britain is tremendous, and if something could be done to prevent it , considerable benefit would accrue to the Australian dairying industry. 1922, and June, 1924, the price of butter in Great Britain thr.ee times exceeded 200s. per cwt., and three times fell below 150s. per cwt., the maximum variation being between 206s. and 123s. per cwt. Violent fluctuations took place also in the monthly imports of .butter. Bet-ween the months of July and December, 1921, Great Britain averaged 11,000 tons per month; between tlie months of January and June, 1922, it averaged 20,000 tons per month. During the year 1922-23, from July to December, 15,000 tons of butter were imported monthly, and from January to June, 2.2,500 tons. . Th© records of butter prices in Britain show a sever© fall during th© first quarterJanuary to March-of each year. That fal l is caused by heavy importations from Australia, Argentine. lowering prices, to the of from Further, whenever prices are so high that the demand for butter begins to decline, the trade stagnates, and then the speculator steps in , and carries the f a l l very much farther than is necessary. If the Australian supply to the British butter market could be regulated, the effect in stabilizing the price of butter would be immediate. member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) was very careful to explain that the local price of butter is always affected by the export parity. Obviously, therefore, anything we can do to stabilize the export price w ill assist in stabilizing the local price. The Government certainly believes that supplies can be regulated to suit the demand in Great Bribain, so as to prevent [109] violent fluctuations in the market. Action in that direction would assist the producer Everywhose butter was exported, and help to -stabilize the local price. The Government is prepared to give financial assistance to 'the industiy, and the investigations that I are being made into proposals for the 'assistance of exporting industries show that probably the most useful financial assistance that can be rendered is such as w ill enable industries to obtain on their products advances in excess of the ordinary banker's risk, so that small men may be enabled to retain control over their products for a longer period Between January, than is possible to-day. Butter today passes into the hands of the speculator because the small producer, in order to meet his bills, has to realize on his product at the earliest possible date. The Government is prepared to consider the question, of granting financial assistance to enable a sufficient quantity of butter from Australia to be held in cold store and released in such a manner as to regulate the the importation of butter into supplies in Great Britain according to the demand. The Government, therefore, proposes to summon a conference of representatives of the industry at the earliest possible date to discuss that matter. It also thinks that it should get into communication with the states, to ascertain whether they are prepared to co-operate in calling a conference of dairying experts to advise on the best action to take to accelerate ""the improvement of dairy herds, and to raise the general efficiency .of the New Zealand, and the industry. disadvantage gentleman submit thab to the previous the producers ' in the countries conference ? cussed.

130,Mr Bruce,"The industry must dothe quality of dairy herds and the conference may recommend that the services of better stud stock should be made available to the small dairy farmers. It is easy to say that the dairy farmer should improve the standard of his herd, but the very Umited nnancial resources of tbe average small dairy farmer must be borne in mind. If he were left to his own resources, it would be almost impossible for him to obtain the services of the pedigreed stock necessary to raise the standard of his herds. not intend to step in and organize any of these industries, it give assistance to people who aro not prepared to assist themselves, but time has come when it should give some assistance to those who are prepared to do so. This assistance will be devised to increase our national efficiency and raise the standard of our national production. Gippsland, who made a very admirable speech, said that he did not see why stringent conditions that are not applied to secondary industries should be applied to primary industries. him of what I said in Sydney, where I tried to make it quite clear that the Government did not subscribe to the view that inefficient secondary industries are entitled to the protection of a tariff, and that if industries want assistance they must demonstrate that they are efficient. But everything cannot be done in a day. If the honourable member wants to know upon what principle the Government bases its offer of assistance, I reply that it is upon the principle of efficiency and organization. That principles' applies to both primary and secondary industries. The Government feels that the problem must be approached with the object of improving methods of production, distribution, poses to consult the industry about the organization of butter marketing in Britain, and is prepared to give financial assistance to control the flow of Australian butter to the British markets. It is also necessary to take advantage of opportunities offered in other ports in Great Britain besides the port of London-ports like Hull, Liverpool, and Manchester. I was in Great Britain recently, and I have no doubt that the authorities controlling them would be prepared to give Itr. Bruce. assistance to primary producers in this country if we had an efficient system of organization, and they knew definitely what we desired them to do,, and with whom they had to deal. Improvements might take the direction of providing additional cold storage, cheaper rates for storage, or improved marketing arrangements. To sum up, the Government has reviewed the proposals that have been The Government does made, and recognizes the difficulties facing the industry. It recognizes, too, that nor will the industry is doing everything it can to try to solve those difficulties. But in the proposals that have been made to it, it believes that the the Government sees grave dangers, and certainly not until every effort has been made by the industry to increase its efficiency, can it accede to an arrangement that contemplates the control of interstate trade. I referred earlier to some The honourable member for of the disadvantages of that proposal, which Ministers believe would be prejudicial in the long run to the interests of the industry itself. There are grave dangers in the fixing of prices for interI would remind state trade, and the scheme would involve, if it was to be made effective, the fixing of prices in each state. In addition, there is the constitutional difficulty to which I have referred.. The Government views these matters seriously, and is therefore not prepared to assent to the proposals that have been made to it. But it is nevertheless prepared to co-operate with those engaged in the butter industry by assisting in improving methods of marketing and in . raising the quality of tbe Australian herds. Ministers are also prepared to look at every phase of the question, and to listen to all suggestions directed towards putting the industry on a national basis for the benefit of the whole of Ausand marketing. It protralia. I trust that those engaged in the industry will appreciate the fact that the Government. has the greatest sympathy with them. Its duty, however, is not to look at one industry, or the interests of one section of the community alone; it is to weigh the interests of all, and determine what action is likely both to promote the welfare of the people immeI visited those ports when diately concerned and to increase the general prosperity of Australia.
