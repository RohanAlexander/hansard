This was reflected in the belief that the political community-that is, regulatory impact statement attached to the the state, the government and its bureaucratic explanatory materials. Yet the bill, which agencies-should be at the service of civil was developed in a secretive process with society. Where the state interacts with civil minimum time for general comments, fails to society, the former should facilitate the meet this basic objective. The bill fails to latter.

In take an example-namely, the case of nonaddition, the new system, far from saving government schools. In addition to the associations the financial resources that proposed ACNC reporting and could be best directed to their community accountability requirements, schools will activities, will cost them more. The continue to be subject to: (a) the DEEWR experience of the UK was that many financial questionnaire and the reporting associations have had to employ additional requirements in accordance with the employees with regulatory, legal and Australian and state governments funding financial expertise to meet the new agreements and the Schools Assistance Act requirements.

Multiply this reporting requirements for registered sum through the many associations upon schools, including financial which this regulatory system is to be foisted, accountabilities-in some states, there are and the cost to the community will be reviews taking place without coordination enormous. The cost, I stress, is to that sector with the ACNC proposals. Indeed, there is of the community which is using scarce very little indication that the Treasury resources mostly to deliver services to bureaucrats behind the ACNC proposals people in need.

I was activity that would be captured by the ACNC in the UK last week, where agencies told me legislation and which illustrates the flaws in that they had to employ a whole new the proposal. What had been promised as department of staff with legal, regulatory and simplification turns out to be costly and accounting expertise just to meet the burdensome additional reporting requirements of the charities commission in requirements with no reduction in red tape the UK. and no reduction in duplication. I turn to some of the other deficiencies in the government's bill. Firstly, many of the regulatory requirements will be introduced proposed that independent non-government by regulation-in other words, one of the schools would only qualify for charitable most distrusted governments in Australia's status if they offered bursaries to poor pupils. history is asking the community to trust it After expensive litigation the courts reversed when it cannot even meet the objectives it set that position, restating the age-old view that for itself.

We reject the approach taken with in to bring it to this point and about the this legislation. We reject it not because of extraordinary displeasure of the sector. The the philosophical basis that I outlined at the reality is that this bill is an extraordinary outset but because overwhelmingly the reach by government into the affairs of civil sector rejects it as well.

One approach is allows investigations to proceed at a snail's summed up in the opening words of the pace and does not lift a finger to deploy maiden speech of the former Prime Minister against the questionable activities of some Mr Rudd, when he said: union officials the kind of powers it proposes Politics is about power.

It is about the power of the state as union officials can blithely threaten to shift applied to individuals, the society in which they the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of live and the economy in which they work. dollars of their members' hard earned money This legislation is a manifestation of that from the support of one political leader to view, that the state should have power over another without so much as a raised eyebrow individuals and organisations, which rightly from the Labor government, yet hardit should not.

(Time layer of federal regulation to the charity and expired) not-for-profit sector, they do nothing to reduce other layers of regulation, particularly",106,Bills Securities To The Retail Market It Has Many

Yet it is disappointing to see no evidence of how this is being achieved. Let me turn firstly to the question of how Our overriding concern is that rather than this package of measures imposes a new reducing red tape and compliance burden, the regulatory regime at the federal level when ACNC will add another layer of compliance and the government has clearly conceded that it that nothing will be taken away. has not secured any tangible outcomes in Those are the words of one particular nonrolling back the regulation of charitable and profit organisation analysing the practical not-for-profit organisations at the state level. impact of this package of measures on their This was a very clear message from activities. Their conclusion is that, despite participants in the sector who appeared the bold promises, the practical consequence before the recent inquiry conducted by the will be no reduction in red tape but, on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on contrary, an increase in red tape. In a similar Corporations and Financial Services as well vein, Father Brian Lucas of the Catholic as a number of other committees of this Church had this to say, when he appeared parliament which have looked at these bills. before the committee recently: The national and state and territory peak Much has been said about the need for reduction bodies for volunteering highlighted the of red tape. That was very much the rationale that significant concern in the sector about the led a number of the various government inquiries duplication and overlap between to recommend a national regulator. You will have Commonwealth and state and territory laws heard, I am sure, that there is still concern in governing the not-for-profit sector. They had many sectors that particular legislation that we this to say in their submission: are now dealing with does not bring about the The ACNCreduction of red tape that was envisaged. the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits The Australian Conservation Foundation had Commissionthis to say: is meant to relieve these compliance burden ACF is concerned that rather than remove issues by providing a 'one-stop' regulation shop. duplication, the ACNC Bills will duplicate However it is argued by some that red-tape reporting obligations. reduction cannot be achieved without We heard that these issues are of collaboration between Federal and State and considerable concern to independent schools, Territory governments. who are worried that they will be required to … … … report much of the same information that today they provide to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace officials of the Department of the Prime Relations to the ACNC as well.

Education, Employment and Workplace By that he means many years to arrive at a Relations. We heard from the Catholic deal between the Commonwealth and the Bishops Conference that they are concerned states. He went on to say: about Catholic schools facing a competitive Our perspective is that it was much better to neutrality problem because this will impose begin the regulatory reform process, to make the new, burdensome reporting obligations on improvements at the Commonwealth level and to Catholic schools, obligations which will not then work very constructively with the states and be faced by the state school just down the territories, and that is in fact what is going on. road. That is his claim. I must say that I was Against this backdrop of real and tangible wholly unpersuaded by that claim, because, concerns, what satisfaction has the if you analyse what Mr Ronalds said when government been able to offer that there will he said it 'would take many years' to achieve be a harmonisation between federal and state a deal between the Commonwealth and the and territory obligations leading to the states and territories, what he is in fact promised reduction in red tape?

For Here is what he had to say-with, I must say, example, it was claimed that the charities a certain lofty disdain which perhaps only would be able to lodge their details once with the ACNC and that, once those details were on the register maintained by the ACNC, then any other Commonwealth Let me turn briefly to the third point I agency or department which is to grant them want to make, which is that the new law money under a contested grant process, for presents major difficulties for charities in a example, would be able to take the range of areas. First of all, it imposes information as read. There will be no need to onerous new requirements to deal with issues provide it separately, and so, rather than like the threat of money laundering. It is hard having to provide a 20-page application to understand why this needs to be dealt with form, they will only need to provide a couple in the ACNC Bill when there are already of pages because most of the information other regulatory regimes which address the will already be on the ACNC's register. issue of money laundering. Wouldn't that be a marvellous thing if it Another way in which this new legislation were in fact to happen? Wouldn't it be a creates difficulties for charities is that it marvellous thing if these efficiencies could establishes draconian powers on the part of be achieved? On this side of the House, we this new regulator. Just as one example, the do not dispute that it would be a marvellous new regulator will have the power to thing; we are just deeply sceptical that it is disqualify a director, whereas, by contrast, if actually going to happen. There appear to be ASIC, the corporate regulator, wants to no tangible mechanisms to ensure that disqualify a director, it must first seek a court bureaucrats in other departments will order. In fact, this regulatory regime is cheerfully vacate the field when the ACNC extraordinarily intrusive, with enforcement comes along. I asked a question on this powers and provisions-division 70, point, at the committee's hearings last week, 'Information gathering powers'; division 75, of Ms Linda Lavarch, who is chair of the monitoring powers; powers to gain warrants; Not-for-Profit Sector Reform Council. This powers to enter onto the property of was her very reassuring answer. First she charities; and so on. This is very far from told me that there is a compact that has been being the so-called light-touch enforcement signed to deal with these matters. Then she regime that we were promised by officials said: appearing before the committee.

We believe that this onerous and department to ensure that they not only are the intrusive package of regulation will do principals of the compact but also have a shared precisely the opposite, and that is why we vision with the sector about reducing red tape. The red tape is not just reduced for the sector; it is oppose it. reduced for government as well. Ms HALL (Shortland-Government I am deeply sceptical.

Often this regulation 'No, we do not want any action and, no, we hinders the ability of not-for-profit do not want to listen to those key players in organisations to deliver on their core goals.
