I therefore rule that this is a continuance of the business interrupted at the sitting of last night. [10.57] I shall not say anything further about that question of procedure at present. I desire now to exhaust my right to speak a second time on the amendment. This subdivision provides for the expenditure of certain money on rifle ranges; but it seems useless to vote these sums unless there is a reasonable probability of their being used. Last year the appropriation in this subdivision was .Â£62,967, a n a "" the amount expended was only ,Â£34,742. That applies only to New South Wales. statement is not fair, because his opening remarks would lead the Committee to believe that the money was voted only for rifle ranges. As a matter of fact, the vote includes drill halls, lecture halls, naval reserves, light-horse depots, &c. subdivision provides for all sorts of accommodation. The question of providing money for drill halls vitally affects every State. I should cheerfully vote any necessary amount if I had any guarantee that it would be expended. I know the Commonwealth Works Department is working at high pressure, but I think the staff should be increased. We should be self-contained with regard to our public works by having all the Commonwealth public works carried out by a Commonwealth Public Works Department, and not by any State Department. of such urgency that the Government would be justified in increasing the Public Works staff materially in order to provide shelter and protection for the lads undergoing compulsory training. A mistake has been made by the Minister and the Department in calling upon the various municipal councils, who are not too kindly treated-in the matter of expression, at all events by the Ministerial partyto show their patriotism, as it is called, by providing drill halls. In some cases halls have been provided by municipalities, and even by private individuals, in order that the work may be safely as well as effectively carried out. That sort of thing, -however, should not be allowed to continue. We are. not entitled in this respect to rest on the municipalities or the charitably disposed or patriotic citizens of the Commonwealth. The most important work that the Government is undertaking now is the training of the future defenders of the Commonwealth ; but the compulsory training system is likely to suffer materially through the want of drill halls. Lads are compelled to drill in the open streets, and even in some cases to sit on the footpath with their feet in the gutter, listening to the instructions of their officers. Such a state of affairs ought not to be allowed to continue; and I should be glad to vote for a much larger sum than is asked for in respect of drill halls if I had any guarantee that the money would be expended by the Government. The Public Works Branch of the Department of Home Affairs is so overtaxed and its capacity is so limited, however, that it has not been able to carry out the works for which provision has been made in previous years. The Defence Department should not rely upon the Public Works Branch of the Home Affairs Department in this regard, but should start a Public Works Branch of its own. It has in its service engineers, architects, ancl others following civil avocations which make them capahle of doing all that is necessary to enable these buildings to be rapidly provided. If the Government has any real desire to make the compulsory training system acceptable to the people, it must protect the lads who, at a most critical period of their lives, are being subjected to climatic conditions to which they should not be exposed. not be properlv instructed in the dark. system is a new one. that; but the honourable memher will agree with me that some speeding up is necessary in regard to the provision of this necessary accommodation. If the Government vii I only utilize the material that they have at hand, they will find that there are in each of the States plenty of men attached to the Department of Defence who aie quite competent to carry out this work. The Minister should give serious consideration to my pronosal that, in order to secure these very npcessarv adjuncts to our compulsory training system, we should have drill halls rapidly consrructed, and that 'we should utilize the services of men in the",17,Unionists

During the year I have received from the Minister of Home Affairs two copies of his digest showing works in progress, and in both I saw a reference to amounts provided for the construction of that road. When the Small Arms factory at 'Lithgow was under consideration in connection with these Estimates last year, I moved the reduction of an item by Â£ x in order to draw attention to the necessity for making the road leading to that factory, and two Ministers gave me a promise that the Government would extend to the Lithgow Council the same treatment that they had extended to the Braybrook Shire Council. That has not been done, and I have only to say that if we are to have this differential treatment of municipalities, trouble may be expected. The Prime Minister promised last year that a fair thing would be done in respect of the municipality of Lithgow. I understand that the road to the Maribyrnong factory has now been completed at a cost of practically _Â£i,ooo. Â£500 on the Estimates inrespect of the work. pared to spend Â£500 in making a road leading to one factory and then to hand over that road to the local shire council, it should be ready to treat in the same way another municipality within whose boundaries there is yet another Commonwealth factory. When I received the Minister of Home Affairs' digest of works in progress, I at once wrote to him, and received three different replies. The Government should deal fairly with all municipalities in this regard. I am not satisfied with the position, and on the item relating to the' construction of a road to Point Nepean, I hope that the Minister will give me some explanation of the attitude taken up by the Government in regard to the construction of this road to the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. I endorse the remarks that have been made as to the necessity for pushing on with the construction of drill halls. The want is so keenly felt that a deputation consisting of representatives of municipalities in my electorate recently waited on the Minister of Defence, and expressed the willingnessof those municipalities to assist the Department by placing at its disposal for this purpose portion of the property of their ratepayers. It is recognised that all the halls required cannot be provided in a day, but in view of the fact that boys have to drillin all sorts of weather, it is recognised by these municipalities that the system of compulsory service is liable to be brought intodisrepute unless provision is made without delay for the training being carried on under reasonable conditions. Drill halls are more urgently needed in Victoria than in other States, because our climate during, the winter months is exceptionally severe as compared with that of some parts of Australia. I have seen boys drilling in muddy streets on a Saturday afternoon, and have felt very sorry for them. Municipalities in the electorate which I representand a deputation from which I introduced to the Minister-ar e willing to assist the Department by placing at its disposal a large market-place, which, at a small cost, could be made really suitable for use as a drill hall. I hope that this work will nor be blocked as is often the case, by the Department of Home Affairs. I trust that we shall not have a recurrence of the difficulties that arose between the Postal Department and the Department of Home Affairs in connection with the Prahran post office fiasco. At a cost of some ^400, the lads in my electorate could be given a really suitable training place, and the work should be taken in hand at once. Unless reasonable accommodation of this kind be provided, our splendid scheme of military training may be brought into disrepute. It is unreasonable to expect boys to getdrenched with rain when undergoing their training; and there ought to be no prosecutions for non-attendance at drill until drill halls have been provided. In Waterloo, which is in my electorate, the citizens have seen the urgent need there is for this accommodation, and have offered to contribute^400 towards the cost of the erection of a drill hall of the value of Â£600, if the Government will provide the balance. That, I think, is a very fair offer; and the Government should afford every encouragement to all patriotic movements of the * kind.",18,Unionists

56,Mr Riley (South Sydney) [11.15],"Â£11.16] -There is a widespread impression that military officers, speaking generally, are not sympathetic with the rifle club movement. Of course, I do not say that that applies to every military officer; but there is the idea that it is generally applicable. These rifle clubs are composed of the finest men in the community, who, in time of trouble, will prove a very efficient reserve. They are most devoted to their respective clubs, and eagerly utilize the meagre provi.sion which this vote enables the Government to make. They are, I may say, put to considerable expense personally in providing, for instance, in many cases, better rifles than the erection of a hall, but splendid those supplied by the Department. Without fee or reward, or any concession beyond, perhaps, an occasional free pass to attend a rifle match, they meet all the expenses out of their own pockets; and I -think that more encouragement ought to be given to them. The Government cannot urge want of funds, in view of the fact that the vote last year was not nearly expended. I should like to hear from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether there is any ground for the impression that the rifle club movement is discouraged by military officers, for, if such t e the case, I should like those officers to Tcnow that this House is almost unanimous in its support of the movement. I am rather surprised to hear from the honourable member for Illawarra and others that cadets have been called upon to drill in -drenching rain. ney, I saw cadets wet through. dalous; and it does not occur, I am sure, with the consent of the Minister.

I may not be so optimistic in regard to the sympathy of the Department towards the movement for the provision of drill halls. It fell to my lot some time ago to introduce a deputation from a portion of my constituency where the people were prepared, as in South Sydney and in other electorates, to contribute towards the cost of such halls. In Footscray a considerable sum has been raised which the people are prepared to hand over if the Department will find the balance. In Essendon, which is also in my electorate, no steps have been taken towards lighting has been provided by the City Council where the boys are drilled. Before the new lights were erected the unruly amongst the lads had great opportunities for misbehaviour in the darkness; but now, on a ground close to the Town Hall, first class drilling is obtainable. I know that the Defence scheme means a large expense to the country; and I think we ought to have a general statement from the Minister as to the financial aspects of the question. I am thoroughly in sympathy with honourable members who speak favourably of the rifle club movement. Many thousands of men voluntarily equip themselves for the defence of the country in case their services should be required ; and every opportunity should be afforded to enable them to make themselves efficient. Many of us are old rifle club men, and are able to appreciate the value of this line of defence. Wherever it is possible to erect drill halls, or keep them in thorough repair, the Department should give every encouragement to the movement. I do not know whether it was the honourable member for Parramatta or the present Minister of Defence who appointed Major Boam to fake special charge of this movement. before I went into oflice. lieve a very efficient officer, and doing all he possibly can to place the claims of the rifle clubs before the Defence authorities; and it is to be hoped that his representations *will be listened to with some effect.

The honourable member for Nepean is not, I think, in full possession of the facts regarding the road to the Cordite Factory. The Federal Government will be exceedingly foolish if they do not accept that Ministers had nobbled the expert be the splendid chance of receiving ,Â£500 from the State Government for the construction of the road. This is not a public road, because, not only the property on both sides, but the road itself, is owned by the Federal Government.

The Braybrook Shire Council, which has charge of the rest of the area in that locality, will be called upon to keep the road in repair, although it is owned by the Defence Department. This road was on the old C. B. Fisher estate, and was made, in the first instance, to give access to a racecourse. Council? are to be asked only to maintain the road because some of the ratepayers will be allowed to pass over it. Under all the circumstances, I think the Government will be lacking in their duty if they do not accept the offer of the State authorities. think we are entitled to an explanation from the responsible Minister in connection with the matter raised by the honourable member for Nepean. Notwithstanding what has been said by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, it would appear that there is some differential treatment going on. been denied a dozen times by the Minister of Defence. tial treatment in Western Australia. memher for Swan says that there is differential treatment; and we ought to have some explanation of the circumstances. This is not the only instance of differential treatment in connection with the States of Victoria and New South Wales. The last instance of the kind was in the selection of a site for woollen mills at Geelong, another defence matter. The honourable member for Nepean told the Government in regard to that, fore allowing him to leave Melbourne. orable member for Nepean, and the fact remains that the expert was not instructed to go to sites which, to outsiders, seem as good as the Geelong site. I wish to emphasize the complaints that have been made about the treatment of rifle clubs, and the non-provision of drill halls. Having been associated with members of rifle clubs all my life, I recognise that they are a use""the defence of the country. Generally speaking, however, military officers seemto be in antagonism to them. that be? Wales before Federation, and I hope that the Minister will see that, in future, the rifle clubs are properly treated. As to drill halls, I would point out that in theCook electoral division six companies of boys have only a small room for which 1 os. a week is paid, while in the aristocratic suburb of Woollahra three companies have a room for which 30s. a week is paid. The Erskineville room is so small that the officers were not able to find places in it for all the rifles. As to boys drilling in the dark, that seems often to take place, but it should not be allowed, as it is a cause of want of discipline, the training sometimes resolving itself into a farce. gerous. compulsory military training, the drilling should be effective, and should.take place under conditions enabling the officers to control the boys. The sum of ,Â£10,000 is set down for the purchase of a site for a remount depot for artillery horses near Liverpool, but why is not the Federal Territory to be used? In every case the Government seems ready to depart from itsannounced policy that wherever possible the Territory will be used for Commonwealth undertakings. There are beautiful grass paddocks in the Territory, and there is no apparent reason why they should not be used for a remount depot.",20,Unionists

Vessels of the largest draught can enter Port Kembla at any time and load alongside the jetties; ancl if the Government is not going to use this reserved lancl for fortifications, it should be made available for commercial uses, because the place is developing by leaps and bounds, ancl every acre that can be obtained is needed for business purposes. Therefore, we should have a statement on the subject from the Minister at the earliest possible moment. In the Senate, a representative of New South Wales recently moved the adjournment of the House to call attention to the wholesale resignations from what is looked upon as one of the most important arms of our Defence Force, the Australian Garrison Artillery, which the honourable member for South Sydney has brought under notice repeatedly of late. For nearly thirtv years, the Woollongong branch of the Australian Garrison Artillery has consisted of a very fine body of men, whose reputation for handling the guns, and whose records for shooting, make it second to none in the Commonwealth. men. longong. which T attended last Saturday fortnight, and at which the Minister of Defence was unable to be present, it was pointed out that these men are so proficient that they have heafen the permanent men.

Why should men who have attained such proficiency as to be classed as There is to be another depot experts, be disbanded simply for a fad ? patriotic. treatment they are getting. I receive comFive plaints from time to time about the delay in paying rent for halls used for defence purposes. The owner of a hall at Moss Vale could not get his rent from the Commonwealth Government for more than eighteen months. It was only after my return from my visit to the Old Country, when the matter was brought before me, ancl by me before the Minister, that the rent was paid. Recently, I had a letter from the trustees of the Nowra School of Arts, who for eleven months had been unable to obtain rent for the hall, which they have leased to the Defence Department, and they have now given the Department notice to go. These delays are not creditable to the Government. When premises are leased,. rents should be paid promptly. I't is to be remembered that there are persons who are always ready to discredit the Federal movement, and cases such as I have referred to do a great deal to add to the general discontent. The Government ought to be very particular indeed in regard to payments in these matters, and keep themselves free from the possibility of accusations such as I have spoken of. I hope the Government will take, in regard to drill halls and rifle ranges, the action that has been impressed upon them by many honourable members on -both sides of the Committee this morning. to take this opportunity of emphasizing the importance of the rifle club portion of our Citizen Defence Forces. I do not think the A t a banquet at Woolrifle clubs have been fairlv treated by the Defence Department.

I have long thought that there is a certain amount of opposition in that quarter to every form of citizen defence. The rifle club movement may only share that opposition with other branches of the forces, but certainly it seems to suffer very considerably in the treatment meted out to it. The clubs must have the assistance of the permanent side to carry on their work. Rifle ranges must be provided for them, and these necessitate a certain expenditure; but all kinds *>f delays take place in dealing with them. I have been informed that when an application is made for a range, and one or two likely sites are suggested, an officer is sent to inspect them. Then, if it is found that there are difficulties in the way of their acquisition, and the local club or others interested are prepared straight-away to suggest another site, the officer refuses to inspect it, alleging that it is not covered by his instructions. Of course, when his report goes in, the sites first suggested are not considered satisfactory, and then the whole routine has to be gone over again. That may seem an extreme instance of Ted-tapismi, but it indicates a want of sympathy and want of desire to facilitate the work of rifle clubs. I agree with the honourable member for Wakefield that the permanent men should be given to understand that the citizen defence movement has come in Australia to stay, and must be made a prominent feature of our defence system. The sooner they realize that the better for themselves and the better for Australia generally. I should not consent -no r do I think the people as a whole would consent-to the establishment in this country of the military systems of the Old World. The delays in connection with rifle ranges have been the cause of considerable friction and soreness amongst those men who voluntarily give their time to make themselves proficient in the use of the rifle. All kinds of obstacles are put in the way, and considerable delays result. instance, I have here a letter just received from Cowra, an important centre in my electorate. A site was agreed upon there and everything seemed to be satisfactory, but the secretary writes to say that about a mbnth or more ago he received word from the staff officer of works that a lease was prepared, and was being sent out to the Mr Brown. owner of the land for his approval and signature. The secretary interviewed the owner, and the owner stated, more than a month after the secretary had received the notification referred to, that he had not received the papers, and knew nothing about them, so that the delay was not on his part, but on the part of the Department. Thai is only one instance of many where delays have taken place. The Department ought to show greater expedition in dealing with these matters, because no one can deny that the civilians who join the rifle clubs and perfect themselves in handling the rifle are doing an important work in the matter of defence. South African experience showed that men trained to use the rifle are a great acquisition to any defence force, and that ordinary military training is comparatively a secondary matter. These men are gaining proficiency in rifle shooting, and, at the same time, are not deficient in other arts of warfare. Whilst certain concessions are made to the rifle clubs in assisting the provision of sites, targets, rifles and ammunition, nothing is done to provide riflemen with a uniform. The Minister should consider whether some cheap, strong uniform, consisting of a khaki over-all jacket and pants, could be provided. The work on the ranges is very injurious to the men's clothing, and their training entails considerable personal expense upon them in that direction. The over-alls I suggest could be made a suitable distinguishing uniform for them, and I can promise The Minister that if that concession were made it would be greatly appreciated by all members of rifle clubs. Monaro) [n.55] I hope the Minister repiesenting thc Minister of Defence will deal particularly with the question of our rifle clubs, because it seems to me that they are being, to a large extent, Ignored. It has always been claimed that our riflemen are the bulwark of our defence, because they can ride and shoot. That is what we want in this country, but the deAs an lays are simply disastrous. I do not blame the present Minister, because the trouble has been going on for many years. Defence is a very big problem in this country, especially under present conditions. When I look at the expenditure provided on these Estimates, and remember that other large sums are being expended on warships, I wonder where the money is",22,Unionists
95,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"to come from. We shall simply hasten the country into bankruptcy, at the rate we are going on. The great expenditure taking place on warships ought to be carefully considered, because millions of pounds are being expended on vessels tliat will be obsodoing a very difficult work well. We ought lete in ten years. At the same time, we refuse fair consideration and concessions to the men on the land, who will, after all, be the real defence of the country. If we encourage rifle clubs, and help every man to learn to shoot and ride, it will be better than sinking millions ot pounds in warships. I am alarmed at the expenditure on defence. When I look back on what we spent a few years ago, and compare it with what we are spending now, it seems to me that we are defence mad, and I ask myself seriously where the money is to come from. It is all very well to vote these millions, but where are we to find them? Are we going to run up a big national debt, or tax people out of existence? That is what this policy appears to be driving at. While I cavil at this heavy expenditure, I ask the Minister to see thac rifle clubs are given consideration in the matter of ranges. At Cathcart, in my electorate, they have been trying for years to get a rifle range, and tlie men at Eden have to travel 15 miles to practise shooting. That ought not to be necessary. Responsibility for these awful delays ought to be placed at the door of somebody. We cannot expect the Minister to know all the details, but when such cases are brought under his notice he should sheet them home to the responsible officer. I hope he will do so. In the country districts boys have to be drilled out in the mud and wet, where there are no halls or shelter of any kind. consequently, their mothers will not send them again to drill, and the upshot is that these unfortunate people are dragged before a Court and fined, and are at their wit's end to find the money to meet the fine. I would also direct the Minister's attention to the fact that all encampments ought, if possible, to be held in the Fedeauthorities to provide rifle ranges and drill ral Territory, where there is every facility available, including a raihvay. should not hold camps at outside places in order to cater to the parochial influences of the fact that it is of such long standing different States, but should have them in the Federal Territory. Unfortunately there is a growing disposition on the part of officials to ignore the Capital, when a site for a mill, or anything else, is wanted. Why should we spend Â£10,000 on a remount depot at Liverpool when we have, in the Federal Territory, all the fine country that the Minister of Home Affairs has resumed and has not yet paid tor? 1 do not blame the Minister of Defence, who is to lay down in this country the principle that we want citizen soldiers, and that we shall not allow certain gentlemen to place every obstacle in their way. It is a bad principle to allow them to have control in defence matters. Our men showed in South Africa, as the honourable member for North Sydney oan testify, that they were made of the right stuff. They made good there, and our riflemen ought to have every consideration from the present Government. I am strongly in favour of giving them some sort of a uniform, but I am afraid that that would involve a rather heavy outlay. There should be some recognition of long service. In the militia and the permanent forces, men areentitled to long-service medals; and I think that men who have served for years in therifle clubs of the Commonwealth should' receive the same recognition. Members of* rifle clubs, although they receive no pay,, are prepared, at great inconvenience to themselves in many cases, to train themselves for the defence of their country; and even if they are not provided with uniforms, they ought certainly to have a distinctive badge or medal of some kind. I am prepared to vote against all unnecessary expenditure, and I cannot help feeling that we have gone ""defence mad."" Where are we to obtain the millions of money that are to be expended on Defence matters? The Minister says that he is going to get the money out of the Federal They catch cold, and, Capital. No doubt he is already making a great profit out of the people of the Federal Territory, but he cannot always expect them to be finding money for these services. I make no complaint against him; I bring these matters under his notice for the reason that, wherever I go, I hear dissatisfaction expressed at the failure of the halls. The complaint is by no means new. We It prevailed even when the Government of which I was a member was in office; and should spur on the Minister to take immediate action. Then, again, it seems to me that when encampment areas are required, and depots are being selected for remount purposes, regard should be paid to the land that is available in our own Federal Territory. I have heard some honourable members say that the Liverpool manoeuvre area is necessary because it adjoins a big centre of population. The curse of this country is that there seems to be a general belief chat practically everything must be established either in or close to our big cities. The big cities have plenty of influence, and can ""pull the strings."" in the Federal Territory. so, and it should be an inducement to our and I am inclined to think that a good deal temperance friends to support the holding of the antipathy of the permanent military of appeal to the Minister to look into their members do not wear a uniform.

The question of unithe city of Melbourne have now to go to form is an important one. I know of many Williamstown for rifle practice. Under riflemen who would be prepared to undergo present conditions some men have to travel some drill if they were provided with unia distance of from 10 to 15 miles in order forms, and I am sure that the militia would to practise on Saturday afternoons. be only too happy to -assist them to secure Efforts should be made to establish rifle drill instruction.

That has been our experience from the inception of Federation.

101,Mr Ryrie,"They cheered the men in the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, I know that riflemen in some instances ride from 15 to 20 miles in order to secure rifle practice, and whilst dealing with the question of uniforms, I should like to say that unless a rug is placed on the mounds there is nothing that will wear out a man's clothes more quickly than will rifle practice. These mounds in country districts are not covered with a green sward, but are rough and gravelly, so that a man who is constantly lying down on them must quickly wear out his clothes. Riflemen should be provided with a uniform, or at least with a sort of overall as suggested by the honourable member who introduced this question. The provision of uniforms for riflemen would involve a great deal of expense, but the effect would be most encouraging. I come now to the provision of drill halls for cadets, which involves not only the success or otherwise of the scheme, but also, perhaps, the health of the rising generation. The cadets are often forced, or, at any rate, they have been forced, to drill in pouring rain, though, I understand, that some instruction has been issued that the area officers are to use their discretion. The bovs may have to travel five miles or more from their homes; and we all know that it is most injurious for a growing lad to remain for hours in wet clothes. No matter what the cost, some arrangements should be made for covered drill areas. Drilling at night is objectionable on many grounds, and absolutely ridiculous unless ample lighting is provided. The question of drill halls is, of course, a big one, involving an enormous expenditure, if a place has to be provided wherever there is a company to be drilled. As already pointed out, people in various localities have given evidence of their willingness to contribute; and if the Government make it clear that they are prepared to do their share, the public will not be lacking in patriotism. There are many other causes which may contribute to the breakdown of the system -cause s which I am not allowed to mention now-bu t one great cause is that the lads may be compelled to drill in the rain. [12.19] -There is every reason for the Government to turn their attention to the rifle clubs, the members of which, in their own time and at their own expense, are perfecting themselves in the use of the rifle, so that they may be ready should their services be required in the defence of the country. So far as I have been able to discover from the Estimates, no proper recognition is given of the public service thus rendered; and the claims urged on behalf of the clubs deserve the serious consideration of any Government which may be in power. Indeed, so tar as can be seen, the rifle clubs have received practically no recognition at a l l ; in many instances disabilities have actuaily been placed in the way of these volunteer riflemen obtaining access to ranges for practice. are treated as the "" ugly duckling "" of the service. clubs seem to be regarded as a sort of excrescence on our military system; and that is a most unfortunate view to take of this most useful body of men. The members of these clubs ought not to be made to feel that they are of no consequence, but should be encouraged _ by some suDstantial financial assistance in a number ot useful ways, and not compelled to fall back entirely on their own financial resources. to them in time of trouble. tainly; and no more capable bodv of men at such a time could be found than those patriotic citizens who give up leisure which might otherwise be devoted to sports and amusements. The clubs are tormed, and the members go about their work in a most unostentatious manner, perfecting themselves in a very necessary branch of defence, and forming a very valuable auxiliary in time of need. Very inadequate provision is made in the Estimates for drill halls. I find that, in New South Wales, Newcastle and Singleton are selected as places where drill halls are to be provided; but there are larger centres ot population in which halls are urgently needed. A short time ago, I had occasion to bring under the notice of honourable members a letter from the municipal body of Marrickville, where I reside, in which complaint was made of the manner i which the drills n are conducted; and it was pointed out how the health of the boys might be injured by being called upon to undergo the drills in all sorts of weather. We cannot wonder that a great number of parents are very chary about allowing their boys to drill under such conditions. I feel satisfied that, if proper halls were provided, with adequate lighting and supervision, a great deal of the present trouble, caused by absence from drill, would be avoided/ I notice",25,Unionists

There has been some talk of negotiations for a site for the Victoria Barracks, in some other part of Sydney; and, if a change be contemplatecf at an early date, or a comparatively early date, the proposed expenditure is not, in my opinion, justified. The Honorary Minister may, perhaps, be able to give us some information on the subject. dorse the complaints about the inadequate consideration extended to the rifle clubs, which I know, from personal experience, are a valuable adjunct of our defence system. The members of these clubs contribute out of their own pockets towards the expense of making themselves efficient in case they should be called upon to defend the country. As to the cadets, many of whom have to travel great distances, they ought not to be called upon to drill out in the rain; and any offers made by municipal or other bodjes to contribute towards the cost of drill halls ought to be accepted. As the representative of a country district, I know that many of the trainees have to travel far; and I think there ought to be some change made in the direction of providing free railway travelling for them. When I was a volunteer in the State service, the members of the Forces were always passed free on the railways; and I think that that policy ought to be continued. The States and tlie Commonwealth are one from a defence point of view; and I see no reason why the State Government should refuse to continue a practice which they followed in the past. I quite agree with the complaints made by the honourable member for Nepean about the Government not contributing towards the maintenance of certain roads. In the past, the Commonwealth Government have granted a sum for this purpose at Queenscliff, which is the centre of very active military operations; but the practice has been discontinued by several Governments. Stationed at Queenscliff ar the Royal Australian Engineers and the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery; and very heavy material is carted over the roads. Queenscliff, itself, has no heavy traffic, and Forces, that he has to neglect it. The all to be found there is caused by the presence of the military. The local municipality would, I believe, be quite satisfied with a contribution of something like Â£ 4 0 a year; and I think the matter might receive the consideration of the Government. was stated in the newspapers some weeks ago that the Minister of Defence intended to make an adequate provision of drillhalls throughout the Commonwealth; but the amounts set down in this. schedule are very small; and, apparently, unless it is proposed to ask for further sums on the Supplementary Estimates, the matter will have to be left over for another year. I should like some information from the Honorary Minister on the subject. I have already expressed my opinion about the treatment given by the Government to rifle clubs; and, even at the risk of tedious repetition, I shall declare my grievances again, and move a reduction of the vote by jQi to express disapproval of the Government neglect of the clubs. Every part of Australia is interested in this matter, and every section of the community.

If the provision for rifle clubs were greatly increased, it would immensely improve the efficiency of our second line of land defence; but, either the Minister is out of sympathy with the rifle e club movement, or he is so much occupied with matters concerning the Permanent rifle clubs have been neglected since the inauguration of Federation; and this neglect is the more reprehensible now, because",26,Unionists

The whole Business must be undertaken in a uniform and systematic manner, in order to insure efliciency and economic expenditure of the money voted by Parliament. as an evidence of the Minister's estimate of the value of rifle clubs? Minister, individually, would be prepared to spend two or three million pounds more on defence in general. I do not know, nor can it be said of any particular member that, because he votes for an item allocating a certain sum, it necessarily discloses his opinion as to the total amount that ought to be spent in that direction. We have to cut our coat according to our cloth, and the allocations are made largely as the result of expert advice in the endeavour to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. I wish to say right away that the Minister of Defence is distinctly sympathetic towards rifle clubs, and anxious to foster them to the best of his ability. He recognises to the full their undoubted value, and the value of effective riflemen, ancl it has been, and will continue to be, his effort to see that they are properly treated, and that all the facilities possible in the circumstances are attorded to them. I should like to add to the opinion of the Minister my own recognition of the value of the rifle clubs, and to say that, as far as I personally know, there is no jealousy of or objection to them on the part of the permanent officers. I know of no unsympathetic administration regarding them. There is practically a sub-department for rifle clubs, ancl Major Boam is at present at the head of it. He has direct audience with the Minister, and all matters relating to rifle clubs go through him. It should be possible for him, through the Secretary, to bring these questions directly before the Minister without being, hampered by what is ordinarily called red-tape or having to make his representations through different officers of the permanent force. friction developed between the rifle club generous in their treatment of the Governauthorities and Major Boam? that in the reports coming from the different States there may be differences of opinion between Major Boam and the officers reporting to him, but I know of no special instance to indicate that any permanent officer, holding a reasonably high post, is unsympathetic towards the rifle clubs, Minister explain the reduction of the vote? permanent officer in the Defence Force allowed his personal antipathies or jealousies, or even opinions, to influence his official work in relation to rifle clubs, I should, to tbe best of my power and influence, have him dismissed. If any instance of it is given, I have not the shadow of a doubt that the Minister will at once investigate the matter, and that the offender will be duly dealt with. it is fair to tell the Committee the reason for the reduction of this vote? ing interjections and legitimate questions. ber is not fair in saying that I am ignoring interjections. Will the honourable member draw my attention to the item .where there is a reduction so far as rifle clubs are concerned ? the Estimates. The vote this year is Â£17,820, as against Â£^22,900 last year. ask me for a detailed explanation of an item which is not yet under consideration. I shall be prepared to give details when the Committee reaches that item, or I hope to be. I assure honourable members opposite that the Minister is in full sympathy with rifle clubs, and desires to foster them in every possible way. The honourable member for Parramatta touched on the ouestion of rifle ranges. The Minister is anxious that the number of ranges shall be increased, and increases are being made wherever possible, limited only by the amount of money available and cogditional on the presence of expert workmen. Still, considerable delays occur. For instance, persons write down, saying they want a rifle rangeat a particular place, and a recommendation is made to that effect.

129,Mr Roberts,"It .is scarcely fair to the Government want a piece of land they put the price up by anything from 50 to 200 per cent., and immediately make heavy demands upon the Department, resulting in legal expenses, or continual delays before a satisfactory arrangement can be arrived at. Some of the old ranges are becoming obsolete, because the new weapons carry further, and the danger zone is materially increased. While the Minister is anxious to increase the number of ranges, and honourable members very properly bring these requests before him, I am confident that if he were to hurry things, and an accident, causing permanent injury, or death, to some one resulted, the outcry would' be considerably greater than it can possibly be at present. Difficulty sometimes arises in fixing up the necessary leases, even with State Governments, whose assistance is not always perhaps quite so readily given as the Minister may desire. Attention was called to the question of drill halls, in the first instance, by the honourable member for Richmond, who only quoted two small items relating to them. I pointed out to him at the time that he had neglected to look at other items totalling Â£ 4 , 3 0 0 . Honourable members will find at page 227 that Â£ 8 0 , 0 0 0 is set down for expenditure during the current year for the acquisition of sites for, and the erection of, mobilization and store buildings and drill halls. Recognising the difficulties under which our cadets in particular are placed, the Minister is anxious that drill halls shall be provided in every possible direction to meet the requirements of the forces, and he and the Department, generally, will welcome the assistance of all local bodies in facilitating their acquisition or erection for the purpose of drilling our cadets, and thereby removing some of the difficulties under which, much to the regret of the Minister, and of all connected with the Department, the lads at present labour. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro referred to the holding of military camps in the Federal Territory. I am not sure what his exact desire is, but would point out to him that it is practically impossible to hold all the camps there. It would be quite out of the question to ask troops from South Australia, or Western Australia, to go there for their annual camp. Their whole time would be spent in the train. member meant it to apply only to New South Wales. of New South Wales where the necessary expenditure and delay in train travelling would quite remove the possibility of the troops holding effective camps at the Federal CapitalI have no doubt that the Department will provide that camps shall be held within the Federal area wherever it is reasonably possible. We have been asked why a site for artillery horses was being bought at Liverpool. A portion of that site, known as Cunningham's farm, is within the Liverpool manoeuvre area, and some part of the farm is outside of it ; but the special reason for acquiring it is that the Department have purchased a large number of very valuable horses for artillery purposes. It is impossible to train artillery properly with hired horses, as was attempted for a number of years. The horses we have acquired must be taken care of, and paddocked where they can be effectively used in whole-day drills, near the large centres of population, where the field artillery require them. That is the only reason why these areas have been purchased. in the world on which you ought to have put horses. the advice of artillery experts. We cannot put unbroken horses into the artillery. They have to be trained. With regard to the barracks in Sydney, all that is Before the Department at present is that New South Wales members, and other persons, have asked for the removal of the Victoria Barracks from Paddington; and the Department have replied that, if a site equal to the old one is given, and the Department are placed in a precisely similar position so far as buildings generally are concerned, the Minister will consider the proposal favourably. Some piece of property has been inspected; but, outside of that, nothing has been done. Silting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. [ 5]--Before we adjourned for lunch the Z I Minister representing the Minister of Defence made a statement regarding the works policy of his Department, as to which generally no exception can be taken.

Their objection to that expendisideration is that the Government are spendture is based on the ground that the money ing public funds as economically and as usefully as possible, and that because urgent urgently needed for defence purposes. matters relating to the defence organization as a whole have had to be attended to more money is not available for the purposes indicated by us.

He asserted that we had given no particulars, and practically challenged us to do so. Now that I desire to make some reply to him, however, I am told that I shall not be in order in doing so. I think that I am entitled, by way of illustration, to refer to other proposed votes in these Estimates, but I shall make the general statement, without reference to any particular item, that the Government could have found plenty of money to provide for rifle clubs ranges and drill halls if they had not spent as much as they have done on Socialistic enterprises. Instead of attending, first of all, to the most urgent matters, they are leaving them until the last. Instead of attending to important, imperative, and urgent matters-and nothing could be more urgent than facilities for efliciency in connection with defence they are dabbling in Socialistic concerns. It seems to be their rule in connection with every Department to look, not to what is necessary to minister to the efficiency of that Department, but to that which will serve as propaganda work.

[2.25] -We have listened to some violent outbursts of parochial anger on the part of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, and other Victorian representatives, as well as by some municipal bodies outside, regarding the expenditure on the Federal proposed to be laid out in that way is ground, too. also a very good ground for objecting to some of the items in the division now before us, which provides for a heavy expenditure in Victoria, but to which neither",30,Unionists

147,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"It is the honourable member for Laanecoorie, nor the honourable member for Maribyrnong, have called attention. There are, in this division, items providing for an expenditure of upwards of ,Â£200,000, in and around Melbourne, although the money proposed to be spent in that way might very well be devoted to defence purposes. We have not heard a word of protest, however, on the part of either the Victorian municipal bodies or the representatives of this State, who have been so loud in their complaints concerning a small item of expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital. If it is fair to attack Federal expenditure of a necessary character when it applies to New South Wales it is equally fair for representatives of that State to raise something in the nature of a protest against a like expenditure in Victoria. Let us give our Victorian friends a little dose of their own medicine. have always been too generous. Wales has "" run the show."" representatives of New South Wales have never raised these petty parochial considerations They are always originated by a few Victorians, who, so far as their political views are concerned, are under the domination of certain local newspapers. Of course, they do not like to be reminded of these things. I wish to see whether the grounds of the objections raised against expenditure in New South Wales have any real merit; because if they hold good in regard to New South Wales they hold good with a hundredfold force in regard to Victoria. Â£3,500 for the saddlery and harness factory near Melbourne. Last year we voted Â£4,700, and the expenditure exceeded that by Â£ 4 5 . When the question of the Naval College was before us we heard a great outoy about the "" broad national view,"" and it was strongly urged by Victorian members that such institutions, together with the Commonwealth factories, should be in Federal Territory. ask the Victorian representatives to honour their own declarations of principle and insist that this vote for the harness and saddlery factory shall b"" struck out, so far as it applies to Vic'.yia, and placed in the New South Wales estimate for expenditure in Federal Territory. If those gentlemen are not prepared to redeem their declarations I hope we shall have heard the last of this cry of theirs about the Â» "" broad national outlook."" Then, again, it is proposed to expend ,Â£7,000 on a clothing factory in Melbourne. For this factory we voted .Â£6,500 last year, and expended ,Â£7,8.2 1. I intend to move at the proper time that the item of Â£3,500 for a harness and saddlery factory be struck out. [2.34] -The complaint of the Minister of Home Affairs to-day is that the Government have not enough money to carry on the works as they would like, with the requisite efficiency so far as managing and organization go. We have been told today that some votes of the Department are dwindling while others are increasing; and the Minister, of course, gets back to general policy, and, referring to criticism which has been directed from this side, challenges us to show in detail where there has been extravagant expenditure. I presume that the inference to be drawn is that, New South if we can point specifically to extravagance, the money so saved will be applied to the more useful purposes of the Department. AllI have to say is that the answer to the Minister is in the Estimates. I know, of course, that harness and saddlery are very necessary for defence purposes; but is it, at this stage, more important to establish such a factory, or a. clothing factory, than it is to fully equip our rifle ranges and drill halls, and look after our rifle clubs decently? still to obtain supplies of clothing from contractors all over Australia. We are asked to vote The Government are only toying with the question; it is only a little thing to be dangled from the platforms of the country.. member suggest that the members of the Defence Force should go without clothes? the men well clothed, and in garments which fit better than many of those supplied to-day. However, I make no comI now plaint on that score, knowing, as I do, the difficulties of the Department.

156,Mr Joseph Cook,"I desire to seeoperation; though, judging from what the Minister has said to-day, one would think that nothing had been done until this Heaven-sent Ministry came into power. The establishment of these Socialistic enterprises might very well be left over for a few years until more important and urgent matters had been attended to. I repeat that the Government are starving the rifle clubs to-day in order to find money for Socialistic enterprises. Socialistic of all is the Federal Capital. Socialistic enterprise? member does not call the clothing factory a Socialistic enterprise? honourable members opposite so describe it, but perhaps they are "" fooling "" the people outside. The fact is, the Government are neither doing this work nor letting it alone; a little bit of a factory is supplying a small portion of the clothing, while the rest is provided by contractors. The Government ought to put the first things first, if they must make a choice in the expenditure. I know that we cannot have everything at once; but it is time to protest when we find important branches of the Defence Forces pinched and starved. It is politics getting into the Defence administration ; and not merely in connection with this vote, but many others, as I should like to point out if time permitted. Already there is trouble in connection with the building of the vessels; and the Government are tinkering with Socialism in the Department, while defence equipment is retarded. If ever there was urgency, it is just now in connection with the organization on both the military and the naval side. Many things are being done in regard .to which I have no criticism to offer. dulged in carping criticism of the Department, so long as the Government give fair, all-round attention to the requirements of the service. I do not even say whether it is good or bad policy that the clothing of the soldiers should be provided by the Department, or whether the saddlery and harness should be so provided; my point is a point of time, and I contend that we ought not to push these Socialistic enterprises ahead while we starve the rifle clubs, and neglect to provide ranges and drill halls. agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that we ought to do our best in the interests of tlie rifle clubs; but I cannot accept his views as to the clothing factory, and tht harness and saddlery factory. The honourable member does not discuss whether these particular projects are good or bad in themselves; but I contend that, in order to criticise any proposal, we must havs regard to whether it is sound or otherwise in the interests of the Commonwealth. If we leave such questions for the future, because of certain expenditure that is necessary in other directions, it may prove, to be false economy. The question we have to decide is whether we should make arrangements for providing our forces with everything they require, or depend on outside sources. In my opinion, it is better to provide everything ourselves. In that way we shall best be able to meet emergencies. Further, the establishment of these factories will result in a saving to the Commonwealth. The objection to them is, not so much that they are unnecessary, but that they are Socialistic undertakings. If it were proposed to remain dependent on private enterprise for the supply of uniforms, equipment, and the like, nothing would be said. Ever since I have been in this House, it has seemed a sufficient reason to some honourable members to condemn a proposal to say that the work provided for was to be carried out in some State other than that in which their electoral division was situated. It is time that this parochial feeling was put aside. What we must consider is whether expenditure is necessary, and whether concrete proposals are the best that can be put before us. If the House had to decide exactly where the various Commonwealth works vvere to be situated, a fine mess would be maJe. We must depend largely on the opinions of experts in these matters. They are not I have never inlikely to be influenced by provincial considerations, and their recommendations are likely to have in view the welfare of Australia as a whole. It is time that the House, instead of being influenced by parochial considerations, had regard to the interest of the whole Commonwealth. It cannot be charged against me that I have ever raised the cry of State interests. I have always taken the view that our business is to decide what is best for the Commonwealth, and if that view were taken more generally we should get on faster.

If the Harness Factory must be established anywhere, Victoria is the best place in which it can be put; but, so far, no reasons have been furnished to the Committee for establishing the factory at a l l ; nor has the Honorary Minister told us why the articles required by our forces should not be obtained from the various private factories in existence. I intend to support the amendment on those grounds, and not because I think the factory should be placed in Federal Territory in preference to Clifton Hill. am sorry to disagree with the honourable member for Lang, but it would not be common sense to put a factory in the wilder, ness of the Yass-Canberra site, where there is no labour to be secured. I understand that the factory is now in working order, so that the question of establishing it is no longer before us. I quite agree with the honoraible member for Wimmera that the work ought to be given to existing factories in the different States, because I have all denever believed in the Government doing this class of work.

When it was first proposed that the Commonwealth should undertake work of this character objection might have been taken, but the honourable member's objection cannot seriously be taken into consideration now that so much money has already been expended on the venture.

The Minister, however, has promised to make an inquiry, and I do not think we can press the matter any further.

D i d time permit, I should feel strongly tempted to move the omission of each of these items, in order that honourable members who have declared for the "" broad national outlook "" shall not stultify themselves. shall not comment on the merits of the proposals just referred to, but I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to impose absolute preference to unionists as a condition in the carrying out of the whole of these works.

317,Sir Robert Best,"A t fhe outsetof contract. The Northern Territory contract, which has been quoted, provided specifically that absolute preference was to be given to unionists; there was nothing said about other things being equal. The specification represents, in writing, the policy of the Minister, whatever he may choose to avow now. We have been told that in all things the Labour party desire to be logical; but I should like them, before being logical, to be at least constitutional. They knew very well when this proposal of preference was first introduced in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill of 1910 that there was no constitutional power to enforce it ; and it was only owing to the determined opposition of this side that they abandoned an idea which had for its object the enforcement of the principle so far as private employment is concerned. realized that the proposal was unconstitutional, and for that reason they abandoned it ; but now they seek to bring about the same unconstitutional proceeding in another way. Some time ago it was decided by the Government that preference should be given to unionists in temporary employment in the Departments; and we have now a deliberate proposal of a far-reaching character. The object is to bring into existence a nefarious system which could not be realized by constitutional means. They are in conflict with the terms and spirit of the Constitution; and we have a right to protest against this iniquitous and infamous proposal to discriminate between the taxpayers of the community, and to reward persons for political reasons only. 1 do not see why there should be so much heat in the discussion of this question. To my mind, the matter was settled last year when the Leader of the Opposition put a number of questions to the Prime Minister. According to Hansard of 20th September, 1911, page 634, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime MinisterWhether he will define the classes of Governthat he will not answer a question. ment employees within which members of unions will henceforward be given priority of appointment over all who are not unionists? The reply by the Prime Minister wasOther qualifications being equal,, preference been in office, he would have sent troops will be given in all cases. I take it that a declaration by the head of the Government is to be regarded as representing the policy, of the Government; and 1 hope and . trust that, throughout the [74]2 Commonwealth, nothing will be given forth* as the policy of the Government in this connexion, except the reply given by the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition. There are honourable memhers gasconading about the country and misinterpreting the official declaration made by the Prime Minister. Of the policy as set forth in that declaration, every honorable member on this side is in favour. [4.22] -Are the gentlemen referred to by the honourable member for Maribyrnong not entitled to go about the country when they, find the kind of language which is set forth in the terms of contracts? I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether there is a new kind of preference that the Government have decided to grant in connection with public contracts, and whether The Labour party the language in the terms of the contracts represents the policy of the Government. guage.

331,Mr Joseph Cook,"I s that relethat absolute preference shall be given without any further stipulation. vernment is preference to unionists, other things being equal. that the language which has been referred to will be taken out of the terms of contract at the earliest possible moment since it misrepresents the Government policy. [4.25] I must say that I was amazed when I saw the terms of contract, and the departure from the policy as laid down by the Prime Minister. That policy was accepted all round the House. The word ""absolute"" was used more than once when this question was previously discussed, and we were told that it had no right to be included, and was never intended to be included in the policy. Honourable members on this side are entitled to complain about the misrepresentation to which they have been subjected. It has heen said more than once to-day that members of the Opposition are in favour of preference to non-unionists. That is not so. I do not think that there is a single honourable member on this side of the House who is in favour of that. But I wish that honourable members opposite were as fair as we are in contending that there should be no preference or discrimination to any one. Packer, the leader,of the Free Labourers' Union, is also a member of the Liberal party, and is getting money from it? members of the Labour party whom I think the Minister of Trade and Customs would not care to sleep with. I do not blame him for that. I do not hold him responsible for every member of his party, and I trust that in the name of decency he will not hold me responsible for every member of the Liberal party. I wish to protest against this misrepresentation, which is unfair, unjust, and certainly not correct. The honourable member for South Sydney frankly admitted that he is here as a representative of one section of the community. I do not know for how many members of his party he spoke, but I take a much higher stand than that. I regard myself as a representative of the people of Australia. Protectionists ? think I represent the Free Traders as well as the Protectionists, inasmuch as I assist in securing for this country a policy Gomuch better than the Free Traders could themselves provide. The honourable mem-' ber for South Sydney has frankly avowed that he stands as a representative of a section. elected by the workers. the honourable member to say that he was sent here by the unionists, who were the best part of the workers. I accept the explanation given by the honourable member, but I am afraid he will have to correct one word in his Hansard proof to bring his speech into conformity with what he has just said. Complaints are continually made in this House against the misrepresentation to which members of Parliament are subjected. Nothing is more likely to degrade or belittle Parliament in the eyes of the people than this avowed desire on the part of honourable members to regard themselves, and to be regarded, simply as representatives of a class or section. I do not know why the Minister of Home Affairs took scissors and paste to put into a contract the condition to which reference has been made. It was evidently put in some time after the major portion of the document was prepared. Any one who has extion does not form part of the original document. It is typed in different ink, and is upon different paper. It has been snipped out of another piece of paper,_ and stuck upon this document. I hope that it will be snipped out again. If it is necessary to put in a provision of the character indicated by the Prime Minister, I trust that it will be framed in the words used by himself. In the State of Victoria we have a very wise provision with regard to all Government contracts. We say nothing about preference to unionists, but it is specified that there shall be recognised rates of wages paid, and that certai:i conditions shall be observed. 1 agree with that. By adopting that system-, we get rid of this invidious discrimination which the Government are endeavouring to steal in. It could not be I done, and probably would not be done on a contract of considerable proportions. I",44,Robert Best Th E Honourable Winners The G Overnment Are Trustees

Had it been a large matter, it would have come under the observation of a more considerable number of people. Had that been the case, this condition would not have been inserted. Minister of Home Affairs is very cute and clever. We all know his methods. We can quite imagine how when he was clipping out this condition, and sticking it into tween unions when making appointments? the contract, he said, "" Ah, this will please the boys! Probably no one will notice it, but it will always remain as a record of my intention to carry out my own policy in my own way I "" member think that "" This Will Please the or subject to appeal? Boys,"" would be a good title for a new greater play? that a play would be a success under such a title. We are entitled to ascertain from the Prime Minister what his view is; because, after all, we may regard him as the head of the Government. We know that an alteration has heen made by the party opposite in regard to the method of forming Governments. Probably that method is a step towards elective Ministries, under which system each Minister will be separately responsible to Parliament. But under the constitutional system that exists, .at present, we look' to the Prime Minister to see that the Ministers at the head of the various Departments shall pav due regard to his own published and expressed opinions regarding policy. The Prime Minister is the mouthpiece of the Government. If a Minister apparently deliberately has transgressed against the lines of policy laid down by the Prime Minister, we are entitled to receive from the right honourable gentleman himself a proper notification and assurance that any unfair, improper, and unjust discrimination, which undoubtedly exists in the case of this particular contract, should be withdrawn from it. ister pf Home Affairs) [4.32] I have listened carefully to what honourable members have said. There is no doubt that we have bad a display of rage from them. I do nof know why they should get into such a bad temper. I want to remind honourable members of the questions that the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister on this subject of preference to unionists in 1911. They were as followWhether1. He will define the classes of Government employees within which members of unions will henceforward' be' given priority of appointment over all who are not unionists? But the 2. Qualifications, such as ability, experience, or physique will be considered, and, if so, to what extent, in the appointments made? 3. The, Ministry proposes to distinguish be4.

The determination mentioned will be final, 7. Non-unionists appointed on the ground of personal Qualifications or capacity will be liable to be subsequently displaced in favor of unionists applying for appointment?

No alteration in the present method will be made in these respects. I am absolutely carrying out that system. When I first gave preference to unionists, other things being equal, my instructions were not complied with. ThenI issued the order that there was to be absolute preference to unionists, which meant that tbe first order must be carried out. Absolute preference to unionists means exactly what it says-othe r things being equal.
